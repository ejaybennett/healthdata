(fifthQuint)A Phase I Pharmacokinetic and Tolerance Study of 28-Day Regimens of Oral Ganciclovir.

 CMV retinitis is an important sight-threatening opportunistic infection which affects about 10 to 15 percent of people with AIDS.

 A previous study has shown that treatment with ganciclovir resulted in a significant delay in time to first retinitis progression compared to untreated controls.

 More studies are warranted to evaluate effects at different doses.

 In group A, 36 HIV seropositive patients with CMV viruria receive a single dose of intravenous ganciclovir followed by one of three oral dose regimens for 28 days.

 Twelve individuals are treated at each dose level.

 In group B, 12 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis receive oral ganciclovir therapy.

 These 12 patients must have received an induction course of intravenous ganciclovir for 4 weeks prior to study entry and must have stable CMV retinitis.

 Measurements for both groups include pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerance (history, physical examination, hematology, and serum chemistry), and CMV blood and urine cultures.

 In addition, there are weekly ophthalmologic evaluations for individuals in the group B study.

 A Phase I Pharmacokinetic and Tolerance Study of 28-Day Regimens of Oral Ganciclovir@highlight

To determine the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of three dose treatment plans of oral ganciclovir during a 28-day dosing period.

 Other purposes of the study are to determine in a population of HIV seropositive persons with cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, the safety, tolerance, and patient acceptability of oral ganciclovir given for 28 days, to collect preliminary laboratory evidence for antiviral activity and effectiveness of three dose regimens of oral ganciclovir based on blood and urine cultures of CMV, and to relate antiviral activity to dosage and to serum ganciclovir levels.
