(secondQuint)Perillyl Alcohol in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the clinical effectiveness (i.

e.

, objective tumor response, time to treatment failure, and survival) of perillyl alcohol in patients with previously treated metastatic breast cancer.

 II.

 Define the acute and chronic toxic effects of perillyl alcohol in this patient population.

 OUTLINE: Patients are given oral perillyl alcohol 4 times per day.

 Dose escalation of perillyl alcohol may occur in individual patients if no unacceptable toxicity is observed.

 Treatment is continued as long as the patient benefits from treatment, does not show progressive disease, and does not experience irreversible or life threatening toxicity.

 Patients are evaluated for response monthly while receiving treatment on this study.

 Patients are followed at 2-4 weeks after the last treatment.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued over 2 years.
