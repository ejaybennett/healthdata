(thirdQuint)Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 Stage IV non-small cell lung cancers receive Antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 capsules orally six to seven times a day.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 OBJECTIVES: - To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease).

 - To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

 - To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are performed every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years thereafter.

 Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

Current therapies for Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer provide very limited benefit to the patient.

 The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of Stage IV lung cancer PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Stage IV lung cancer.
