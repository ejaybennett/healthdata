(secondQuint)Interferon Alfa-2b in Treating Patients With Advanced Low-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the response in patients with minimally treated or previously untreated advanced low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with pegylated interferon alfa-2b.

 II.

 Determine the effects of this treatment regimen on the immune system by measuring T-cell subsets and NK cells in this patient population.

 III.

 Determine event-free and progression-free survival in this patient population treated with this regimen.

 IV.

 Evaluate the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive pegylated interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once weekly for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Upon completion of treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for at least 2 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be initially accrued for this study.

 Additional patients will be accrued if acceptable responses are seen in the first cohort.

 Interferon Alfa-2b in Treating Patients With Advanced Low-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@highlight

RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of the cancer cells and slow the growth of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interferon alfa-2b in treating patients who have advanced low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
