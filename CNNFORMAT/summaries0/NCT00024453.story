(thirdQuint)Teicoplanin in Treating Septicemia in Patients Who Are Receiving Chemotherapy Through a Central Venous Catheter.

 OBJECTIVES: - Compare the response and cure rate of coagulase-negative staphylococcal septicemia in patients receiving chemotherapy through a central venous catheter treated with 2 different schedules of teicoplanin.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to participating center and number of central venous catheter lumens (1 vs 2).

 Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive teicoplanin IV bolus every 12 hours for 3 doses and then once daily for 5 doses (total of 7 days).

 - Arm II: Patients receive teicoplanin IV over 2 hours and/or by antibiotic lock every 12 hours for 3 doses and then once daily for 5 doses (total of 7 days).

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 490-1,360 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.

2-6.

2 years.

 Teicoplanin in Treating Septicemia in Patients Who Are Receiving Chemotherapy Through a Central Venous Catheter@highlight

RATIONALE: Giving the antibiotic teicoplanin by infusion and allowing bacteria to be exposed to the antibiotic for a longer period of time may be effective in preventing or controlling septicemia.

 PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to compare two different methods of giving teicoplanin in treating septicemia in patients who are receiving chemotherapy through a central venous catheter.
