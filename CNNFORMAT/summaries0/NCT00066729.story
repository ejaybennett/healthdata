(secondQuint)Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety of NY-ESO-1b peptide vaccine and Montanide ISA-51 in patients with ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer expressing NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1.

 - Determine the immunologic profile (NY-ESO-1 antibody, CD8+ cells, and delayed-type hypersensitivity) induced by this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

 Patients receive NY-ESO-1b peptide vaccine emulsified with Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously once every 3 weeks on weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed at 3 weeks and then every 6-12 weeks for 2 years or until disease progression.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial to studying the side effects of vaccine therapy in treating patients with ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.
