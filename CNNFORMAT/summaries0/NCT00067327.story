(secondQuint)Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis Using Over the Counter Inosine.

 Uric acid is a natural inhibitor of certain chemistries associated with peroxynitrite, a product of inflammation.

 In animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS), these chemical reactions have been associated with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and CNS tissue damage.

 In addition, MS patients have serum uric acid levels that are lower than age- and sex- matched healthy individuals.

 The primary purpose of this study to determine whether raising low serum uric acid levels by daily oral administration of its precursor inosine has an effect on the cumulative number of newly active lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of inosine in patients diagnosed with relapsing remitting and secondary progressive MS.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether raising low levels of the natural antioxidant uric acid by the administration of a precursor, inosine, has any therapeutic effect on the progression of Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) and secondary progressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS).
