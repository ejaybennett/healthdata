(fifthQuint)J-Pouch Coloanal Anastomosis Compared With Side-to-End Coloanal Anastomosis After Radiation Therapy and Surgery to Remove the Rectum in Treating Patients With Rectal Adenocarcinoma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare functional outcome in patients with mid- or distal rectal adenocarcinoma when treated with J-pouch coloanal anastomosis vs side-to-end coloanal anastomosis after preoperative radiotherapy and total mesorectal excision.

 Secondary - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these procedures.

 - Compare anorectal function in patients treated with these procedures.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to participating center and gender.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients undergo total mesorectal excision followed by a J-pouch coloanal anastomosis.

 - Arm II: Patients undergo total mesorectal excision followed by a side-to-end coloanal anastomosis.

 In both arms, patients receive a temporary ileostomy.

 The ileostomy is closed after 1 week provided recovery is uneventful and no radiological signs of anastomotic leakage are detected.

 If early closure is not possible, the ileostomy is closed after 6-8 weeks.

 Functional outcome, quality of life, and anorectal function are assessed before surgery and at 4 and 12 months after surgery.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.

 J-Pouch Coloanal Anastomosis Compared With Side-to-End Coloanal Anastomosis After Radiation Therapy and Surgery to Remove the Rectum in Treating Patients With Rectal Adenocarcinoma@highlight

RATIONALE: A coloanal anastomosis may be effective in restoring bowel function after radiation therapy and surgery to remove the rectum.

 It is not yet known whether a J-pouch coloanal anastomosis is more effective than a side-to-end coloanal anastomosis in restoring bowel function in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who have undergone radiation therapy and surgery to remove the rectum.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well J-pouch coloanal anastomosis works compared to side-to-end coloanal anastomosis in treating patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who have undergone radiation therapy and surgery to remove the rectum.
