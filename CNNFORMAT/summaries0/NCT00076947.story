(secondQuint)Safety of the EnvPro HIV Vaccine in Healthy Volunteers.

 EnvPro is a recombinant, purified envelope protein vaccine with an aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant.

 Aluminum hydroxide is licensed as an adjuvant in other vaccines, such as the hepatitis B vaccine.

 This study will examine the safety and tolerability of EnvPro with alum adjuvant in healthy, HIV uninfected adults.

 All participants in this study will receive vaccine injections in the upper arm muscle.

 Participants will receive a second vaccine injection eight weeks after the first injection.

 Blood tests will be performed at study visits before the vaccine is given, during the eight weeks between injections, and at selected times for up to three years after the vaccine is given.
