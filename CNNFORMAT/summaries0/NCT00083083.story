(fifthQuint)Fludeoxyglucose F18 Positron Emission Tomography Imaging In Assessing Patients Before and After Treatment for Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine whether peak standardized uptake value (SUV) for fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) shortly after definitive chemoradiotherapy is predictive of long-term survival of patients with inoperable stage IIB or III non-small cell lung cancer.

 Secondary - Determine whether max SUV for FDG-PET shortly after definitive chemoradiotherapy is predictive of long-term survival in these patients.

 - Determine whether post-treatment imaging using peak and max SUV for FDG-PET shortly after definitive chemoradiotherapy is predictive of local disease control in these patients.

 - Determine whether pre-treatment imaging using these techniques is predictive of long-term survival and local disease control in these patients.

 - Correlate, if possible, Ki-67 expression with overall survival of patients assessed with these imaging techniques.

 OUTLINE: This is a diagnostic, multicenter study.

 Before starting chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo baseline whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

 Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 (^18FDG) IV followed 50-70 minutes later by PET imaging.

 Patients then receive concurrent definitive radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

 Patients enrolled in other treatment-oriented clinical trials receive therapy as per that trial.

 Other patients receive standard thoracic radiotherapy (dose 60 Gy) and standard chemotherapy comprising a platin (cisplatin or carboplatin) and a second non-platin, non-gemcitabine drug (etoposide, vinblastine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel).

 Approximately 14 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy (if given), patients undergo post-treatment ^18FDG-PET imaging.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for at least 1 year.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients (including at least 75 with stage IIB/IIIA disease and at least 75 with stage IIIB disease) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as fludeoxyglucose F18 positron emission tomography (^18FDG-PET), may improve the ability to detect disease progression and help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and plan more effective treatment.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well ^18FDG-PET imaging works in detecting disease progression and determining response to treatment in patients who are undergoing chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
