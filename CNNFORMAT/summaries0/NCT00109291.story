(firstQuint)Safety of Single Doses of Peginesatide in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.

 This was a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential dose escalation study conducted at a single clinical center.

 The study was designed to evaluate up to 6 treatment cohorts of 9 participants with CKD not on dialysis in the first cohort and 5 participants in each subsequent cohort.

 In each treatment cohort, participants were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of peginesatide (n=7 in the first cohort, n=4 in subsequent cohorts) or placebo (n=2 in the first cohort, n=1 in subsequent cohorts).

 Participants were followed for a minimum of 28 days.
