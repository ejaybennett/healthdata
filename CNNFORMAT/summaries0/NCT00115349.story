(thirdQuint)Combination Therapy Compared With Single-Drug Therapy in Patients With Cardiac Diseases.

 DESIGN NARRATIVE: Participants will be randomized to 1 year of treatment with L1/DFO combination therapy or DFO monotherapy.

 At baseline, 6 months, and 1 year on therapy, cardiac function will be assessed by MRI measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), T2*, Holter monitoring, and electrocardiography.

 Additional monitoring for safety includes weekly blood testing, monthly visits, and periodic eye and ear exams.

 Combination Therapy Compared With Single-Drug Therapy in Patients With Cardiac Diseases@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether left ventricular function improves more rapidly with deferoxamine (DFO) and deferiprone (L1) combination therapy than with DFO monotherapy in patients with thalassemia and decreased ejection fractions.

 Secondary aims include evaluating changes in myocardial iron burden using T2* and estimating the relative incidence and severity of chelator-induced toxicity.
