(secondQuint)Glycemic Index and CVD: a Crossover Feeding Study.

 This study will compare the physiological effects of two isoenergetic, nutrient-controlled diets that differ in glycemic index.

 The diets will be studied in obese male adults in a 10-day crossover feeding trial.

 Hypothesis: Obese subjects will show improvements in clinical endpoints associated with risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) after consuming a controlled low (compared to high) glycemic index diet for 10 days.

 1 endpoint: insulin sensitivity as measured by the modified Frequently Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test (FSIVGTT).

 2 endpoints: CVD risk factors; postprandial studies of oxidative stress; thermic effect of food.
