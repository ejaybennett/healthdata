(secondQuint)CRT RENEWAL Registry.

 The CRT RENEWAL Registry aims to characterize patient demographics and clinical attributes at enrollment and overall event rates as defined by heart failure decompensation, heart failure hospitalization, death, and ventricular arrhythmic events.

 The registry will also assess clinical outcomes including quality of life (QOL), physical activity habits, and events rates, along with device diagnostics such as Activity Log Index and heart rate.
