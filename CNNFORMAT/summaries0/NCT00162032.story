(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Use and Safety of CARDIOLITE in Pediatric Patients With Kawasaki Disease.

 The purpose of this clinical research study is to determine how well CARDIOLITE(R) rest and stress myocardial (heart) imaging can define the pediatric Kawasaki disease (KD) population into high and low risk categories of developing cardiac (heart) events (complications) from 1 year through 3 years after image completion.

 The safety of CARDIOLITE(R) rest and stress heart imaging will also be studied.
