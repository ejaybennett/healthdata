(firstQuint)Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI) for Relapsed (Post Transplant) Leukemia.

 We will collect immune cells or lymphocytes from the donor's blood using a cell separator.

 The blood lymphocytes will be given to the subjects through a catheter.

 If the subjects have no complications of the first course of infusions, we may decide to give them "lymphocytes" aa second time while subjects are in remission in an attempt to prevent their disease from relapsing.

 A bone marrow test will be taken prior to infusion of lymphocytes as part of the clinical evaluation to receive this treatment.

 After lymphocyte infusions, a bone marrow will be examined about every three months for the first year to monitor progress from this therapy.

 Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI) for Relapsed (Post Transplant) Leukemia@highlight

In this study our hypothesis is that infusion of donor lymphocyte immune cells from the subject's bone marrow donor will activate the subject's immune system to attack their cancer.
