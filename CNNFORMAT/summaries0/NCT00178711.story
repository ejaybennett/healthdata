(secondQuint)Effects of Hypothermia Upon Outcomes After Acute Traumatic Brain Injury.

 NABIS:HIIR was a randomized clinical trial conducted in patients with severe brain injury, age 16-45.

 Patients were randomized to standard treatment at normothermia or to standard treatment with moderate hypothermia (32.

5-34C for 48 hours).

 An intent to treat analysis was used with the primary outcome measure as the Glasgow Outcome Scale at six months after injury.

 GOS is dichotomized into good outcome (Good Recovery/Moderate Disability) and poor outcome (Severe Disability, Vegetative, Dead).

 Effects of Hypothermia Upon Outcomes After Acute Traumatic Brain Injury@highlight

Induction of hypothermia to C by C by 4 hours after injury and maintained for 48 hours in patients aged 16-45 will result in an increased number of patients with good outcomes at six months after injury compared to patients randomized to normothermia.
