(secondQuint)ASSESS Study: Evaluation of ABSOLUTE Stent System for Occluded Arteries.

 The treatment of stenosis in superficial femoral arteries and/or proximal popliteal arteries with stenting is associated with high restenosis rates, especially with the first generation stents (stainless steel).

 Currently, self-expandable nitinol stents are commercialized which lead to higher primary patency rates as compared to the first generation stents, even in longer lesions.

 However, until now most data available are retrospective and uni-center.

 The ASSESS study is a prospective multi-center study investigating the performance (restenosis rate, patency rates) of the ABSOLUTE cent .

 035 peripheral self-expandable stent in longer lesions (lesion length from 4.

00 mm to 200.

00 mm).

 Moreover, literature shows stent fracture in nitinol stents, with a possible clinical relationship.

 For this reason, the ASSESS study will analyze the stent fractures of the ABSOLUTE cent stent, and a possible relationship between stent fracture and restenosis.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of the ABSOLUTE cent .

035 peripheral self-expanding stent system in preventing restenosis of occluded or stenotic superficial femoral or proximal popliteal arteries.
