(fifthQuint)Weekly Docetaxel and CMF in the Adjuvant Treatment of Elderly Women With High-Risk Breast Cancer.

 Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: - Docetaxel - Cyclophosphamide + Methotrexate + 5-fluorouracil This is not a blinded study so both the patient and the investigator will know which treatment has been assigned.

 Chemotherapy will be followed by breast and/or regional radiotherapy in appropriate patients, and by hormone therapy with tamoxifen for 5 years in patients who are estrogen-receptor positive.

 Patients who are considered poor candidates to receive tamoxifen may receive hormonal therapy with anastrazole.

 Weekly Docetaxel and CMF in the Adjuvant Treatment of Elderly Women With High-Risk Breast Cancer@highlight

This trial will evaluate the effectiveness of standard adjuvant treatment with CMF chemotherapy versus treatment with weekly docetaxel in patients with high-risk breast cancer who are 65 years of age and older or are poor candidates for anthracycline-containing regimens.

 This CMF regimen has decreased dose intensity and may be slightly less active in patients with metastatic breast cancer; however, the patient population in this trial has tolerated more intensive CMF regimens poorly in other trials.
