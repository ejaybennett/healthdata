(fifthQuint)An Evaluation of the Development of Nevirapine Induced Mutations in HIV Patients Initiating or Discontinuing Combination Antiretroviral Therapy.

 The HIVNET 012 clinical trial demonstrates a cost effective strategy to prevent maternal fetal transmission of HIV.

 In this study, a single 200 mg dose of Nevirapine was given to pregnant Ugandan women at the onset of labour and a single 2 mg/kg dose to their infants within 72 hours of birth (1).

 Given the efficacy, simplicity and low cost of this regime, the World Health Organization recently recommended implementation of this regimen as one of several options for prevention of maternal fetal transmission of HIV in resource limited settings.

 Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that 200 mg of Nevirapine given to the mother during labour results in concentrations >100 mg/mL (10 times the in vitro IC50) in the newborn.

 Nevirapine elimination is prolonged in both mothers and infants with median t 1/2 of 36.

8 to 65.

7 hours.

 Administration of 200 mg orally to the mother and a single 2 mg/kg oral dose to the infant at 48-72 hours, maintains serum concentration in the infants >100 mg/ml through 7 days of life (2, 3) Early studies demonstrated that the use of Nevirapine monotherapy resulted in a rapid selection of Nevirapine resistant mutations (4).

 This was associated with loss of antiviral activity and return of the viral load to baseline within 12 weeks.

 It appeared very soon that the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were drugs with a low genetic barrier and that a single mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene induced a high level of phenotypic resistance (5).

 Similarly, when Nevirapine was used in combination with a single nucleoside, and there was incomplete suppression of viral replication, resistance emerged to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (6).

 In contrast, when used as part of triple antiretroviral combination and there was successful inhibition of viral replication to 250 cellsmm3 at initiation of therapy including pregnant women receiving chronic treatment for HIV infection are at considerably higher risk (12-fold) of hepatotoxicity which in some cases has been fatal.

 The greatest risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic events occurs in the first 6 weeks of therapy.

 However, the risk continues after this time and patients should be closely monitored for the first 18 weeks of therapy.

 For this reason, women with CD4 > 250/mm3 will not be included in Objective 1 of this study.

 Hypothesis Nevirapine resistance developed in women and infants in the HIVNET 006 and 012 cohorts as a consequence of use of an agent with a long t 1/2 as monotherapy in individuals with high viral loads.

 Objective 1 To demonstrate that Nevirapine resistance does not develop in HIV infected patients when used as part of triple antiretroviral combination therapy between the initiation of treatment and suppression of HIV RNA to <1000 copies/ml.

 Objective 2 To demonstrate that resistance to nevirapine does not develop when patients with suppressed HIV RNA discontinue combination antiretroviral therapy which contains nevirapine.
