(thirdQuint)A Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Long-Term Nebivolol Use in Hypertensive Patients.

 This was an international, multicenter parallel group, 9-month extension study with a 4-week follow-up phase to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of nebivolol administered orally once daily in patients with mild to moderate hypertension (defined as an average sitting diastolic blood pressure greater then or equal to 95 mmHg and less then or equal to 109 mmHg when untreated, based on entry into NEB 202, NEB 302 or NEB 305).

 Patients were permitted protocol-defined concomitant use of diuretic or calcium antagonist.

 After successful completion of one of the 3-month efficacy "feeder" studies, patients were eligible to continue nebivolol treatment in this 9-month extension study.

 Patients who completed the extension phase and received only nebivolol monotherapy during the extension phase were eligible to enter the 1-month follow-up phase.
