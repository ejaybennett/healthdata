(fifthQuint)A Prospective, Open Label Comparison of Ezetimibe, Niacin, and Colestipol as Adjunct Therapy in Lipid Reduction.

 : Patients with hyperlipidemia who sign consent and who are currently at maximum tolerated dose of a statin and are not meeting NCEP ATPIII treatment goals for LDL cholesterol are enrolled in 12-week open label, prospective trial.

 Patients are randomized into one of three groups to receive ezetimibe, niacin, or colestipol in addition to current statin therapy.

 Patients are titrated as tolerated to therapeutic doses of study medications (ezetimibe 10mg/day, niacin 1500mg/day, and colestipol 20gm/day).

 At baseline, informed consent; a laboratory admission profile (Chem20); weight; height; blood pressure; concomitant medications; cholesterol medication history; and grapefruit juice consumption data are gathered.

 At weeks 6 and 12, patients have their cholesterol panels and liver function tests assessed.

 Patients are also interviewed regarding side effects (including rhabdomyolysis), tolerance, changes in concomitant medications, and grapefruit juice consumption, along with weight and blood pressure measurements.

 A Prospective, Open Label Comparison of Ezetimibe, Niacin, and Colestipol as Adjunct Therapy in Lipid Reduction@highlight

To compare LDL reduction compared to baseline in patients using maximum tolerated HMG CoA Reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy with adjunctive therapy with ezetimibe, colestipol, or niacin.

 The patient's cardiovascular risks are assessed to determine if National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) guidelines for low density lipoprotein (LDL) reduction were achieved between the three groups.

 Secondary measures examine the safety issues with liver function test (LFT) monitoring and rhabdomyolysis.

 High-density lipoproteins (HDL) elevations are monitored between the three groups to determine efficacy as a secondary outcome.
