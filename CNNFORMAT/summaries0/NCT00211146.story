(secondQuint)A Study to Confirm the Safety and Efficacy of Epoetin Alfa (PROCRIT) Administered Perioperatively vs.

 the Standard of Care in Blood Conservation in Patients Undergoing Major Elective Spinal Surgery (SPINE Study).

 The objective of the study is to demonstrate that there is no clinically important additional risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in adult spine surgery using a perisurgical regimen of epoetin alfa (PROCRIT(R)) versus the standard of care for blood conservation.

 Spine surgery was selected as the population to study because anti-coagulant therapy is not always administered in association with this surgery type.

 In addition, the efficacy of epoetin alfa (PROCRIT(R)) in protecting patients from receiving allogeneic red cell transfusion across adult spinal procedures will be studied.

 Patients scheduled for elective spinal surgery, who agree to participate in the study, and meet eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to epoetin alfa (PROCRIT(R)) or standard of care.

 No perioperative anti-coagulation therapy is to be administered during the study.

 The study hypothesis is that there is no increased risk of DVT in patients receiving perisurgical epoetin alfa (PROCRIT(R)) treatment.

 Epoetin alfa (PROCRIT(R)) 600U/kg administered once per week for 3 weeks prior to surgery and on the day of surgery.

This study is designed to investigate the incidence of deep vein thrombosis in patients receiving a perisurgical regimen of epoetin alfa (PROCRITA(R)) as compared to patients receiving standard of care blood conservation management.
