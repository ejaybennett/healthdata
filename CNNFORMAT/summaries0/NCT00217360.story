(fifthQuint)RCT to Reduce Further Falls and Injuries for Older Fallers Presenting to an Emergency Department.

 Older people presenting to an Emergency Department (ED) following a fall have high injury and hospitalisation rates.

 They are also at high risk of further falls and other adverse outcomes.

 However, there is currently limited available evidence to inform best practice.

 The primary aim of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a targeted multi-factor intervention in improving health and well being of older people who present to an ED after a fall.

 It also aims to identify those within this high-risk population most likely to benefit from the intervention program.

 Approximately 800 people aged 60 years and over will be invited to participate at the Emergency Department from the end of September 2002.

 Those who are eligible to participate will have a falls risk assessment in their own home and will be required to complete a falls diary for 12 months.

 There is a 50/50 chance (random allocation) that participants will receive an individualised falls prevention program.

 The duration of a falls risk assessment is up to 2 hours and there is no cost involved.

 Participation in the research program will not affect routine management from the Emergency Department.

 Becoming a participant may lessen the risk of having another fall and help others as well.

 RCT to Reduce Further Falls and Injuries for Older Fallers Presenting to an Emergency Department@highlight

This project is called "Falls Aren't Us" and aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a customised falls prevention program for people aged 60 and over who were presented to the hospital Emergency Department following a fall and being discharged home.

 Recruitment for this randomized controlled trial has commenced in late December 2002 from several major public hospitals in the western, southern, and northern parts of Melbourne Metropolitan Region.

 Consented participants will receive a comprehensive falls risk assessment within one week of being discharged home from the Emergency Department and at twelve month following this initial assessment.

 Their falls risks will be monitored for twelve months through a falls diary.

 Following randomization, participants in the intervention group will receive a customised falls prevention program in addition to the usual care being put in place from the hospital Emergency Department.
