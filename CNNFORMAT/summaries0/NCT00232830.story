(thirdQuint)The Study to Assess AMI Treated With Balloon Angioplasty.

.

 This is an international, multicenter (up to 52 sites), randomized, single-blind study in patients with an acute myocardial infarction treated with the CYPHER cent (Sirolimus-eluting) stent as compared to the bare stents.

 Patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions will be treated with the CYPHER cent (Sirolimus-eluting) stent or a bare stent.

 Subjects will be followed at 30 days, 6 months and at 1, 3, 4 and 5 years post-procedure.

 200 subjects will have an angiographic follow-up at 8 months.

@highlight

The main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of the CYPHER cent (CYPHER SELECT cent ) (Sirolimus-eluting) stent in reducing the occurrence of a composite endpoint of target vessel failure (TVF) in subjects treated for acute myocardial infarction as compared to a bare metal stent.
