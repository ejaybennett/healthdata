(thirdQuint)Voriconazole and Caspofungin Acetate in Treating Invasive Fungal Infections in Patients With Weakened Immune Systems.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the 12-week complete and partial response rate in immunocompromised patients with invasive fungal infections treated with voriconazole and caspofungin acetate.

 Secondary - Determine the 12-week survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive voriconazole orally or IV over 1 hour twice daily and caspofungin acetate IV over 1 hour once daily on days 1-84.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Voriconazole and Caspofungin Acetate in Treating Invasive Fungal Infections in Patients With Weakened Immune Systems@highlight

RATIONALE: Voriconazole and caspofungin acetate may control invasive fungal infections in patients who have weakened immune systems.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving voriconazole together with caspofungin acetate works in treating invasive fungal infections in patients with weakened immune systems.
