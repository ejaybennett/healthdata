(thirdQuint)Epidemiologic, Laboratory, and Clinical Characterization of Individuals With Ocular Diseases.

 This study is designed to investigate the epidemiologic, genetic, laboratory and clinical characterization of individuals with ocular diseases (cataract, retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinal detachment, ocular tumor, etc.

).

 We will accrue approximately 800 patients as experimental group.

 The control group consists of age/sex frequency-matched subjects who will be confirmed without ocular diseases.

 We will explore the environmental (including family history, life style, diet, physical activity, neuropsychological functioning,plasma levels of oxidative stress and angiogenic factors, etc.

) and genetic (including oxidative stress and angiogenic factors, etc.

) risk factors.

 We will study the association between various environmental risk factors with the clinical characterization and correlation between the genetic polymorphisms and the presence of various ocular diseases.

 Epidemiologic, Laboratory, and Clinical Characterization of Individuals With Ocular Diseases@highlight

Environmental and genetic factors may play a role in the progression of ocular diseases (cataract, retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinal detachment, ocular tumor, etc.

).

 The goal of this project is to establish a series of case-control studies to evaluate risk factors of ocular diseases in China.
