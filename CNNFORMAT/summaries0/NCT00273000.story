(firstQuint)The Importance of Glucagon-Like Peptide-2 (GLP-2)in Mesenteric Bloodflow in Humans.

 The investigation will include 10 testpersons.

 It will be a 2 fase study over 2 days.

 day 1: The testperson will meet fasting, and take in a standard liquid meal, after this the bloodflow in a mesenteric artery will be measured by use of ultrasonic technique.

 Bloodsamples will be taken regular in a total wolumne of 200 ml.

 day 2:The testperson will meet fasting, there wil be administered intraveneous GLP-2 in 3 increasing doses over 3 x 45 min.

and one subcutaneous dose.

 During this the bloodflow in a mesenteric artery will be measured by use of ultrasonic technique.

 Bloodsamples will be taken regular in a total wolumne of 200 ml.

 The Importance of Glucagon-Like Peptide-2 (GLP-2)in Mesenteric Bloodflow in Humans@highlight

The purpose of this study is to study the effect of GLP-2 on mesenteric bloodflow in healthy adults by the use of ultrasound.

, it is the hypothesis that GLP-2 vil increase the bloodflow.
