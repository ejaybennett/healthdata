(firstQuint)The Effect of Intensive Insulin Therapy in the Surgical Critical Care Unit.

 While evidence exists for using tight glycemic control in the critically ill cardiac surgical patient, other patient populations have yet to be studied.

 We performed a prospective randomized trial for using intensive insulin therapy in the general and vascular critically ill surgical patient population.

 We will compare tight glycemic control versus conventional glycemic control to determine if there is a benefit to the normalization of blood glucose levels in this patient population.

We sought to determine if there is a benefit to using an insulin drip to control hyperglycemia in the surgical critical care unit for patients who undergo general and vascular surgery.
