(thirdQuint)Internal Radiation Therapy After Lumpectomy in Treating Women With Ductal Carcinoma in Situ.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate in women with ductal carcinoma in situ undergoing lumpectomy followed by brachytherapy using the MammoSite^(R) Radiation Therapy System.

 Secondary - Determine the early and late complication rates and cosmetic outcome in these patients after treatment.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo lumpectomy.

 Patients with negative tumor margins* (no ink on tumor) undergo placement of the MammoSite^(R) Radiation Therapy System at the time of lumpectomy or within 4 weeks after surgery.

 NOTE: *If positive margins are present, the surgeon may elect to resect the positive margins and then insert a new MammoSite(R) device if all other eligibility criteria are met.

 Beginning 2-5 days after placement of the MammoSite^(R), patients undergo brachytherapy through the MammoSite^(R) twice daily for 5 days (a total of 10 fractions).

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

 Internal Radiation Therapy After Lumpectomy in Treating Women With Ductal Carcinoma in Situ@highlight

RATIONALE: Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells.

 Giving internal radiation therapy using a special radiation therapy device may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well internal radiation therapy after lumpectomy works in treating women with ductal carcinoma in situ.
