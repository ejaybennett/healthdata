(thirdQuint)SJG-136 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Blastic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Establish the maximum tolerated dose of SJG-136 in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

 II.

 Determine dose-limiting toxicities and pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive SJG-136 IV over 15 minutes on days 1-5.

 Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SJG-136 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 A total of 10 patients are treated at the MTD.

 SJG-136 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Blastic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia@highlight

This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of SJG-136 in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SJG-136, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
