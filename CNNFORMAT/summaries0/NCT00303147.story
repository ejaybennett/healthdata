(secondQuint)Cognitive and Health Benefits of Expressive Writing for Family Caregivers Under Stress.

 A significant and growing need exists to support caregivers of older adults with dementia, including methods of support that are easily implemented and targeted at caregivers who can not access multicomponent interventions.

 The current intervention examines the efficacy of one such approach: expressive writing (EW).
