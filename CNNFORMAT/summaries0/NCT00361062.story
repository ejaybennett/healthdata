(fifthQuint)Aggressive Behavior Induced by Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) During the First Month of Treatment.

 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) became the first line therapy for anxiety and depressive disorders and for many other clinical diagnoses.

 One of the most disturbing side effects that is observed is a tendency towards aggressiveness among patients receiving medications from this group, mainly during the first (one month) period of therapy.

 Aggressive behavior tends to occur in some individuals but not in others.

 Until now most of the cases and reports in the literature demonstrate the extreme events of aggressive behavior.

 These personality or any other character traits that are more prone to develop aggressiveness have not been studied and it is not clear if this side effect manifests itself just in the extreme rare cases or if it is a more common phenomenon that occurs in a wider group of people.

 In this study we try to estimate the tendency towards aggressive behavior of patients prescribed to a medication of the SSRI group.

 By using a comparative computer simulation we hope to be able to detect more delicate changes and maybe to get some clues of the personalities prone to aggressive behavior in the future.

 One of the most disturbing side effects that is observed is a tendency towards aggressiveness among patients receiving medications from this group, mainly during the first month of therapy.

 Aggressive behavior tends to occur in some individuals but not in others.

 In some sub-groups of people, personality and character traits might make a person more prone to aggressive behavior.

 In this study the investigators try to estimate the tendency towards aggressive behavior in patients prescribed to a medication from the SSRI group.

 By using a comparative computer simulation they hope to be able to detect delicate changes and to maybe get some clues of the personalities prone to aggressive behavior in the future.
