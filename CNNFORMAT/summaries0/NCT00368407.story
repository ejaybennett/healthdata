(thirdQuint)Optimal Treatment Frequency of 308-Nm Excimer Laser for Vitiligo on the Face and Neck.

 Vitiligo patients were treated with 308-nm excimer laser for 20 sessions at different frequencies (0.

5*, 1.

0*, 2.

0* and 3.

0* weekly).

 Treatment protocols adapted the dose to the lesions and not to the minimal erythemal dose.

 Treatment efficacy was blindly evaluated by 2 independent physicians.

 Re-pigmentation rate was graded on a 6-point scale.

 The onset of re-pigmentation of vitiligo lesions was evaluated after 5 treatment sessions.

 The differences between Group 0.

5*, 1.

0*, 2.

0* and 3.

0* linking different clinical variables were assessed.
