(fifthQuint)A Study of Nimotuzumab in Combination With External Radiotherapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter Phase II study with Phase I lead-in.

 Patients enrolled in this study will receive external radiotherapy with or without nimotuzumab (TheraCIM h-R3).

 The objective of the Phase I component of the study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the administration of nimotuzumab with palliative radiation in patients who are unsuitable for radical therapy (curative intent chemoradiation) and to select the optimal biologically effective dose (BED) for Phase II component of the study.

 In the Phase II component, overall survival, local and systemic response rates and quality of life will be evaluated inpatients treated with nimotuzumab in combination with palliative radiation vs.

 radiation alone.

 The Phase I component of this study has been completed.

 The Phase II is now closed to recruitment.
