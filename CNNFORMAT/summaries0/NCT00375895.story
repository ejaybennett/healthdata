(fifthQuint)Switch From Tacrolimus to Cyclosporin in the Treatment of Recurrent Hepatitis C After Liver Transplantation.

 In France, 50% of hepatitis C virus carriers develop chronic clinical hepatitis, which may lead to cirrhosis and liver transplantation.

 Transplant infection by hepatitis C virus is constant after transplantation.

 A main factor determining the severity of recurrent hepatitis C after transplantation may be immunosuppression.

 Thus optimization of immunosuppressive regimens might be a key aspect to improve the prognosis of chronic hepatitis C in transplanted patients.

 The two most frequently used immunosuppressive drugs are cyclosporin and tacrolimus.

 However, it has been shown that virus replication could be inhibited by cyclosporin, through the blockade of cyclophilins, decreasing hepatitis C viral load and improving liver function.

 These effects were not found with tacrolimus.

 The aim of our study is to assess the efficacy on C virological response of the switch from tacrolimus to cyclosporin associated with a peginterferon alfa-2a / ribavirin bitherapy, in non-responder or with a recurrent VHC+ disease liver transplanted patients.

 Patients will receive a 19 month cyclosporin treatment, associated during 12 months with a peginterferon alfa-2a / ribavirin bitherapy.

 Efficacy will be assessed by the percentage of patients with a negative qualitative PCR after 19 months of cyclosporin treatment.

 Switch From Tacrolimus to Cyclosporin in the Treatment of Recurrent Hepatitis C After Liver Transplantation@highlight

In France, 50% of hepatitis C virus carriers develop chronic clinical hepatitis, which may lead to cirrhosis and liver transplantation.

 Transplant infection by hepatitis C virus is constant after transplantation and recurrence causes chronic liver disease in 50 to 80% of cases.

 The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of cyclosporin on C virological response.

 Patients included in the Transpeg 1 study and non-responder or with a recurrent disease will be switched from their tacrolimus therapy to cyclosporin, in association with a 1 year peginterferon alfa-2a / ribavirin bitherapy.

 Efficacy will be assessed by the percentage of patients with a negative qualitative PCR after 19 months of cyclosporin treatment.
