(thirdQuint)Radiation Boost for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme.

 The study design is multi-centered and non-randomized.

 Patients with newly diagnosed GBM undergoing initial surgical resection will be candidates for this study.

 Eligible patients will undergo surgical resection within 30 days of diagnosis.

 Newly diagnosed patients with presumed diagnosis of GBM will undergo surgery for maximal resection.

 After frozen section diagnosis of GBM is confirmed, the GliaSite(R) will be placed into the tumor cavity.

 After the patient recovers from surgery, radiation therapy (60 Gy to 1 cm) is delivered via the GliaSite(R).

 Radiation therapy with the GliaSite(R) will be initiated within 21 days after surgery.

 Concomitant temozolomide (75 mg/m2/d) is started 2 days prior to radiation therapy with the GliaSite(R) and continued for a total of 7 days.

 Within 21 days following radiation therapy with the GliaSite(R), external beam radiation therapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions) will be initiated.

 Concomitant temozolomide (75 mg/m2/d) will start on day 1 of external beam radiation therapy and continue through the external beam radiation therapy interval, ending with the last day of radiation.

 Four weeks (+/- 2 days) after completion of external beam radiation therapy, temozolomide (150 mg/m2/d) for 5 days every 28 days will be initiated for one cycle.

 At the start of cycle 2, the dose will be escalated to 200 mg/m2/d, if the CTC non-hematological toxicity for cycle 1 is Grade < 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and vomiting).

 This will continue for up to a total of 12 cycles, unless disease progression or severe myelosuppression is noted.

 Radiation Boost for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine treatment related toxicity, tumor response, progression-free survival and quality of life of newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) patients undergoing a combination of surgical resection, brachytherapy and external beam radiation with concomitant temozolomide, followed by adjuvant temozolomide.
