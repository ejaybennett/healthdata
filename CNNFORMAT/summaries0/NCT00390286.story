(firstQuint)Telemedicine's Utility for Augmenting Clinical Trials and Informed Consent TACTIC.

 The UCSD Telemedicine system is a digital video camera system, which can transfer video and audio images from a clinic or emergency room to a remote place where a physician can review images in real time (as they happen).

 The system uses site independent software to access the camera system from multiple locations.

 This research study will determine if it is feasible to obtain informed consent for various types of research trials (hypothetical, non-invasive, invasive trails) via telemedicine.

 Inpatient assessments on participants to complete clinical research case report forms by telemedicine will also by performed.
