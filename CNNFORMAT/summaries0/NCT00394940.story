(thirdQuint)Identifying Inflammatory Biomarkers of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

 COPD is a term that encompasses both chronic bronchitis and emphysema, two diseases that are characterized by airway obstruction that interferes with normal breathing.

 Airway inflammation can stem from exposure to harmful fumes in the air, chronic bacterial infections in the airways, and a genetic predisposition to an inflammatory response to these agents.

 In people with COPD, the airway inflammation may extend beyond the lungs and contribute to systemic symptoms and, ultimately, to an increased mortality risk.

 Markers of systemic inflammation have been identified, but the relationship between these markers and when and to what extent COPD develops has not been determined.

 This study will use data collected during the TESAOD and its 33-year follow-up to determine the relationship between COPD and the expression of various inflammatory proteins, including pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.

g.

, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha) and acute phase proteins (e.

g.

, C-reactive protein, soluble CD14).

 This study will not recruit any new participants.

 Detailed respiratory phenotypic information and serum samples that were collected during the TESAOD study will be evaluated in conjunction with newly generated biomarker and protein information.

 No new phenotypic data or biological specimens will be collected in this study.

 Identifying Inflammatory Biomarkers of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease@highlight

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition that is characterized by airway obstruction due to inflammation.

 Levels of inflammatory proteins may be linked to when and to what extent COPD develops.

 This study will use data collected during the Tucson Epidemiological Study of Airway Obstructive Disease (TESAOD) and its 33-year follow-up to determine the relationship between inflammatory protein expression and COPD.
