(fifthQuint)CHOICE: Carotid Stenting For High Surgical-Risk Patients.

 The CHOICE study will provide a mechanism for collection of data from Abbott Vascular's Carotid Stent Systems and Embolic Protection Systems when used by a broad group of physicians under commercial use conditions.

 The original CAPTURE and EXACT studies had built-in features that limited the ability to collect on-going real world data because they restricted the number of sites that could participate (up to 150 sites) and limited enrollment at each site (up to 50 patients per site).

 This study will not have these restrictions.

 The CHOICE study will also provide an ongoing post-market surveillance mechanism for documentation of clinical outcomes and for possible extension of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) coverage to a broader group of patients.
