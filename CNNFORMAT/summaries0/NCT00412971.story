(thirdQuint)A Randomized, Comparative Study of Hexvix Fluorescence Cystoscopy and Standard Cystoscopy in Patients With Non-invasive Bladder Cancer.

 The main objective of the study is to compare the 1-year recurrence rate of Hexvix assisted Transuretheral Resection of the Bladder (TURB) to standard white light TURB in patients with suspicion of non-invasive bladder cancer.

 Patients will be followed 4, 8 and 12 months after the initial TURB.

 This follow-up regimen is according to standard clinical practice in Denmark.

 Recurrence of non-invasive bladder cancer is frequent, and this study is designed to investigate whether Hexvix assisted TURB can reduce the early recurrence compared to standard TURB.

The main objective of the study is to compare the 1-year recurrence rate of Hexvix assisted Transuretheral Resection of the Bladder (TURB) to standard white light TURB in patients with suspicion of non-invasive bladder cancer.

 The hypothesis is to test whether the 1-year recurrence rate is different with Hexvix assisted TURB compared to standard white light TURB.
