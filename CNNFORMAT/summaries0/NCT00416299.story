(firstQuint)Prognostic Value of New Cardiac Biomarkers in Elderly Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery.

 Plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP, cardiac troponin T (cTnT), pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), ischemia-modified albumin (IMA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), metalloproteinase (MMP) soluble CD 40 ligand (sCD40L), and inflammatory cytokine levels will be measured in 100 elderly patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass before induction of anesthesia and 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h after surgery.

 Optimum discriminators for prediction of postoperative cardiovascular complications wil be determined by the use of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves analyses.
