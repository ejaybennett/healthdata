(firstQuint)Survey of the Need for Information on Fertility and Menopause-Related Treatment Effects Among HSCT Patients.

 Researchers are currently conducting a survey on how important it is to women who are having a stem cell transplant to have information about the effects of the treatment on their fertility (their ability to have children) and on the risk of early menopause.

 Researchers know that some women who had transplants think that the information that they received may have been lacking or was not appropriate for their needs.

 Therefore, researchers would like to ask women who have had stem cell transplants at M.

 D.

 Anderson Cancer Center to report what kind of information they got and would like to have gotten before or during their treatment.
