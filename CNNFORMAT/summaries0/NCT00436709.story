(fifthQuint)Bevacizumab, Doxorubicin, and Cyclophosphamide Followed By Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation and Bevacizumab in Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery for Early-Stage Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the cardiac safety of adjuvant concurrent bevacizumab and dose-dense doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide followed by dose-dense paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and maintenance therapy comprising bevacizumab alone in patients with early-stage breast cancer.

 Secondary - Determine the noncardiac toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

 - Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of time to tumor recurrence and overall survival, in these patients.

 - Explore changes in circulating endothelial cells and circulating tumor cells from pre-treatment levels in patients with no evidence of disease.

 - Prospectively explore the use of serial troponin I as a predictor of cardiac toxicity in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Prospectively explore the relationship between plasma renin activity and hypertension in patients treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy.

 OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, pilot, multicenter study.

 Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, cyclophophamide IV, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 2.

 Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients then receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and pegfilgrastim SC on day 2.

 Treatment with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and pegfilgrastim repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients then receive maintenance therapy comprising bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1.

 Treatment with maintenance therapy repeats every 3 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study treatment.

 Samples are analyzed for circulating endothelial cells (by flow cytomery [FC]), circulating epithelial cells (by immunocytochemistry and FC), troponin I concentrations (by enzyme immunoassay or chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay), and plasma renin activity (by radioimmunoassay).

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 4-6 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Bevacizumab, Doxorubicin, and Cyclophosphamide Followed By Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation and Bevacizumab in Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery for Early-Stage Breast Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways.

 Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

 Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.

 Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of breast cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving bevacizumab together with chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well giving bevacizumab together with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and bevacizumab works in treating patients who have undergone surgery for early-stage breast cancer.
