(secondQuint)Fluorine F 18 FEQA in Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and in Healthy Participants.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the biodistribution of fluorine F 18 FEQA in patients with stage III or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in healthy participants.

 - Determine whether fluorine F 18 FEQA can be used as an imaging agent with positron emission tomography in patients with stage III or IV NSCLC.

 OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

 Patients and healthy participants receive fluorine F 18 FEQA IV and then undergo whole-body dynamic scans comprising positron emission tomography.

 Blood is collected during and after imaging to measure radioactivity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
