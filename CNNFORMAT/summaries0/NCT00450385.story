(secondQuint)Genes in Predicting Outcome of Patients With DLBCL Treated With Rituximab and Combination Chemotherapy (R-CHOP).

 In this phase II multi-institutional trial, the investigators will identify genes associated with either good or bad outcome in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP, will construct a robust predictive models based on RNA extracted from or paraffin specimens as well on immunohistochemistry and will examine the predictive power of new biomarkers associated with the anti-tumor effects of rituximab.

 The acquisition of fixed tissue as a component of this uniformly treated prospective study will also afford future studies with this informative dataset.

 Genes in Predicting Outcome of Patients With DLBCL Treated With Rituximab and Combination Chemotherapy (R-CHOP)@highlight

The investigators hypothesize that survival of newly diagnosed DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) patients treated with R-CHOP can be predicted by RNA or protein gene expression or by presence of biomarkers associated with the anti-tumor effects of Rituximab.
