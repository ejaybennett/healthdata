(thirdQuint)The Effect of Pramlintide on Meal Time Insulin Bolus.

 Pramlintide.

 an amylinomimetic, is effective in reducing post-meal glucose by non-insulin means.

 As such, when patients requiring insulin treatment are treated with pramlintide, the bolus insulin does must be reduced.

 Current recommendations suggest a 50% reduction but in our experience and that of a recent study this appears excessive.

 By using continuous glucose monitoring(CGM) to guide pre-meal insulin treatment, we will determine the percentage reduction in meal time insulin bolus comparing pre-pramlintide to maximum pramlintide treatment.

 We anticipate that the reduction in bolus dosage will be about 25%.

 In addition, the secondary aim of this study is to determine which bolus pattern, standard, square or dual wave, provides the best post-meal glucose control with pramlintide therapy.

The primary objective is to establish the mean percentage of change in the insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio due to pramlintide treatment once a maximum tolerated dose or 6 mcg before each meal is reached.

 The secondary objective is to establish which insulin bolus wave form is associated with the lowest post-bolus without hypoglycemia in subjects treated with maximum pramlintide dosage.
