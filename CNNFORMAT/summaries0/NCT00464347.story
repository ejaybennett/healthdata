(secondQuint)TAC-PF, Avastin in Combination With Photodynamic Therapy to Treat Age Related Macular Degeneration.

 The VERTACL study is a multi-center, randomized, Phase II trial to investigate whether a triple therapy, Avastin(R), half fluence verteporfin PDT, and TAC- PF, results in improved 12-month vision outcome compared to Avastin(R) alone in participants with neovascular AMD.

 Participants will be randomized (similar to the flip of a coin) in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study groups: single therapy (Avastin(R)), or triple therapy (Avastin(R), half fluence verteporfin PDT, and TAC- PF).

 Participants in the Avastin(R) alone arm will receive 1.

25 mg intravitreal Avastin(R), at every study visit.

 Participants in the triple-therapy arm will receive all treatments (Avastin(R), half fluence verteporfin PDT, and TAC- PF) at baseline.

 Following baseline, participants in the triple therapy study arm will receive study treatment on an as-needed (PRN) basis if protocol-specific re-treatment criteria are met.

 After randomization, participants will return to the clinic approximately every six weeks for one year for study assessments and possible re-treatment.

 Participants will return to the clinic at month 24 for a final study assessment.

 Study assessments include: visual acuity, optical coherence tomography, and fundus photography.

VERTACL will investigate whether a triple therapy, Avastin(R), half fluence verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT), and triamcinolone acetonide-preservative free (TAC- PF), results in improved 12-month vision outcome compared to Avastin(R) alone in participants with neovascular AMD.
