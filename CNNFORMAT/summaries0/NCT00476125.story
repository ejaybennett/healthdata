(thirdQuint)Effects of Dietary Manipulation on Metabolism in Healthy Adults.

 There is scant data regarding the metabolic events that occur in humans during ketosis which may be brought about by fasting or ingestion of diets low in carbohydrate.

 We aim to employ both fasting and dietary manipulation in order to bring about a ketotic state in healthy human adults.

 During the study blood levels of key metabolic regulators will be monitored 1) during a 16 hour fast followed by re-feeding and 2) during dietary induction of ketosis followed by re-feeding with a standard meal.

 Effects of Dietary Manipulation on Metabolism in Healthy Adults@highlight

This study will examine the potential changes in the blood levels of a recently discovered metabolic regulator in response to changes in diet in healthy adults.

 Our hypothesis is that in healthy adults key regulatory factors involved in lipid oxidation will respond to changes in diet, particularly fasting and diet-induced ketosis.
