(secondQuint)Study of the Modification of the Pharmacokinetic Profile of Levodopa by the Fiber Plantago Ovata Husk.

 Although the treatment with l-dopa is the election treatment for Parkinsons disease, a high number of patients develop motor complications, including, fluctuations and dyscinesia after some years of treatment.

 The origin of the fluctuations is not well established, but it could be attributed, al least partially, a pharmacokinetics factors.

 So that, it could improve the answer and reduce the adverse reaction if we reach more stable levels of L-dopa in the circulation.

 The first experimental studies in animals showed that Plantago ovata husk has an influence in the pharmacokinetics parameters of L-dopa, obtaining more stable levels.

 Study of the Modification of the Pharmacokinetic Profile of Levodopa by the Fiber Plantago Ovata Husk@highlight

The purpose of this trial is to study the effect of the association levodopa/carbidopa with plantago ovata husk in Parkinsons disease patients of recent diagnostic, that are being treated with levodopa/carbidopa.
