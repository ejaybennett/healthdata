 Temozolomide and Thalidomide Treatment in Recurrent Glioblastoma@highlight

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intensive dose temozolomide treatment alone in parallel to a combination with thalidomide in patients with recurrent glioblastoma after standard therapy.

 In the treatment arm A of the study it will be investigated whether or not continuous dosing of temozolomide may overcome alkylator resistance in patients with glioblastoma who progress on the 5/28 day dosing regimen.

 For treatment arm B it is postulated that the combination of thalidomide and temozolomide is effective with respect to time to progression and progression-free survival due to the fact that temozolomide and thalidomide have different mechanisms of action.
