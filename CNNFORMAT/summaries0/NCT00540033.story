(thirdQuint)Probiotics Reduce Incidence of Necrotizing Enterocolitis for Very Low Birth Weight Infants.

 Introduction NEC is a worldwide problem in preterm very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with highly variable incidence affecting 2.

6% to 28% of these infants; 1.

Recent reports suggest increasing occurrence of NEC, estimating up to 9000 cases of NEC in the United States every year, with death occurring in 20 % to 40% of affected individuals.

 [1.

3] As the number of very low-birth-weight infants increases, NEC remains a critical eminent problem.

 3[4] The pathogenesis of NEC is unknown, but is widely considered as a multi-factorial disease; prematurity, enteral feeding, intestinal hypoxia-ischemia, and bacterial colonization are considered major risk factors.

 [4] Researches showed that proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1.

 (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF- ) 5-711-13 and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor- (TGF- ) 8-1014-16 by intestinal epithelial cells is highly relevant to be involved in the final common pathway of pathogen of NEC.

In mature bowel, the intestinal environment is capable of producing an array of cytokines important in the development and control of inflammatory responses11 8.

 In contrast, the immaturity of the neonatal intestinal immune system is evidenced by decreased numbers of immune cells 12.

 Recently, it has bee thought that inappropriate, accentuated inflammatory response to colonizing pathogenic flora at premature gut plays a major role, the inflammatory cascade further promotes spread of bacteria or toxin, and end up with ischemia, necrosis and even perforation.

19 We and Bin-Nun had proved that probitics reduces the incidence and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm VLBW infants.

18 Nevertheless, there is no solid data in the literature as to the optima strains, timing, dosage and duration of probiotics administering to preterm VLBW infants at preset; and these need further investigate.

 Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are commonly found in breast-fed infants; 19 and most of the NEC in VLBW infants occurred before 6-8 weeks of age; 20 therefore, we hypothesized that early oral probiotics contains Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli fed to preterm VLBW infants for 6 weeks could reduce the incidence and severity of NEC.

 PATIENTS AND METHODS From July 1, 2005 to Dec 31, 2006, a prospective masked randomized control trial will be conducted at the level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of eight neonatal centers in Taiwan.

 Study is approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) of each hospital.

 Preterm VLBW infants (birth weight stage2) is made by two independent attending physicians who did not know the group assignment of the infant.

 Demographic and clinical variables that are potential risk factors for NEC were prospectively abstracted from the medical records.

 These factors included chorioamnionitis, prolonged rupture of amniotic membrane (PROM) >18 hours, pre-eclampsia, use of prenatal steroid, multiple -pregnancy, mode of delivery, gender, gestational age, birth weight, small for gestational age, Apgar score at 5 minutes, asphyxia, initial Hb, initial body temperature, use of surfactant, use of indomethacin, dosage of indomethacin, days of UAC and UVC, days of fasting, use of dopamine, days of antibiotics use, days of dopamine use, incidence and grading of IVH, incidence of pneumothorax, days of mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplement, days of TPN before and after NEC; weight gain per week, lengthy of stay are prospectively abstracted from the medical records.

 Primary outcome measurement was the incidence and severity of NEC ( stage2); and death.

 Secondary outcome were, culture proved sepsis, chronic lung disease, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) , weight gain per week, duration of TPN, lengthy of stay, cost effective analysis.

 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION AND STATISTICS According to the unpublished data of Premature Baby Foundation of Taiwan and Bravura of National Health Insurance (2003-2004), the recent data showed that the combined incidence of NEC (stage 2) or death for preterm VLBW infants was about 25 % for level III neonatal center in Taiwan.

 Setting the error at 0.

05 and error at 0.

1; and an absolute reduction of the incidence of NEC or death by 50%, the number needed to verify our hypothesis was 203 for each arm.

 Probiotics Reduce Incidence of Necrotizing Enterocolitis for Very Low Birth Weight Infants@highlight

We investigate the efficacy of probiotics in reducing the incidence and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) for very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.

A prospective, masked, multi-center randomized control trial will be conducted level III neonatal center to evaluate the beneficial effects of probiotics for NEC among VLBW (stage 2).
