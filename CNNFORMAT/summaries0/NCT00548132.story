(secondQuint)Reducing Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections in the ICU With a Chlorhexidine-Impregnated Sponge (BIOPATCH).

 At the time of the inception of this study, there were no published randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of the Biopatch in reducing bloodstream infections.

 Preliminary data has shown that the Biopatch decreases colonization of the catheter exit site and thereby decrease bloodstream infections but this was at that time only theoretical.

 Reducing Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections in the ICU With a Chlorhexidine-Impregnated Sponge (BIOPATCH)@highlight

We proposed to perform a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the effect of the use of a commercially-available chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge (Biopatch) as part of central venous catheter care on catheter-related bloodstream infections among patients in two Barnes-Jewish Hospital ICUs.
