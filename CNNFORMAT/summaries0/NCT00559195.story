(thirdQuint)Epoetin Beta in Treating Fatigue and Anemia in Patients Receiving Palliative Care for Malignant Solid Tumors.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the impact of epoetin beta on fatigue and quality of life of patients receiving palliative care for malignant solid tumors.

 Secondary - Evaluate the impact of epoetin beta on hemoglobin level (increase > 2 g/dL).

 OUTLINE: Patients receive epoetin beta subcutaneously once a week for up to 3 months.

 Fatigue, quality of life, and hemoglobin and reticulocyte levels are assessed every 4 weeks.
