(fifthQuint)A Randomized Study to Demonstrate the Safety and Feasibility of Plexisyl-AF in Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG).

 The purpose of this study is to investigate a non-surgical and non-destructive approach to providing a temporary, protective parasympathectomy as a means to reducing postoperative atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery.

 Applications of Plexisyl-AF will be placed in the cardiac fat pads as a means for creating a "non-destructive" cardiac denervation.

 This is a randomized assessment to demonstrate the safety of Plexisyl-AF in patients undergoing open heart surgery.

 Eligible patients will be those submitted to undergo open-chest CABG.

 Patients will receive Plexisyl-AF, administered via direct application to the SA nodal and AV nodal epicardial fat pads during the surgical procedure.

 Patients will be monitored for the occurrence of atrial fibrillation via the use of continuous cardiac monitoring for a period of 120 hours following surgery.

 Patients will return the clinic for brief follow-up, including electrocardiographic recordings, 10 days, 30 days and 90 days after the date of surgery.

 A Randomized Study to Demonstrate the Safety and Feasibility of Plexisyl-AF in Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)@highlight

The primary goal of this study is to assess the safety of Plexisyl-AF administered by direct application to the cardiac fat pads in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.

 Secondary goals of the study are to assess the potential response of Plexisyl-AF to reduce the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation and assess the performance of the electrostimulator device to confirm the location of the epicardial fat pads (nerves).

 The occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation will be monitored by continuous cardiac monitoring.
