(thirdQuint)Donor Natural Killer Cell Infusion in Preventing Relapse or Graft Failure in Patients Who Have Undergone Donor Bone Marrow Transplant.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To ascertain the safety of donor natural killer (NK) cells, generated from peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells, when given as a single intravenous infusion in patients who have undergone HLA-haploidentical familial donor bone marrow transplantation (BMT).

 - To determine the maximum tolerated dose of donor NK cells when given as a single infusion.

 Secondary - To determine the effectiveness of donor NK cell infusion in preventing tumor relapse and graft failure after HLA-haploidentical familial donor BMT.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive donor natural killer cells as a single infusion over 1 hour.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of natural killer cells until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients experience grade III toxicities or acute graft-vs-host disease.

RATIONALE: Giving donor natural killer cells to patients who have undergone donor bone marrow transplant may make the transplant work better and keep cancer cells from coming back.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of donor natural kill cells in preventing relapse or graft failure in patients who have undergone donor bone marrow transplant.
