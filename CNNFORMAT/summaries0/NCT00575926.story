(fifthQuint)Lingzhi for Cancer Children.

 Alternative and complementary medicine are widely used in treating children with cancers.

 A population-based survey in British Columbia revealed that they were used by 42% of the respondents.

 Among Chinese in Hong Kong, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is also widely practiced.

 Some 60% of the population had consulted TCM practitioners at one time or another.

 TCM use could be dated back to more than five thousand years ago, and written records were available for over two thousand years.

 TCM is considered to be an integral part of the Chinese culture.

 In our experience, TCM is believed to be commonly used to 'strengthen immunity and promote health' among local children with cancers, despite the lack of well-designed study to prove its usefulness.

 Ganoderma lucidum (Ling Zhi) is a mushroom long-used in China for a broad range of disorders.

 Its use is common in the general population and among both adults and children with a wide range of malignancies.

 However, there is no randomized controlled trial to support its clinical efficacy and safety.

 Therefore, we conducted this clinical trial of Ganoderma lucidum (Ling Zhi) among Hong Kong children with cancers.

 Lingzhi for Cancer Children@highlight

Ganoderma lucidum (Lingzhi) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine which is widely used as a means to 'strengthen immunity' among patients with cancers.

 However, there is no published randomized controlled clinical trial on its efficacy and safety despite the many in vitro studies on its anti-viral, anti-oxidative, anti-tumour, radioprotective, hepato-protective and immunomodulatory effects.

 This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel clinical trial that investigated the benefits and safety of Ganoderma lucidum (Lingzhi) in treating children with cancers.

 Patients were randomized to receive identical capsules of either Lingzhi or placebo for six months.

 The primary outcome was the general Paediatric Quality of Life score.

 Secondary outcomes included immune functions, infection-related morbidities, complete blood counts and serum biochemistry, and overall and event-free survival.
