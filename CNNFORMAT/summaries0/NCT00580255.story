(thirdQuint)Comparison Study of BNP and Thoracic Impedance Measurements on Arrhythmias.

 The primary aim of this study: 1.

 To assess the correlation between elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels and elevated thoracic impedance/body fluid index as measured by selective biventricular resynchronization devices and an external impedance cardiography device.

 2.

 Correlate impedance measurements and brain natriuretic levels with occurrence of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias as assessed by interrogation of biventricular devices.

It is hypothesized that elevated BNP level correlate with an elevated thoracic impedance/fluid index as measured separately by CRT-D devices and external impedance cardiography.

 Ultimately, it is also hypothesized that both BNP and thoracic impedance/fluid index measurements are predictive of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.
