(firstQuint)Deep Brain Stimulation in Patients With Parkinson's Disease.

 Patients who have had deep brain stimulation surgery for Parkinson's disease at Mayo Clinic Arizona will have electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements with the stimulator on followed by EEG measurements with the stimulator off.

 Patients who are scheduled to have deep brain stimulation surgery for Parkinson's disease will have EEG measurements before and after surgery.
