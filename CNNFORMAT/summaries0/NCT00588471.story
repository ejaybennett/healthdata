(secondQuint)Effect of Acute Statin Treatment in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

 The objective of this study is to determine if acute pretreatment with simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor will reduce the post inflammatory response after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), and/or change endothelial function as assessed by peripheral arterial tomography (PAT).

 Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), commonly known as coronary angioplasty or simply angioplasty, is a non-surgical procedure used to treat the stenotic (narrowed) coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary heart disease.

 Patients will be pretreated with simvastatin 80 mg prior to undergoing PCI.

 Endothelial function will be assessed before and after treatment via PAT.

 Our working hypothesis is patients pretreated with simvastatin, will have 1) attenuated inflammatory response, as noted by decreased levels of serum high sensitivity CRP and IL-6 and 2) improved endothelial function as compared to patients not pretreated with statin therapy.

 Effect of Acute Statin Treatment in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention@highlight

The goal of this study is to determine if one dose of simvastatin will decrease the inflammatory response to coronary intervention.

 Also to determine if one dose of simvastatin affects endothelial function (activity of the artery) as measured by noninvasive peripheral artery tonography.
