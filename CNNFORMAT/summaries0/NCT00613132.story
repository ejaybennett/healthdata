(fifthQuint)Ph I Gleevec in Combo w RAD001 + Hydroxyurea for Pts w Recurrent MG.

 This is open-label, single center, 1-arm ph I dose-escalation study of continuous, daily doses of imatinib mesylate & RAD001 administered orally in combination w fixed doses of hydroxyurea in adult pts w recurrent or relapsing glioblastoma multiforme.

 Study format includes classical "3+3" dose escalation design to determine MTD & DLT of imatinib mesylate + RAD001 when combined w hydroxyurea among GBM pts.

 Pts will be stratified based on whether they who are receiving EIACD & each stratum will independently dose escalate.

 Additionally, study will characterize safety, tolerability, biologic activity, & pharmacokinetic profile of this combo therapy.

 Ph I Gleevec in Combo w RAD001 + Hydroxyurea for Pts w Recurrent MG@highlight

Primary objective To determine maximum tolerated dose & dose limiting toxicity of imatinib mesylate & RAD001 when combined w fixed doses of hydroxyurea among pts w recurrent GBM who are on & not on enzyme-inducing anti-convulsants including pts not on anti-epileptic drugs Secondary objective To assess safety & tolerability of imatinib mesylate in combo w RAD001 & hydroxyurea in this population To characterize single-dose & repeated-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of imatinib mesylate & RAD001 combo therapy in this pt population.

 To assess antiangiogenic effects, pre- and post-treatment, of imatinib mesylate, RAD001 & hydroxyurea combo therapy, using DCE-MRI to evaluate changes in extent of vascular permeability, perfusion & relative tumor blood volume; to explore assessment of tumor cellularity & tumor cell death by changes in DWI-MRI as quantitated by apparent diffusion coefficient maps.
