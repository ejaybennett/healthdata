 Test allergens in 20 adult subjects per allergen with a clinical history of contact dermatitis and a positive patch test to the respective reference allergen.

 Evaluations will include: - Determination of the lowest concentration eliciting positive skin reactions (+1 or +2) in 70-90% of sensitive subjects.

 - Frequency of positive, negative, doubtful and irritant reactions for each allergen and tested concentration.

 - Concordance/discordance as compared to the corresponding reference petrolatum allergen.

 Secondary endpoint: To evaluate the safety of Disperse blue 106 and Bronopol T.

 Test allergens in 20 adult subjects per allergen with a clinical history of contact dermatitis and a positive patch test to the respective reference allergen.

 Evaluations will include: - The frequency of tape-induced irritation at the test site, incomplete panel adhesion, and subject-reported sensations of itching or burning.

 - The frequency and characterization of adverse events and serious adverse events.

 - The frequency and characterization of late and/or persistent reactions.

2 Allergens: Dose Response@highlight

We propose a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, randomized study comparing the diagnostic performance (primary) and safety (secondary) of 3 concentrations of Disperse blue 106 and 4 concentrations of Bronopol in 40 adult subjects (20 subjects per allergen) with a clinical history of contact dermatitis and a positive patch test (current or previous) to the corresponding reference petrolatum allergen ("sensitives").
