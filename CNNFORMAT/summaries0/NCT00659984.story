(fifthQuint)N2007-01: Ultratrace Iobenguane I 131 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory High-Risk Neuroblastoma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To establish the maximum tolerated dose of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (^131I-MIBG) in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

 Secondary - To describe toxicity following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

 - To estimate radiation absorbed doses to measurable lesions and to a standard set of normal organs following a 0.

1 mCi/kg [3.

7 MBq/kg] (minimum dose of 1.

0 mCi [37 MBq] but not to exceed 5.

0 mCi [185 MBq]) intravenous administration of ^131I-MIBG in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

 - To describe, within the confines of a phase IIa trial, objective tumor response following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

 - To explore dose-response following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

 - To explore quality of life assessment following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

 OUTLINE: - Dosimetry: Patients receive a dosimetric dose of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (^131I-MIBG) IV over 1-3 minutes.

 Patients then undergo 2 or 3 MIBG scans within 5 days of the dosimetry dose to assess biodistribution and tumor uptake.

 Patients with normal tumor uptake and biodistribution proceed to treatment.

 - Treatment: Within 1-4 weeks of the dosimetric dose, patients with normal tumor uptake and biodistribution receive a therapeutic dose of ^131I-MIBG IV over 1 hour on day 0 and undergo MIBG scan on day 7.

 Patients then proceed to autologous stem cell infusion.

 - Autologous stem cell infusion: Patients receive an infusion of autologous stem cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow on day 14.

 Patients with an ANC of mu l at any point after autologous stem cell infusion receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously once daily until ANC is > 2,000/ mu l.

 Patients complete a quality of life questionnaire at baseline and then at day 60.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at day 60 and periodically thereafter.

RATIONALE: Radioactive drugs, such as iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells.

 A bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplant using stem cells from the patient may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by I 131 MIBG.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of iodine I 131 MIBG followed by a stem cell transplant in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.
