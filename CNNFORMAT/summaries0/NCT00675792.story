 Undetected residual neuromuscular blockade is common in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).

 In fact, 16%-42% of patients receiving intermediate-acting muscle relaxants in the operating room have T4/T1 ratios <0.

 Respiratory and pharyngeal muscle function can be adversely affected during minimal neuromuscular blockade.

 Studies in awake volunteers and surgical patients have demonstrated that T4/T1 ratios of 0.

 The incidence and severity of residual neuromuscular blockade at the time of tracheal extubation will be evaluated to determine how these influence the length of stay in the operating room and PACU.

The primary purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade at the time of tracheal extubation after reversal of rocuronium bromide-induced neuromuscular blockade by 4 mg/kg sugammadex with that of 50 mu g/kg neostigmine.

 Residual neuromuscular blockade is defined as the fourth twitch to first twitch (T4/T1) ratio of < 0.
