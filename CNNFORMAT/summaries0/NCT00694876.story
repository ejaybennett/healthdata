(secondQuint)Impact of Health Literacy and Other Factors on Glaucoma Patient Adherence in South India.

 Many studies have shown the importance of health literacy on patient adherence in the United States (Juzych, M, et al.

, 2008; Muir, KW, et al.

, 2006).

 Low adherence in glaucoma patients leads to increased intraocular pressure, optic nerve damage, and blindness.

 To date, no research has been done with health literacy and patient adherence in the developing world.

 We will use TOFHLA and REALM to assess the health literacy of glaucoma patients in Tamil Nadu, India.

 We will also survey other demographic information and patient knowledge of glaucoma.

 This information will be compared with follow-up rates to identify barriers to patient adherence.

 Impact of Health Literacy and Other Factors on Glaucoma Patient Adherence in South India@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine how health literacy impacts glaucoma patient adherence (as measured by following up with the doctor) in Tamil Nadu, India.

 We hypothesize that individuals with better health literacy will have higher rates of follow-up with their ophthalmologist.
