(firstQuint)Assess Vitamin D Levels in Those With & Without Thyroid Cancer.

 Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine related malignancy, increasing in incidence in recent years.

 There are relatively few, well known factors, both genetic and environmental, which predispose to the development of thyroid cancer.

 Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with other cancers, but the association between vitamin D and thyroid cancer is unknown.

 We plan to do a case control, pilot study to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D levels and thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer in remission, and active thyroid cancer.
