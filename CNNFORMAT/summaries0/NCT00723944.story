(thirdQuint)A Study of the Performance of Certain Prevail Implants Used in Short Fixed Cases.

 This is a prospective, randomized-controlled study where patients with qualifying partial edentulism received a short fixed bridge restoration.

 Each implant site was randomized to receive either the test (Osseotite Certain Prevail) or the control non lateralized version of the Osseotite Certain implant.

 All implants were placed in a single-stage manner with temporary provisionalization taking place two months after implant placement.

 Enrollment continued until 10 patients (approximately 30 implants) were treated at each participating study center.

 A Study of the Performance of Certain Prevail Implants Used in Short Fixed Cases@highlight

This prospective, randomized study evaluates the performance and crestal bone changes difference between the Osseotite Certain Prevail vs the non-lateralized design of the implant.

 Study (null) hypothesis: the crestal bone changes that take place after placement and loading of the Osseotite lateralized implants will be the same as for similar but non-lateralized Osseotite Certain implants.
