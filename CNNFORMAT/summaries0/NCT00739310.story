(secondQuint)Study Assessing High-Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (HFCWO) in Preventing Pulmonary Exacerbations.

 This non-randomized home based pre-post intervention study.

 The study will compare the efficacy of Vest(R) therapy (HFCWO) for mucus secretion clearance in a population of patients with muscle weakness and restrictive lung disease with frequent pulmonary exacerbations.

 Enrolled subjects with a tracheostomy will be evaluated for microbial load and inflammatory status as a pilot evaluation of microbial load and inflammatory status outcomes.

 The total number of evaluable subjects to be recruited is estimated at 40.

 Subjects will be considered evaluable if they have completed at least 6 months of follow up.
