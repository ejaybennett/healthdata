(firstQuint)MarginProbe, a Device for Intraoperative Assessment of Margin Status in Breast Conservation Surgery.

 The study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double arm study demonstrating the effectiveness of the device in adjunctive use for locating the tissue for additional excision following primary specimen excision.

 One arm is a "Standard of Care" (SOC) Control group and the other arm a "Device+SOC" group.

In the "Device +SOC" group the surgeon will use the MarginProbe device on the tissue specimen removed during the surgical procedure.

The surgeon will use the results derived from the device and other routine assessments to decide if it is necessary to remove some additional breast tissue.
