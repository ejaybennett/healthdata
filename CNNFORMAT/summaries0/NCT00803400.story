(secondQuint)Efficacy of Aerobic Exercise Added to Alprazolam in Panic Disorder Treatment.

 We have observed in our clinical practice that patients who practiced aerobic physical exercise had faster remissions and better improvement in their treatments that those who did not.

 There are also some scientific studies that included physical exercise in the treatment for panic disorder and compared them to other single pharmacological treatments.

 So our objective will be to compare the efficacy of a pharmacological monotherapy (alprazolam), that is one of the options for the pharmacological treatment of panic disorder, with other treatment such as the combination of aerobic physical exercise and alprazolam, and to determine if this combination results in a better therapeutic response.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of aerobic physical exercise and alprazolam in patients with panic disorder has a better therapeutic response than the treatment with alprazolam alone.
