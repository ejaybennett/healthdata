(secondQuint)Implant for Augmentation of Cerebral Blood Flow Trial, Effectiveness and Safety in a 24 Hour Window.

 A multi-center, multinational, randomized, double blind, sham control, adjunctive to Standard of Care, parallel arm study and will include ongoing DSMB review of accumulated safety data.

 Screening: Since the treatment should be initiated within 24 hours from stroke onset, the screening window is limited and all procedures should be performed within this window.

Subjects with Acute Ischemic Stroke will be screened upon arrival to the hospital.

 Since the treatment should be initiated between 8 and 24 hours from stroke onset, the screening window is limited and all procedures should be performed as soon as possible.

 All screened patients will be identified by patient number and will sign the informed consent prior to any study procedure initiation.

 Period 1: Day 1-5 : Day 1- Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 (ISS Stimulation: Sham Control) ratio: - Group 1: Implantation and ISS Stimulation during five consecutive days & Standard of Care - Group 2: Sham Implantation and Sham Stimulation during five consecutive days & Standard of Care Subjects will be transferred to the implantation procedure facility and the implantation/sham implantation will be performed by a trained physician.

 Following implantation, stimulation/sham stimulation will be delivered.

 Day 2-4 ISS / Sham Stimulation will be repeated during the following four consecutive days by trained personnel within 18-26 hours from preceding stimulation.

 Day 5 / Day of Discharge.

 Following the last ISS /Sham Stimulation, explantation will be performed and the patients will be evaluated for safety and effectiveness.

 Subjects will continue with Standard of Care as needed and will be released from the hospital upon investigator's judgment.

 Period 2: Day of Discharge - 897 days During this period both groups (ISS Stimulation and Sham Control) will be treated according to Standard of Care either at the hospital, rehabilitation center or at home.

 Scheduled visits will be performed on day 307 and day 60 7, which will include safety and effectiveness assessments.

 Final Visit Day 907 days: The final visit will be performed at the study site and will include safety and effectiveness evaluations.

 Patients will be contacted by study personnel via telephone on Day 1807 and on Day 3607 in order to assess their quality of life status.
