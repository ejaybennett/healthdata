(fifthQuint)The Role of Apathy in Glycemic Control.

 The incidence of diabetes in the US is at epidemic proportions.

 A large number of diabetes patients in the VA system have uncontrolled diabetes with high HbA1c.

 The inability to carry out important self-care behaviors such as measuring blood sugars regularly, following diet, exercise and medication programs may be due to apathy.

 Apathy is the lack of motivation, persistence and novelty.

 We have found this to be very prevalent in the VA diabetes population.

 We now do a randomized placebo controlled trial to see if treatment of apathy with methylphenidate will improve glycemic control in patients with A1c >8.

 Treatment will be for 6 months.

 The primary end point is HbA1c.

 The Role of Apathy in Glycemic Control@highlight

In spite of several new medications and insulins for the control of blood sugars in patients with diabetes, a large number of patients do not have good control.

 This likely due to inability to carry out regular activities and self-care behaviors such as taking meds regularly, keeping a good diet, exercise etc.

 This inability to carry out self care lifestyle changes may be due to a condition called apathy.

 Apathy is a lack of motivation and persistence.

 In this study we will attempt to treat apathy with a medication called methylphenidate for 6 months and see if blood sugar/diabetes control improves.
