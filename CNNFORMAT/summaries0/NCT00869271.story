(secondQuint)Postoperative Folfox4 Only Versus Folfox4 Plus Transhepatic Arterial Chemotherapy (TAC) in the Treatment Unresectable Liver Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer.

 We administered three cycles FOLFOX4 plus on TAC (oxaliplatin, FUDR and MMC) or FOLFOX4 only to primary colorectal tumor resected patients with unresected liver metastasis.

 The study endpoints were resection rate of liver metastasis, progression-free survival, overall survival as evaluated by intent-to-treat analysis.
