(thirdQuint)Ultrasound Guidance Versus Electrical Stimulation for Continuous Popliteal-Sciatic Nerve Blocks.

 Specific Aim 1: To determine the relationship between perineural catheter placement technique (ultrasound-guidance and electrical stimulation) and quality of postoperative analgesia during continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks following moderate-to-severely painful orthopedic surgery.

 Hypothesis 1: When inserting a perineural catheter for a continuous peripheral nerve block, the use of electrical stimulation, as compared with ultrasound-guidance, is associated with decreased pain the morning following moderate-to-severely painful orthopedic surgery as measured with a numeric rating scale.

 Specific Aim 2: To determine the relationship between perineural catheter placement technique (ultrasound-guidance and electrical stimulation) and degree of sensory deficit during continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks following moderate-to-severely painful orthopedic surgery.

 Hypothesis 2: When inserting a perineural catheter for a continuous peripheral nerve block, the use of electrical stimulation, as compared with ultrasound-guidance, is associated with increased sensory deficit the day following moderate-to-severely painful orthopedic surgery as measured with a simple 0-10 scale (0=no numbness; 10=completely insensate) of the part of the foot with the greatest sensory deficit at the time of the data-collection phone call.

 Ultrasound Guidance Versus Electrical Stimulation for Continuous Popliteal-Sciatic Nerve Blocks@highlight

Research study to determine if pain relief following foot and/or ankle surgery is influenced by the technique used to place perineural catheter.

 The catheters are placed using ultrasound-guidance or nerve stimulation and the method is selected at random using a computer program.

 This may help to determine if one of these methods is associated with an increased success rate and incidence of foot numbness during the infusion.
