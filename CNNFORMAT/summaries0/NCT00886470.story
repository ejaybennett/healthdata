(thirdQuint)ACCS (Amnion-derived Cellular Cytokine Solution) Versus Standard Care In Treating Partial Thickness Burns.

 A Phase I/II multi-center clinical trial will be performed in 99 adults with partial-thickness burns.

 Two similar partial-thickness burn areas in a single patient will be selected.

 One burn will be randomly assigned to receive either test drug (ACCS) or normal saline in one of three treatment regimens.

 The three treatment arms will be: 1.

 ACCS 0.

01 mL/cm2 every 7th day vs.

 normal saline 0.

01 mL/cm2 every 7th day; 2.

 ACCS 0.

01 mL/cm2 every 4th day vs.

 normal saline 0.

01 mL/cm2 every 4th day; and 3.

 ACCS 0.

01 mL/cm2 every other day vs.

 normal saline 0.

01 mL/cm2 every other day.

 Two different preclinical studies of partial-thickness burns on guinea pigs have demonstrated accelerated epithelialization with topical treatment with ACCS.

 Similarly, preclinical studies in Yorkshire pigs have demonstrated more rapid maturity of epithelialization and better quality healing of partial-thickness skin graft donor sites with ACCS treatment.

 In the preclinical studies, ACCS given in a dose of 0.

01 mL/cm2 wound area appeared to saturate the wound adequately without excess and simultaneously improve healing.

 In preclinical toxicity studies, the dose of 0.

01 mL/cm2 was shown to be safe.

 ACCS (Amnion-derived Cellular Cytokine Solution) Versus Standard Care In Treating Partial Thickness Burns@highlight

The objective of this protocol is to perform a safety and dose-determination efficacy clinical trial in patients having a degree of partial-thickness burn wounds.

 The trial will be a prospectively randomized and double-blind trial of Amnion-derived Cellular Cytokine Solution (ACCS) compared with standardized care using 0.

9% NaCl (normal saline) solution in the same three treatment regimens.
