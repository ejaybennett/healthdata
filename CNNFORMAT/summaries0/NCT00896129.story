(thirdQuint)Mid-to Long-Term Outcomes in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) Patients With Complete Cytogenetic Response After Imatinib as First Line Therapy.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary: to investigate a number of mid to long-term HRQOL issues in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients with complete cytogenetic response treated with Imatinib as First Line Therapy.

 Secondary evaluation of: - Psychological wellbeing.

 - Fatigue.

 - Adherence to therapy issues.

 - Symptom burden.

 - Possible association between social-demographic and clinical variables with patient reported health outcomes.

 OUTLINE:This is a multicenter study.

 SAMPLE SIZE: Sample size estimation has not been performed considering the nature of the study and the lack of preliminary data to hypothesize the number of possible eligible patients in each center.

 DURATION OF THE STUDY: The recruitment period is estimated in approximately 6 to 12 months.

Rationale: At present, virtually no evidence exists regarding mid to long-term patient-reported health outcomes (e.

g.

, health related quality of life-HRQOL) of CML patients treated with Imatinib.
