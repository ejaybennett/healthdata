(thirdQuint)Laboratory Assay in Determining Cancer Resistance in Patients With Metastatic Cancer and in Healthy Participants.

 OBJECTIVES: - Optimize and standardize the in vitro cell kill assay using human white blood cells and human cancer cell lines from patients with metastatic cancer and from healthy participants.

 - Determine the results of the in vitro cell kill assay in patients with metastatic cancer and in healthy participants with no history of cancer.

 OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

 Peripheral blood is obtained from healthy participants and from cancer patients.

 Tissue is collected from archived samples.

 White blood cells are obtained from tissue and blood samples and are assessed by the in vitro cell kill assay.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients and 24 healthy participants will be accrued for this study.
