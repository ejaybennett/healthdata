(secondQuint)Hypofractionated Versus Standard Fractionated Whole Breast Irradiation to Node-negative Breast Cancer Patients.

 The randomization is between 50 Gy/25 fractions, 2.

0 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions weekly, and 40 Gy/15 fractions, 2.

67 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions weekly.

 The primary endpoint is late radiation morbidity; secondly, we want to investigate the frequency of local recurrences, and try to establish a genetic risk profile for development of late radiation morbidity.

 The hypothesis is that women operated with breast conserving strategy for early breast cancer can be offered moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy without developing more late radiation morbidity compared to standard fractionated radiotherapy.

 Hypofractionated Versus Standard Fractionated Whole Breast Irradiation to Node-negative Breast Cancer Patients@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate the difference in late radiation morbidity between hypofractionated and standard fractionated breast irradiation given to women operated with breast conservation for early breast cancer.
