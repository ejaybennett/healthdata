 Two prokinetic drugs (metoclopramide and erythromycin) will be compared during the administration of enteral nutrition in critically ill patients.

 We would like to know which one is the most effective in preventing regurgitation and risk of aspiration, which is a common complication of enteral nutritional support.

 This will be evaluated by measuring gastric residue every six hours.
