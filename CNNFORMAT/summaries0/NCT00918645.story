(thirdQuint)Calcium-41 (41Ca) Chloride Aqueous Solution in Diagnosing Patients With Prostate Cancer and Bone Metastasis.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To measure the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of calcium-41 (41Ca) chloride aqueous solution (^41Ca) over 18 months in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and bone metastasis.

 - To correlate the ^41Ca-tracer kinetics with time to disease progression, skeletal-related events, and death.

 Secondary - To correlate modulations in baseline urinary ^41Ca clearance with changes in clinically relevant disease parameters, including isotope bone scan data and PSA.

 - To combine bone turnover assessments with ^41Ca and collagen/bone cell biomarkers with clinical imaging techniques, especially isotope bone scans, to provide improved stratification of disease stage.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral calcium-41 (41Ca) chloride aqueous solution (^41Ca) on day 1.

 Some patients also receive oral calcium-46 (46Ca) chloride aqueous solution (^46Ca).

 Urine and blood specimens are collected periodically for 18 months.

 Blood samples are assayed for bone collagen residues, bone alkaline phosphatase, and PSA.

 Urine specimens are assessed for ^41Ca/Ca.

 Isotope bone scintigraphy is use to measure radioactivity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 3 years.

RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as radionuclide imaging using calcium-41 (41Ca) chloride aqueous solution, may help predict progressive disease in patients with prostate cancer and bone metastasis.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well calcium-41 (41Ca) chloride aqueous solution works in diagnosing patients with prostate cancer and bone metastasis.
