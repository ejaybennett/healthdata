(firstQuint)Benefits of Exchanging a Double Lumen Tube to a Proseal Laryngeal Mask or a Single Lumen Tube After a Thoracic Surgery.

 Intubation with a double lumen tube is often the preferred method to ensure isolation of the lung and proper exposition of the surgical site during thoracoscopies and thoracostomies.

 Unfortunately, because of the length and diameter of the double lumen tube, it is known to cause more irritation in the upper airways thereby inducing cough at emergence.

 In turn, cough has been associated with numerous multisystemic complications.

 Severe respiratory complications include laryngospasm or upper airway obstruction, desaturation, vocal cord injury, tracheal and bronchial ruptures.

 The purpose of this study is to determine whether exchange of the double lumen tube before emergence with a laryngeal mask airway (Proseal) or a tracheal tube will reduce cough at emergence.
