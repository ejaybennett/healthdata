(secondQuint)Ocular Imaging With Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography.

 Assessment of macular thickness is important for the treatment and follow-up of a variety of ocular diseases.

 The introduction of optical coherence tomography (OCT) has enabled clinicians to reliably detect small changes in macular thickness and to quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of different therapeutic modalities.

 In this study using the spectral domain-OCT, we examined the variations of macular retinal thickness and macular volume in normal eyes and in eyes with various ocular diseases.
