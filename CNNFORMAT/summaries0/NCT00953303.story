(secondQuint)The Effects of Glucocorticoids on Mortality and Renal Function in Patients With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure.

 Newly emerging clinical evidence showed glucocorticoids, when added to best conventional therapy, could produce potent diuretic effects, and improve renal functions in patients with decompensated congestive heart failure.

 It holds ture even in the patients who failed to respond to high dose of furosemide (>200mg/day).

 The present study is to confirm the clinical efficacy of glucocorticoids on cardiovascular mortality in patients with decompensated congestive heart failure who are on best conventional therapy.

 The Effects of Glucocorticoids on Mortality and Renal Function in Patients With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure@highlight

Evidence showed that glucocorticoids could induce potent diuretic actions and improve renal functions in patients with decompensated congestive heart failure.

 Thus we design this study to determine the efficacy of glucocorticoids on cardiovascular mortality in the 30 days following randomization.
