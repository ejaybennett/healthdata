(firstQuint)The RITAI Cohort: An Observational Study on Rituximab Off-label Use for Auto-immune Disorders.

 Every patient treated by rituximab off -label for auto-immune diseases in the public hospitals of the Midi-Pyrenees County (France) is eligible for the study, whatever the dose and the number of planned infusions.

 The enrollment is definitive at the time the first rituximab infusion begins.

 Follow-up visits are planned at months 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 after the first infusion.

 At each visit, the investigators will record the adverse events that have occurred since the last visit.

 Serious or unexpected adverse events will be systematically monitored and declared to the Pharmacovigilance.

 Imputability will be quoted according to the French method.

 A biological collection will be constituted to allow pharmaco- immunological studies.
