(firstQuint)Traction Assisted Polypectomy of the Intestine.

 We want to facilitate the ablation of lesions (polyps, adenomas) in the large (and small) intestine by using a traction assisted technique.

 The traction will be performed by using a haemoclip connected to surgical suture materials.

 The haemoclip will be fixed to the intestinal mucosa next to the lesion and a loop will be mounted to perform an endoscopic mucosal resection.

 The aim of the study is to show the feasibility of this technique.
