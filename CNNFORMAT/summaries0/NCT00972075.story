(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Circadin for Non-24 Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder in Totally Blind Subjects.

 This was a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a once-daily (QD) dose of Circadin cent 2 mg in subjects with non-24 hour sleep-wake disorder.

 Subjects were initially treated with placebo for 2 weeks and then were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive Circadin cent 2 mg or placebo for 6 weeks, followed by a 2-week washout period.

 The primary objective was to assess the effect of Circadin 2 mg given once daily for 6 weeks on total night sleep duration.

 Secondary objectives were other sleep variables recorded by the diary like sleep latency, daytime naps and sleep offset time.

 Other endpoints were CGIC score for Severity of Illness and Global Improvement and WHO (Five) Well-Being Index score.
