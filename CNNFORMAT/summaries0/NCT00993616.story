(fifthQuint)Belinostat and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer That Did Not Respond to Carboplatin or Cisplatin.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To estimate the antitumor activity of belinostat and carboplatin in patients with persistent or recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, measured by objective response rate and the frequency of progression- free survival at 6 months.

 II.

 To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of belinostat in combination with carboplatin in this cohort of patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive belinostat IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 3.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients who are clinically responding or who, in the opinion of their physician, would continue to benefit from treatment may continue treatment beyond 6 courses.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

 Belinostat and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer That Did Not Respond to Carboplatin or Cisplatin@highlight

This phase II trial is studying how well giving belinostat together with carboplatin works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that did not respond to carboplatin or cisplatin.

 Belinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving belinostat together with carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.
