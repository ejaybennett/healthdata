(secondQuint)STENTYS Self-expanding Versus Balloon-expandable Stent in Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).

 Stent strut malapposition and stent underexpansion are a common phenomenon in AMI as a result of the changing anatomy after an AMI has occurred (thrombus dissolution, resolution of spasm) with the traditional balloon-expandable stent treatment.

 A self-expanding stent might lead to better stent strut apposition as it follows the contours of the vessel wall due to its self-expanding properties.

 This might result into better long term clinical outcomes like lower thrombosis rates.

 STENTYS Self-expanding Versus Balloon-expandable Stent in Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)@highlight

Study hypothesis: the Stentys self-expandable Stent results into a better alignment of the struts to the vessel wall than a balloon-expandable stent within a few days after the procedure in acute myocardial infarction patients.
