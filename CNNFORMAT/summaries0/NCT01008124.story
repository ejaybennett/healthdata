(firstQuint)The Liberatory Maneuver for the Treatment of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV).

 BPPV is a problem with the inner ear that causes brief periods of vertigo triggered by changes in the position of the head such as rolling, looking up, or bending down.

 BPPV is presently thought to be caused by small pieces of debris or crystals becoming displaced within the inner ear.

 It can be treated by moving the patient through a series of positions called a maneuver.

 There are 2 different maneuvers currently used to treat BPPV by the clinician called the liberatory maneuver and the canalith repositioning procedure.

 We would like to determine how effective the liberatory maneuver is in the treatment of BPPV compared to a placebo maneuver.
