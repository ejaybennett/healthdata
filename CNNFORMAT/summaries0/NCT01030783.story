(thirdQuint)A Study to Compare Tivozanib (AV-951) to Sorafenib in Subjects With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.

 This is an open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-national, multi-center, parallel-arm trial comparing tivozanib to sorafenib in subjects with advanced RCC.

 The study is designed to compare the PFS, OS, ORR, DR, safety and tolerability, and kidney specific symptoms/health outcome measurements of tivozanib and sorafenib.

 Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to treatment with tivozanib or sorafenib and stratified by geographic region (North America/Western Europe, Central/Eastern Europe, or rest of the world); number of prior treatments (0 or 1); and number of metastatic sites/organs involved (1 or 2).
