(firstQuint)Repeat Dose Safety and Efficacy Study for Compound to Treat Anemia.

 Compound 1278863A is a novel small molecule agent, which stimulates erythropoiesis through inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylases (EGLNs).

 This compound is being developed for the treatment of anemia.

 This study, PHI112844, will be the first administration of compound 1278863A to investigate the pharmacodynamics/efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of repeat oral doses in anemic pre-dialysis patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in hemodialysis-dependent patients.
