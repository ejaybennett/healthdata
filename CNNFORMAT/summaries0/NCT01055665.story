(fifthQuint)Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Self-Efficacy, and Depression in Persons With Chronic Pain.

 Subjects will need to complete two questionnaires on admission and on discharge from the PRC program to measure self-efficacy and depression.

 The first is the Pain Self-Efficacy Scale (PSEQ) which is a measure of self-efficacy in persons with chronic pain.

 The second questionnaire is the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) which is a measure of depressive symptoms in persons with chronic pain.

 Both scales will also be used for clinical information.

 Persons who score 27 or higher on the CES-D will be approached for potential consent to this evidence based project.

 Each patient in the PRC will participate in up to 6 CBT sessions but only persons who, upon admission, score 27 or greater on the CES-D will be studied for any changes in scores from admission to discharge.

 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Self-Efficacy, and Depression in Persons With Chronic Pain@highlight

The investigators are exploring the role of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), a treatment for depression, on self-efficacy (feeling empowered to accomplish a given task) and depression in persons with chronic pain and depression.

 Past research has shown that persons with chronic pain show improvement in self-efficacy and depression scores when they are using CBT.

 The Pain rehabilitation Center (PRC) at Mayo Clinic is adding CBT focused groups to better understand the role of CBT on self-efficacy and depression in persons with chronic pain and depression.
