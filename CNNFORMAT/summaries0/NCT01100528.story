(fifthQuint)Dacarbazine and Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b in Treating Patients With Primary Uveal Melanoma With Genetic Imbalance.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess disease-free survival (DFS) with sequential dacarbazine and interferon-alfa-2b as an adjuvant to primary therapy for patients with uveal melanoma with genetic imbalance.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate side effects and assess safety in the patient population.

 II.

 Examine the relationship between the levels of plasma biomarkers of immune function and tumor invasion and the clinical outcome.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive dacarbazine IV on days 1 and 29.

 Beginning 4 weeks after the second dose of dacarbazine, patients receive recombinant interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously 3 times a week for 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Recombinant interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells.

 Giving interferon alfa-2b together with dacarbazine may be an effective treatment for primary uveal melanoma.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving dacarbazine together with recombinant interferon alfa-2b works in treating patients with primary uveal melanoma with genetic imbalance.
