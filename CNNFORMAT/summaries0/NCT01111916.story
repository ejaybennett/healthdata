(firstQuint)Development Study Using Vaginal Tactile Imager.

 Pelvic organ prolapse affects 40-50% of women in US.

 This study aims to establish a reliable examination procedure, collect data necessary for assessing the performance of Vaginal Tactile Imaging sensors, assess clinical suitability of interface software and correlate elasticity measurements with clinical examination findings for normal versus prolapse conditions of the female pelvis.
