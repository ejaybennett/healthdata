(secondQuint)Prospan Hustenzpfchen - Investigation on Efficacy and Tolerability in Children.

 After interim analysis of the first part the clinical study will be continued as follows: Double blind, placebo controlled, randomised, multi-centre study with 2-parallel groups for the treatment of acute bronchitis accompanied by coughing in children aged 0 - 6 years to demonstrate efficacy and safety of Prospan(R) Hustenzapfchen.

 For assessment of cough intensity and severity a specific symptom score has been developed, which gathers the child's frequency and severity of coughing and of cough productivity as well as the severity of rhonchi (each symptom will be assessed on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3; total score range: 0-12 points).

 Considering the specificities of the study population and the disease, confirmatory evaluation will be based on the change in the symptom score after the first three consecutive days of treatment as assessed by the investigator.
