(secondQuint)Comparison of Different Locations for Pulse Oximetry Probes in Cardiovascular (CV) Patients With Poor Peripheral Perfusion.

 A comparison study design will be used to evaluate the signal quality of pulse oximetry sensors placed in two locations: forehand and finger.

 Each subject will serve as their own control, with measurements of signal quality evaluated at 2 second intervals over a period of one hour.

 The measurements will be recorded simultaneously with a computer program and laptop computer.

 Finger and forehand sensors will be applied according to manufacturer's guidelines.

 An output connection will be made from each pulse oximeter computer unit to a password protected, laptop computer for data downloading.

 Data will be collected for a 1 hour period at 2 second increments and stored in the hard drive of the laptop.

 Following completion of data collection, the study sensors will be removed.

The purpose of this study is to determine if the forehand location for sensor placement has less episodes of signal dropout than the finger sensor location.

 In addition, this study will evaluate two finger sensors, which utilize different technology to compare signal quality.
