(firstQuint)Event-related Potentials in Management of Children With Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.

 The aims of this study are to explore the various cognitive impairments of ADHD children, to differentiate various subtypes of ADHD children, and to investigate the efficacy of anti-ADHD drugs on various cognitive performance of ADHD children by event-related potentials(ERP).

 Children, aged six to 18 years old, are enrolled and assigned to three groups (normal control, pure ADHD, and ADHD with comorbidities).

 ADHD children fulfill the DSM-IV-TR criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD.

 ADHD children are evaluated by Chinese version of SNAP-IV Rating Scale for rating ADHD-related symptoms before and after medication.

 EEG and audiometric testing are required for every participant to exclude dialeptic seizures and hearing impairment respectively.

 Methylphenidate (either immediate-release or extended-release formulations) or atomoxetine Hydrochloride is given to ADHD participants.

Continuous performance task (CPT) and ERP tasks are applied.
