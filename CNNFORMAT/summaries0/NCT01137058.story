(fifthQuint)Ubiquitous Healthcare for Elderly Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

 Recently, the application of internet-based glucose control system showed better long term glucose control compared to the conventional treatment.

 This study has become the foundation of web-based methodology in the glucose control.

 In addition, the combined application of mobile device and web-based monitoring system for chronic diseases showed improvement in various metabolic parameters in obese patients with diabetes and hypertension.

 Thus, the application of U-healthcare based on advanced information technology would be helpful in the diabetes management.

 We plan to provide an individualized U-healthcare service using advanced information technology that enables more effective glucose control.

 Ubiquitous Healthcare for Elderly Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus@highlight

Ubiquitous healthcare service for elderly patients with type 2 diabetes provides real-time glycemic monitoring and glucose control implemented by clinical decision support system (CDSS) using wire and wireless communication and information technology.

 To evaluate the clinical efficacy of this system, researchers plan to compare the improvement of glycemic control, self-management, and quality of life among three study groups: control, self glucose monitoring, and U-healthcare group.
