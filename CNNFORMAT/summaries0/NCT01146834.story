 Trial of Three Stem Cell Mobilization Regimens for Multiple Myeloma@highlight

This phase III randomized trial compares three different peripheral stem cell mobilization regimens for patients with multiple myeloma who have received primary induction therapy or other therapies.

 Up to 180 patients will be enrolled.

 Patients eligible for treatment will be randomized to one of the three following mobilization regimens: Arm A = VELCADE, CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, G-CSF Arm B = VELCADE & G-CSF Arm C = CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE & G-CSF
