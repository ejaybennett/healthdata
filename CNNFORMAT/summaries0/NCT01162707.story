(firstQuint)Wireless, Intermittent Monitoring of Right Heart Pressures in HF.

 The trial is designed to demonstrate that the CardioMEMS Sensor can be positioned in the right or left pulmonary artery, and that Sensor pressure measurements correlate to standardized methods of intra-cardiac pressure measurements post-sensor implant and at the 60 day visit.

 Safety will be monitored by the occurrence of adverse events throughout the trial.
