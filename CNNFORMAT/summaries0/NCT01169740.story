(secondQuint)Transcutaneous Measurement of Jaundice in the Newborn.

 Whenever a blood sample is drawn for measurement of bilirubin in a newborn, a transcutaneous measurement of skin yellow color will be made.

 Such measurements will also be included in all infants when a CRP-test (blood sample for C-reactive protein) has been ordered, as well as in connection with the routine blood sampling for metabolic screening.

 Only infants where parents have given written consent for their infant will be included in the study.

 Transcutaneous Measurement of Jaundice in the Newborn@highlight

Prospective comparison of measurement of bilirubin in jaundiced newborns by a transcutaneous device (bilirubinometer) and laboratory analysis of blood samples.

 We hypothesise that correlation of the two measurements depend on bilirubin level, gestational age as well as postnatal age.
