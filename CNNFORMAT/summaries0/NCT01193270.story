(thirdQuint)Vitamin E for Extremely Preterm Infants.

 Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) -- bleeding into the brain's ventricular system -- is one of the most common complications of prematurity, affecting an estimated 10-40% of very low birth weight (-tocopheryl acetate), given intragastrically to preterm infants -tocopherol levels in the target range of 1-3 mg/dl.

 Based on the results of this pilot, a Phase III randomized control trial will be developed to test whether a single dose of vitamin E can reduce the incidence of death or neurodevelopmental impairment at 18-22 months corrected age in these preterm infants.

 Most intraventricular hemorrhages occur in the first 72 hours after birth.

 Because of this, to prevent IVH, it must be given as soon as possible after birth.

 Eligible, consented infants will be assigned to either a vitamin E group or a placebo group.

 Infants in the vitamin E group will receive 1.

0 ml/kg of dl--tocopheryl acetate (Aquasol E(R)); infants in the placebo control group will receive a similar amount of sterile water.

 The dose will be given within 4 hours of birth via a tube into the stomach.

 Blood samples will be taken from all infants before the dose is given, 24 hours after dosing, and 7 days after dosing to measure how well the vitamin E is absorbed into the bloodstream.

 Vitamin E for Extremely Preterm Infants@highlight

The purpose of this pilot trial is to test the safety and efficacy of administering one dose of vitamin E, via a tube into the stomach, to extremely preterm infants (less than 27 weeks gestation and less than 1000 grams birth weight).

 This pilot will examine whether a single dose of vitamin E will be absorbed into the infants' bloodstreams with resulting serum -tocopherol level in the target range of 1-3 mg/dl.
