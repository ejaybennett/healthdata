(thirdQuint)Development of A Technique to Predict Antidepressant Responsiveness in Depressive Patients.

 The purpose of this study is 1.

 to determine whether serotonin transporter genotypic or functional differences between depressive patients and normal controls were existed.

 2.

 to determine the relationship between serotonin transporter polymorphisms and serotonin transporter functional expression.

 3.

 to determine whether genomic or functional differences between drug responders and nonresponders predict the response of antidepressant.

 Development of A Technique to Predict Antidepressant Responsiveness in Depressive Patients@highlight

First, the investigators examined the functional relevance of serotonin transporter polymorphisms by quantifying the activity of serotonin transporter in blood platelets of genotyped healthy volunteers and patients with major depression.

 Second, the investigators studied response to SSRIs in relation to 5-HTTLPR genotype and also to the functional expression of 5-HTT in platelets.
