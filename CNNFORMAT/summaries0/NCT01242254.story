(firstQuint)A Study Assessing the Safety and Efficacy of Multiple Intravitreal KH902 in Patients With CNV Due to AMD.

 Due to conclusions of KH902 Ia study: Doses of single intravitreal injection of a recombinant human VEGF receptor-Fc fusion protein (KH902) in patients with CNV secondary to neovascular AMD are from 0.

05 mg to 3.

0 mg.

 The trial shows that KH902 is safe and tolerable, and no DLT, ophthalmia reaction, endophthalmitis, or systemic AE relevant to the drug is reported, and the main AEs are transient ocular tension increase and micro-hemorrhage in injection site.

 KH902 appears to produce rapid clinical effects on VA, supported by improvements in anatomical features, in patients with neovascular AMD.

 HOPE Study is an open label, multi-center, randomized, uncontrolled dose-and interval-ranging phase Ib study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of multiple intravitreal injection of KH902 at variable dosing regimen in patients with CNV due to AMD.

 Two groups of patients will initially receive intravitreal administration of KH902 following the randomization: 1.

 Patients in group A will receive monthly intravitreal injections of KH902 for 3 times successively at a dose of 0.

5 mg/50 1/2l/eye; 2.

 Patients in group B will receive monthly intravitreal injections of KH902 for 3 times successively at a dose of 2.

0 mg/50 1/2l/eye.

 Following the initial 12-week fixed-dosing phase of the trial: Patients in group A and group B will continue to receive monthly intravitreal injections of KH902 with 0.

5 mg/50 1/2l/eye or 2.

0 mg/50 1/2l/eye as same as the doses he/she received during the fixed dosing phase, on an as needed (PRN) dosing schedule, based upon the need for re-treatment in accordance with pre-specified criteria up till week 52.
