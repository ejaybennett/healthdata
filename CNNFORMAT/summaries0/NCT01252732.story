(secondQuint)Oritavancin Versus IV Vancomycin for the Treatment of Patients With Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infection.

 This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, comparative efficacy and safety study of single-dose IV oritavancin/IV placebo versus IV vancomycin for 7 to 10 days in adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) suspected or proven to be caused by Gram-positive pathogens.

 Approximately 960 patients will be randomized at 100 centers globally.

 In addition, this study will characterize the PK and PK/PD properties of a single 1200 mg IV dose of oritavancin and evaluate the potential health economic benefits offered by this dosing strategy.
