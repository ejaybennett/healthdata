Cat allergy is an increasingly prevalent condition, affecting 10-15% of patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma.

 The purpose of this optional observational follow-on study is to further evaluate rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms on exposure to cat dander in the EEC among subjects who completed all dosing visits in study CP005 approximately one year after the start of treatment.
