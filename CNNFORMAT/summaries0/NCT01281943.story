(firstQuint)Study of Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin and Temsirolimus in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Cancer.

 This proposal aims to capitalize on the consensus recommendations of the NCI panel, the known antitumor activity of doxorubicin in HCC, and the as yet unpublished results of a recently completed Phase I clinical trial (WU HRPO# 07-0447, NCT00703170) combining pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil(R)) and temsirolimus (Torisel(R)) in patients with advanced solid tumors.

 In this Phase I study, twenty-two patients were enrolled and treated.

 The MTD and recommended Phase II dose for the combination regimen from this trial is is Doxil 25mg/m2 IV Q 4 weeks and temsirolimus 25mg IV Q week.

 During the conduct of this study two patients experienced confirmed partial responses (PR).

 One patient had heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer and remained on the study for 6 months.

 The second patient with a PR had HCC that was previously treated with sorafenib.

 She remained on the study regimen for 14 months and tolerated this treatment well.

 Based on the tolerability of the drug combination and the observed anti-tumor activity in HCC, the current Phase II study in HCC is proposed.

This Phase II study will use the MTD from a previous Phase I study at the recommended dose for the combination regimen from the Phase I trial, Doxil 25mg/m2 IV Q 4 weeks and temsirolimus 25mg IV Q week.
