(fifthQuint)Gliadel Wafer and Fluorescence-Guided Surgery With 5-ALA Followed by Radiation Therapy And Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Primary Glioblastoma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To establish that the combined use of 5-ALA and Gliadel wafers during fluorescence-guided radical brain tumor resection is safe and does not compromise patients with primary glioblastoma from receiving or completing adjuvant standard radiotherapy plus temozolomide.

 Secondary - To gather preliminary evidence that the combined use of 5-ALA and Gliadel wafers at surgery has the potential to improve clinical outcome, via measurement of time to clinical progression.

 - To gather preliminary evidence that this regimen at surgery has the potential to improve clinical outcome via measurement of survival at 24 months.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Gliadel wafers are applied to resection cavity immediately after 5-ALA fluorescence-guided radical brain tumor resection.

 After recovery from surgery (within 6 weeks of surgery when possible ), patients receive adjuvant chemoradiotherapy comprising standard radiotherapy and temozolomide.

 Tumor biopsy and blood sample may be collected at time of surgery for retrospective MGMT status analysis.

 After surgery, patients are followed up at post-surgical visits, during subsequent therapy at routine clinic visits, and at 12, 18, and 24 months.

 Gliadel Wafer and Fluorescence-Guided Surgery With 5-ALA Followed by Radiation Therapy And Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Primary Glioblastoma@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as Gliadel wafer and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.

 Giving radiation therapy and temozolomide after surgery and Gliadel wafer may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of fluorescence-guided surgery with 5-ALA given together with Gliadel wafer, followed by radiation therapy and temozolomide, in treating patients with primary glioblastoma.
