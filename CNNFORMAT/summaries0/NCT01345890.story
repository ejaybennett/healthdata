 Aspiration could have fatal complication especially in post stroke dysphagia.

 The aim of this study is to improve post stroke dysphagia using electrical stimulation of mylohyoid muscles.

 The investigators measure swallowing time before and after electrical stimulation, performed one hour per day, 5 consecutive days during paste consistency swallowing.
