(firstQuint)Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in Cemented Versus Cementless Hip Resurfacing.

 Recent research is inconclusive regarding the degree to which the density or strength of the bone around the hip implant is preserved following a hip resurfacing system.

 Certainly, there are many factors which contribute to the preservation of bone mineral density - we are studying the role of cement.

 More specifically, we are trying to compare outcomes between patients who receive the cementless Cormet Hip Resurfacing System to those who receive the cemented CONSERVE(R) Plus Total Resurfacing Hip System.

 Therefore, the primary purpose of the current study is to compare the bone mineral density between the cementless and cemented hip resurfacing systems.

 We are also comparing patients who receive these two different hip systems in terms of their x-rays and how they are managing with their hip.
