(firstQuint)Effect of HCO1100 on Cardiovascular Function.

 Cardiovascular events are the leading cause of the increased mortality rate of chronic dialysis patients.

 It is believed that increased micro-inflammation plays an important role in the pathophysiological process of cardiovascular disease.

 High porous dialysis membranes can better eliminate inflammatory mediators as compared to standard dialysis membranes.

 In this study, the high porous dialysis membrane HCO1100 is investigated for its potential capability to improve the cardiovascular status of chronic dialysis patients.
