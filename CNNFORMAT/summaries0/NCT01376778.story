(fifthQuint)A Randomized Trial to Prevent Congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV).

 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common congenital infection, with approximately 44,000 congenitally infected infants in the U.

S.

 per year.

 A substantial proportion of these infants will die or suffer permanent injury as a result of their infection.

 The severity of congenital infection is greatest with primary maternal CMV infection.

 Currently, there is no proven method of preventing congenital CMV infection, and the approach to primary maternal CMV infection in the United States is haphazard and ineffective.

 One small, non-randomized study suggests that maternal administration of CMV hyperimmune globulin may significantly reduce the rate of congenital CMV infection following maternal primary infection.

 The MFMU CMV Trial will address the primary research question: does maternal administration of CMV hyperimmune globulin lower the rate of congenital CMV infection among the offspring of women who have been diagnosed with primary CMV infection during early pregnancy? The research study is funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).

 Fourteen medical centers across the country are participating in this research study.

 In all, 800 pregnant women who are identified with a primary CMV infection will be enrolled in this research study.

 The children of these women will be evaluated and tested at one and two years of age.

 A Randomized Trial to Prevent Congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV)@highlight

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that usually presents with few if any side effects.

 When first infected, some people may have symptoms similar to mononucleosis (i.

e.

, fatigue, weakness, fever, swollen glands).

 Most people in the United States are infected during childhood or as adults if they work around children.

 Pregnant women, who have not been infected with CMV in the past and become infected during pregnancy (i.

e.

 a primary infection), may cause their babies to get infected with CMV.

 Babies that are infected may develop permanent disabilities including hearing loss and a small portion will die from the infection.

 Currently it is not routine practice to screen pregnant women for CMV infection.

 Additionally, there is no agreement about how to evaluate and manage pregnant women infected with CMV for the first time.

 There is also no evidence that treatment is beneficial for the baby.

 The purpose of this research study is to determine whether treating pregnant women who have a primary CMV infection with CMV antibodies will reduce the number of babies infected with CMV.
