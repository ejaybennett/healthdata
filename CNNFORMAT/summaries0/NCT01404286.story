(fifthQuint)Resistance Training and Sleep in the Elderly.

 Upon completion of the baseline polysomnography (PSG), volunteers underwent body composition evaluations (total body mass, height and body mass index calculation) to characterize the sample.

 Three familiarization sessions were conducted with the exercise machines used in the study, and one repetition maximum test (1 RM) was completed in order to quantify the training session load.

 A PSG test was conducted on the same day of the exercise session for the resistance group, and the control group had a second PSG without exercise to compare the groups at both times.

 The body composition assessment, the adaptations to the exercises and the training sessions were held at the Center for Psychobiology and Exercise Studies.

 Resistance Training and Sleep in the Elderly@highlight

Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of a session of resistance training on the sleep patterns of elderly people.

 Methods: Forty men aged 65 to 80 years, sedentary and clinically healthy were divided into two groups: the control group (n=18) and the resistance group (n=22).

 Both groups underwent two polysomnography tests, one at baseline and another after either a resistance training session (One Repetition Maximum - Strength Test, resistance group) or without physical exercise (control group).
