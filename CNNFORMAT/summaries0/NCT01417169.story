(secondQuint)Micafungin Prevention Study for Invasive Fungal Disease in Pediatric & Adolescent Patients Undergoing Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate absence of proven, probable, possible, suspected invasive fungal disease (IFDs) through the end of prophylaxis therapy and during 4 weeks after stopping of micafungin prophylaxis after Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in pediatric and adolescent neutropenia patients.

 Patients will receive micafungin until the earliest of the following: 1) neutrophil engraftment; 2) development of proven, provable, possible or suspected invasive fungal disease; 3) development of unacceptable drug toxicity; 4) withdrawal from study participation or discontinuation of study treatment.

 Safety profile of micafungin is also evaluated.
