(firstQuint)Maternal Singing During Kangaroo Care in Preterm Infants.

 Maternal singing to preterm infants during Kangaroo Care intervention, is it beneficial? Protocol Maternal voice is a predominant source of multimodal stimulation for the developing fetus that is largely lost for the preterm infant amidst the unfiltered levels of auditory stimuli in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

 These elevated levels of auditory stimulation in the NICU can interfere with an infant's sleep and have a negative effect on vital signs and oxygen saturation.

 Common sources of sound for the preterm infant are derived from routine incubator noise, monitoring alarms, and the speech sounds of healthcare team, all of which they would not typically encounter if life in the uterus had continued to term.

 In the midst of these additional sounds, preterm infants lose significant contact with an auditory stimulus they would typically be exposed to until full-term birth (their mothers' voice).

 Skin to skin contact care (Kangaroo care) was found to produce cardiorespiratory stability, decrease apneic and periodic breathing, and improve sleep patterns and weight gain in preterm infants.

 This technique has also been shown to help mothers of preterm infants to develop and strengthen self-confidence and attachment behaviors, leading to reduced stress response.

 Live music was shown to have a beneficial effect on psychophysiological responses in both mothers and preterm infants during their stay in the NICU.

 Aim: To evaluate the combined influence of live maternal singing during kangaroo care (KC) on maternal anxiety and stable preterm infants' responses.

 Participants Inclusion criteria clinically stable infants postmenstrual age 8 seconds) and a self-report questionnaire comprising 20 descriptive statements for measuring maternal anxiety symptoms (state-trait anxiety inventory [STAI] scale will be used at the beginning and the end of each intervention.

 Higher scores indicate greater anxiety, with a possible score of 20 to 80 points.

 Additional maternal measures will be age, ethnicity (Arab/Jews), education (8 years, elementary school; 8-12 years, high school; and >13 years, college/university degree), and affinity for music (a 5-point scale: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours, measuring the length of time spent a day listening to music).

 Data will be recorded by a single physician who will remain at the bedside throughout each session.

 Data will be analyzed in a blinded fashion another researcher who will be unaware of treatment allocations.

 Power Analysis: To achieve a power of 0.
