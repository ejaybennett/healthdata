(firstQuint)Insulin Sensitivity, Impaired Counterregulation, and Glucose Variability.

 The principal idea of the proposed research is: in order to be successful, closed-loop control of glucose in diabetes must adapt to individual physiologic characteristics and to the behavioral profile of each person.

 We propose to build a system that will use observers of patients' behavior and metabolic state and control modules that are responsible for insulin delivery and hypoglycemia prevention.

 In this phase of the project, we will investigate relationships of insulin sensitivity and impaired counterregulation with blood glucose variability, aiming to develop algorithmic physiology observers, which will track specific parameters of glucose variability and recurrent hypoglycemia as markers of change in a person's insulin sensitivity and counterregulatory ability.

 Insulin Sensitivity, Impaired Counterregulation, and Glucose Variability@highlight

This protocol will investigate physiological parameters including insulin sensitivity and counterregulatory function using a mixed meal test and induced hypoglycemia in subjects with type I diabetes.
