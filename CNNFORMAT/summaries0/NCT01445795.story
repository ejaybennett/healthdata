(secondQuint)Safety Study of INX-08189, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic With Ribavirin and Food Effect Study, in Chronically-infected Genotype 1 Hepatitis C Virus, Treatment-nave Subjects.

 Primary Objectives: To evaluate in chronically-infected, non-cirrhotic, genotype 1 treatment naive-subjects dosed with Study Drug for 7 consecutive days Safety - The safety of each of the 4 dosing cohorts of INX-08189 (200 mg daily (QD), 100 mg twice a day (BID), 100 mg QD with low-fat meal, and 100 mg QD with adjunctive ribavirin).

 Pharmacokinetic - To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of oral doses of INX-08189 (200 mg QD, 100 mg BID, 100 mg QD with low-fat meal, and 100 mg QD with adjunctive ribavirin) and the PK profile of the metabolite (INX-08032).

 Pharmacodynamic - To evaluate the relationship between the kinetics of the reduction from baseline in serum HCV RNA and PK parameters of INX-08189 and the metabolite INX-08032 Efficacy - To measure the kinetics of viral load reduction in plasma HCV RNA by each of the 4 dosing cohorts of INX-08189 (200 mg QD, 100 mg BID, 100 mg QD with low-fat meal, and 100 mg QD with adjunctive ribavirin).
