(thirdQuint)Clinical Study Comparing the New Immunosuppressive Drug Gusperimus With the Conventional Treatment in Wegener's Granulomatosis.

 Wegener Granulomatosis without treatment is life-threatening.

 The standard treatment with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide is usually effective at controlling active disease.

 However, disease relapse is frequent and requires increased exposure to these toxic drugs.

 In other patients initiation or continuation of these standard drugs is contraindicated due to intolerable side effects.

 No well-established therapy is available for relapsing patients.

 They may suffer severe organ damage due to progressive disease, or may die.

 The proposed indication for gusperimus is the treatment of relapsing Wegener Granulomatosis.

 The aim of therapy with gusperimus is to induce and maintain remission thereby avoiding further cyclophosphamide and reducing corticosteroid exposure.

The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy (superiority testing) of gusperimus compared to conventional treatment in patients with a relapse of Wegener Granulomatosis with or without ongoing steroids, and/or immunosuppressive therapy.

 Further, to evaluate the safety and quality of life of gusperimus treatment compared to standard treatment in patients with relapse of Wegener Granulomatosis receiving glucocorticoids.
