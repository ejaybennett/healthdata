 This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteers and study staff), single-center study to evaluate the oral bioavailability (ie, absorption and distribution within the body) and pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of a single dose of 1 fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet of canagliflozin and metformin IR (abbreviated as 1 CANA/MET IR FDC tablet) when taken by healthy volunteers without food (in a fasting state) or with food (in a fed state).

 Healthy volunteers participating in the study will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive Treatment A (1 CANA/MET IR FDC tablet taken by healthy volunteers in a fasting state) followed approximately 14 days later by Treatment B (1 CANA/MET IR FDC tablet taken by healthy volunteers in a fed state) or Treatment B followed approximately 14 days later by Treatment A.
