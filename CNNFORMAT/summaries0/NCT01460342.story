(secondQuint)Phase 3 Study of Tadalafil Once-Daily in Asian Men With Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH).

 Tadalafil is being investigated as a treatment for men with signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH; also referred to as urinary disturbance or BPH-LUTS (BPH-lower urinary tract symptoms)] in Japan and overseas.

 Overseas studies and the Japanese dose-finding study LVIA (NCT00783094) identified tadalafil 5 mg once-daily as the recommended dose.

 The long-term safety and maintenance of effect was confirmed in the open-label extension of study LVIA.

 The risk-benefit profile was further studied in the Asian study LVHB (NCT00861757).

 This study, LVJF, is to confirm the efficacy and safety of tadalafil 5 mg once-daily in Asian men with BPH-LUTS.
