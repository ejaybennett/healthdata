(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Trans Sodium Crocetinate (TSC) With Radiation and Temozolomide in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma.

 The overall objectives of this Phase 1/2 clinical study in newly diagnosed GBM patients was to evaluate the safety and tolerability, efficacy, PK profile, PFS/time to disease progression, QoL, and overall survival in adults when TSC is added to the standard of care regimen of radiation therapy and temozolomide.

 All patients received TSC in this study.

 The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of the study was to evaluate the safety (DLT rate) and to define the dosing regimen of TSC for the larger Phase 2 study.

 The primary clinical endpoint was overall survival at 24 months and patients will be followed for up to 3 years.
