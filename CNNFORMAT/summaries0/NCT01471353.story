(firstQuint)Sorafenib Plus Capecitabine (SorCape) in Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

 The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is an important mediator of responses to growth factors, and a strong inducer of genes involved in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

 Inhibition of this pathway has been previously proven to be highly clinically beneficial for patients with this disease.

 It has also been clearly demonstrated that the inhibition of VEGF, when coupled with cytotoxic therapy and/or continued beyond initial response, can improve clinical outcomes and survival in this same cohort of patients.

 Safety and pharmacokinetic data have already been established for this novel doublet oral chemotherapy.

 This study is intended to determine the activity of a combination of oral fluoropyrimidine plus sorafenib in an advanced mCRC patient population for whom limited treatment options remain.

Combining Sorafenib with standard cytotoxic fluoropyrimidine therapy for advanced colorectal cancer may provide clinical benefit when no other treatment remains.
