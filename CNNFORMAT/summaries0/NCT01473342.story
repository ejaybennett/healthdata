(secondQuint)Mila Blooms Intervention Study.

 While successful advancements in treatment for childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) have resulted in a growing cohort of survivors, these survivors are at risk for a number of long-term health problems.

 This study proposes to develop and conduct feasibility testing for a smartphone application that would deliver a health behavior intervention to this population.

 A formative phase focused on intervention and software development will be followed by a pilot/feasibility test of the intervention.

 Participants in the intervention will receive a customized study-designed mobile phone app with a social networking component in which users will be able to support one another.

 They will also receive personal support from a health counselor to help set goals and discuss areas of concern.
