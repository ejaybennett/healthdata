(secondQuint)A Study of the Safety and Activity of the MEK Inhibitor Given Together With the AKT Inhibitor to Patients With Multiple Myeloma or Solid Tumor Cancers.

 This is an open-label, two part, Phase I/II study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of the MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 administered in combination with the AKT inhibitor GSK2110183 in subjects with solid tumors and multiple myeloma.

 In Part 1, the safety and tolerability of a range of doses for GSK1120212 and GSK2110183 dosed in combination will be investigated; pharmacokinetics will also be analyzed to determine whether there is a drug-drug interaction between GSK1120212 and GSK2110183 when dosed in combination.

 The second part of the study will focus on evaluation of the clinical efficacy of the combination as well as the pharmacodynamic response in subjects with proteasome-refractory multiple myeloma (Part 2A) or solid tumors, putatively endometrial and triple negative breast cancer (Part 2B).
