(secondQuint)Risk of Hepatitis B Reactivation After Bone Marrow Transplantation With Prior Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Exposure.

 Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been documented in bone marrow transplantation recipients who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative but with serologic evidence of prior exposure to HBV.

 However detailed prospective studies documenting the incidence of reactivation and the virologic and serologic kinetics of reactivation are lacking.

 The investigators prospective study proposes to follow-up 50 such bone marrow transplant recipients with all serologic and virologic parameters monitored every 4 weeks.

 Patients with detectable HBV DNA will be started on nucleoside analogue therapy.

 The optimal method and duration of monitoring will also be determined from our study.

 Risk of Hepatitis B Reactivation After Bone Marrow Transplantation With Prior Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Exposure@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether preemptive nucleoside analogue therapy or regular virologic monitoring is the preferred method in management patients with prior exposure to hepatitis B vius (HBV) and undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
