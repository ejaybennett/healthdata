(thirdQuint)Alisertib (MLN8237) or Investigator's Choice in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma.

 The drug being tested in this study was Alisertib.

 Alisertib was tested to treat people who have relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).

 This study evaluated alisertib for the improvement in overall response rate (ORR) compared with single-agent treatment, as selected by the investigator from the offered options of pralatrexate, romidepsin (US only), or gemcitabine, in participants with relapsed or refractory PTCL.

 The study enrolled 271 patients.

 Participants were randomized (1:1) to one of 2 treatment arms: - Alisertib - Investigator's choice (Pralatrexate, Romidepsin, or Gemcitabine) This multi-center trial was conducted worldwide.

 The overall time to participate in this study was approximately 5 years.

 Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and then were contacted by telephone up to 42-months after the last participant was randomized, or until death, for follow-up assessment.
