 Prolonged or Standard Infusion of Cefepime Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Febrile Neutropenia@highlight

This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well giving prolonged infusion compared to standard infusion of cefepime hydrochloride works in treating patients with febrile neutropenia.

 Giving cefepime hydrochloride over a longer period of time may be more effective than giving cefepime hydrochloride over the standard time.
