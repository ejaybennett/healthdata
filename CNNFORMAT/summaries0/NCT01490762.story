(firstQuint)Healthy Normal Volunteers Looking at Exposure and Effects of Multiple Doses of Technosphere Insulin (TI) Using the Gen2C Inhaler.

 Healthy Normal Volunteers will be randomized to a sequence of 4 different doses of Technosphere(R) Insulin (TI), inhaled using the Gen2C device, and one dose of subcutaneously injected Regular Human Insulin.

 A euglycemic clamp procedure will be performed at each dosing visit.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the insulin dose proportionality/linearity of Technosphere(R) Insulin (TI) Inhalation Powder based on the AUCo-180 after administration of the following doses using the Gen2C inhaler: - 10 U (one 10 U cartridge) - 30 U (one 10 U and one 20 U cartridge) - 60 U (three 20 U cartridges) - 80 U (four 20 U cartridges).
