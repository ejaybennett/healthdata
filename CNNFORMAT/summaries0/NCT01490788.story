(fifthQuint)Comparative Bioavailability of TNX-102 and Cyclobenzaprine and Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of TNX-102 in Healthy Adults.

 Very low dose (VLD) cyclobenzaprine at bedtime has shown promise as a treatment for fibromyalgia, but the chemistry of cyclobenzaprine requires new formulation technology for bedtime use.

 Employing a proprietary mixture of approved lipids with cyclobenzaprine, TNX-102, is designed to provide predictable absorption of cyclobenzaprine and to result in increased dosage precision and decreased potential for morning grogginess.

 As a first step in the development of TNX-102 in the treatment of fibromyalgia, the present single-center, randomized, open-label, single-dose, three-way-crossover trial is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of TNX-102 2.

4 mg (a dose based on the results of a previous Phase 2a, proof-of-concept study - VPI-CY-0001.

1) and to compare the rate and extent of absorption of TNX-102 2.

4 mg and cyclobenzaprine 5 mg tablets under fasting or fed conditions.
