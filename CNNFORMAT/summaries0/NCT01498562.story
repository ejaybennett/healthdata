(firstQuint)Phase II Study of Gefitinib Plus Nimotuzumab Versus Gefitinib in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 Reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as gefitinib, were shown to be effective in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 However, patients almost invariably develop resistance to TKIs and have disease progression.

 Nimotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the EGFR.

 Combining nimotuzumab to gefitinib may not only potentiate cellular cytotoxicity, but may also assist in overcoming inherent or acquired resistance to gefitinib alone.
