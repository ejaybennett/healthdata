(firstQuint)The Efficacy of Trachway (R) Intubating Stylet in the Insertion of the Double Lumen Endobronchial Tube.

 Intubation with the double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) remains a great challenge for anesthesiologists.

 Although new upper airway devices, such as Trachway (R), a video-assisted intubating stylet, had been developed for facilitating airway management.

 The larger size and the complexity of DLT than single-lumen tube (SLT) makes the difficulties for DLT intubation.

 Therefore, the investigators designed this study to investigate the effects of Trachway(R)compared with direct laryngoscope in DLT intubation.
