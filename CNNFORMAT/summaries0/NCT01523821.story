(thirdQuint)Alpha 1 Anti-Trypsin in Treating Patients With Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the safety and tolerability of alpha 1 anti-trypsin (AAT) in patients with steroid non-responsive acute GVHD.

 II.

 Characterize pharmacodynamic effects of AAT on pro-inflammatory cytokines, heparan sulfate, and the spectrum of peripheral blood T cells.

 III.

 Determine clinical responses of GVHD to AAT in patients with steroid non-responsive acute GVHD.

 OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor human followed by a phase II study.

 Patients receive alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor human intravenously (IV) on days 1, 3, 5, and 7.

 Patients who experience no toxicity and in whom GVHD is stable or improved after the day 7 dose can continue therapy with alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor human on days 9, 11, 13 and 15.

This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of alpha 1 anti-trypsin (alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor human) and to see how well it works in treating patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

 Alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor human may be a better treatment for graft-versus-host disease caused by a stem cell transplant.
