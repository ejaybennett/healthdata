(thirdQuint)Roux-en-Y Versus Billroth II Reconstruction After Subtotal Gastrectomy in Gastric Cancer Comorbid With Type II Diabetes.

 Type 2 diabetes may cause severe complications such as nephropathy and retinopathy.

 Additionally, it is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events and diseases.

 Surgical intervention with gastric bypass has been shown to attenuate glycemic levels in obese patient comorbid with type 2 diabetes.

 However, since gastric bypass is not a standard procedure, surgical protocol including stomach and small intestine reconstruction may be varied.

 The investigators and others have found that stomach and small intestine reconstruction may affect the efficacy of diabetic treatment.

 In this study, the investigators will compare the efficacy of Billroth II and Roux en Y reconstruction on glycemic control in stomach cancer patients with type 2 diabetes.

 Both Billroth II and Roux en Y are used in stomach-small intestine reconstruction after subtotal gastrectomy.

 No differences in postoperative outcomes and quality of life have been reported in Billroth II and Roux en Y reconstruction.

Gastric bypass improves glycemic levels in type 2 diabetes.

 However, the efficacy may be varied by different gastric-small intestine reconstruction used in the procedure.

 There are reports that Roux en Y reconstruction may give a better result.

 The purpose of this study is to compare Roux en Y and Billroth II reconstruction in patients with gastric cancer comorbid with type 2 diabetes.
