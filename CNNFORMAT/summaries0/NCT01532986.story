(fifthQuint)Randomized Trial to Test the "Coordinated Care for Health Promotion and Activities in Parkinson's Disease" Intervention in the Veterans Administration.

 In a 5-year randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 345 Veterans with PD that were then randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive up to 24 months of a PD care management program, "Care Coordination for Health Promotion and Activities in Parkinson's Disease" (CHAPS), or continue with usual care.

 Eligible participants across 5 sites of the Southwest Parkinson's Disease Research, Education and Clinical Center (SW PADRECC): Greater Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Loma Linda, Long Beach and San Diego VISN 22 (VA Desert Pacific Healthcare Network) facilities were identified through administrative data and vetted by physicians.

 The multi-faceted nurse-led intervention, CHAPS, incorporated PD quality improvement (QI) tools to enhance proactive Veteran-centered care delivery.

 PDQI tools included: (1) a structured telephone assessment administered by a nurse care manager (NCM) to proactively identify medical problems and unmet needs; (2) problem-specific evidence-based interventions organized into treatment plans including follow-up/monitoring protocols with VA and community linkages; (3) the Siebens Domain Management ModelTM, a structural approach to improve collection and organization of health information and enrich communication among providers; (4) Siebens Health Care Notebooks prepared with Veteran self-management materials; (5) a Microsoft Access care management database, containing the CHAPS Assessment and algorithms for problem identification based on Veteran data; and (6) decision-support meetings of NCMs with movement disorder specialists.

 Research interviewers administer a structured telephone survey at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

 Participants were provided $25 per survey.

 Medical records were abstracted.

 Ongoing analyses (1) measure PD quality indicator adherence, health outcomes, and health service utilization; (2) evaluate qualitative and quantitative data to summarize the extent of intervention implementation and barriers and facilitators to potential dissemination; and (3) examine costs of CHAPS care and cost offset between randomization arms to provide new knowledge to aid in future dissemination of the CHAPS Program in a "National Rollout" according to the VA Quality Enhancement Research Initiative QUERI process.

 Randomized Trial to Test the "Coordinated Care for Health Promotion and Activities in Parkinson's Disease" Intervention in the Veterans Administration@highlight

Health care benefits and services are received through the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), a component of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

 Over 40,000 Veterans across the Veterans Health Administration are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD), a chronic condition that affects motor function as well as cognition, mood, sleep, and autonomic function.

 There are not enough subspecialists to manage every Veteran with Parkinson's disease.

 However, a care model of nurse care managers as catalysts and advocates using needs assessments, evidence-based protocols, and VHA and community access coordination mechanisms to optimize Parkinson's disease care may improve quality of Parkinson's disease care and patient-centered outcomes.

 If efficacious, this model may be practical to disseminate via an existing VHA national consortium network for Parkinson's disease.

 Objectives are (1) to implement then analyze via a randomized controlled trial whether a nurse-led, coordinated care management intervention, Care Coordination for Health Promotion and Activities in Parkinson's Disease (CHAPS), compared to usual care will improve adherence to evidence-based practice guidelines and improve health outcomes in Veterans with Parkinson's disease in a region of the southwest United States, and (2) to analyze extent of implementation of the CHAPS intervention and its costs to determine how the intervention can be made sustainable and disseminated throughout Veterans Affairs Medical Centers if efficacious.
