(firstQuint)A Study to Evaluate Platlet Aggregation of Clopidogrel, EC Aspirin 81 mg, EC Omeprazole 40 mg Compare to PA32540.

 PA32540 is proposed for the secondary prevention of cardio- and cerebrovascular events in patients at risk for developing aspirin-associated gastric ulcers.

 Aspirin 81 mg taken concomitantly with clopidogrel 75 mg as maintenance doses is standard of care in some patients with cardiovascular disease.

 The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, however, significantly increases the risk for bleeding events.

 To mitigate upper gastrointestinal bleeding events, these patients would require the use of a proton pump inhibitor.

 For that reason, the reference arm in this study uses Prilosec(R) 40 mg as a comparator - the same proton pump inhibitor at the same dose level.

 The primary objective is to evaluate adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation following administration of clopidogrel, EC aspirin 81 mg and EC omeprazole 40 mg, all dosed concomitantly, and PA32540 and clopidogrel dosed separately.

This study is designed to provide data on platelet aggregation of PA32540 plus clopidogrel dosed separately compared to EC aspirin 81 mg plus EC omeprazole 40 mg plus clopidogrel dosed concomitantly.
