(fifthQuint)Contingency Management of Alcohol Abuse in the Severely Mentally ILL.

 The contingency management (CM) paradigm that will be used is the variable magnitude of reinforcement procedure.

 In order to encourage engagement in study procedures and reduce dropout in the randomized sample, all participants will undergo a 4-week pre-randomization induction period.

 During the induction period, participants will be reinforced for providing urine-tests three times a week.

 Those who demonstrate study participation and need for treatment during the induction period will be randomized to receive treatment as usual and either 1) 12 weeks of CM for alcohol abstinence (assessed by Ethyl glucuronide immunoassay urine-test) AND weekly reinforcement for intensive outpatient addiction treatment attendance; or 2) 12 weeks of reinforcement for providing urine-samples and continued study involvement.

 Randomization will be used to assign participants to treatment conditions.

 The primary outcome will be changes in alcohol use assessed by Ehyl glucuronide immunoassay urine-tests, breath-tests, as well as self- and clinician-reported alcohol use.

 The secondary outcome will be changes in intensive outpatient group attendance assessed by intensive outpatient clinician-report, as well as administrative data sources, and self-report.

 Other outcomes will include: urine-tests and self-reported illicit drug use, psychiatric symptoms, other outpatient treatment utilization, HIV-risk, and nicotine use.

 All outcomes will be assessed [for 4-weeks prior to study enrollment (self-report, clinician ratings etc)] and throughout the 4-week induction, 12-week intervention, and 3-month follow-up periods.

 Contingency Management of Alcohol Abuse in the Severely Mentally ILL@highlight

The investigators will evaluate the efficacy of a comprehensive 12-week contingency management intervention for treating alcohol dependence for persons with severe mental illness who are seen within the context of a community mental health center setting.

 The primary contingency will be submission of alcohol-free urines.

 Additional reinforcers will be provided for intensive outpatient addiction treatment attendance.

 Reinforcers will be vouchers or actual items useful for day-to-day living.

 Participants will be 120 adults diagnosed with alcohol dependance and severe mental illness.
