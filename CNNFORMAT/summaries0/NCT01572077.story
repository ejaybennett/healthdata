(fifthQuint)Rt Ventricular Substrate Metabolism as a Predictor of Rt Heart Failure in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.

 PAH results in premature death as a result of right ventricular dysfunction.

 However, there are substantial differences among patients in their tendency to develop right heart failure.

 This study proposes to determine if right ventricular (RV) changes can predict the development of right heart failure in patients with PAH.

 In addition, the study aims to evaluate the relationship of right ventricular metabolism to other physiologic responses in PAH,including:pulmonary vascular resistance, serum BNP and changes in cardiac hypertrophy and function.

 In conjunction with hemodynamic measurements, biomarkers and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); RV metabolism will be evaluated with (18F) FTHA and (18F)FDG cardiac PET imaging.

 A cohort of 20 age sex matched individuals will serve as normal controls.

 These subjects will have no known cardiac or pulmonary disease with normal ventricular function and estimates pulmonary pressures on echocardiogram.

 Rt Ventricular Substrate Metabolism as a Predictor of Rt Heart Failure in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate patterns of metabolic activity in the heart of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension(PAH).

 Patients with PAH are at risk of developing weakness or failure of the right side of the heart.

It is possible that there is a relationship between the development of heart failure and the way the heart uses energy sources, such as sugar.

 This study is designed to evaluate the way the heart uses sugar uptake in patients with PAH using positron emission tomography(PET imaging)
