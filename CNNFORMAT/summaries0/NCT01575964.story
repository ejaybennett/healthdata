(firstQuint)Biomechanical Assessment of Femoroacetabular Impingement.

 The purpose of this study is to quantify hip biomechanics of subjects with and without FAI.

 The results of this study will advance our understanding of how the FAI alters the biomechanics of the hip joint, improving diagnosis and directing treatment strategies.
