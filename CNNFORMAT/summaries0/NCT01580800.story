(thirdQuint)National Breast Cancer and Lymphedema Registry.

 Historically, breast cancer-associated lymphedema has been relatively ignored, with mis-diagnosis, late diagnosis, and failure to treat.

 The condition has a measurable, substantial impact on patient function and perceived quality of life (QOL).

 Recent pilot studies suggest that interventions that are designed to facilitate early diagnosis and preventive strategies have a major impact on the incidence and severity of disease burden.

 This registry is designed to prospectively capture the relevant data to document the impact of preemptive diagnostic and treatment strategies.

The purpose of the National Breast Cancer Lymphedema Registry is to collect health information in order to study the lymphedema as a complication of breast cancer treatment.

 The investigators hope to learn whether early diagnosis will help to prevent lymphedema or, if it does occur, to reduce the severity.
