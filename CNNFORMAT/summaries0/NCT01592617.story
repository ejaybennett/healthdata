(thirdQuint)Phase II Study of S-488410 to Treat Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of S-488410 for advanced non-small cell lung cancers who failed to standard therapy.

 The investigators previously identified three novel HLA-A*2402-restricted epitope peptides, which were derived from three cancer-testis antigens, as targets for cancer vaccination against lung cancer.

 In this phase II trial, we examine using a combination of these three peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for HLA-A*2402-positive advanced small cell lung cancer patients who failed to standard therapy.
