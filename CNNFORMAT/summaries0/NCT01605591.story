(firstQuint)Comparison of Different Bending Mode for Double-lumen Endotracheal Tube Intubation.

 Intubation with the double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) remains a great challenge for anesthesiologists.

 Although new upper airway devices, such as GlideScope(R) videolaryngoscope, had been developed for facilitating airway management, the larger size and the complexity of DLT than single-lumen tube (SLT) makes the difficulties for DLT intubation.

 Therefore, the investigators designed this study to investigate the effects of different bending type of DLT in tracheal intubation.
