(fifthQuint)A Study of Anterior Approach Combined With Infrahepatic Inferior Vena Cava Clamping.

 Traditionally, mobilisation of the right hemiliver followed by right hepatic vein control before parenchymal transection has been considered the standard approach to a major right hepatectomy.

 However, this approach is often difficult and hazardous when performing liver resection for large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or for tumors with extrahepatic organ invasion in the right retrohepatic region.

In setting of right hepatectomy by an anterior approach,liver mobilisation is performed only at the end of parenchymal transection, when all vascular connections have already been interrupted.

The anterior approach was found to be associated with significantly less intraoperative blood loss, less blood transfusions and a lower hospital mortality rate.

However,excessive bleeding can occur at the deeper plane of parenchymal transection from the right hepatic vein or middle hepatic vein.

 Bleeding from the hepatic veins is closely related to the CVP.

Our previous retrospective analysisfound that the infrahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) clamping is efficacious in reducing CVP without the need of systemic fluid restriction and is associated with significantly less intraoperative blood loss during complex hepatectomy.

 The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate if the application of the anterior approach combined with infrahepatic IVC clamping during right hepatectomy for large HCC reduces intraoperative blood loss.

 A Study of Anterior Approach Combined With Infrahepatic Inferior Vena Cava Clamping@highlight

Anterior approach results in better operative and survival outcomes compared with the conventional approach in patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but anterior approach has the problem of bleeding from the hepatic vein.

 Our previous study showed that infrahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) clamping can reduce blood loss during conventional hepatic resection.

 The investigators guess infrahepatic IVC clamping may also reduce blood loss in anterior approach right hepatic resection.

 So the investigators conduct this prospective, randomized, controlled trial to compare anterior approach combined with infrahepatic IVC clamping and anterior approach in major right hepatectomy for large HCC.
