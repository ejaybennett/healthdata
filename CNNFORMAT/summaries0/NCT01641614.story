(secondQuint)Beating Versus Arrested Heart for Mitral Valve Replacement.

 During open-heart surgery prevention of ischemia and reperfusion following cardioplegic arrest are essential for myocardial protection.

 Beating heart surgery on normothermic bypass simulates physiologic cardiac status and is good method for myocardial protection.

 A comparison of both available techniques for valve replacement arrested heart versus on-pump empty beating heart of the clinical and ultramicroscopic myocardial alterations will allowed to better understand myocardial protection because eliminated the use of cardioplegia and the corollary risk of ischemic reperfusion injury.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immediately clinic and ultramicroscopic myocardial cellular ischemia and reperfusion to replace of the mitral valve using arrested heart versus on-pump empty beating heart surgical techniques.
