(secondQuint)Effect of a Program of Deep Inspiration Combined to Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure in Asthmatic.

 Asthma is associated with high morbidity and significant mortality.

 This disease has functional impact on activities of daily living (ADLs) and according to some studies in the United States and Europe, the percentage of asthmatics who have significant restrictions in their ADLs is quite significant.

 Asthma is characterized as a major public health problem, not only in Brazil but worldwide.

 Currently there are few studies reporting the effects of a domiciliary program of deep inspiration associated with positive expiratory pressure in the airways of asthmatics.

 This study aims to analyze the benefits of this program on lung function, quality of life and response to exercise.
