(fifthQuint)Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Youth: Effectiveness in a Community Setting.

 This investigation aims to examine the effectiveness of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) in treating child traumatic stress when implemented in community settings on a state-wide level in Delaware.

 Youth (ages 7-16 years) with a history of documented trauma (sexual or physical abuse, traumatic loss, domestic or community violence) and symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) receive approximately 10 sessions of TF-CBT delivered in a state-contracted mental health agency.

 Children and adolescents are recruited from a public mental health population.

 PTSD symptoms and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems have been assessed in the first 72 participants at pre-treatment and then at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months after intake; subsequent participants (n=38) are only being assessed for symptoms and problems at pre-treatment and then at 3-, 6-months after intake.

 Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Youth: Effectiveness in a Community Setting@highlight

This effectiveness study is being conducted to determine whether Trauma-Focused Cognitive Therapy (TF-CBT), a treatment model developed in specialty clinics by experts in the treatment of child sexual abuse, can be effectively transported to a state-contracted community mental health agency in the state of Delaware and used effectively by clinicians with little prior TF-CBT experience.

 The sample is comprised of youths receiving public mental health services and with diverse trauma histories.
