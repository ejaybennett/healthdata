(thirdQuint)A Study to Evaluate ABT-450 With Ritonavir (ABT-450/r) and ABT-267 in Japanese Adults With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection.

 This multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, combination treatment study consisted of a Treatment and Post-treatment Phase, divided into 2 cohorts: 1) chronic HCV GT1b- infected, pegIFN/RBV treatment-exposed Japanese adults; and 2) HCV GT2-infected, pegIFN/RBV treatment-exposed Japanese adults.

 The Treatment Phase evaluated the antiviral activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of a range of ABT-450/r and ABT-267 doses for 12 to 24 weeks.

 The Post-treatment Phase evaluated the evolution and persistence of viral resistance to ABT-267 and ABT-450.

This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics of ABT-450 (also known as paritaprevir) with ritonavir (ABT-450/r) and ABT-267 (also known as ombitasvir) in adult Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (HCV GT1b) or genotype 2 (HCV GT2) infection who were previous treated with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV).
