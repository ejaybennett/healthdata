(fifthQuint)Metabolic Activation With Almased for Type 2 Diabetes Patients.

 The pilot study included patients with type 2 diabetes (n=22), that injected >100 U insulin daily.

 During the first week, all three main meals were replaced with 50 g of a protein-rich meal replacement (Almased) (=1100 kcal per day).

 During weeks 2-4, only two meals were replaced and a protein-rich lunch was allowed.

 During weeks 5-12, only dinner was replaced.

 Clinical parameters were determined at the beginning of the study, after 4, 8 and 12 weeks as well as after 1.

5 years of follow-up.

 Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for the intention-to-treat analysis and Mann-Whitney test for subgroup analyses.

 Metabolic Activation With Almased for Type 2 Diabetes Patients@highlight

Overweight patients with type 2 diabetes are often being treated with an intensified insulin therapy.

 However, in many cases, even a high insulin dosage (> 100 U per day) does not achieve satisfying metabolic control.

 A new therapy option is necessary that makes it possible to lower the daily insulin requirement and to improve metabolic control.

 The aim of this study was to investigate whether a protein-rich meal replacement is suitable to lower the daily insulin requirement and to reduce HbA1c and body weight.
