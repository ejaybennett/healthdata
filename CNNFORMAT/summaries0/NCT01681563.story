(secondQuint)Trial of Pentostatin Plus Cyclophosphamide With Ofatumumab (PCO) in Older Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.

 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common of the chronic lymphoid leukemias, comprising 30% of all adult leukemias.

 The majority of CLL patients are of advanced age.

 Currently, immunochemotherapy with Rituximab, Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide (RFC) is the standard of care in previously untreated patients with CLL requiring treatment.

 The combination of Pentostatin and Cyclophosphamide has generated excellent clinical response rates in pretreated B-CLL patients.

 Early data on the use of Ofatumumab as a single agent in Fludarabine-refractory CLL patients have been reported.

 Given the reported efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy combinations in CLL and the promising activity and toxicity profile of Pentostatin combinations, we designed a trial of Pentostatin, Cyclophosphamide, and Ofatumumab for previously untreated older patients with CLL.

 The aim is improving efficacy, in Rituximab resistant CLL, and toxicity considering the good profile of tolerability showed using Ofatumumab as single agent.

 Trial of Pentostatin Plus Cyclophosphamide With Ofatumumab (PCO) in Older Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia@highlight

This is a phase II multicenter, non-comparative, open label study in older previously untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia patients, requiring therapy, aimed at defining the efficacy profile (ORR, CRR and TTP) of pentostatin and cyclophosphamide given in combination with Ofatumumab (PCO).
