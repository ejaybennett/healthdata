(firstQuint)Glucosamine and Chondroitin Effects.

 Use of glucosamine and chondroitin have been associated with reduced cancer and overall mortality.

 The aim of this study is to determine whether a common starting dose of glucosamine and chondroitin (1500 mg/d + 1200 mg/d, respectively) reduces systemic inflammation as reflected by a reduction in high sensitivity C-reactive protein.
