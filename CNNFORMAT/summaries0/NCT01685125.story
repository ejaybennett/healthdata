(fifthQuint)Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone With or Without Dasatinib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To compare the progression-free survival of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with abiraterone (abiraterone acetate) plus dasatinib to that of men treated with abiraterone alone.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To describe the toxicity profile of the combination, as well as the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, objective responses, and changes in circulating tumor cell (CTC) numbers.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM A: Patients receive abiraterone acetate 1000 mg orally (PO) once daily (QD) and prednisone 5 mg PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.

 Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 ARM B: Patients receive abiraterone acetate and prednisone as patients in arm A.

 Patients also receive dasatinib 100 mg PO QD on days 1-28.

 Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

 Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone With or Without Dasatinib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well giving abiraterone acetate and prednisone with or without dasatinib works in treating patients with metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate cancer.

 Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells.

 Antihormone therapy, such as abiraterone acetate, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body.

 Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 It is not yet known whether abiraterone acetate and prednisone is more effective than abiraterone acetate, prednisone, and dasatinib in treating prostate cancer
