(secondQuint)Does Protein Restriction Inhibit Prostrate Cancer Growth.

 The primary objective of this study is to determine whether or not a low protein diet has an inhibitory effect on prostate cancer cell growth.

 The primary outcome measures relative to the investigators primary objectives are: For Group 1 the expression of genes and proteins of the PI-3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.

 For Group 2 the PSA values obtained every three months.

 Does Protein Restriction Inhibit Prostrate Cancer Growth@highlight

The Purpose of the Protein Study is to investigate whether a reduced protein diet can inhibit the growth of prostate cancer in humans.

 The Investigators hypothesis is that a reduced protein diet will inhibit expression of genes that are involved in the growth of prostate cancer.
