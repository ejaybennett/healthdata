(thirdQuint)Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Treating Patients With Large Brain Metastasis.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the safety and feasibility of treating brain metastases or resection cavities greater than 3 cm with hypofractionated radiosurgery and to determine the maximum-tolerated radiation dose for hypofractionated radiosurgery (HR) delivered in 5 fractions, 2-3 fractions per week.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery 2-3 times weekly (5 fractions total) for 2-3 weeks.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 3 months thereafter.

This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of hypofractionated radiosurgery in treating patients with large brain metastasis.

 Stereotactic radiosurgery can send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

 Giving fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery may kill more tumor cells.
