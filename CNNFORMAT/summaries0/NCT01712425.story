(fifthQuint)Safety and Immunogenicity of ChAdV63.

HIVconsv and MVA.

HIVconsv Candidate HIV-1 Vaccines in Recently HIV-1 Infected Individuals.

 It is a Phase I, multicenter primary/booster therapeutic vaccination study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ChAdV63.

HIVcons and MVA.

HIVconsv HIV-1 vaccines, delivered intramuscularly according to a 0-8 weeks or a 0-24 weeks schedule to recently HIV-1 infected individuals with early viral suppression 6 months after initiation of Tenofovir/Emtricitabine plus Raltegravir.

 24 patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled, first 10 individuals will be assigned in the 0-24 week prime/boost regimen (ARM A).

 The next 10 volunteers will be assigned in the 0-8 week prime/boost regimen (ARM B).

Four additional volunteers will be included as 'back-up' and assigned 2 in ARM A and 2 in ARM B to cover a possible 10% of patients who drop-off during the follow-up.

 Purpose of staging of 2 study arms is just to shorten overall study duration (from screening of first volunteer to 6 months after last immunisation of last volunteer).

 Lastly, 24 patients who also meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled as controls, will also initiate promptly antiretroviral treatment with Tenofovir/Emtricitabine plus Raltegravir but will not receive the investigational vaccines.

 Control patients will consecutively be assigned to the 0-24w control arm (ARM C 'long control') or 0-8w control arm (ARM D 'short control') until 12 patients per arm are reached.

 The purpose of the control arms is to have a study population to compare the viral reservoir decay kinetics in the absence of vaccination.

HIVconsv Candidate HIV-1 Vaccines in Recently HIV-1 Infected Individuals@highlight

The HIVconsv gene was constructed by assembling the 14 most conserved regions of the HIV-1 proteome into one chimaeric protein.

 This gene has been inserted into 2 leading non-replicating vaccine vectors: an attenuated chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 63 (ChAdV63) and a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) to construct the ChAdV63.
