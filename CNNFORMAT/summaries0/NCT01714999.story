(fifthQuint)Treatment of Acute Traumatic Laceration of the Olecranon and Prepatellar Bursa.

 A fall onto the elbow or knee often results in a laceration of the olecranon (OB) and prepatellar bursa (PB), due to their exposed and superficial location.

 Although a common injury, the authors are not aware of any study dealing with this entity.

 In order to get a first idea on the treatment concepts currently used, the authors conducted a international online survey among orthopaedic and trauma surgeons in Germany, Austria and Switzerland [1].

 The primary treatment approach of more than 70% of Austrian and German surgeons was bursectomy and immobilization, which was performed by less than 50% of Swiss physicians.

 At the Departments of Trauma Surgery of the Medical University of Vienna and of the Medical University of Munich, two opposing treatment concepts are being practised.

 Whereas in Vienna a bursectomy is performed in case of traumatic laceration of the OB and PB, a primary bursal reconstruction is performed at the Medical University of Munich.

 The aim of this study is to prospectively follow patients who suffered from an acute traumatic laceration of the OB or PB treated, according to the local standards, either by bursectomy (Vie, AT) or bursal reconstruction and direct wound closure (Muc, GER).

 The Hypothesis of this study is, that there is no difference with respect to complications between bursectomy and bursal reconstruction in case of acute traumatic laceration of the OB and PB.

 Treatment of Acute Traumatic Laceration of the Olecranon and Prepatellar Bursa@highlight

Following a recent publication by the authors [1], there is no standardized treatment regime for the treatment of lacerations of the olecranon or prepatellar bursa, although primary bursectomy seems to be the most common treatment regime in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

 The aim of this study is to prospectively follow patients who suffered from an acute traumatic laceration of the OB or PB treated, according to the local standards, either by bursectomy (Vie, AT) or bursal reconstruction and direct wound closure (Muc, GER).
