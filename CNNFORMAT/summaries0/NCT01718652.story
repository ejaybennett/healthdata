(secondQuint)A Study to Assess the Effects of Cyclosporine on the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) in Healthy Volunteers.

 This study will be an open label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of assigned treatments), single-center, multiple-dose study to determine how cyclosporin (a drug which reduces the activity of a patient's immune system) affects the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus).

 The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, an open-label treatment phase, and an end-of study (or follow-up) phase.

 Each volunteer will participate in the study for approximately 47 days.

 A Study to Assess the Effects of Cyclosporine on the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) in Healthy Volunteers@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine how a single dose of cyclosporin affects the pharmacokinetics (ie, how the body affects the drug) of multiple doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754).

 The safety and tolerability of canagliflozin will also be assessed in healthy volunteers.
