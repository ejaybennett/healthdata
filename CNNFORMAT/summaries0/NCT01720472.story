(thirdQuint)Implementing a Physical and Cognitive Performance Assessment Cohort in the MURDOCK Study Community Registry and Biorepository.

 The MURDOCK Study, proposes this Horizon 2 study to collect a brief physical and cognitive performance assessment from 1,000 MURDOCK Registry participants.

 Blood sample aliquots will also be obtained.

 These physical and cognitive performance data, paired with -omics data from plasma and serum sample analyses, offer promise in the discovery of biomarkers for functional decline.

 This research will provide an important basis for our understanding of the physical, lifestyle, and genetic factors which, over the lifespan, contribute to changes in physical and cognitive capabilities as we age.
