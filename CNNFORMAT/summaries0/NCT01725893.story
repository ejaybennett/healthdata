(secondQuint)Percutaneous Tenotomy of the Toe Flexor Tendon is a Simple and Efficient Method in Treating Checkrein Deformity.

 The investigators reviewed fourteen patients with checkrein deformity who underwent surgery in our hospital between 1993 and 2010.

 Five patients received FHL and flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tenolysis at the musculotendinous junction; among them, two also underwent Z-plasty lengthening of the FHL tendon.

 Nine patients underwent percutaneous segmental toe flexor tenotomy.

 The Hallux Metatarsophalangeal- Interphalangeal Scale (Hallux MTP-IP scale) and Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), English version LK1.

0 self-explanatory questionnaire were used to evaluate the functional outcomes.

Checkrein deformity represents a dynamic claw toe deformity.

 Surgical intervention is the treatment of choice and many methods have been proposed.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes and complications of percutaneous segmental tenotomy of the toe flexor tendons.
