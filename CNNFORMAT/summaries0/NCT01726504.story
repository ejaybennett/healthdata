(secondQuint)The Efficacy and Safety Study of Electro-acupuncture for Severe Chronic Functional Constipation.

 Chronic functional constipation is a common disease.

 To date there has not specific therapy on chronic functional constipation.

 Systematic reviews indicate that acupuncture is probably effective for the disease, but the evidence is limited.

 Recently, we have finished a multi-center clinical trial of individualized deep electro-acupuncture (EA) for chronic functional constipation (n=460, Registration ID: NCT00508482) which preliminarily showed EA was effective.

 This multi-center large-sample randomized controlled clinical trial of acupuncture for severe functional constipation is designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of EA.

 This project is conducted by Chinese experts, supported by the Chinese Government.

 The research result is expected to provide high quality evidence of EA for chronic functional constipation.
