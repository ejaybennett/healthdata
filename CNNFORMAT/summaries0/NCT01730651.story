(firstQuint)High Dose Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy in the Cervical Cancer With Metastatic Lymphadenopathies.

.

 Lymph node (LN) involvement in cervical cancer is a poor prognostic factor(1).

 Although lymph node evaluation is not a part of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system(2), it is generally performed as one of the initial workup of patients with cervical cancer by use of modern imaging tools for accurate evaluation of the disease extent and possible treatment adjustment.

 Kidd et al reported the positron emission tomography with [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET)-positive lymph node rate is 47% at diagnosis in 560 patients.

 They also showed that within a stage, patients with PET-positive lymph nodes had significantly worse disease specific survival than those with PET-negative lymph nodes (p/=10 Gy) is needed to control the gross tumor sized of 10 mm, containing 109 cells, according to the logarithmic cell killing(6).

 Theoretically, pelvic and para-aortic LNs (PAN) could not be controlled with the dose of 45-50 Gy10 EQD2, and we need to escalate the dose as much as possible with new radiation technology.

 In the current is study, we evaluate the LNs control rate, toxicity rate, progression-free survival and overall survival in cervical cancer patients with lymphadenopathies and treated with high dose intensity modulated radiation therapy.
