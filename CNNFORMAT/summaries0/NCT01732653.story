(fifthQuint)A Treadmill Training Program Augmented by Virtual Reality to Decrease Fall Risk in Older Adults.

 A prospective, single blinded, parallel group, randomized controlled trial with 6 month follow-up will be employed to investigate the effects of treadmill training augmented with virtual reality on fall risk.

 The study will include 300 older participants who have experienced two or more falls in the previous 6 months.

 Participants will be randomized to either the intervention or control group.

 The intervention group will receive 18 sessions of Treadmill Training with Virtual Reality (TT+VR) and the active control comparison will receive 18 training sessions of treadmill training alone (TT) without the VR simulation All interventions will be delivered by therapists trained in the standard protocols.

 All subjects will be trained 3 times a week for 6 weeks, each session will last approximately 45 minutes.

Training progression will be based on increasing both motor and cognitive challenges, individualized to the participant's level of performance.

 Primary outcome measures: The primary outcome measure of the study is fall rate for 6 months post intervention.

 Secondary outcome measures will include gait speed and gait variability under usual and dual task conditions and while negotiating physical obstacles will be measured.

 Endurance will be assessed using the 2 Minute Walk Test and mobility will be assessed using the Four Square Step Test (FSST), The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and the mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (mini-BESTest).

 Community ambulation will be assessed using a tri-axial accelerometer ('Axivity' Ltd.

)which will be worn by the participants for 7 days.

 Cognitive function will be assessed using a computerized neuropsychological test battery (Mindstreams, 'NeuroTrax' Corp.

, NJ) as well as standardized neuropsychological tests (Montreal Cognitive Assessment,The Trail Making Test; Verbal Fluency).

 Quality of life will be evaluated using the SF-36 Health Survey.

 A Treadmill Training Program Augmented by Virtual Reality to Decrease Fall Risk in Older Adults@highlight

The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of treadmill training augmented with virtual reality on fall risk.

 300 older adults with a history of falls will be recruited to participate in this study.

 This will include older adults (n=100), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n=100), and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD)(n=100).

 Subjects will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (treadmill training with virtual reality) or to the active-control group (treadmill training without virtual reality).

 Each person will participate in a training program set in an outpatient setting 3 times per week for 6 weeks.

 Assessments will take place before, after, and 1 month and 6 months after the completion of the training.
