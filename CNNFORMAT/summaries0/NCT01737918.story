(secondQuint)Treatment of Urge Urinary Incontinence in Women After Failure of Cesa or Vasa.

 It was hypothesized that urge urinary incontinence in women is based on the destruction of the uteri-sacral ligaments (USL)and the pubourethral ligaments (PUL).

 In a preliminary study (URGE I) we repaired the USL by cesa or vasa.

 Those patients who are still incontinent after cesa and vasa get the repair of the PUL by means of trans-obturator tapes (TOT).

 That treatment is compared to conservative medical treatment.

 Cross over after completion of three months is possible if no continence is achieved.

Urge urinary incontinence can be a disorder caused by destroyed pelvic structures.

 We repaired the uteri-sacral ligaments (USL) by cesa or vasa.

 The study evaluates if solifenacin can lead to continence after surgery or if also the pubo-urethral ligaments (PUL) need to be repaired.
