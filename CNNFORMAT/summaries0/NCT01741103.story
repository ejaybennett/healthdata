(thirdQuint)Sitagliptin in Type I Diabetic Patients.

 The hypothesis is that Sitagliptin will improve overall blood glucose, fasting blood glucose, and glycemic excursions in patients with Type I Diabetes.

 In addition, sitagliptin will likely suppress indices of oxidative stress in patients.

 The study will investigate proposed mechanisms of improved glucose concentrations, including enhanced effect of endogenous GLP-1 and suppression of glucagon.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of sitagliptin on overall blood glucose concentrations in Type I Diabetic subjects.

 The study also aims to evaluate post meal glucagon concentrations in Type I Diabetic subjects (a possible mechanism of reduced blood glucose concentrations) and indices of oxidation stress in the plasma of these subjects.
