(fifthQuint)Safety and Efficacy on Spasticity Symptoms of a Cannabis Sativa Extract in Motor Neuron Disease.

 CANALS project has as a main objective to analyse the safety profile, tolerability and efficacy of a Cannabis Sativa (Sativex) derivative on patients affected by spasticity due to motor neuron disease.

 Muscular rigidity (or spasticity) is a symptom that affects many patients with motor neuron disease, concurring to reduce personal autonomy, patients' quality of life and can potentially cause secondary symptomatology (as pain or secondary muscular retractions).

 Currently available anti-spasticity drugs are often unsatisfactory and their pharmacological action can cause weakness as a secondary effect.

 There many arguments supporting the use of cannabinoid derivatives in motor neuron diseases.

 Cannabinoids receptor is expresses both in the brain and in the spinal cord.

 In animal models cannabinoids have an anti-spasticity effect.

 Moreover recent studies on ALS animal models demonstrated a neuroprotective effect of cannabinoids, including the preservation of the motor ability and a survival increase of the treated animals.

 Recently many clinical trials (some of them performed at the Neurological Division of San Raffaele Hospital) demonstrated cannabinoid efficacy on spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis patients.

 CAnnabinois would be able to reduce spasticity with no secondary weakness effect on treated patients.

 The results of these studies led to the drug approval in certain countries and by the European Community for the treatment of spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis.

 The aim of this study is to analyze the safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of a Cannabis Sativa (Sativex) derivative on patients affected by spasticity due to motor neuron disease ( Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Primary Lateral Sclerosis).

 The study will be performed along 7 weeks.

 During the first week will be asked patients to note down in the clinical diary elements related to their symptomatology.

 Afterwards patients will be randomized in two groups: drug-treated and placebo treated.

 The study will be followed by a 6-weeks open-label phase during which all patients will receive the active drug (Phase B).

The clinical primary hypothesis is that there will be a difference between a Cannabis Sativa extract and placebo in their effect on spasticity in Motor Neuron Disease (MND) patients with signs of involvement of the upper motor neuron (UMN) resulting in disabling spasticity.

 Secondary goals of the study are to evidence of improvement in other symptoms (in particular pain), and to show favourable trends on functionality measures.

 Finally, cannabis based drug safety and tolerability will be studied through vital parameters (including weight and pulmonary function) measurement, and analyzing ALS function rating scale progression slope hopefully, showing a slowing of the functional values decrease, owing to cannabis neuroprotective effects)
