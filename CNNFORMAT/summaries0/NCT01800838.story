(fifthQuint)Silicon Phthalocyanine 4 and Photodynamic Therapy in Stage IA-IIA Cutaneous T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that can be utilized for a single treatment of Pc 4-PDT (silicon phthalocyanine 4 photo dynamic therapy) on subjects with mycosis fungoides (MF)/cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) stage IA-IIA, by evaluating an accelerated dose escalation protocol consisting of a single exposure to PDT using topically-applied Pc 4 and visible light at a wavelength of 675 nm, followed by assessment of skin biopsies to analyze cellular and molecular changes induced by Pc 4-PDT.

 (Cohort I) II.

 Determine safety and tolerability of repeated light (PDT) exposures after a single application of Pc 4 to a MF/CTCL plaque, using topically-applied Pc 4 and visible light at a wavelength of 675nm, followed by assessment of skin biopsies to analyze cellular and molecular changes induced by Pc 4-PDT.

 (Cohort II) III.

 Identification of targets for assessment of efficacy to assist in planning for a Phase II study.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive silicon phthalocyanine 4 topically and then undergo PDT.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 30 days.

 Silicon Phthalocyanine 4 and Photodynamic Therapy in Stage IA-IIA Cutaneous T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of silicon phthalocyanine 4 and photodynamic therapy in treating patients with stage IA-IIA cutaneous T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

 Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a drug, silicon phthalocyanine 4, that becomes active when it is exposed to a certain kind of light.

 When the drug is active, cancer cells are killed.

 This may be effective against cutaneous T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
