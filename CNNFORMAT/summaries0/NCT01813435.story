(fifthQuint)GLOBAL LEADERS: A Clinical Study Comparing Two Forms of Anti-platelet Therapy After Stent Implantation.

 The study objective is to determine in all-comers patients undergoing PCI under standardised treatment (including the BioMatrix family of drug-eluting stents and bivalirudin), whether treatment with 1 month of ticagrelor and aspirin followed by 23 months of ticagrelor monotherapy is superior with respect to the composite of all-cause mortality or non-fatal new Q-wave MI compared to treatment with 12 months of standard dual anti platelet therapy (DAPT) followed by aspirin monotherapy.

 The study design is an investigator-initiated, prospective randomised, multi-centre, multi-national, open-label trial to be conducted in approximately 60-80 interventional cardiology centres in Europe, North America, South America and Asia-Pacific.

 Patients will be randomised at a 1:1 ratio to study or reference treatment strategy.

 Randomisation will occur at the time of the index procedure prior to PCI.

 Subjects will be stratified according to centre and according to the clinical presentation (Stable Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) vs.

 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)).

 All patients will be followed for a period of 2 years.

 GLOBAL LEADERS: A Clinical Study Comparing Two Forms of Anti-platelet Therapy After Stent Implantation@highlight

After a stent procedure, it is common practice to prescribe anti-platelet medication to prevent the blood from clotting.

 The main objective of this study is to determine if there is a better medication strategy to prevent blood from clotting and at the same time minimising the number of complications.

 There are two medication strategies: - Study group: Dual anti-platelet therapy (ticagrelor combined with aspirin) for 1 month, and then ticagrelor alone for another 23 months OR - Control group: Standard treatment, being dual anti-platelet therapy (ticagrelor or clopidogrel combined with aspirin) for 12 months, and then aspirin alone indefinitely
