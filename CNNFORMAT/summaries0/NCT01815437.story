(thirdQuint)Evaluating Vitamin D Content in Mushrooms.

 Mushrooms have the capability to produce vitamin D in a similar way to human skin.

 When exposed to ultraviolet light, mushrooms will convert a precursor to vitamin D.

 This reaction produces large amounts of vitamin D.

 This study is comparing a natural source of vitamin D to a synthetic source of vitamin D and will help determine if mushrooms are a novel source for this essential nutrient.

 Evaluating Vitamin D Content in Mushrooms@highlight

This study will evaluate how much vitamin D is present in a mushroom supplement.

 This supplement contains an extract from mushrooms that have been exposed to sunlight.

 The mushroom supplement will be compared to non-commercially available vitamin D supplements produced in a Goo Manufacturing Practices (GMP)-licensed facility.
