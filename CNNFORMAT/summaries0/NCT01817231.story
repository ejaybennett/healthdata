(firstQuint)Epidemiological Analysis of Vitamin D and Breast Cancer Risk in Saudi Arabian Women.

 Background: The role of vitamin D in breast cancer prevention is equivocal.

 Saudi Arabian women are thought to be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency due to darker skin type and greater likelihood for reduced UVB radiation exposure.

 However, there is a lack of data regarding the vitamin D status of Saudi Arabian women and how this may relate to breast cancer risk.

 Objective: The purpose of this research was to evaluate the association between circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D and breast cancer risk in Saudi Arabian women.

 Design: A case-control study was conducted among 120 breast cancer cases and 120 controls.

 The study population was drawn from patients admitted to King Fahd Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from June to August 2009.

 Participants completed questionnaires on diet and medical history and serum samples were collected from all women to measure circulating 25(OH)D concentrations.
