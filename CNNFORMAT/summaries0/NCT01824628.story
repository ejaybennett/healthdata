(secondQuint)Comparison of the QT/QTc Interval Between an Outpatient HIV-Infected Population on Antiretroviral Therapy and Two Large HIV-Negative Cohorts.

 Primary objective: The primary objective is to compare the QT/QTc intervals of HIV positive subjects treated with antiretroviral therapy and followed at the ambulatory HIV clinic and the QT/QTc intervals of : 1.

 an outpatient HIV negative population from the same health center pre-admission one-day surgical clinic.

 2.

 the large HIV-free korean population studied in the ECG-ViEW database.

 Secondary objectives : - Evaluate the prevalence of QTc interval prolongation in the outpatient HIV positive population comparatively to the two HIV negative outpatient populations available from the one-day surgical clinic and the ECG-ViEW database.

 - Evaluate risk factors associated with QTc interval prolongation in the outpatient HIV positive population compared to the outpatient HIV negative population and the population studied in the ECG-ViEW database.

 - Compare the QT/QTc intervals and the prevalence of QTc interval prolongation of the outpatient HIV positive population currently on an antiretroviral regimen including a protease inhibitor versus those on an antiretroviral regimen without protease inhibitor.

 - Compare the QT/QTc intervals among the outpatient HIV positive population treated with a protease inhibitor, in regard to the presence or the absence of certain genetic polymorphisms that may influence pharmacokinetic aspects of protease inhibitors.

 Comparison of the QT/QTc Interval Between an Outpatient HIV-Infected Population on Antiretroviral Therapy and Two Large HIV-Negative Cohorts@highlight

This is a unicentric, two cohorts, observational transversal study.

 The purpose of this study is to compare the QT/QTc intervals of HIV positive subjects receiving an antiretroviral therapy and those without HIV in an ambulatory care setting.
