(firstQuint)The Effect of Ultrasound on Orthodontic Tooth Movement.

 The study will involve comparing the effects of tooth movement with and without ultrasound treatment in a split mouth design.

 Treatment will consist of using the Aevo System cent device for one 20 minute period per day for the duration of the trial (up to 24 weeks).

 Tooth position measurements will be taken from eligible patients prior to commencing usage of the study device.

 Follow-up visits will be scheduled for intra-oral clinical measurements and to take full-arch impressions.

 The Aevo System cent consists of an ultrasound emitting mouthpiece which is wire connected to an external handheld device.

 The mouthpiece is placed over the teeth and over the braces every day for 20 minutes in order to deliver the therapy.
