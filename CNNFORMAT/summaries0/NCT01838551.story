(fifthQuint)Treatment for Endogenous Cushing's Syndrome.

 This will be a single period, open-label, dose titration study to assess efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of COR-003 in subjects with CS.

 The trial design will identify both the minimally effective and maximally tolerated doses in this CS population.

 Following an initial screening period, this study will be conducted in 2 treatment phases as follows: - Dose titration phase: approximately 2 to 16 weeks to achieve an effective and tolerable maximum dose (the therapeutic dose) - Maintenance phase: 6 months of treatment at the therapeutic dose without a prior dose increase following the establishment of the appropriate dose identified in the titration phase; - Extended evaluation phase: 6 months of continued treatment after the maintenance phase (6 - 12 months); dose adjustments will be allowed as required for treatment Efficacy will be assessed by measuring UFC concentrations at specified times as described in the clinical protocol.

 Blood samples for the PK determination will be collected at the times indicated in the clinical protocol.

 An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the safety of the drug throughout the study.

 The constituents of the DSMB membership and a adjudication committee is specifically described in the clinical protocol.

 Subjects completing the 6-month maintenance phase of the study will remain in the study for an additional 6 months for extended evaluations.

 COR-003 will be provided under a compassionate use protocol for subjects who wish to continue treatment with COR-003.

 Treatment for Endogenous Cushing's Syndrome@highlight

The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of ascending doses of COR-003 in subjects with elevated levels of cortisol due to endogenous Cushing's Syndrome by assessment of reduction in Urinary Free Cortisol (UFC) concentrations and to identify the range of safe and effective doses of COR-003 that reduce mean UFC concentrations ULN (upper limit of normal) of the assay at month 6 of the maintenance phase of dosing without a prior dose increase in that phase.
