(thirdQuint)PEGPH20 Plus Nab-Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine Compared With Nab-Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine in Subjects With Stage IV Untreated Pancreatic Cancer.

 1.

 Phase 2, multicenter open-label randomized study with two run-in phases.

 The first run-in phase was to evaluate safety and tolerability of PEGPH20 + Nab-paclitaxel + Gemcitabine vs.

 Nab-paclitaxel + Gemcitabine.

 A second run-in phase was to evaluate a new formulation of PEGPH20.

 Phase 2 will be an open-label randomized study with same study drugs evaluating safety and efficacy.

 2.

 Subjects must have newly diagnosed stage 4 untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal cancer diagnosed by a standard of Care CT scan within 20 days of dosing and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

 3.

 Treatment consists of 4 week treatment cycles with Week 4 of every cycle, a wash-out week.

 In Cycle 1, PEGPH20 will be administered twice per week with Nab-paclitaxel + Gemcitabine given once/week 2-4 hrs after PEGPH20 and nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine alone 4.

 Safety parameters include medical history, physical exams, adverse event and Concomitant med collection, Doppler and CT scans for thromboembolic events, prophylactic enoxaparin, Karnofsky Performance scale, Immunogenicity, Hematology, Chemistry, coagulation, Weight/body surface area (BSA) for dosing, ECG and pharmacokinetics (PK) and Hyaluronan (HA) catabolite levels.

 Efficacy parameters include standard of care CT scans, CA19-9, tumor analysis of HA.

 5.

 Subjects continue in study until disease progression, adverse event/toxicity, death or either the subject/sponsor discontinues the study.

 PEGPH20 Plus Nab-Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine Compared With Nab-Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine in Subjects With Stage IV Untreated Pancreatic Cancer@highlight

To compare the treatment effect of PEGPH20 combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (PAG) to nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (AG) in subjects with Stage IV pancreatic cancer.

 The Phase 2 will study safety and treatment effect in 237 subjects (2:1 randomization, PAG:AG), preceded by two run-in phases (the first to assess safety and tolerability and a second to assess a new formulation of PEGHP20), 16 subjects total (randomized 3:1).
