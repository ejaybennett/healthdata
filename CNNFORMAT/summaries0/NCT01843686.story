(fifthQuint)Using Autologous Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Gel to Treat Deep 2nd and 3rd Degree Burns.

 The goal of this study is to demonstrate the safety of the application of autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) gel following excision and autologous skin grafting of acute deep 2nd and 3rd degree burns.

 This treatment is intended to stimulate rapid healing and improve the outcome of standard of care treatments for burns common to active duty military personnel, and more broadly for treatment of all acute burns.

 The care is specific to excision and split thickness skin grafting in the context of this burn study.

 The study will enroll 42 patients receiving surgical management of acute 2nd and 3rd degree burns requiring excision and skin grafting.

 The patient's total body surface area burn injury should not exceed 20%.

 The study will be conducted for 12 months.

 This study will provide further information for the development of enhanced treatment of wound-deployable cellular therapy for advanced trauma care of burned warriors.

 Using Autologous Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Gel to Treat Deep 2nd and 3rd Degree Burns@highlight

This study will demonstrate the safety of the application of autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) gel following excision and autologous skin grafting of acute deep 2nd and 3rd degree burns.

 The study will be a randomized, double-blinded controlled safety study.

 Investigators expect that the PRP will deliver improved hemostasis and growth factors at the wound site thus increasing the effectiveness of treatment at the wound site.

 This will lead to rapid production and delivery of an autologous therapy that should minimize additional morbidity to the patient.
