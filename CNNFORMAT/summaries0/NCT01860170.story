(secondQuint)Post-Transplant Bortezomib and High Dose Cyclophosphamide as Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) Prophylaxis.

 It is hypothesized that the administration of an early and short course cyclophosphamide and bortezomib after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantationin in the setting of matched related or unrelated donor transplantation using a standard reduced-intensity conditioning regimen is feasible.

 The study is a phase I study.

 The primary objective of the study is to determine the feasibility and safety of increasing doses of bortezomib administered post-transplant in conjunction with fixed high dose cyclophosphamide, also administered post-transplant in the setting of reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, as GVHD prophylaxis strategy.

 Eligible patients will receive a conditioning regimen based on a combination of fludarabine and busulfan with or without rATG.

 Post-Transplant Bortezomib and High Dose Cyclophosphamide as Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) Prophylaxis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if Bortezomib, known commercially as Velcade is safe and tolerated at different dose levels (amounts) with high dose Cyclophosphamide to be used as graft versus host disease prevention after reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
