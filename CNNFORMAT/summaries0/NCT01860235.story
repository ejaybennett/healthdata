(thirdQuint)EMLA Topical Anesthetic During Scaling and Root Planing.

 Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of a eutectic mixture containing 25 mg/g of lidocaine and 25 mg/g of prilocaine (EMLA(R)) with injectable 2% lidocaine, topical benzocaine, and 2% placebo for reducing pain during subgingival scaling and root planing (SRP) procedures.

 Methods: Thirty-two patients were enrolled in this split-mouth, double-blind randomized clinical trial.

 Patients were randomized to a sequence of four anesthetics: 25 mg/g lidocaine and 25 mg/g of 5% prilocaine (EMLA(R)), injectable 2% lidocaine, topical 2% benzocaine, or placebo.

 Pain and discomfort were measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Verbal Scale (VS).

 Patient satisfaction with anesthesia was also determined at the end of each treatment session.

 EMLA Topical Anesthetic During Scaling and Root Planing@highlight

Injectable anesthesics previous to subgingival scaling and root planing (SRP) presents some disadvantages like fear of the needle insertion, long-lasting effect and prolonged dampening of adjacent tissues.

 This study will compare the intrapocket anesthetic effectiveness of a skin topical anesthesic EMLA with intrapocket 2% benzocaine, intrapocket placebo and injectable anaesthesia for SRP in a Split-mouth, double-blind, clinical trial study.
