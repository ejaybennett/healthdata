(secondQuint)Proximal Humerus Site for Anesthesia.

 When using IO access in the perioperative and OR settings, abduction of the arms to the shoulder level prevents use of the traditional proximal humerus insertion site due to the rotation of the humeral head under the acromion process.

 An alternate proximal humerus IO insertion technique has been developed to meet the needs of anesthesia patient positioning that uses a slightly more distal insertion site and a superior angle of insertion.

 However infusion flow rate in the proximal humerus using the anesthesia technique has not been measured.

 This study is needed to evaluate the anesthesia proximal humerus IO insertion technique to determine if the IO infusion flow rates remain unchanged by the alternate method.

This will be a prospective, non-controlled study using healthy adult volunteers as subjects receiving bilateral proximal humerus intraosseous (IO) vascular access to evaluate the insertion technique and IO infusion flow rates.
