(secondQuint)Phase 2 Ibrutinib + Rituximab in Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (R/R MCL).

 Relapsed and/or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL): Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible for this study, you will begin the first cycle of treatment with ibrutinib and rituximab.

 Each cycle is 28 days.

 Ibrutinib Administration: Every day you will take 4 ibrutinib capsules with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water.

 Do not open the capsules or dissolve them.

 If you miss a dose, you can take it up to 6 hours after the time you would have taken it.

 If it is later than 6 hours, you should skip the dose and start taking the capsules at the same time as usual the next day.

 You will need to fill out diary cards with information about when you take ibrutinib.

 You should bring the diary cards with you to appointments.

 You will receive a 30 day supply of the ibrutinib capsules on Day 1 of Cycles 1-9.

 After that, starting on Cycle 10, you will receive a 60-day supply of the drug every other cycle.

 Rituximab Administration: On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1, you will receive rituximab by vein.

 After that, infusions take about 4 hours.

 You will then receive rituximab by vein over 4 hours on Day 1 of Cycles 3-8 and every other cycle after that for up to 2 years.

 For some patients, you may receive the rituximab dose over 2 days.

 Your doctor will tell you if this is the best approach for you.

 Study Visits: On Day 1 of all cycles: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration to check the status of the disease.

 On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, then every 3 cycles after that, if the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease.

 You may have scans less often.

 On Day 1 of Cycle 1: - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing and to check the status of the disease.

 Biomarkers are found in the blood and may be related to your reaction to the study drug.

 - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your immune system.

 One time between Cycles 2-10, when the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing and to check you immune system.

 Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

 You will no longer be able to take the drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed follow-up.

 End-of-Treatment Visit: After you finish taking the study drugs: - You will have a physical exam.

 - You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

 - Blood (about 5-7 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, for biomarker testing, for immune system testing, and to check the status of the disease.

 - You will have a CT scan and/or x-ray to check the status of the disease.

 - If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET/CT scan and/or bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease.

 - If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a gastrointestinal endoscopy.

 - If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) or urine pregnancy test.

 - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing and to check the status of the disease.

 - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your immune system.

 Long Term Follow-Up: After your end-of-treatment visit, you will be called every 3 months for 1 year and every 6 months after that to see how you are doing.

 These calls will take about 2-3 minutes.

 If you stop the study drug and the disease has gotten better or is stable at the time you stopped taking the study drug, blood will be drawn every month for 3 months, then every 2 months for 6 months, and then every 3 months after that to check the status of the disease.

 Elderly Patients (> 65) with Newly-Diagnosed, Untreated MCL: Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible for this study, you will begin the first cycle of treatment with ibrutinib and rituximab.

 Each cycle is 28 days.
