(fifthQuint)Fibromyalgia Activity Study With Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (FAST).

 This is a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-center clinical trial involving a device, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS).

 TENS is a non-pharmacological agent which delivers electrical stimulation by a battery operated device via electrodes placed on the skin.

 TENS is considered to be a safe, inexpensive and non-invasive modality used to treat a variety of acute and chronic pain conditions.

 The initial phase of the study will randomly allocate subjects to receive active TENS, placebo TENS or standard care (No TENS).

 After participating in the 1 month random assignment, all subjects will receive active TENS for 1 month.

 The subjects will make 4 visits to the clinic approximately 2 to 3 1/2 hours each visit.

 Visits will entail questionnaires, functional tasks, accelerometry, TENS, pain and fatigue assessments.

 Study Aims: Aim #1: The primary aim of the study is to test the effect of the long-term use of TENS on movement-related pain as measured by a numeric rating scale (NRS) during six minute walk test (6MWT) in women with fibromyalgia with random assignment to three treatments: standard care (No TENS), placebo TENS and active TENS.

 Aim #2: A secondary aim will test if movement-pain reduction by TENS results in a concomitant decrease in fear of movement, fatigue, resting pain and analgesic medication and an increase in function and quality of life.

 Outcome measures will include physical function by directly assessing daily activity with an accelerometer, self-report (IPAQ), as well as performing specific function tasks.

 A sub-analysis will determine responders and non-responders to TENS and factors that predict both responders and non-responders.

 Multiple factors that could contribute to TENS response include self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, levels of physical activity, fear of movement, sleep, pain, fatigue, function, quality of life, or pain physiology.

 Aim #3: To determine if active TENS alters pain processing in women with fibromyalgia and if improvement in clinical symptoms correlates with normalization of pain processing physiology.

 We will evaluate change in these physiologic parameters in responders versus non-responders as assessed clinically.

Pain processing will be assessed by examining pressure pain thresholds at the site and outside the site of stimulation and by examining conditioned pain modulation Aim #4: To determine if PROMIS (patient reported outcome measurement information system) is a useful instrument for assessing outcomes in women with fibromyalgia by comparing the PROMIS modules to symptom domains measured by other instruments validated for use in fibromyalgia clinical trials and by determining the performance of PROMIS in the definition of responders.

 Fibromyalgia Activity Study With Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (FAST)@highlight

Pain associated with fibromyalgia interferes with daily function, work, and social activities resulting in a decreased quality of life.

 People with fibromyalgia also have a significant amount of fatigue and a fear of movement.

 People with fibromyalgia show enhanced excitability of pain neurons in the central nervous system and reduced pain inhibition.

 Therefore, one of the main treatments for patients with fibromyalgia must focus on pain relief to allow the person to function more independently both at home and at work.

 Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is used by health professionals to deliver electrical stimulation through the skin for pain control.

 Basic science studies, from the PI's laboratory show that TENS activates descending pain inhibitory pathways to inhibit excitability of pain neurons.

 Thus the ideal patient population for the treatment of TENS would be one in which there is enhanced central excitability and reduced inhibition; fibromyalgia is such a condition.

 Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that application of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) to patients with fibromyalgia will reduce resting and movement-related pain and reduce central excitability by restoring diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC), and that this decrease in pain and/or central excitability will reduce fatigue and fear of movement, thereby improving function and quality of life
