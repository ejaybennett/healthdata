(fifthQuint)ColoAssist vs.

 MEI.

 The recommended cecal intubation rate in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is 95%.

 The MEI system allows real time monitoring of the colonoscope position within the colon and is considered to be a useful supplement to achieve cecal intubation.

 However, the MEI system is costly, and trial results are equivocal regarding the actual benefits.

 A newly designed colonoscope (ColoAssist) with gradual stiffness throughout the colonoscope shaft has been developed to improve insertability.

 We want to investigate if we can achieve equal performance results with the ColoAssist instrument as with the MEI system in CRC screening.

 The study is designed as a two-center, single-blinded, randomized, controlled non-inferiority trial.

 ColoAssist vs.

 MEI@highlight

Colonoscopy aims to investigate the entire colon by advancing the colonoscope tip from the rectum to the cecum, a process called cecal intubation.

 Cecal intubation may be difficult for different reasons, and features of the colonoscope and the use of imaging devices may influence the success rate.

 We want to compare the performance of a new colonoscope with novel features including gradual stiffness with that of a colonoscope supplied with a magnetic endoscope imaging (MEI) device.

 The hypothesis is that the performance of the new instrument is non-inferior to the MEI system.
