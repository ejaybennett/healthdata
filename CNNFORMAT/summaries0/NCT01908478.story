(fifthQuint)Veliparib in Combination With Gemcitabine and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer.

 Gemcitabine will be administered by intravenous infusion of 1000 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15 of the cycle.

 Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) will be given to a total dose of 36 Gy in 15 fractions (2.

4 Gy per fraction, one fraction per day, 5 fractions per week, Monday through Friday) beginning on day 1.

 Veliparib will be administered per a dose escalation schema.
