(firstQuint)Neurostimulation to the Vagus Nerve for the Reduction in Frequency of Seizures Associated With Epilepsy.

 The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation for the reduction in frequency of seizure associated with epilepsy in subjects 18 or older.

 Subjects will record 4 weeks of baseline seizure activity before being randomized for a period of 4 weeks to receive and active treatment to an active-sham treatment.
