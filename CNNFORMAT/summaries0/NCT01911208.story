(thirdQuint)A Randomized Recruitment Intervention Trial.

 Low minority participation in clinical trials limits our ability to assess and address potential differences in therapeutic responses.

 To address the problem of low minority recruitment we are initiating a randomized trial of a recruitment intervention (RECRUIT) funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health disparities (NIMHD) to increase racial/ethnic diversity in clinical trials.

 Our specific approach is directed toward multi-site trials conducted at specialty clinics within academic centers with recruiting venues that include community practices or practices of colleagues in other areas of the academic center.

 The intervention will focus on approximately 60 specialty clinics.

 Clinical sites will be randomized to the intervention or control group.

 The target of the intervention will be the site investigators and clinical trial coordinators.
