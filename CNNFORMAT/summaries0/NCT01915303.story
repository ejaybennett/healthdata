(thirdQuint)Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Pasireotide s.

c.

 +/- Cabergoline in Patients With Cushing's Disease.

 This study is to assess whether pasireotide alone and combined with cabergoline will give reliefs on patients with recurrent, persistent and newly diagnosed Cushing's disease.

 The study will also assess study drug safety, the changes in Quality of Life and on clinical signs and symptoms of Cushing's disease.

 The study consists pasireotide-untreated patients at screening and patients currently treated with maximal tolerated doses of pasireotide.

 Core phase will consist of pasireotide-untreated patients at screening - this includes patients who have never received pasireotide or patients who have received pasireotide sometime in the past but it was not discontinued because of safety.

 These patients will start pasireotide at 0.

6mg twice a day for 8 weeks.

 Should biochemical control not be achieved the dose will be increased to 0.

9mg twice a day.

 If biochemical control is still not achieved, cabergoline at increasing dose will be added.

 Patients currently treated with maximal tolerated doses of pasireotide monotherapy for at least 8 weeks at 0.

3mg twice a day, 0.

6mg twice a day or 0.

9mg twice a day, but still did not achieve biochemical control will add cabergoline at increasing dose.

 After 35 weeks of treatment at core phase, patients will have the option to continue study treatment in extension phase if pasireotide is not yet approved for commercial use and/or reimbursed - if country reimbursement is applicable.
