(secondQuint)Genomic Grade Index (GGI): Feasibility in Routine Practice and Impact on Treatment Decisions in Early Breast Cancer.

 The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing Genomic Grade Index (GGI) in community hospitals in Belgium for breast cancer patients with node negative and 1-3 node positive early breast cancer.

 GGI would be considered a feasible genomic test if results were obtained in > 70% of evaluated patients.
