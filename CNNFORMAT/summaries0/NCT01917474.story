(fifthQuint)Effects of Changes in Dietary Intake and Headache's Attacks.

 Headache is a common disease in general population, which affects adult women more frequently than men.

 Among different factors which might be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease, eating or drinking a particular food or drink have been shown to act as a trigger of acute attacks.

 In particular foods such as aged cheese or red wine may trigger acute migraine attacks and dietary habits such as excessive caffeine intake may increase headache frequency.

 Moreover a close relationship has been detected between overweight/obesity and migraine severity even if other authors showed that obesity at baseline does not seem to be related to follow-up refractoriness to preventive treatment.

 At the first visit, patients will undergo a complete clinical examination and body weight (BW), height (HT), blood pressure (SBP/DBP) and heart rate (HR) will be also measured.

 Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated as BW/HT2 and expressed in kg/m2.

 We consider overweight patients with BMI> 25 and 30.

 Patients will be followed-up for two months when treatment for the prevention of headache (usually the calcium entry blocker flunarizine 5 mg/day) will be added to the habitual dietary regimen.

 At the end of this run-in period all patients will be randomly attributed to one of the following two dietary regimens: a low lipid diet with a lipid content 2.

5.

 Moreover, at each visit patients will fill-up a food questionnaire, validated in comparison to the 7-day food record (12), with the help of a well trained dietician.

 Data are expressed as daily percent caloric intake from each macronutrient and as the weekly number of a medium size serving.

 Main drugs suggested for the pain relief at each attack are the selective serotonin receptor agonists (triptans), which are abortive migraine medications, and the non steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.

 In a randomly selected subgroup of patients we will evaluate at baseline and after diet: 1.

 Vascular dysfunction by echography at the brachial artery level after ischaemia (Flow mediated dilatation) and after nitroglycerin 0.

3 mg; 2.

 Intimal-media thickness at carotid artery level will be evaluated by b-mode echography; 3.

 central pressure and pulse wave velocity by tonometry applanation.

 Effects of Changes in Dietary Intake and Headache's Attacks@highlight

Headache is a frequently disabling disorder, which occurs in about 30% of the adult population, particularly in overweight/obese women.

 Aim of the study is to modify the nutritional habits of the patients and to evaluate the effects of a low lipid intake vs.

 a normal lipid diet on the incidence and severity of migraine crises.

 Moreover vascular reactivity will be evaluated in a randomly selected subgroup of patients.

 This randomized, cross-over intervention trial will be performed in about 150 patients, affected by migraine.

 Adherence to the diet, particularly regarding energy intake, percent of energy from lipids, carbohydrates and proteins will be carefully assessed at baseline and during the 2 intervention periods
