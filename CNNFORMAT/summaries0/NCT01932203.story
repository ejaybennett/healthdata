(firstQuint)Efficacy Study of Cilostazol and Aspirin on Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.

 The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of aspirin and cilostazol on volume of white matter changes in cerebral small vessel disease.

 The secondary objectives are to compare the impact of aspirin and cilostazol on DTI parameters, lacune, microbleeds, brain atrophy, cognition, depression, neurologic signs, gait, urination, and activities of daily living.

 We also investigate risk factors associated with progression of cerebral small vessel disease.
