(firstQuint)A Single Dose Study To Investigate The Pharmacokinetics and Safety Of Dalbavancin In Hospitalized Children Aged 3 Months to 11 Years.

.

 This is a open label, multi center study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of a single dose of intravenous dalbavancin in hospitalized pediatric patients with known or suspected bacterial infection.

 Patients will be enrolled and results will be evaluated in 3 age cohorts as follows: Cohort 1: Patients 6 years to 11 years of age, inclusive; Cohort 2: Patients 2 years to <6 years of age; Cohort 3: Patients 3 months to <2 years of age.

 All patients in each cohort will be administered a single dose of dalbavancin in addition to background anti infective treatment to be chosen by the investigator according to standard of care.

 Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained at various timepoints.

 Dalbavancin can be administered at any time (before, during or after) the standard of care therapy.
