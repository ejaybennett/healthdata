(fifthQuint)Potato Fiber and Gastrointestinal Function: Phase 3.

 Potato fiber (PF-RS, PF-RO1 and PF-RO2), supplemented in the diet of healthy individuals (n=60; 20 per group) and providing 30 g per day of fiber, will result in a significant changes in gastrointestinal function and microbiota profile.

 Objectives: 1.

 To determine the effect of potato fibers on stool frequency, gastrointestinal transit time and gastrointestinal symptoms.

 2.

 To determine the effect of potato fibers on microbial diversity in healthy individuals.

 Potato Fiber and Gastrointestinal Function: Phase 3@highlight

The primary physiological impacts of fiber intake include the gastrointestinal effects of stool bulking, increased stool frequency and decreased gastrointestinal transit time (GTT).

 Fermentation of resistant starches by microbiota increases bacterial numbers, which increases fecal bulk and may impact frequency and transit time.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of resistant potato starches (potato fiber) on stool frequency, transit time and microbiota in healthy individuals.
