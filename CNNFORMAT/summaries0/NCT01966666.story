(thirdQuint)A Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Preliminary Efficacy Study of TPI-287 in Alzheimer's Disease.

 The maximum tolerated dose of TPI-287 will be determined through a planned dose escalation over 3 sequential cohorts, each comprising of 11 participants randomized to either TPI-287 or placebo.

 TPI-287 or placebo will be administered as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks for 9 weeks, for a total of 4 infusions.

 Participants who successfully complete this phase will have the option of entering into the open label extension phase during which TPI-287 will be administered once every 3 weeks for an additional 6 weeks, for a total of 3 extra infusions.

 Pre-medication of diphenhyramine 25 mg (Benadryl) will be given IV within 30 to 60 minutes prior to each study infusion in the study.

 Safety and tolerability will be assessed through reporting of adverse events, physical and neurological testing, ECGs, as well as blood and urine analyses.

 Baseline and end-point measures of cognition and function, MRI brain scans, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analyses will be used to determine preliminary efficacy of TPI-287 in mild-moderate AD.

 Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of TPI-287 will be calculated from blood plasma collected after the first infusion, and from CSF collected on the last visit of the placebo-controlled phase.

 A Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Preliminary Efficacy Study of TPI-287 in Alzheimer's Disease@highlight

The purpose of the study is to determine the highest dose of TPI-287 that is safe and tolerable when administered as an intravenous infusion to participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), to measure pharmacokinetic properties of the drug as well as to gauge preliminary efficacy of TPI-287 on disease progression.
