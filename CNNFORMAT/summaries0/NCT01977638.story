(thirdQuint)Phase 1 Trial of CXD101 in Patients With Advanced Cancer.

 Patients will be treated with CXD101 administered orally starting at 1mg twice a day (ie: 2mg/day).

 Dose escalation will proceed according to a standard 3+3 phase 1 scheme.

 Adverse experiences will be evaluated according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.

0.

 Dose escalation will continue until dose limiting toxicity is encountered in >1/3rd of patients at any dose level.

 The dose level below this will be determined to be the maximum tolerated dose.

 Patients will be treated, at the discretion of the Principal Investigator, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or the withdrawal of consent.

 At the maximum tolerated dose a further 20 patients, defined by tumour HR23B expression will be enrolled.

 Phase 1 Trial of CXD101 in Patients With Advanced Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of CXD101 (a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor) that can be safely administered to patients with advanced tumours.

 The study will also investigate the use of HR23B expression in tumour as a biomarker of response to treatment with CXD101.

 Patients with solid tumours, lymphoma and myeloma can be considered for this study.
