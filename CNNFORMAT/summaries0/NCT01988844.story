(secondQuint)Upper Limbs Assessment in Children With Cerebral Palsy.

 While the rates of perinatal and infant mortality have declined toward the end of the last century,the rate of cerebral palsy has remained at 2 to 2.

5 per 1,000 live births.

 A high percentage of children with cerebral palsy have difficulty keeping up with the handwriting demands at school.

 The neurological impairments in children with cerebral palsy frequently limit the functionality of these children taken in to account the upper limbs variables.

 It should be interesting to describe a clinical profile based on this assessment.

 Upper Limbs Assessment in Children With Cerebral Palsy@highlight

Cerebral palsy is the leading cause of physical disability among children.

 Manual dexterity and upper limbs functionality is limited between these children.

 The purpose of this study is to stablish a specific profile of school children with cerebral palsy based on the upper limbs assessment.
