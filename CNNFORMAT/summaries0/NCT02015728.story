(thirdQuint)Selecting Patient-Specific Biologically Targeted Therapy for Pediatric Patients With Refractory Or Recurrent Brain Tumors.

 This research study will assign a specific drug treatment based on lab tests performed on the participant's tumor from tumor tissue taken from a biopsy done when he/she was first diagnosed or if taken when he/she relapsed or progressed.

 All participants will get Temozolomide and Etoposide to start.

 Then depending on review of the participant's tumor tissue he/she will also receive one of the following: Sorafenib, Everolimus, Erlotinib, or Dasatinib.

 The purpose of this research study is to learn about the feasibility of obtaining and using information from studies done on tumor tissue in order to help make treatment decisions for patients with relapsed or refractory pediatric brain tumors.

 The investigators also want to find out the effects this therapy has on the participant and the participant's brain tumor.

This research study is a Feasibility clinical trial.

 In this trial, researchers are trying to figure out whether a medication can be chosen based on rapid testing done on tumor tissue.

 Information from a feasibility or pilot trial will hopefully help researchers plan larger trials in the future to determine the effect of this therapy.
