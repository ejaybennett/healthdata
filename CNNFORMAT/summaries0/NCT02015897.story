(secondQuint)Effect of Physical Therapy on Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema.

 Physical therapy treatment of patients with lymphoedema includes treatment based on the principles of 'Complete Decongestive Therapy' (CDT).

 CDT consists of following components; skin care, manual lymphatic drainage, bandaging and exercises.

 Regarding what type of treatment of treatments is most effective, the scientific evidence is sparse.

 Studies have focused on the time-consuming manual lymphatic drainage, but the scientific evidence is not consistent.

 A randomized, single-blind, equivalence trial.

 A total of 160 breast cancer patients with lymphoedema will be recruited from 3 hospitals and randomised into one of two treatment groups: A: Complete Decongestive TherapyA (incl.

 manual drainage) or B: Complete Decongestive TherapyB (except manual lymphatic drainage.

The objective of this study is to investigate if Complete Decongestive Therapy is equally effective whether it includes manual lymphatic drainage or not in the treatment of lymphoedema among patients with breast cancer.
