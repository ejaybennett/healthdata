(thirdQuint)Social Forces to Improve Statin Adherence (Study A).

 We propose to complete a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 200 subjects with medication treated diabetes and evidence of poor adherence to a statin medication (2 consecutive daily doses of statin; and 4) usual care (GlowCaps without any notifications).

 The primary outcome will be the percent of statin doses taken during the study as measured by the GlowCaps.

 The secondary outcome will be subjects' statin medication possession ratio (MPR) during the study.

 Social Forces to Improve Statin Adherence (Study A)@highlight

To assess the effectiveness of reporting statin adherence patterns to a Medication Adherence Partner (MAP) in improving the outcome of statin adherence versus usual care as measured by an electronic pill bottle.

 Hypothesis: Subjects with a MAP receiving daily adherence feedback will have the highest statin adherence of any arm, as measured by pill bottle data.
