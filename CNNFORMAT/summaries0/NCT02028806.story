(firstQuint)mFOLFIRINOX as First-Line Chemotherapy in Treating Chinese Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer.

 Since for many tumors, different races may show different responses to the same regimen, we design this open, multicenter phase II study to evaluate the the efficacy and safety of mFOLFIRINOX as first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer in China.
