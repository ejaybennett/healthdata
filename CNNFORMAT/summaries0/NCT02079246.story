(firstQuint)Long-term Safety and Tolerability of Idalopirdine (Lu AE58054) as Adjunctive Treatment to Donepezil in Patients With Mild-moderate Alzheimer's Disease.

 This is an interventional, multi-national, multi-site, open-label extension study in patients with mild to moderate AD who completed study 14861A (NCT01955161) or 14862A (NCT02006641).

 Patients will receive 28-weeks of treatment with idalopirdine 60 mg/day (option to reduce to 30 mg/day) as adjunctive treatment to donepezil.

 Approximately 100 patients, who have completed the initial 28-week period, will be included in an 24 weeks open-label treatment period with memantine (sub-study) that will evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding memantine therapy in patients who are already on a stable treatment of idalopirdine and donepezil and for whom memantine treatment is clinically indicated.
