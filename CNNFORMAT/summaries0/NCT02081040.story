(secondQuint)Coughing in Infratentorial Brain Lesion Patients.

 Our previous work has shown that stroke patients with dysphagia have impaired diaphragm excursion in comparison to those with no dysphagia.

 It has been postulated that respiratory and cough function are primarily controlled by respiratory and swallowing centers located in the brainstem.

We postulated that those with infratentorial brain lesions would have more impaired cough and respiratory function than those with non-brainstem lesions and supratentorial brain lesions.

 However there has been no studies whether those with infratentorial brain lesions have more impaired cough function and decreased diaphragm excursion than those with supratentorial brain lesions.

To record diaphragm excursion in infratentorial brain lesions patients with dysphagia during coughing and compare them to those with supratentorial brain lesion patients with dysphasia and those with no dysphagia at a university affiliated rehabilitation department.
