(fifthQuint)Short-term Effects of Thoracic Manipulation in Shoulder Impingement.

 Subjects with shoulder impingement signs will be evaluated and will be compared with subjects asymptomatic for shoulder symptoms.

 Both subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups: thoracic spinal manipulation (TSM) or sham intervention.

 We want to know if possible changes in scapular motion and muscle activity following a TSM depend on the symptoms or if it is generic to everyone.

 Also, we want to know if TSM reduces shoulder pain immediately and in a short-therm period.

 Short-term Effects of Thoracic Manipulation in Shoulder Impingement@highlight

The hypothesis of this study is that thoracic spine manipulation would reduce pain in subjects with SIS and cause changes in scapular kinematics and muscle activity in subjects with impingement symptoms and in asymptomatic subjects.

 With this study, the investigators want to answer if possible changes in scapular motion and muscle activity following a TSM depend on the symptoms or if it is generic to individuals without shoulder dysfunction and not specific to subjects with shoulder impingement.
