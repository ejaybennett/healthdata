(thirdQuint)Comparison of Intraosseous Anaesthesia Using a Computerized System (QuickSleeper) to Conventional Anesthesia.

 Local anesthesia is commonly used in oral health care and intra-mucosal infiltration anesthesia is most commonly used by practitioners.

 Anesthesia may cause children a great deal of anxiety because of the fear of the injection.

 The latter can be painful if the product is delivered too quickly in the mucosa.

 Recent developments in the techniques and anesthesia systems allow reducing pain during the injection.

 In particular, computerized systems (electronically assisted local anesthesia) allow a slow injection limiting pressure.

 Moreover, these systems look like a pen which prevents the negative impression of the image related to the syringe metal.

 The intraosseous electronically-assisted anesthesia could be an interesting alternative to conventional infiltration anesthesia by making the act less stressful but also less painful for the child.

 Comparison of Intraosseous Anaesthesia Using a Computerized System (QuickSleeper) to Conventional Anesthesia@highlight

The purpose is to compare the efficacy of an intraosseous anaesthesia using a computerized system (QuickSleeper) to a conventional infiltration anesthesia.

 Our hypothesis is that anesthesia via QuickSleeper system can reduce pain during anesthesia and obtain a more rapid local anesthesia compared to the anesthesia via conventional technique by infiltration.
