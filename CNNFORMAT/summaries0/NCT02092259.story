(secondQuint)A Multi-Site Clinical Evaluation of the ARIES Norovirus Assay.

 The ARIES Norovirus Assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection of Norovirus GI/GII RNA from stool specimens obtained from symptomatic patients.

 The objective is to establish the diagnostic accuracy of the ARIES Norovirus assay through a multi-site, method comparison on prospectively collected leftover, stool specimens.

 Diagnostic accuracy will be expressed in terms of clinical sensitivity (or positive agreement) and specificity (or negative agreement).
