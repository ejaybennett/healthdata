(thirdQuint)Ultrasound and Near Infrared Imaging for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Monitoring.

 The investigators propose to validate the utility of the investigators novel hybrid imaging technique for accurate diagnosis of breast lesions, and for assessing chemotherapy response of cancer treatment and predicting treatment efficacy.

 The investigators unique hybrid technique is implemented by simultaneously deploying near infrared (NIR) optical sensors and a commercial ultrasound (US) transducer mounted on a hand-held probe, and utilizing co-registered lesion structure information provided by ultrasound to improve the inverse optical tomography reconstruction.

 As a result, the optical tomography assisted with US has overcome problems associated with intense light scattering and has provided reliable tumor angiogenesis distributions.

 Initial results with a group of 200 biopsied patients have shown that early stage invasive cancers present two-fold greater total hemoglobin concentration on average than fibroadenomas and other benign lesions.

 Initial results of advanced cancers have shown that the angiogenesis distribution is highly distorted and heterogeneous, and the distorted distributions correlate with histological microvessel density counts and can be used to assess chemotherapy response.

 Objective of this study is to validate the investigators initial results that NIR light guided by ultrasound can improve breast cancer diagnosis and monitor chemotherapy response.

 Ultrasound and Near Infrared Imaging for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Monitoring@highlight

An imaging method has been developed that uses near infrared light as an adjunct to ultrasound for better diagnosis and for monitoring tumor response.

 This study will use a new, non-invasive way to evaluate breast lumps using a low power light source & ultrasound to see if breast lumps are benign or cancerous.

 This study will also evaluate if this new technique might be useful in assessing response to chemotherapy.
