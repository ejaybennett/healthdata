(firstQuint)Changes in Tear Osmolarity Over Time With Sustained Use of TheraTears.

 The hypothesis is that the measured tear osmolarity from study participants decrease with sustained use of a over-the-counter artificial tears, TheraTears(R) lubricating drops, over an eight week period.

 Participant's dry eye symptoms would also improve with sustained use of TheraTears(R) lubricating drops.
