 Abuse Liability of Controlled-Release Oxycodone Formulations@highlight

The objective of this study is to examine the abuse liability of a single 40mg dose of 2 controlled release oxycodone formulations (Apo-Oxycodone CR(R) and OxyNEO(R)) in non-dependent recreational opioid users by assessing the self-reported acute effects of the drugs and taking blood samples to measure drug concentrations.

 The investigators think there may be differences in how well these drugs are liked when swallowed whole due to differences in how the products are formulated.
