(fifthQuint)Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Pediatric Patients.

 50 subjects (25 subjects with Crohn's Disease and 25 subjects with Ulcerative Colitis) who are 2 to 22 years of age will be enrolled in the trial over 3 years.

 The fecal donors, preferably a parent or sibling, will be extensively screened for infectious diseases prior to providing stool for the transplant.

 Patients who are failing primary therapy, are in a flare, and require restaging of their IBD by an endoscopy and colonoscopy will be approached for the study.

 Standard of care endoscopy and colonoscopy will be performed on each subject and 2 additional biopsies will be taken for analysis.

 Microbiota analysis will also be performed on both the donor and recipient stool sample prior to transplantation, and on the recipient sample at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months post transplantation.

 The primary objective will be to study the safety of FMT in all enrolled subjects.

 The study will also correlate efficacy and patient outcomes with the fecal microbiome prior to, and after FMT.

 The secondary objectives are to examine the efficacy of FMT in the treatment of children with IBD using the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and the Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) analysis.

 Correlate the patient outcomes with the fecal microbiome prior to, and after FMT.

A disturbance in the diversity of gut bacterial composition could be linked to several immune mediated diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).

 IBD can be classified into Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC).

 Both these diseases occur from abnormal immune reaction to resident gut bacteria.

The process of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) where fecal bacteria from a healthy individual is transferred into a recipient, has recently received attention as an alternative therapy for individuals affected with these life-altering diseases.

 In this study, the investigators will perform fecal transplantation on the subjects meeting inclusion criteria, to determine the efficacy and safety of this therapy in subjects with IBD (CD and UC) who are not responding to first line therapy, and are in a flare.
