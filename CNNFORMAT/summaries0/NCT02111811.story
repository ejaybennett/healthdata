(fifthQuint)Reducing the Burden of Depression Related Disability.

 With the goal of helping employed Veterans with depression to participate fully in the labor market, this randomized controlled trial has two objectives: 1) test the effectiveness of a new evidence-based, vocationally-focused telephonic counseling program for employed Veterans with depression, the Veterans Work and Health Initiative (V-WHI), which was developed by this study's research partners from the Tufts Medical Center; and 2) if the V-WHI is effective, quantify its return on investment.

 This study will test the impact of the V-WHI in combination with the Philadelphia VA's Primary Care Mental Health Integration program, the Behavioral Health Lab (BHL).

 The primary endpoints are pre/post changes in at-work performance and productivity scores based on the validated Work Limitation Questionnaire (WLQ).

 Secondary endpoints include changes in depression symptom severity (measured with the validated Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]).

 A return on investment (ROI) analysis will assess costs and benefits.

 For practical reasons, neither subjects nor the intervention providers will be blinded to subject assignment.

 After informed consent and eligibility screening, subjects are randomized to one of two groups: the V-WHI intervention group or to the usual care group (BHL).

 250 employed Veterans with depression and work limitations will be enrolled (half per group).

 The "usual care" group participants are assigned to standard behavioral health care.

 The second group, assigned to V-WHI services, is the experimental group.

 Participants in this group are assigned to an innovative program designed explicitly to address mental health and vocational issues that interfere with working (V-WHI) in addition to standard care.

 V-WHI counselors offer work coaching and modification strategies and work-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

 This counseling is provided solely over the phone with sessions every 2 weeks for 4 months (eight sessions total).

 At 8 months post-baseline, the V-WHI group is provided with a booster session.

 Participants in both groups are administered follow-up questionnaires at two time-points: month five (post-intervention) and month nine.

 Reducing the Burden of Depression Related Disability@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of a new telephone counseling program for employed Veterans with depression called the Veterans Work and Health Initiative (V-WHI).

 250 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of two groups: the V-WHI experimental group or usual mental health care.

 The V-WHI counselors will address mental health and job-related issues that interfere with working.

 This counseling is provided solely over the phone with sessions every 2 weeks for 4 months (eight sessions total).

 At 8 months post-baseline, the V-WHI group is provided with a booster session.

 Participants in both groups are administered follow-up questionnaires at two time-points: month five and month nine.
