(thirdQuint)Pharmacokinetic Study With Levodopa-carbidopa Fixed-dose Products in Healthy Subjects After Oral Administration.

 Isicom(R) 100/25 mg and Sinemet(R) (Trade name in Germany: Nacom(R)) 100/25 mg are authorised fixed-combination products containing 100 mg levodopa plus 25 mg carbidopa.

 These two formulations were tested for bioequivalence in 1997 (DESITIN trial No LCD-010/K); based on the regulatory provisions in place at that time (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), the two formulations could be accepted to be bioequivalent.

 The present study is proposed to be conducted in order to verify and confirm the bioequivalence of Isicom(R) 100/25 mg (test formulation) and Nacom(R) 100/25 mg (reference formulation) in agreement with the pertinent regulatory guidance that came in place 2010 (CHMP Guideline On The Investigation Of Bioequivalence - CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98- Rev.

 1/ Corr - Jan.

2010).
