(secondQuint)Effect of Prolonged PDE-5 Inhibition on Insulin Signaling in Skeletal Muscle.

.

 Participants enrolled in the study titled " Renin-angiotensin and fibrinolysis interaction in humans: effect of long-term PDE5 inhibition on glucose Homeostasis, (Specific aim 2)" will be offered the opportunity to participate in this sub-study.

 We will obtain skeletal muscle biopsies from 16 subjects who are enrolled in specific aim 2.

 Eight subjects will be in the sildenafil group and 8 subjects will be in the placebo group.

 Effect of Prolonged PDE-5 Inhibition on Insulin Signaling in Skeletal Muscle.

@highlight

Our research proposal will determine if PDE-5 inhibition exerts a favorable effect on insulin signaling pathways in skeletal muscle of subjects with impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance.
