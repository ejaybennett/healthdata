(secondQuint)Sevoflurane Decreases the Risk of Postoperative Delirium After Cerebral Hypoxemia During Surgery.

 The aim of the present study is to investigate whether in non-cardiac surgery the frequency of POD after intraoperative undeliberate cerebral saturation could be modulated by the choice of the anesthetic strategy (Volatile Induction and Maintenance of Anesthesia [VIMA] and Total Intravenous Anesthesia [TIVA]).

 Based on our previous data we hypothesized that incidence of POD would be lower with VIMA compared to TIVA.

The aim of this study is to distinguish possible differences in frequency of delirium after Volatile Induction and Maintenance of Anesthesia and Total Intravenous Anesthesia in case of undeliberate cerebral desaturation during non-cardiac surgery.
