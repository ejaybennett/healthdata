(thirdQuint)Effects of a Self-management Course for Adults on Sick-leave.

 The intervention course is a Danish adaptation of The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP), tailored towards workers on sick-leave.

 The original program has been developed by The Stanford Patient Education Research Center.

 The translation and adaptation has been conducted by The Danish Committee for Health Education.

 Previous studies have examined the program with respect to specific chronic diseases (e.

g.

, Arthritis), quality of life, well-being and health-care utilization, though non-otherwise specified workers on sick-leave and return work have not been examined before.

 The framework of CDSMP is social-cognitive learning theory in which self-efficacy plays a central role.

 Effects of a Self-management Course for Adults on Sick-leave@highlight

The purpose of the current study is to determine the efficacy of a self-management course for workers on sick-leave as an add-on to standard rehabilitation care and follow-up (treatment as usual).

 Outcomes are registry based measures of return to work, and questionnaire based measures of well-being and quality of life.

 We thus, hypothesize that the program will improve workers return to work rates and self-reported/psychological well-being.
