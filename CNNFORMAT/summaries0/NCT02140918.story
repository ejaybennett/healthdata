(fifthQuint)Fludrocortisone in Healthy Volunteers (AFLUCO4).

 In a previous study (AFLUCO2) in healthy volunteers with saline-induced hypoaldosteronism, the investigators found that single doses of both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone induced a significant decrease in the pressor response to phenylephrine, probably due to a rapid non-genomic vasodilatory mechanism, and that these effects were additive.

 The investigators also showed that, at the doses used in septic shock, hydrocortisone induced more pronounced mineralocorticoid effects than fludrocortisone and also induced systemic hemodynamic effects whereas fludrocortisone did not.

 The investigators now want to perform a dose-response study under normal conditions (ie without saline-induced hypoaldosteronism) and after repeated administrations, to determine the optimal dose of fludrocortisone that allows an increase in the pressor response to phenylephrine and to characterize its concomitant hemodynamic and biological effects.

 This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, 4-periods (fludrocortisone 100 1/2g/day, 200 1/2g/day, 400 1/2g/day, or placebo) study aims to investigate hemodynamic and biological effects of fludrocortisone administered orally during 5 days, in healthy volunteers.

 Each period will be separated from the next one by a washout interval of at least 14 days.

Fludrocortisone, in association with hydrocortisone, has demonstrated an improvement in survival in septic shock patients with relative adrenal insufficiency.

 However, the utility of low doses of steroids and in particular of mineralocorticoids in septic shock is still discussed.

 The purpose of the investigators study is to investigate the effects of 3 increasing doses of fludrocortisone (100 1/2g, 200 1/2g, 400 1/2g) in order to determine which dose allows the best pressor response to phenylephrine in healthy volunteers, and simultaneously assess their respective hemodynamic and biological effects.
