(secondQuint)Bone Marrow Stem Cell Treatment for Asherman's Syndrome and Endometrial Atrophy.

 This novel technique refers to the use of CD133+ autologous bone marrow stem-cells to regenerate the endometrium in patients with Asherman's Syndrome, Endometrial Atrophy or any condition that produce a destruction of the endometrium or its de novo creation in a bioengineered uterus.

 It requires a previous mobilization in the peripheral blood of CD133+ autologous bone marrow stem cells, subsequent apheresis and transplant of the same cells in the spiral arterioles of the uterus with the aim to regenerate de novo the endometrium.

 This technique represents a new therapeutical approach for the treatment of endometrial regeneration problems such Asherman Syndrome and the endometrial atrophy since currently no specific treatment for these endometrial pathologies exist.

 A prospective experimental non controlled study has been designed in order to assess the effectiveness of these technique as a new tool for treat Asherman's Syndrome and Endometrial Atrophy.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether Bone Marrow Stem Cell transplantation may improve Assisted Reproduction Techniques (ART) outcomes in refractive Asherman's Syndrome or Atrophic Endometrium.
