(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of Roxadustat to Treat Anemia in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease, on Dialysis.

 This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of roxadustat compared to epoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia in dialysis patients.

 Patients on hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) who have been treated with an erythropoietin analogue or have an indication for treatment with an erythropoietin analogue will be evaluated for eligibility and randomized at a 1:1 ratio to treatment with roxadustat (with discontinuation of prior erythropoietin analogue therapy) or to an active-control group treated with epoetin alfa.
