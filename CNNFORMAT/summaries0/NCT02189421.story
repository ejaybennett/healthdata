(thirdQuint)Multibending vs Conventional Endoscope for Direct Peroral Cholangioscopy.

 Direct POC using an ultra-slim upper endoscope permits various diagnostic and/or therapeutic intraductal interventions under direct endoscopic visualization in selected patients who has dilated distal CBD and widened papillary orifice.

 Because the bile duct has anatomical position in acute angle with the duodenum, assisting accessories such as intraductal anchoring balloon, guidewire or overtube is usually required for the successful direct POC.

 Recently, direct peroral cholangioscopes have been developed for free-hand direct advancement of the endoscope into the bile duct from duodenum.

 Multibending ultra-slim endoscope may be expected to facilitate the advance into the bile duct by overcoming the acute angle between the bile duct and the duodenum.

 After randomization of enrolled patients into two groups, direct POC will be performed by using a conventional slim endoscope in control group and by using a multibending endoscope in study group.

 Multibending vs Conventional Endoscope for Direct Peroral Cholangioscopy@highlight

The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of a newly developed multibending ultra-slim upper endoscope for the successful direct peroral cholangioscopy (POC) without assisting accessory in comparison with conventional ultra-slim endoscope.

 The investigators expect that multibending endoscope will show more higher successful performance than conventional endoscope.
