(fifthQuint)The Measurement-based Care in Patients With Depressive Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

 Objective: To compare the effectiveness and feasibility of the measurement-based care (MBC) in the treatment of depression with clinician's treatment decisions, standardizing treatment (ST, clinicians' choice decisions) to two commonly prescribed antidepressants.

 Methods: Selecting the patients in psychiatric hospitals and general hospitals with depression, with multi-center randomized controlled study design.

 Refer to STAR-D "measurement-based care" mode, to establish the whole measurement-based evaluation system.

 Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to 24 weeks of MBC or ST, restricting treatment to paroxetine (20-60mg/day) or mirtazapine (15-45mg/day) in both groups.

 the ST group will maximize simulate of the actual clinical situation, and the patients of the MBC group are required to complete the prospective Life-chart Methodology (LCM-p), 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report (QIDS-SR16) and other related symptoms and side effects of self-assessment, the doctor will make a comprehensive assessment according to the results of self-assessment, adjust treatment according to research programs.

 This is 1-year follow-up study; the independent members will have a blinded assessment in the baseline visit and each point of view.

 Depressive symptoms are measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) and QIDS-SR.

 The Measurement-based Care in Patients With Depressive Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial@highlight

In recent years, measurement-based care (MBC) has been gaining more attention in the treatment of depression because it allows psychiatrists to individualize treatment decisions for each patient based on the change of psychopathology and tolerance toward antidepressants.

 Several studies, such as the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial using MBC, found that MBC-informed sequential algorithms can be successfully integrated into clinical practice and improve patients' outcomes However, despite a strong theoretical rationale for MBC and data supporting the ability to implement MBC in clinical practice settings, there is currently no randomized controlled trial in MDD patients comparing MBC with usual/standard care.

 The investigators compare MBC with clinician's treatment decisions, standardizing care to two commonly prescribed antidepressants.

 Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the effects of MBC in patients with MDD compared to standard treatment (ST).

 The research hypothesis is that compared to ST, the estimated time to response and to remission would be significantly shorter in the MBC group without increased dropout rates and side effect burden.
