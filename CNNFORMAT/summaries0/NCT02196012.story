(firstQuint)A Technology-Based Intervention for the Reduction of Overweight and Obesity Among College Students.

 A randomized controlled trial design will be employed to investigate the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of a technology-based weight loss pilot intervention for the reduction of overweight and obesity in college students.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) 8-week intervention group, or (2) 8-week attention control group.

 Both conditions include 8 weekly lessons over 8 weeks.

 Undergraduate students (n=100) age 18-22 years who are overweight or obese (BMI 25 kg/m2) will be recruited from the University of Tennessee Knoxville.

 Measurements will be taken at baseline and 8 weeks.

 Since the study is a technology-based intervention, research staff will collect height and weight measures for BMI through a novel approach, utilizing Skype video conferencing.
