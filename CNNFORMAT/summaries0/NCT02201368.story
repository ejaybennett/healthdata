(secondQuint)Triheptanoin Treatment Trial for Patients With Long-chain Fatty Acid Beta-oxidation Defects.

 Triheptanoin treatment, in patients with long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation defects, could cause not only a great improvement in their quality of life, also could prevent life-threatening signs, reducing symptoms and serious complications of their disease, like cardiomyopathy, Reye-like syndrome episodes and rhabdomyolysis.

 This result would occur by the effect of propionyl CoA primer on the Krebs cycle and, at the same time, would produce a gluconeogenic effect.

 This treatment opens the door to be used in other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, glycogen storage disease and other diseases with energy problems.

 All patients will be followed up until 16 months.
