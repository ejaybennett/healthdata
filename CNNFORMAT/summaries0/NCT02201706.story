(thirdQuint)Multi-electrocoagulation Retinectomy for Retinal Re-detachment in Silicone Oil Filled Eye.

 The relaxing retinectomy is a useful surgery for retinal re-detachment in eyes with silicone oil filled.

 However, it has some obvious disadvantages such as the cut of the normal retina surrounding, leaving a large area of retinal deficiency and significant exposure of retinal pigment epithelium and choroid membranes.

 In this study, we try to apply a modified surgery named Multi-electrocoagulation retinectomy to re-attach the retina.

 Instead of cutting through the proliferated retina directly, this new surgical approach adopts to cut the retina apart in a honeycomb shape with the help of electrocoagulation.

 In this way, we not only relax the traction of the proliferative membranes, but also reserve the rest retina to cover the RPE layers.

 Based on the hypothesis above, we are aiming to explore the safety and efficacy of this new surgical approach.

 Multi-electrocoagulation Retinectomy for Retinal Re-detachment in Silicone Oil Filled Eye@highlight

Retinal re-detachment in silicone oil filled eye, especially in the traumatic eye, is a complex retinal detachment with poor prognosis.

 In this study, the investigators try to apply a modified surgery as Multi-electrocoagulation retinectomy to reattach the retina.

 Here the investigators aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of this new surgical approach
