(fifthQuint)Re-Step: Dynamic Balance Treatment of Gait for Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) Victims.

 Study design: Type of research: Prospective, exploratory, clinical, interventional trial Specific objectives are: To explore the efficacy of Re-step rehabilitation technology to improve dynamic balance in gait of people after Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).

 The investigators suggest a new technology of intervention that will induce unexpected changes of underfoot slopes, with Re-Step shoes, during walking and will force the central nervous system (CNS) to react and solve walking problems in real time.

 The investigators propose that the new approach will have a significantly motor function improvement on balance in gait, transferred to real environmental settings and be retained for long periods of time.

 Research methods: Subjects: A total of 60 subjects of ABI victims will be studied in one treatment group-Re-Step shoes walking training Time flow protocol: Telephone calls to patients of rehabilitation clinics and call for participation in the papers Recruiting subjects according to inclusion/exclusion criteria, after medical examination and consent of subjects Tests and measures (see outcome measures) will be applied to measure changes - TO - before starting the intervention to form a base line - T1 - after 20 sessions of intensive treatments 60 min each, 2-3 sessions a week.

 For each subject 10-12 weeks of treatment.

 - T2 - 6 months after T1, a period of normal daily schedule of subjects, of no interventions, to check retaining of training results.

 For each subject 10-12 weeks of treatment.

 The treatments will start in a week from T0; the T1 will be performed in a week after training was completed; T2 will be performed 6 months (take or leave 2 weeks) after T1.

 The recruitment and training of participants will go on according to availability of facilities not more than 24 months.

 Re-Step: Dynamic Balance Treatment of Gait for Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) Victims@highlight

The purpose of this study is to: 1.

 Test the walking functionality of people following Acquired brain injury (ABI) 2.

 Suggesting a new treatment for their walking impairments 3.

 Follow-up of motor learning ability and balance after intervention within this population The investigators intend to target dynamic stability and gait after ABI, in a group of individuals with ABI who have persistent balance and mobility deficits despite being able to walk independently and having high scores on standard clinical balance measures.

 Interventions: Training with Re-Step system shoes.

 In this study there is no control group.
