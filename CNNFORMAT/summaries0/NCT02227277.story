(fifthQuint)Reducing Proviral HIV DNA With Interferon-a.

 Our long-term goal is to evaluate the effect of pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) as an anti-HIV reservoir immunotherapy that could potentiate eradication strategies against HIV.

 The present study is a 3-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT).

 The aim of this study is to determine whether a 20-week treatment course with 11/2g/kg/week of pegylated interferon alpha 2 b (peg-IFN-2b) will reduce the levels of HIV-1 proviral DNA levels in circulating PBMC and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) in HIV-infected individuals receiving long-term ART.

 In addition, we will study if a 4-week interruption of ART is necessary to observe any change in proviral DNA levels.

 In our previous study (NCT00594880) with a different form of Interferon alpha (peg-IFN-2a), we observed a reduction in proviral DNA in peripheral blood cells in 50% of the patients.

 However, we did not measure the levels in MALT, and we could not determine whether or not an interruption of ART was necessary.

 The present study will address these questions.

 We will also seek to determine the biological mechanisms (such as an increase in Natural Killer cell cytotoxicity) that mediate the antiviral effects of peg-IFN-.

 Reducing Proviral HIV DNA With Interferon-a@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with pegylated interferon alpha 2b (peg-IFN-2b) will reduce the amount of integrated HIV DNA in peripheral blood cells and tissues of individuals with chronic HIV infection receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART).

 A reduction and/or clearance of the latent viral reservoir (i.

e.

: virus that remains dormant in HIV-infected subjects receiving suppressive treatment ) is considered essential for HIV eradication.

 By measuring the changes in integrated proviral HIV DNA, which is considered a surrogate measure of the latent reservoir, the investigators will establish if peg-IFN-2b treatment should be considered as a component of future viral eradication strategies.
