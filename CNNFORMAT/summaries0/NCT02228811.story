(secondQuint)A Study of DCC-2701 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 This is a first-in-human study of DCC-2701.

 The primary purpose of this study is to determine what dose of DCC-2701, can be given safely to patients with advanced solid tumors.

 The study will have two phases.

 The first phase will assess escalating doses of DCC-2701 in order to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and the optimal dosing regimen (ODR) of DCC-2701.

 Once the MTD and ODR is established, a dose expansion phase will further evaluate the safety of DCC-2701, as well as the activity of DCC-2701 in select solid tumor types.
