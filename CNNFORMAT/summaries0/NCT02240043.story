(thirdQuint)Growth Hormone Evaluation in the Elderly People.

 subjects over 65 years old were recruited from the geriatric ambulatory unit of our hospital to voluntarily participate in a research study concerning the GH and ACTH axis in the elderly, which included the realization of the glucagon stimulation test as the first phase of the study.

 The GST (Glucagen(R) Hypokit, Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark) was the chosen test to assess both ACTH and GH release because of its few known contraindications and mild side effects.

 It is a provocative test to evaluate GH and ACTH axis, i.

e, a diagnostic test, without therapeutic effects.

 Growth Hormone Evaluation in the Elderly People@highlight

The aim of this study is to evaluate the growth hormone (GH) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion in elderly without hypothalamic-pituitary disease using the glucagon stimulation test (using Glucagen(R) Hypokit, Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark) and evaluate some parameters such as sarcopenia, nutritional state, bone mineral density, frailty criteria with secretion of GH.
