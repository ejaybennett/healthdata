(thirdQuint)Effects of Clinical Music Improvisation on Resiliency in Adults Undergoing Infusion Therapy.

 The purpose of this research study is to examine clinical music therapy's impact on the resiliency of adults undergoing infusion therapy.

 This research study is being undertaken to learn about how creative music therapy modalities can affect the infusion therapy process.

 Infusion therapy often includes side effects which impact quality of life.

 Symptoms include pain, nausea and anxiety.

 For newly diagnosed patients anxiety accompanies adjustment to scheduling treatments and side effects.

 Typically patients receiving infusion therapy have no alternative focus for their mind and or body aside from the Infusion itself.

 Since the relationship between pain and anxiety is inter-related, altering one modality through a live music intervention may modify the impact of the other modality thus shifting the cycle and overall impact of pain and anxiety providing relief which leads to self soothing control measures.

 The current research will enroll patients newly diagnosed with either Lung, Breast, or Gastrointestinal Cancer that are treated in the Infusion Suite of SLRHC.

 100 patients will be randomly assigned to three groups: clinical instrumental improvisation, clinical vocal improvisation or control.

 All enrolled participants will complete a survey which indicates their music preference, Resiliency Test , the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Body Pain Scale - Color Analysis Scale (CAS).

This study will investigate the impact of music therapy on newly diagnosed patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy.

 Measurements used at baseline, middle and end of first cycle will be the Resiliency Scale (Wagnild and Young 1993); The HADS scale (hospital anxiety depression scale, Zigmond and Snaith 1983 )and and The CAS scale for pain (Color Analysis Scale).
