(fifthQuint)Diabetes CKD Lifestyle Technology Study.

 The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test a lifestyle intervention in obese individuals with t2dm and concurrent stage 2-4 ckd.

 The counseling intervention will be based on social cognitive theory and supported by mobile (ipad) self-monitoring.

 Mobile self-monitoring is featured in the intervention to encourage vigilance to the diet in a manner that is not burdensome, enhance self-efficacy by integrating complex information regarding the ckd dietary regimen with a calorie-restricted diet, and permit real-time monitoring of weight, blood glucose, blood pressure, and self-reported diet and physical activity by the study team.

 Specifically, the investigators will develop the methods for and pilot test the ckd lifestyle intervention in stage 2-4 ckd patients and explore the impact of the intervention on: (a) weight and fat mass, (b) blood pressure, (c) physical activity, (d) urinary sodium excretion, (e) serum phosphorus and calcium-phosphorus product, (f) kidney function as measured by serum cystatin-c, and (g) serum lipids.

 Additionally, we will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention in terms of: (h) recruitment and retention, (i) time and cost associated with training ckd patients in technology-based self-monitoring and in delivering the intervention, (j) patterns of self-monitoring adherence over time, and (k) participant satisfaction with the intervention.

 Finally, we will describe: (l) the extent to which the intervention differentially adversely affects the nutritional health of participants as evidenced by low serum albumin or serum prealbumin; a body mass index (bmi) that falls below 20kg/m2; and subjective assessment of nutritional risk (e.

g.

 Nausea, diarrhea, anorexia).

 Diabetes CKD Lifestyle Technology Study@highlight

The purpose of this study is to pilot test an mHealth technology-supported behavioral intervention designed to engage patients with diabetes and concurrent chronic kidney disease (CKD) in multiple behaviors which aim to reduce CKD progression.

 Participants will be randomized to the 6-month lifestyle intervention or to a wait-list control.

 The lifestyle intervention will be modeled after that used in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and the counseling intervention will be based on SCT, which will be paired with mobile technology-based dietary and physical activity monitoring.

 The wait-list control will receive 6 months of standard medical care followed by a delayed, but less intensive, 6-month intervention.
