(firstQuint)A Trial to Evaluate the Superior Mesenteric Vein (14V) Lymphadenectomy for Distal Advanced Gastric Cancer.

 Radical surgery is still the only possible way to cure gastric cancer.

 In Japan, South Korea and other countries, due to the popularity of screening and Improved surgical procedures, there has been great improvement in overall survival.

 Standard D2 Gastrectomy has been the standard operation for advanced gastric cancer.

Till now, it is difficult to stage the 14V lymph node as regional lymph nodes metastasis or distant metastasis.

 And it is urgent to explore the necessity of 14v lymph node dissection in advanced gastric cancer.

So a prospective randomized controlled study will to carry out to evaluate the effects of D2 radical gastrectomy plus 14v lymph node dissection compared with D2 radical gastrectomy.
