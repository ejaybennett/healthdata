(secondQuint)Comprehensive Genomic Analysis in Tissue and Blood Samples From Young Patients With Lung Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To perform comprehensive genomic analysis of young lung cancer patients' samples to facilitate delivery of targeted therapies and clinical trial enrollment.

 II.

 To characterize the impact of young age at lung cancer diagnosis on the genomic landscape of primary lung cancer.

 III.

 To establish a prospective registry of young lung cancer patients for both tumor and germline next generation sequencing.

 OUTLINE: Tissue and blood samples are analyzed via next generation sequencing and whole exome sequencing.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 3 years.

 Comprehensive Genomic Analysis in Tissue and Blood Samples From Young Patients With Lung Cancer@highlight

This research trial studies genomic analysis in tissue and blood samples from young patients with lung cancer.

 Identifying specific gene mutations (changes in deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]) may help doctors tailor treatment to target the specific mutations and help plan effective treatment.
