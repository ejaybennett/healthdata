(fifthQuint)Closed-loop Control of Overnight Glucose Levels (Artificial Pancreas) in Type 1 Diabtes Adults With Hypoglycemia Unawareness and Documented Nocturnal Hypoglycemia.

 Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels, insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings.

 A dual-hormone closed-loop strategy would regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon.

 The investigators aim to conduct the 1st randomized cross-over trial comparing single- hormone and dual-hormone closed-loop strategy to regulate overnight glucose levels.

 The investigators aim to compare the two interventions for 10 hours in two subgroups of adults with type 1 diabetes.

 Patients from both subgroups will present documented nocturnal hypoglycemia.

 One subgroup will consist of patients with hypoglycemia unawareness while the other subgroup will consist of patients with hypoglycemia unawareness.

 This study will allow to determine if there is a greater benefit of a closed-loop strategy in a higher-risk hypoglycemia unaware group.

Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels, insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings.

 A dual-hormone closed-loop strategy would regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon.

 The main objective of this project is to compare the efficacy of single-hormone and dual-hormone closed-loop strategy to regulate overnight glucose levels in a in-patient study in type 1 diabetes adults with hypoglycemia unawareness and documented nocturnal hypoglycemia.

 The investigators hypothesized that dual-hormone closed-loop strategy is more effective in regulating overnight glucose levels compared to single-hormone closed-loop strategy.
