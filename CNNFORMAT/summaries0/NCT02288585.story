(thirdQuint)The Effect of Plant Sterols on the Blood Lipid Profile of Subjects With and at High Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

 The main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of plant sterols on fasting triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol concentrations.

 This study also aims to study the effect of plant sterols on fasting total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol concentrations and Lipoprotein (a).

 Furthermore the effects of plant sterols on fasting blood glucose and insulin will be explored.

 At last, in a sub-group, at end of intervention the acute, chronic and acute upon chronic effect of plant sterols on postprandial blood lipids, glucose and insulin responses during a mixed meal challenge rich in fat and carbohydrates will be explored.
