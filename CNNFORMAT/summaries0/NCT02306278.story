(fifthQuint)The Effects of Gabapentin Premedication on Neurosurgery.

 This is a random, double-blind study.

 In GG, patients are given gabapentin 600mg orally at the night and 2hours before surgery, respectively.

 In PG, vitamine pills are given instead.

Total intravenous anesthesia is applied for all patients.
