(secondQuint)Depression Therapy to Improve Cardiovascular Risk in HIV.

 The objectives of this study will be met by performing a 24-week, randomized, controlled, single-blinded, two-arm, parallel group, pilot trial at a single center.

 A total of 200 subjects may be screened to identify 110 participants to be enrolled and randomized.

 These participants will be 18 years old, have been receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least one year with an HIV viral load < 75 copies/mL at screening, and have major depression using the PHQ-9 questionnaire.

 These participants will be randomized 1:1 to either depression treatment with the Beating-the-Blues cognitive behavioral therapy program (N=55) or usual care (N=55).
