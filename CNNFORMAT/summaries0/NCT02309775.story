(fifthQuint)Auriculotherapy in Tension-type Headache Due to Temporomandibular Dysfunction.

 This is an experimental clinical trial in which will be selected at the University, 40 students with tension-type headache due to temporomandibular dysfunction.

 Among the selected subjects will be randomized by blind draw into two groups: intervention group (IG) and placebo group (GII).

 The instruments that will be used for the evaluation are the visual analog pain scale, the Survey questionnaire for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC) 3, and surface electromyography (EMG System of Brazil).

 The EMG signals will be collected in the rest position (3 samples) and maximum voluntary isometric contraction (3 collections).

 The masseter and temporalis muscles bilaterally will be evaluated according to the protocol of Rodrigues.

 For treatment of Ear, initially cleaning the pinna is made to be manipulated with 70% alcohol and later will be inserted mustard seed with a tape in the following points: Shenmen, Sympathetic, Kidney, subcortex, Adrenal and Brain second Souza in GI and GII point of the trachea.

 Such treatment will last 15 minutes each session, being held 2 times a week, alternating the ear to be manipulated over a period of 5 weeks.

 For comparison between groups the Mann-Whitney test statistic with Software BioStat 4.

0 software will be used.

 With a significance level (p <0.

05).

Objectives: Verify the effect of auriculotherapy in patients with tension-type headache resulting from temporomandibular dysfunction.

 Design: Randomized clinical study Setting: Randomized Study Participants: The study consist of 38 participants randomized into two groups: an intervention group (n = 18, sample loss = 1) and placebo group (n = 20, sample loss = 6) Interventions: The intervention group will receive treatment with auricular acupuncture in the Shen Men, Kidney, Sympathetic, Subcortex, Adrenal and Cerebral points.

 The placebo group will receive auriculotherapy in the trachea point.

 Main outcome measures: visual analog scale for pain pain (VAS) and surface electromyography (EMG).
