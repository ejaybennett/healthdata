(firstQuint)Expression of TIM-3 on Lymphocytes in Sepsis.

 Immunosuppression is the leading cause of death in septic patients.

Lymphocyte apoptosis has been recognized as an important step in the pathogenesis of sepsis.

 Previous studies indicated that T cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein 3 (TIM-3) is a type I cell surface protein and was identified as a marker of lymphocyte dysfunction.

 The current project was designed to examine the express TIM-3 on lymphocytes and monocytes and its further role in immunosuppression during sepsis.
