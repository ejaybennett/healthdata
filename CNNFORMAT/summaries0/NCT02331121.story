(fifthQuint)Multimedia First Aid Program for Families.

 Program content was based on the American Heart Association's (AHA) 2010 guidelines for CPR and first aid training.

 The Online IMM course was designed to teach participants in six modules: Principles of care; CPR for infants; CPR for children; How to relieve infant choking; How to relieve child choking; and Preventing injuries.

 Participants were also able to view text articles on first aid topics, such as Wound care or Caring for burns.

 Although the users of the Online IMM training program did not have direct contact with a manikin during their training, there were opportunities to practice CPR skills through the use of interactive animations.

 These animations demonstrated and then encouraged users to practice key functions similar to actual CPR skill delivery: including the location, depth and rate of compressions, opening the airway and giving breaths.

 Participants were encouraged to view the entire program; however, they could navigate and review all program content as much or as little as desired.

Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death for children and infants under 14 years of age.

 Many of these deaths are preventable, in part by promoting injury prevention behaviors but also by administering effective emergency first aid techniques until advanced care arrives.

 This project created a web site program that paired video-based instruction with interactive skills training to teach parents of children birth to 12 years old basic first-aid and CPR skills, and that included the option to practice skills as needed.
