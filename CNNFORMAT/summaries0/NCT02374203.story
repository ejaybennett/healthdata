(thirdQuint)Nutritional Intervention Study in the Critically Ill Ventilated Patient.

 Background: Presently, the Harris-Benedict equation (BEE) multiplied by the stress factor and activity factor is used to calculate the total calorie needs of critically ill patients.

 Clinically however, there are variations in the definitions for stress and activity factors which could lead to errors in calculated results.

 The Indirect Calorimetry (IC) measurement is the gold standard to measure the critically ill patient's actual energy needs, since the relationship of measured energy expenditure (EE) and estimated basal EE (BEE) according to different age groups are taken into account.

 It is recommended that enteral nutrition be initiated within the first 24 to 48 hours of ICU admission.

 A high protein hypo-caloric (15 kcal/kg; 1.

7 g / kg protein) diet can reduce the risk of multi-organ failure and hyperglycemia.

 Aim: The investigators first aim is to compare the EE and BEE in critically ill patients in Taiwan.

 The second aim of this study is to examine protein requirements in different age groups in critically ill patients, and their relationship to factors causing inadequate enteral nutrition, duration of mechanical ventilation, newly diagnosed infection and duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay.

 Method: Critically ill patients, 20 years or older, who are mechanically ventilated and on nasogastric tube feeding will be selected.

 Exclusion criteria are the use of total parenteral nutrition, APACHE score 5 days, brain death, terminal cancer and those on pacemaker.

 After evaluation of nutrition and calorie requirements using IC measurement and H-B formula calculation, patients will be 1:1 randomized to the following two tube feeding regimens: 1.

 Original formula: supply energy according to the original feeding formula and high protein formula.

 The calories will be first be increased to reach the required energy needs (HB*1.

0~1.

3) then the amount of protein will be gradually increased to the reach the target value.

 2.

 Adjusted formula: supply adequate protein intake initially (>1.

5 gm/kg BW; renal and liver failure: 0.

8 ~ 1 gm/kg IBW); then gradually increase the calorie intake till the target is achieved.

 Data collection: 7 days feeding volume, gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, abdominal distension, gastric residual volume, etc.

), reasons for discontinuing enteral feeding (GI bleeding, investigations), duration of discontinued enteral feeding, diagnosis, other comorbidity, underlying disease, APACHE score, anthropometry, the type and daily amount of intravenous nutrition (calculated calories and protein), biochemistry, number of days on ventilator, newly diagnosed infection (ventilator associated pneumonia, urinary tract infection or bacteremia) duration of ICU stay, mortality, etc.
