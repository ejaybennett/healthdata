(secondQuint)Modified Diet Trial: A Study of SMT C1100 in Paediatric Patients With DMD Who Follow a Balanced Diet.

 Primary Objective: To determine the plasma concentration of SMT C1100 calculated at each time point for each subject (sample size (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), percentage of coefficient of variation (%CV), geometric mean, median, minimum, and maximum for the parent and the major metabolites).

 Secondary Objectives: 1.

 To determine the safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of SMT C1100 in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) by assessing the participants adverse events, ECG results, vital signs and laboratory tests.

 2.

 To evaluate the diurnal variability in the steady state PK of SMT C1100 calculated at each time point for each subject (sample size (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), percentage of coefficient of variation (%CV), geometric mean, median, minimum, and maximum for the parent and the major metabolites).

 3.

 To evaluate reductions in creatine phosphokinase as a potential pharmacodynamic (PD) marker of SMT C1100 activity and clinical benefit.

 Modified Diet Trial: A Study of SMT C1100 in Paediatric Patients With DMD Who Follow a Balanced Diet@highlight

Placebo-controlled, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind dose escalation study.

 The aim is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of SMT C1100 in paediatric patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) who follow a balanced diet.
