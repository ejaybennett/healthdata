(secondQuint)A Study of Ganetespib in Combination With Chemoradiation.

 Study Groups: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to a dose level of ganetespib based on when they joined this study.

 Up to 3 dose levels of ganetespib will be tested.

 The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level.

 Each new group will then receive a higher dose level than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects are seen.

 This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of ganetespib is found.

 All participants will receive the same standard dose level of paclitaxel and carboplatin.

 Study Treatment: Participant will also receive radiation therapy for 5 days a week (Monday-Friday) for about 5 1/2 weeks.

 Each radiation treatment will take only a few minutes, but the appointment will last about 1 hour.

 On the first day of radiation (Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday) and then every week after that during radiation, participant will receive ganetespib.

 Participant will also be given paclitaxel by vein over about 1 hour and carboplatin by vein over about 30 minutes.

 Study Tests: Each week during treatment for Weeks 1, 2, and 3: - Participant will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (up to 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - Participant will have an EKG right before the ganetespib infusion and then 24hours after the ganetespib infusion.

 Each week during treatment for Weeks 4 and 5: - Participant will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (up to 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - Participant will have an EKG right before the ganetespib infusion.

 Participant will have another EKG 24 hours after the infusion if they have a previous abnormal EKG result.

 Participant's dose of ganetespib may be adjusted or stopped at any time based on their EKG results.

 About 6 weeks after treatment, participant will have the following tests and procedures to help their doctor decide if they should have standard of care surgery: - Participant will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (up to 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - Participant will have an FDG-PET/CT scan and/or CT scan to check the status of the disease.

 - Participant will have an endoscopic biopsy to check the status of the disease.

 Surgery: If participant's doctor decides they should have surgery, the surgery will be performed at MD Anderson about 8 to 10 weeks after finishing chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

 If participant needs surgery, they will be given a separate consent form that describes the surgery and its risks.

 At the time of surgery, participant will have a physical exam as part of routine care.

 Length of Treatment: Participant will receive the treatment for up to 6 weeks.

 Participant will no longer be able to receive treatment if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.

 Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

 Follow-up Testing: If the disease comes back while participant is on study, the following tests will be performed: - Participant will have a physical exam.

 - Participant will have an endoscopic biopsy to check the status of the disease.

 - If not already done, participant will have a CT scan or an FDG-PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.

 Participant will be asked to return to the clinic for follow-up tests.

 Participants will have follow-up visits every 3 months for up to 1 year, unless they are taken off study.

 After 1 year, participant will have follow-up visits about every 4 months in the second year after radiation therapy, and then about every 6 months for the next 3 years.

 At these follow-up visits, the following tests will be performed: - Participant will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (up to 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - Participant will have a PET/CT and/or CT scan to check the status of the disease.

 - If participant's doctor thinks it is in their best interest, they will have an endoscopic biopsy to check the status of the disease.

 - Participant will also receive nutritional assessment and counseling, if needed.

 This is an investigational study.

 Ganetespib is not FDA approved or commercially available.

 It is currently being used for research purposes only.

 Paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiation therapy are all FDA approved and considered standard treatment for esophageal cancer.

 The combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin, ganetespib, and radiation therapy is investigational.

 The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

 Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.

 A Study of Ganetespib in Combination With Chemoradiation@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of ganetespib that can be given in combination with standard chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) and radiation therapy in patients with esophageal cancer.
