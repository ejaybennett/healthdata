(fifthQuint)Cognitively Augmented Behavioral Activation for Veterans With Comorbid TBI/PTSD.

 Veterans historically exhibit high rates of comorbid mTBI/PTSD.

 Given the comorbidity and neuropsychiatric symptom overlap of these disorders, it can be difficult to determine whether problems and disruptions in functioning are due to mTBI, PTSD, or both.

 Hence, it is challenging for providers to know how to prioritize these patients' clinical issues and how to effectively treat them.

 Currently, there are no evidence-based treatments for comorbid mTBI/PTSD.

 Further, it is unclear to what extent existing treatments for each disorder can be adherently and effectively implemented for the other.

 As such, most current treatment recommendations suggest a holistic or integrated approach to treatment for comorbid mTBI/PTSD targeting symptoms and functionality rather than underlying etiology.

 Investigators are proposing a treatment for comorbid mTBI and PTSD that directly targets daily functioning and quality of life.

 The study design makes use of the convergent availability of resources at the two participating Veterans Administration Health Care Systems in Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington to conduct a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of CABA.

 The study will recruit a total of 192 Veterans less than or equal to 55 years of age, 96 participants at each site, enrolled at participating VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) who are diagnosed with both mTBI and PTSD.

 Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either the CABA or Treatment as Usual (TAU) group.

 Participants in the CABA group will receive the CABA intervention during the first 14 weeks of their participation in the study, whereas TAU participants will continue to receive TAU (usual care in a PTSD specialty treatment clinic, but no CABA) during their participation in the study.

 Both groups will undergo evaluations at baseline, 7 weeks (mid-treatment), 14 weeks (post-treatment), and 39 weeks (6 month follow-up).

 During their study participation, all participants will continue to receive their usual medical care.

 Cognitively Augmented Behavioral Activation for Veterans With Comorbid TBI/PTSD@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Cognitively Augmented Behavioral Activation (CABA), a new hybrid treatment for Veterans diagnosed with comorbid mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

 The study's specific goals are to determine whether: 1) CABA reduces PTSD symptoms in Veterans with mTBI/PTSD, 2) CABA reduces cognitive-related functional impairment in Veterans with mTBI/PTSD, 3) CABA results in improvements in depression symptoms, cognitive functioning, and quality of life in Veterans with mTBI/PTSD; and 4) CABA is an acceptable treatment for Veterans with mTBI/PTSD.

 The overall goal is to develop an evidence-based manualized treatment for comorbid mTBI/PTSD that can be readily implemented in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) treatment settings.
