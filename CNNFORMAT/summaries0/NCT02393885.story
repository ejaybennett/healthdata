(secondQuint)Pivotal Study Of A Dual Epicardial & Endocardial Procedure (DEEP) Approach.

 The objective of this study is to establish the safety and effectiveness of a dual epicardial and endocardial ablation procedure for patients presenting with Persistent Atrial Fibrillation or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation utilizing the AtriCure Bipolar System and AtriClip(R) PRO LAA Exclusion System in an endoscopic or open ablation procedure, followed by an endocardial mapping and ablation procedure utilizing commercially available RF based, irrigated, power controlled, ablation catheters for endocardial lesions.

 The endocardial procedure will be staged to occur after 90 days post epicardial surgical procedure.
