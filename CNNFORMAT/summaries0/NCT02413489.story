(fifthQuint)An Efficacy and Safety Proof of Concept Study of Daratumumab in Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma, Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, and Follicular Lymphoma.

 This is an open label (everyone knows the study intervention), Phase 2 study to evaluate efficacy and safety of daratumumab in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma.

 The study will have three phases.

 Screening phase, treatment phase, follow-up phase.

 Participants will receive daratumumab (16 milligram per kilogram [mg/kg]) as intravenous infusion approximately 3.

5 years.

 Participants will primarily be assessed for overall response rate.

 Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

The purpose of this study is to assess overall response rate [ORR, including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)], of daratumumab in participants with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [a cancer of the lymph nodes (or tissues)-NHL] and to evaluate association between ORR and CD38 expression level in order to determine a threshold for CD38 expression level in each NHL subtype, above which daratumumab activity is enhanced in participants with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma.
