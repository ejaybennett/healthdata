(fifthQuint)Effects of a Psycho-cognitive Nursing Intervention on Patients' Outcomes in Critical Illness.

 In previous research on the impact of stress on physiology, it has been shown that stress and its molecules may contribute to derangements prevalent in critical illness, including systemic inflammation, cellular stress, oxidative damage, endothelial dysfunction and coagulopathies which precipitate high mortality and morbidity.

 Investigators will examine whether a Psycho-cognitive nursing intervention to induce relaxation can improve patients outcomes.

 Sixty ICU patients with or without SIRS will be randomized to receive either standard care or a brief Psycho-cognitive Nursing Intervention, plus standard care, up to 5 days during ICU stay.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a psycho-cognitive nursing intervention including relaxation, guided imagery, touch and music listening can improve the clinical and psychological outcome of critically ill patients.

 The investigators hypothesize that, patients who receive the proposed psycho-cognitive nursing intervention will report lower stress, less pain and have altered level of stress neuropeptides in peripheral blood, lower levels of inflammatory molecules, less complications and better self reported lived experience than patients who receive standard care alone.
