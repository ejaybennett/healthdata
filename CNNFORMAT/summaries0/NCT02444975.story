(secondQuint)The Effect of Increased Water Intake on the Frequency of the Clinical Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections in Pre-menopausal Women: S-HYDRACYST.

 This study aims to assess the effect of increased daily water intake on the frequency of clinical, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) among low drinking pre-menopausal women suffering from recurrent community-acquired UTI over 12 consecutive months of study product consumption.

 It is a prospective, single site, open-label, randomised controlled trial in two parallel groups: - Control group: not changing their fluid intake habits - Intervention group: provided with mineral water, fluid intake recommendations and regular hydration coaching support The study population consists in pre-menopausal women diagnosed with recurrent UTIs and having a 'low drinker' profile.

 The total number of randomized subjects in this study is estimated at 140.

 The study will include only women who are low-drinkers (< 1.

5 L fluids per day; urinary volume < 1.

2 L per day) since they are most likely to have a predisposition to UTIs due to infrequent voiding.
