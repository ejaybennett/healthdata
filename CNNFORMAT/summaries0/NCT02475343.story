(thirdQuint)A Novel Method to Assess the Cornea Biomechanical Properties With Schiotz Tonometer.

 Schiotz tonometer, since it firstly be developed more than 100 years ago by Hjalmar Schiotz, has been regarded as a classical method to evaluate intraocular pressure (IOP).

 In present study, we aims to measure the corneal biomechanical properties with schiotz tonometer and elucidate the clinical significance of this novel measurement.

 The corneal biomechanical property was calculated with subtracting the value displayed under loaded weight 5.

5g from that under loaded weight 7.

5g.

 We named the corneal biomechanical properties obtained with schiotz tonometer as Mulee factor, and the formulation is Mulee factor=value under loaded weight 7.

5g (Value 7.

5G)-value under loaded weight 5.

5g (Value 5.

5G).

 A Novel Method to Assess the Cornea Biomechanical Properties With Schiotz Tonometer@highlight

This study aims to use Schiotz tonometer to evaluate the corneal biomechanical properties.

 The administration of Schiotz tonometer is according to the routine protocol which is use to measure intra-ocular pressure.

 The results obtained from Schiotz tonometer will be compared with results obtained from ORA and/or Corvis.
