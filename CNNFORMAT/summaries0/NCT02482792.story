(secondQuint)Norwegian Psychomotor Physiotherapy in Patients With Long-lasting Musculoskeletal Pain.

.

 The NPMP is based on the assumption that patients with long-lasting problems, physical and/or psychological, may react with general aberrations related to posture, respiration, and movements, as well as with muscular tension and skin changes.

 Employees With Long lasting musculoskeletal pain problems, working in the Municipality of Bergen, will be invited to participate in an Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT), and randomized to either receive Norwegian Psychomotor Physiotherapy (NPMP) or a series of Cognitive Patient Education in combination with active individual physiotherapy (COPE-PT).

 The aim is to examine the effect of NPMP compared to those receiving COPE-PT on pain, function, quality of life and sick-leave.
