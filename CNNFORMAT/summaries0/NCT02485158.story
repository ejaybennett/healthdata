(thirdQuint)Individual Differences in the Response to Drugs.

 Here, the investigators aim to investigate whether individuals exhibit similar responses to three different drugs from different classes.

 This study used a within-subjects design (total N = 24).

 All subjects received alcohol, amphetamine and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a double-blind, double-dummy fashion.

 Subjects completed six sessions wherein they received either alcohol, amphetamine, or THC, or corresponding placebos, on separate days.

 Subjects completed questionnaires about mood, general drug effects, and specific drug effects.

 Individual Differences in the Response to Drugs@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine whether individual differences in acute responses to drugs co-vary across three drugs from different drug classes: alcohol, amphetamine and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

 The investigators hypothesize that individuals who experience greater rewarding effects from one drug will also experience more rewarding effects from the other drugs.
