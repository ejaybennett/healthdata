(fifthQuint)Trial of Topotecan With VX-970, an ATR Kinase Inhibitor, in Small Cell Cancers Amd Extrapulmonary Small Cell Cancers.

 Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis.

 Although highly responsive to chemotherapy initially, SCLC typically relapses quickly and becomes refractory to treatment within a few months.

 There is only one FDA approved treatment for patients with relapsed SCLC after first-line chemotherapy: topotecan, which inhibits religation of topoisomerase I-mediated single-strand DNA breaks leading to lethal doublestrand DNA breaks.

 The survival of some SCLC cells despite initial tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy suggests the existence of a highly effective DNA damage response network.

 SCLC is characterized by high replication stress (RB1 inactivation, MYC and CCNE1 activation) and defective ATM-p53 signaling pathway, which cause an excessive reliance on ATR for survival following DNA damage.

 We hypothesize that a combination of ATR kinase inhibition with DNA damaging agents such as topotecan will provide an attractive synthetically lethal therapeutic option for SCLC.

 VX-970 is a potent and selective kinase inhibitor of ATR, and in vitro data support the hypothesis that ATR inhibition can improve SCLC responses to DNA damaging agents.

 Primary objectives: Phase 1: To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topotecan in combination with VX-970.

 Phase 2: To assess the efficacy with respect to clinical response rate of a combination of topotecan and VX-970 in the second-line treatment of patients with SCLC.

 Eligibility: Both Phase 1 and 2: Subjects must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age and have a performance status (ECOG) less than or equal to 2.

 Subjects must not have received chemotherapy, or undergone major surgery within 4 weeks and radiotherapy within 24 hours prior to enrollment.

 Phase 1: Subjects with histologically confirmed SCLC, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and neuroendocrine cancers, and at least one prior chemotherapy.

 Patients with other histolgies will be allowed if no standard treatment options exist.

 Patients with evaluable, but not measurable disease will be eligible for Phase I.

 Phase 2: Subjects with histological confirmation of SCLC and one prior platinum-based chemotherapy.

 Patients with both platinum-sensitive and platinum-refractory disease will be eligible.

 Patients must have measurable disease to be eligible for Phase II.

 Design: Participants meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive topotecan and VX-970 administered every 21 days (1 cycle), until disease progression or development of intolerable side effects.

 Blood and hair samples will be collected at multiple time points during cycle 1 (pre-treatment on day 1, post treatment on days 2, and 3) for PD analyses.

 Tumor biopsies, which are optional, will be obtained at baseline, during the first treatment cycle (approximately 15 hours after the first dose of VX-970 on day 3) and at disease progression except for subjects at the first dose level.

 Participants at the first dose level will undergo biopsies on day 3 prior to third dose of topotecan.

 Participants will be monitored weekly during the first cycle by clinic visit and basic labs.

 Toxicity will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.

0, and tumor assessments will be made using CT scans (chest, abdomen and pelvis) at baseline and after every 2 cycles according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.

1.

 Follow-up for survival will be carried out every 3 months.

 Trial of Topotecan With VX-970, an ATR Kinase Inhibitor, in Small Cell Cancers Amd Extrapulmonary Small Cell Cancers@highlight

Background: Chemotherapy damages cancer cell DNA so the cells die and the tumor shrinks.

 But it may stop working in some people over time.

 This is partly due to efficient DNA damage repair mechanisms used by tumor cells.

 VX-970 may stop cancer cells from preventing the repair of DNA damaged by chemotherapy.

 The purpose of this study is to see if using the chemotherapy drug topotecan along with the drug VX-970 will improve the response to chemotherapy.

 Objective: To study the safety and efficacy of VX-970 and topotecan in treating small cell lung cancer.

 Eligibility: Adults at least 18 years old with small cell lung cancer .

 Design: Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood and heart tests, and scans.

 Most of these tests are part of their routine care.

 Most of these tests will be repeated throughout the study.

 The study is set in 21-day cycles.

 Participants will get topotecan IV on days 1 through 5.

 They will get VX-970 IV on day 5 alone or on day 5 and day 2.

 Participants doctors will monitor them weekly for the first cycle, every 3 weeks after that.

 For Part 1 of this Study the doses of topotecan and VX-970 will be increased (according to the Protocol) to determine the maximum safe dose of the combination.

 The maximum safe dose of the combination is the dose at which no more than 1 in 6 people have an intolerable side effect.

 More participants will join in Phase 2.

 They will take the drugs at the maximum safe dose, on the same schedule as the drugs were taken in Phase 1.

 Participants will give samples of blood, hair, and tumor tissue (optional) at different times.

 They will discuss side effects at every visit.

 A month after stopping taking the drugs, participants will have a physical exam and blood drawn.

 They will have follow-up phone calls every 3 months.
