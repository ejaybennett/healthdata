(fifthQuint)The Role of Nerves in the Heart That Trigger Pulmonary Vein Extra Beats.

 Any patients referred for symptomatically and clinically indicated AF ablation studies will be recruited.

 180 patients undergoing first time ablation for documented paroxysmal AF ablation.

 1.

 Catheter ablation within the left atrium that electrically disconnects these veins form the rest of the left atrium (pulmonary vein isolation)90 patients 2.

 Catheter ablation around the nerve supplying the heart and destroying the collection of these nerve endings (ganglionic plexi ablation)90 patients Follow Up Period: 1 year The Time Frame of the study is 1 year.

 At this point the outcome will be assessed and the data will be presented at 18 months.

 Patients will undergo routine pre and post op checks for assessment as per optimal clinical follow up.

 Pre procedure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be used for registering anatomy onto 3D location systems.

 However In addition we will assess pre-existing atrial scar which has been associated with clinical outcomes on previous studies.

 We will ensure equal numbers of patients in both low and high scarring groups.

 All patients will have an MRI scan of the heart pre procedure to assess for pre-existing scar and at 3 months following the procedure to detect areas where the burns have been made.

 In addition to the usual clinical outcomes burden, we will look at clinical outcome rates of atrial burden.

 The patients will have a 48 hour monitor at 3,6,9 and 12 months to assess the response to the treatment.

 All patients will be reviewed at 3 months post procedure for symptoms and again at 6 months with both a heart monitor and symptom questionnaire to determine if a redo procedure is required.

 In addition, all patients will undergo a repeat MRI scan at 3 months to look for scaring of the heart.

 Some patients may require a repeat procedure if they have documented recurrence.

 There is a 3 month blanking period which is ignored as part of the healing process, however the following 3 months will be assessed for recurrence hence a minimum of 6 months prior to consideration of a redo procedure.

 If the patient gets symptomatic documented AF lasting >30 seconds than a redo AF ablation procedure will be offered to the patient as per standard clinical practice.

 The procedure will be pulmonary vein isolation for both groups with the ganglionic plexi arm receiving a lesions encircling the pulmonary veins.

 This will enable the study to report outcomes from 3 groups.

 End points will be compared by Primary- Documented recurrent atrial arrhythmia lasting >30secs.

 (after a blanking period of 8 weeks) on 48 hour holter.

 Secondary- Mortality,Redo-AF ablation procedure, Major complications (stroke, pericardiocentesis, bleed requiring transfusion) Statistical methodology The primary endpoints will be analysed in the two groups by the Fisher's test.

 The Role of Nerves in the Heart That Trigger Pulmonary Vein Extra Beats@highlight

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm disorder which can significantly affect a patient's quality of life.

 Abnormal electrical activity from the 4 veins that drain into the left atrium (top left chamber of the heart), is the main cause of this condition.

 Catheter ablation and this involves making tiny burns within the left atrium that electrically disconnects these veins form the rest of the left atrium (pulmonary vein isolation).

 Abnormal electrical activity can be as a result of the nerves supplying the heart and destroying the collection of these nerve endings (ganglionic plexi ablation) can be helpful in eliminating the abnormal electrical activity.

 Catheter ablation for AF and study the affect of ganglionic plexi ablation on the success of this treatment option.

 All patients will be grouped by low or high preexisting scar.

 The investigators plan to recruit patients undergoing ablation with proportionate numbers in both existing scar groups.

 Patients will be randomly assigned into the two treatment groups each with different treatment strategies 1.

 Pulmonary vein isolation alone 2.

 Ganglionic plexi ablation alone There will be pre and post procedure tests as per optimal clinical practice.

 Some patients may require a repeat procedure if they have documented recurrence.

 This will be done after a minimum of 6 months.

 The redo-procedure will be pulmonary vein isolation for both groups with the ganglionic plexi arm receiving a lesions encircling the pulmonary veins.

 This will enable the study to report outcomes from 3 groups.
