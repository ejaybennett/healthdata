(thirdQuint)A Roll-over Study With Rilpivirine for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) Infected Participants Who Participated in the Rilpivirine Pediatric Studies.

 This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter (more than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a study), roll-over study to provide continued access to RPV for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected participants.

 All enrolled participants will continue to receive RPV in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen consisting of 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs).

 Participants will continue to receive RPV in this study until they no longer benefit from RPV treatment, they meet at least 1 of the withdrawal criteria, or RPV is licensed for adult/pediatric use (depending on the age of the participant) and/or is available/accessible outside of a clinical study setting, whichever comes first.

The purpose of this study is to provide continued access to rilpivirine (RPV) for participants who were treated with RPV in a clinical development pediatric study with rilpivirine and who, at the time of roll-over, experience and are expected to continue experiencing clinical benefit from RPV treatment.
