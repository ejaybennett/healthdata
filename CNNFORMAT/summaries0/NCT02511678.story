(secondQuint)Multicenter Study of Cryoablation for Palliation of Painful Bone Metastases.

 Patients with painful metastatic lesions involving bone who meet the eligibility criteria and who have been determined to be an appropriate candidate for cryoablation therapy will be offered enrollment into the study.

 Patients agreeing to participate will read and sign an informed consent form and thus become subjects in the study.

 Treatment will be performed using a Galil Medical cryoablation system and Galil Medical cryoablation needles.

 Subjects will have one cryoablation procedure and will be followed for up to 6 months for palliation of pain, quality of life and analgesic usage.

 Baseline and follow-up data will be collected for each subject via a web-based electronic data collection tool.

 Multicenter Study of Cryoablation for Palliation of Painful Bone Metastases@highlight

This study will evaluate the efficacy of cryoablation for palliation of painful metastases in patients with metastatic lesions involving bone who have failed, are not candidates for, or are not experiencing adequate pain relief from current pain therapies (e.

g.

 radiation, analgesics).
