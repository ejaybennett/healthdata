(fifthQuint)Effect of Beetroot Juice on Coronary Blood Flow and Walking Performance in PAD.

 Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and negatively affects functional capacity and quality of life for as many as 14 million patients in the U.

S.

 alone.

 One open-label study showed that acute consumption of beetroot juice improved 6 min walk performance, reduced blood pressure, and enhanced leg muscle oxygenation in PAD patients.

 However, no studies have rigorously confirmed these findings in a double-blind manner, nor have the effects of this supplement been investigated (acutely or short-term) in the coronary circulation of PAD patients.

 In addition to studying its effects on graded treadmill walking performance and consequent large artery vasodilation, the present study will examine the effects of short-term beetroot juice consumption (twice/day) on both coronary and leg vasodilator (graded calf flexion) and vasoconstrictor (isometric handgrip, voluntary apnea) responses in patients with PAD.

 Participants will randomly consume either nitrate-rich or nitrate-depleted beetroot juice with a 7 to 14 day wash-out period between.

 Effects of beetroot juice consumption on plasma nitrate, nitrite and methemoglobin will also be assessed.

 Effect of Beetroot Juice on Coronary Blood Flow and Walking Performance in PAD@highlight

In this study the investigators will test the hypothesis that short-term consumption of inorganic nitrate (supplied in concentrated beetroot juice) enhances coronary blood flow responses, large artery hemodynamics, and leg oxygenation/exercise tolerance in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

 Understanding and improving blood flow regulation in the heart and skeletal muscles of patients with PAD is important because exercise triggers symptoms of leg pain and substantially raises blood pressure and myocardial demand in these patients.
