(secondQuint)Randomized Trial of Continuous Versus Intermittent Cefotaxime Infusion on ICU.

.

 Critically ill patients have other pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles than healthy volunteers.

 Suboptimal, both under- and overdosing of antibiotics is an important threat in this patient category.

 Given the time-dependent character of beta-lactam antibiotics continuous dosing as opposed to traditional intermittent dosing is likely to render better target attainment and maintenance and might improve clinical outcome.

 Randomized Trial of Continuous Versus Intermittent Cefotaxime Infusion on ICU.

@highlight

This study evaluates target attainment after either intermittent intravenous bolus or intravenous continuous infusion of cefotaxime in critically ill patients.

 Critically ill patients will be randomized to intermittent infusion or continuous infusion of cefotaxime.
