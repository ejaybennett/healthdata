(secondQuint)Acupuncture on Post-Stroke Overactive Bladder.

 Current practice in management of OAB is quite limited.

 Acupuncture, which is a major treatment modality of traditional Chinese medicine, has also claimed to have favourable therapeutic effect on OAB.

 Previous study found that acupuncture at the BL-33 point was effective for controlling the overactive bladder.

 Although acupuncture has been shown to be effective in treating OAB, there has been no randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of acupuncture on patients with post-stroke.

 Given the high incidence of OAB in post-stroke patients, potentially effective alternative treatments should be investigated.
