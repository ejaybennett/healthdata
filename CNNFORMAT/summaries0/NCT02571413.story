(thirdQuint)Evaluation of the Animated Cartoon-aided Teaching of Intranasal Corticosteroid Allergic Rhinitis.

 The study was a prospective randomized control trial in children aged 5 - 16 years with moderate to severe intermittent or persistent AR who had never used INCS.

 The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups; 1) Teaching how to use INCS by oral presentation and 2) by animated cartoon-aided teaching.

 Successful achievements were recorded when the patients were able to use INCS (all five-point checklists) correctly.

 If they were unable to use the INCS correctly after the first teaching, the same instruction would be repeated and the second assessment would be performed.

 Evaluation of the Animated Cartoon-aided Teaching of Intranasal Corticosteroid Allergic Rhinitis@highlight

Correct methods and compliance of intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) is very important for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR).

 The animated cartoon-aided teaching of INCS administration was created to decrease workload of health care professionals.

 The aim of this study is to compare the achievement of the children with AR in using INCS between the group which were instructed by animated cartoon-aided teaching or oral presentation without demonstration.
