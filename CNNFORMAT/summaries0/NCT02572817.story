(firstQuint)Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of High-Titer Versus Low-Titer Anti-Influenza Immune Plasma for the Treatment of Severe Influenza A.

 Despite antivirals and vaccines, influenza is responsible for thousands of hospitalizations and deaths each year worldwide.

 Because of this, additional treatments for influenza are needed.

 One potential treatment may be the use of high-titer anti-influenza immune plasma.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with high-titer versus low-titer anti-influenza immune plasma, in addition to standard care, in participants hospitalized with severe influenza A infection.

 This study will enroll people aged 2 weeks or older who are hospitalized with severe influenza A infection.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either high-titer anti-influenza plasma or low-titer (control) anti-influenza plasma on Day 0.

 In addition, all participants will receive standard care antivirals.

 Participants will be assessed on Day 0 (baseline) and on Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 28.

 For participants who are not hospitalized on Days 2, 14, and 28, researchers may contact participants by telephone.

 Study procedures will include clinical assessments, blood collection, and oropharyngeal swabs.
