(thirdQuint)Recovery of Hibernating Myocardium in End Stage Heart Failure.

 Clinical, echocardiographic and hemodynamic data will be obtained from the patients' medical records.

 Assessment of viability will be performed using a Tl-201 Rest-Redistribution Scintigraphy protocol within 2 weeks before LVAD implantation and 2 months after LVAD implant.

 Recovery of myocardial function will be assessed using available 2D transthoracic echocardiographic images and with the novel imaging modality, Speckle Tracking Echocardiography (STE), in order to provide a regional quantification of the myocardium, in the context of TL-201 results.

 Transthoracic echocardiograms will be performed 2 weeks prior to the LVAD implant and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after implantation.

 Recovery of Hibernating Myocardium in End Stage Heart Failure@highlight

This study will collect clinical, echocardiographic, nuclear imaging and hemodynamic data in a group of patients with end stage ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation to investigate the incidence of recovery of myocardial function when supported with LVADs, and to study the association between hibernating myocardium and myocardial recovery in this population.
