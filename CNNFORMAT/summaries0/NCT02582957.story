(secondQuint)Sigh Ventilation to Increase Ventilator-Free Days in Victims of Trauma at Risk for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

 Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) as a result of injuries resulting from penetrating or non-penetrating trauma who are intubated and receiving invasive mechanical ventilation will be randomized to either usual care or usual care with the addition of sigh breaths given once every 6 minutes.

 Patients will be randomized to one of the two study arms as soon as possible, but not longer than 24 hours after initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation.

 Patients will be followed for 28 days to assess ventilator-free days (VFDs), mortality, ICU-free days, and the occurrence of complications.

A randomized, concurrent controlled trial to assess if adding sigh breaths to usual invasive mechanical ventilation of victims of trauma who are at risk of developing ARDS will decrease the number of days they require invasive mechanical ventilation.
