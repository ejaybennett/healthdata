(firstQuint)Effect of Posture and Passive Cycling on Cardiac Autonomic Control System in Children With Severe Cerebral Palsy.

 Standing position is a routine therapeutic tool for improving bone density in children with cerebral palsy.

 The autonomous immediate response for these children is defective.

 In recent years it has been shown that there is an association between bone density and autonomic function .

 In this paper the investigators will examine how the addition of movement to standing subjects contribute to changes in heart rate and blood pressure.

 The hypothesis is that the integration of movement while standing presents a change in the autonomic response and thus may improve bone density.
