(secondQuint)Clinical Research Platform Into Molecular Testing, Treatment and Outcome of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma Patients.

 Thorough knowledge of the treatment reality, e.

g.

 characteristics, diagnostic, treatment and outcome of unselected patients in real-life practice, is crucial to evaluate and improve the quality of care for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 The purpose of CRISP is to set up a national clinical research platform to document uniform data on the molecular testing, treatment, course of disease in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC not amenable to curative treatment.

 A particular focus is on molecular biomarker testing of patients before the start of first-line treatment.

 The data shall be used to assess the current state of care and to develop recommendations concerning topics that could be improved.

 PRO assessment will provide large-scale data on quality of life and anxiety/depression for real-life patients in routine practice.

 In addition, two questionnaires (concerning individual quality of life and patient-caregiver communication) will be validated in German patients with metastatic NSCLC.

 Furthermore CRISP will set up a decentralized clinically annotated tissue repository for future collaborative, investigational scientific biomarker testing.
