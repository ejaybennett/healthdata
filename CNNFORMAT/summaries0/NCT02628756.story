 working-channel is guided through the cervical canal with normal saline as distension medium, with flow manually regulated through the key of the hysteroscopic sheath.

 The examination of the uterine cavity begins by observing its regularity, paying special attention to the presence of intrauterine malformations or morphologic alterations such as submucous myomas, or uterine septa.

2 mm working channel, and will be used to generate a local injury on the upper posterior endometrium (Endometrial Snip) at midline 10-15 mm from the fundus on D4 to D7 of the ongoing menstrual cycle.

 The depth and width of the injured site will be about 2x2 mm (i.

e a single bite of the claw forceps).

Women between 18-39 years old who had been infertile (primary or secondary) for at least 1 year were recruited.

 In a parallel assignment eligible participants were randomized to receive either a single, site-specific endometrial injury guided by hysteroscopy (Study group) or no intervention (Control group).

 Natural cycle folliculometry + timed sexual intercourse were offered for all participants for the ongoing and the immediate 2 concecutive cycles.

 Clinical pregnancy rates were the primary outcome and miscarriage rates were the secondary outcome measures.
