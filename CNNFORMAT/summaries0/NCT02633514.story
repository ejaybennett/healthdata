(firstQuint)Adjuvant Treatment for Incomplete Resection Thymoma or Thymic Carcinoma.

 The previous trials have showed that radiotherapy was significantly associated with prolonged OS and chemotherapy is playing an increasing role in treatment of patients with thymoma or thymic carcinoma.

However,whether patients with thymoma or thymic carcinoma could benefit from adjuvant radiochemotherapy after incomplete resection remains controversial.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate whether adjuvant radiochemotherapy after incomplete resection can improve survival for thymoma or thymic carcinoma.
