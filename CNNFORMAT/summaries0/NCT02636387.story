(secondQuint)Desmopressin as a Therapy for Bedwetting in Children With Sickle Cell Disease.

 Night time bedwetting is a common complication of sickle cell disease, and affects up to 30 % of children .

 Desmopressin is an oral medication that increases water reabsorption in the kidneys.

 Studies have shown that it is effective in decreasing bedwetting episodes in children without sickle cell disease.

 Chronic sickling episodes causing damage to the kidneys could cause permanent damage and may make this treatment ineffective in sickle cell disease.

 The investigators designed this trial to definitively answer this question by randomizing the patients to give half of the children placebo and the other half titrated doses of desmopressin.

 This trial will inform pediatric sickle cell doctors if desmopressin is an appropriate treatment for bed wetting in the investigators patients.
