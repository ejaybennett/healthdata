 Once the patients are diagnosed to have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) lupus nephritis and they satisfy the inclusion criteria , they will be informed about the nature and severity of the disease and about the expected treatment options and the duration of treatment.

 After providing written informed consent, eligible patients will be stratified into two groups.

 Block randomization will be done to generate random allocation sequence.

They will receive either a low dose or high dose Cyclophosphamide as per the protocol mentioned below: Group I : Low dose arm : Intravenous cyclophosphamide fixed pulse 500 mg each 2 weekly total 6 doses followed by azathioprine 2 mg/kg.

 Group II : High Dose arm : Intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy 750 mg/m2 will be given every 4 weekly for total 6 doses followed by azathioprine 2 mg/kg.

 Intravenous methylprednisolone pulses 1 gm each will be given for 3 days in both the treatment arms followed by prednisolone 1 mg/kg for 4 weeks and then tapering 5 mg every 2 weeks.

 Additional drugs as per indication like hydroxychloroquine, antihypertensives and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis shall also be given unless contraindicated.

 Comparison of Low Dose Versus High Dose Cyclophosphamide as Induction Therapy in the Treatment of Lupus Nephritis@highlight

This study will be conducted to find out whether low dose or high dose cyclophosphamide therapy is effective in the treatment of proliferative lupus nephritis.

It will also compare the side effects and risks of infection in low dose and high dose cyclophosphamide group.

 Half of the participants will receive a low dose cyclophosphamide for 3 months and half will receive high dose cyclophosphamide therapy monthly for 6 months followed by azathioprine 2 mg/kg.
