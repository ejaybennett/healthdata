(fifthQuint)Effects of Teriflunomide (Aubagio) on Cognitive and Vocational Outcomes in Multiple Sclerosis.

 Summary: Objectives: The primary aim of this study is to define the effect of teriflunomide (Aubagio(R)) on cognitive abilities in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS).

 There are two secondary objectives, to [a] relate changes in cognition to vocational problems, and [b] determine MRI correlates of change in cognition, more specifically gray-matter (GM) volume metrics which the investigators believe reflect neurodegeneration.

 Design: This is a prospective, observational, single-blinded, longitudinal study of teriflunomide effects on cognitive performance in MS patients over 24 months.

 Neuropsychological status and 3T MRI will be assessed at baseline, 12 months and 24 months.

 Vocational status will be assessed every three months via the internet.

 Statistical analysis will emphasize within-subjects changes in all metrics to maximize statistical power.

 Study Population: Thirty (30) relapsing MS patients and 30 healthy controls (HC) will be enrolled in the study.

 Outcomes: An information processing speed index and a memory composite index will be calculated from conventional, validated neuropsychological tests as recommended by consensus opinion publications.

 Conventional clinical metrics for overall neurological disability will also be assessed.

 Vocational performance will be monitored using a newly developed online survey called the Multiple Sclerosis Vocational Monitoring Survey (MSVMS).

 Regional GM atrophy, as defined by measurement of thalamic and cortical atrophy, will serve as neurodegeneration outcomes.

 Significance of the research: The effect of teriflunomide on the development of cognitive impairment and vocational capacity is unknown.

 This study will elucidate the effect of teriflunomide on these important outcomes.

 Effects of Teriflunomide (Aubagio) on Cognitive and Vocational Outcomes in Multiple Sclerosis@highlight

Cognitive impairment is common in MS and has devastating impact on functional activities.

 There is a great demand for medications that will enhance cognitive capacity in MS patients.

 The effect of teriflunomide on cognition and vocational capacity is unknown.

 The investigators will address these questions in a sample of 30 relapsing MS patients treated with teriflunomide.

 Cognitive impairment will be measured by calculating an information processing speed index and a memory composite index from conventional, validated neuropsychological tests as recommended by consensus opinion publications.

 Vocational performance will be monitored using a newly developed online survey called the Multiple Sclerosis Vocational Monitoring Survey (MSVMS).

 This study will elucidate the effect of teriflunomide on these important outcomes.
