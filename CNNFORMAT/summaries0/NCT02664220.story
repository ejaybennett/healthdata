(secondQuint)Dilute Povidone-iodine Irrigation vs No Irrigation for Children With Acute, Perforated Appendicitis.

 Postoperative intra-abdominal abscesses are common occurrences after perforated appendicitis in pediatric patients despite utilization of evidence-based practices.

 Povidone-iodine is a commonly used antiseptic in surgical procedures and has been shown to be effective in reducing postoperative abscesses in adults with perforated appendicitis.

 This trial will be the first to rigorously test the efficacy of povidone-iodine irrigation in children and to verify its safety profile in this patient population.

The goal of this study is to compare the efficacy of PVI irrigation to no irrigation for decreasing postoperative intra-abdominal abscesses in children with perforated appendicitis.

 Additionally, this study aims to verify the safety profile of dilute PVI for intra-abdominal irrigation.
