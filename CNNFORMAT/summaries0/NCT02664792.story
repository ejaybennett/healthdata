(secondQuint)Use of [18]F-FDG on PET/CT as an Alternative Non-invasive Method for Staging of Lung Cancer.

 The main aim of this study is to validate the [18F]FDG on PET/CT for the diagnosis of metastatic ganglions at the mediastinum in SUS patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma considering sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy.

 Other specific aims are: - Analyze the diagnosis performance of the [18F]FDG on PET/CT in two timepoints (1 and 2 hours after exam), in relation to the staging of the non-small cell lung carcinoma - Evaluate the addition of the iodinated contrast in the [18F]FDG to improve the images obtained from the PET/CT in the staging of the non-small cell lung carcinoma.

 Use of [18]F-FDG on PET/CT as an Alternative Non-invasive Method for Staging of Lung Cancer@highlight

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the 18Fluor-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) in the Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) as compared to mediastinoscopy for staging of non-small cel lung carcinoma.
