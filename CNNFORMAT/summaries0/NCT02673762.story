(fifthQuint)Salivary Transcriptome Biomarkers for Early Diabetes Detection.

 Prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) methods will be employed to collect saliva and evaluate transcriptome markers for early pre-diabetes and type II diabetes identification.

 At risk patients will have fasting blood glucose and insulin levels measured along with hemoglobin A1c and 2 hour post-prandial glucose levels.

 Saliva samples will be stored and will be analyzed after pre-specifying a panel of mRNAs and a multi marker model for validation.

 The pre-specified mRNAs and multi-marker model will be determined after analysis of data from a currently ongoing case-control study.

 After analyzing the data from this prior trial a validation plan will be locked before analysis of the prospectively collected specimens.

 Pre-diabetes will be defined based on abnormal glucose tolerance tests.

 Insulin resistance will be calculated as HOMA IR.

 The diagnostic value of the salivary transcriptome for will be compared with that of hemoglobin A1c and fasting blood glucose for the detection of pre-diabetes, insulin resistance and type II diabetes.

A PRoBE design study will be used to obtain saliva from patients before undergoing blood study evaluation for screening at risk patients for the presence of undiagnosed pre-diabetes of type II diabetes.

 Pre-specified saliva biomarkers will be evaluated along with multi-marker models for their discriminatory value for distinguishing patients with normal glucose metabolism from those with disease.

 Appropriate housekeeping genes will also be incorporated to allow for the measurement of relative gene expression.
