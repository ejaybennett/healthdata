(secondQuint)The Effect of Resistance Training on Proprotein Subtilisin Convertase Kexin 9 Level After Coronary Bypass Surgery.

 The PCSK9 level will be measured before and after cardiac rehabilitation program (around 2-4 weeks), and will be compared between two groups.

 ELISA method will be used to measure plasma PCSK9 level.
