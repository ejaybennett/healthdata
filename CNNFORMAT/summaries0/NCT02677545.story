(thirdQuint)Ticagrelor Versus Clopidogrel in Carotid Artery Stenting.

 Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an emerging treatment for atherosclerotic carotid stenosis.

 The main adverse event is embolic stroke during the procedure.

 Current medical management to prevent peri-procedural embolisation consists of dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin.

 Ticagrelor, a novel reversible inhibitor of the platelet adenosine diphosphate receptor P2Y12, was superior to clopidogrel, as add-on therapy to aspirin, in preventing stent thrombosis, cardiovascular outcome events, and death in patients undergoing coronary artery stenting, without causing an increase in major bleeding events.

 This study aims to test the hypothesis that ticagrelor is superior to clopidogrel as add-on to aspirin in preventing cerebral embolism during the CAS procedure.

 Ticagrelor Versus Clopidogrel in Carotid Artery Stenting@highlight

Patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis in whom carotid artery stenting is planned are randomised between antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor plus aspirin or clopidogrel plus aspirin and examined with brain MRI before and after stent treatment.

 The proportion of patients with new ischaemic lesions on MRI after treatment is compared between the two groups.
