(thirdQuint)Ultrasound-guided Serratus Plane Block for the Quality of Recovery After Modified Radical Mastectomy.

 A total of 72 subjects (36 patients for each groups) were enrolled in this study.

 Patients were allocated to either the general anesthesia group (group control) or SPB (serratus plane block) + general anesthesia groups (group SPB) using randomized central computer-generated sequence software (SAS 19.

0).

 The allocation ratio was 1:1 for the two groups.

 Group assignment was concealed by opaque sticking envelops.

 The major research content is to evaluate the quality of recovery using 40 questionnaire (QoR-40).

 Ultrasound-guided Serratus Plane Block for the Quality of Recovery After Modified Radical Mastectomy@highlight

Regional anesthesia improves quality of recovery after surgery in many studies.

 Ultrasound-guided serratus plane block is a novel technique which may be a viable alternative to current regional anesthetic techniques.

 This randomized, controlled trial is to examine the effects of ultrasound-guided serratus plane block anesthetic on the QoR after breast tumor resection.
