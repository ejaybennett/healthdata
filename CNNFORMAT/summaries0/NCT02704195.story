(firstQuint)Subthalamic Nucleus Stimulation Effect on Gait Symmetry and Freezing of Gait.

 Unilateral modulation of subthalamic stimulation and its impact on freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease will be studied.

 In a cross-over, doubleblind, randomized study, a 30% reduction of stimulation intensity of the less impacted side will be compared with chronic treatment with regard to frequency and duration of freezing of gait episodes.
