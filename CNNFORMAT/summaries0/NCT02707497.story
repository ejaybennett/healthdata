(thirdQuint)The Effect of Recombinant Human Thrombopoietin on Septic Shock With Thrombocytopenia.

.

 Sepsis is a high morbidity and mortality in critical care unit.

 Clinically, we found that secondary thrombocytopenia was common in the patients with septic shock, and the incidence can be as high as 55%.

 Moreover, many studies have shown that thrombocytopenia is an early prognostic marker in septic shock and an independent risk factor for the mortality of septic shock.

 And then, it has been reported that early recovery from thrombocytopenia helps to prevent the coagulopathy and decreases the mortality.

 At present, the managements of sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia are mainly platelet transfusion and platelet-increased drugs.

 Because of source scarcity, transfusion-related infectious and immunological complications, platelet transfusion is limited in the clinical treatment.

 So, the use of platelet-increased drugs for replacement therapy becomes an inevitable trend.

 The primary purpose of this study is to explore the effect of platelet-increased drugs(rhTPO) on the 28-day mortality among septic shock patients with thrombocytopenia.

 The study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, open-label, ,randomized, placebo-controlled study in 5 tertiary academic medical centers which are medical, surgical or general ICUs.

 Patient enrollment is expected to last up to 42 months.

 They will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio into two groups.

 Both groups receive appropriate medical support and treatment based on guidelines issued by the surviving sepsis campaign.

 The intervention group will receive rhTPO at a dose of 15000u/d, subcutaneous injection, for 7 consecutive days.

 It will be terminated when platelet counts(PCs) are increased by 50*10^9/L for 3 consecutive days compared with PCs at baseline, or PCs are more than 100*10^9/L, or the duration of rhTPO is more than 7 days.

 Time from randomization to administration of rhTPO will be within 24 hours.

 The control group will not use any platelet-increased drugs.

 Platelet transfusion is advised to be administered when PCs are below 10*10^9/L in the absence of apparent bleeding or below 20 *10^9/L if the patient has a significant risk of bleeding in both two groups.

 Patients will be followed for 28 days.

 PCs will be monitored every day until 14 days, followed by tests twice a week.

 Liver and renal function, coagulation function, inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, PCT), and the severity of the disease(SOFA, APACHE) will be monitored before treatment, followed by tests twice a week.

 And then, the number of platelet transfusion, the length of ICU stay, days free from advanced cardiovascular/respiratory/ renal support, bleeding events, and any adverse effects will be recorded before and after treatment.

 The Effect of Recombinant Human Thrombopoietin on Septic Shock With Thrombocytopenia.

@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether recombinant human thrombopoietin(rhTPO) can rapidly increase the platelet counts, shorten the time of the platelet returned to normal, reduce platelet transfusion and bleeding events, decrease the length of ICU stay, and eventually reduce the 28-day mortality in septic shock patients with thrombocytopenia.
