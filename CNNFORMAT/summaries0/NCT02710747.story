(secondQuint)The Pharmacogenetics of Optimal Warfarin Therapy in Chinese Patients After Heart Valve Replacement.

.

 The dosing algorithm published by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium hadn't been verifying by a standard randomized prospective study in Chinese patients after heart valve replacement.

 And, warfarin will affect people's coagulation, so that probably increase the drainage.

 We'll analyse the interaction of patients' PT-INR or drainge and oral warfarin dosing.
