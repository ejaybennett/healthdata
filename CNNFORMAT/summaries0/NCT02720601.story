(fifthQuint)Irinotecan and Capecitabine as Second-line Treatment for Advanced/Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancers.

 The current front-line treatment regimen using gemcitabine in combination with cisplatin has a significant survival benefit (11.

7 versus 8.

1 months, P < 0.

001) in patients with biliary tract cancer when compare to single agent gemcitabine.

 However, there is urgent need for effective second-line regimens with minimal toxicity.

 Capecitabine (Xeloda) is an oral pro-drug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).

 The conversion to active drug is dependent on thymidine phosphorylase, which is expressed at a higher level in tumor cells than in normal tissue.

 There are no reports on prospective clinical trials using capecitabine in cholangiocarcinoma.

 However, case reports of successful stabilization of disease with single agent capecitabine are available.

 Since 5-FU has been the main chemotherapy agent for biliary tract cancer for more than 40 years, it is reasonable to presume that the overall effectiveness of capecitabine will be very similar to infusional 5-FU.

 Several clinical trials have shown that irinotecan can be a good agent for cholangiocarcinoma.

 Of the five patients that had a partial response in one phase I trial of the combination of irinotecan and docetaxel in advanced solid tumors, one had cholangiocarcinoma.

 Two of the 11 patients that had a partial response from another phase I trial using a combination of irinotecan, oxaliplatin and 5-FU in advanced tumors had cholangiocarcinoma.

 A case report indicated that single agent irinotecan given at a low weekly dose could produce a long-lasting response in metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.

 Based on the above data, our experience, and other early phase studies of this combination, this phase II trial was proposed to determine the progression free survival, response rate, overall survival, and toxicity in biliary tract cancer patients who are administered irinotecan and capecitabine as a second-line treatment.

 Irinotecan and Capecitabine as Second-line Treatment for Advanced/Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancers@highlight

Biliary tract cancers that progress after first line treatment can be difficult to treat.

 There is a great need for an effective, tolerable, easy to administer second-line regimen.

 Previous early phase studies demonstrated that the combination of two chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and capecitabine had activity in this setting.

 The goal of this study is to determine whether this drug combination, as a second-line treatment, can improve progression free survival in patients with biliary tract cancers.
