(fifthQuint)Computer-based Dartmouth Research Problem Solving Therapy (DrPST) for Depression in Employee Assistance Programs (EAP).

 Objective: To assess the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of DrPST under naturalistic conditions.

 Hypotheses: H1: Greater than 50% of participants referred to DrPST will complete at least 4 treatment sessions.

 H2: Participants will report that DrPST is acceptable as a stand-alone treatment for depression.

 H3: On average, participant's self-reported depression severity scores on the PHQ-9 will decrease over time.

 Procedures: Consecutive employees and faculty members receiving evaluations in the EAP programs of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) and Dartmouth College and identified as being depressed and as potentially able to benefit from using DrPST will be referred to the program.

 DrPST will be loaded onto laptops in the Health Information Library at DHMC and in the FEAP clinic at Dartmouth College.

 Materials: Laptop computers containing the DrPST program.

 Data Collection: All study data will be automatically collected by the DrPST program.

 Evaluation data (i.

e.

, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item Depression Scale; PHQ-9) scores and acceptability of the program) will be collected at each session.

 Information entered into the program as part of using DrPST (e.

g.

, the types of problems worked on, success with solving the problems, satisfaction with effort, compliance with homework, obstacles encountered) will also be automatically stored.

 Users will be assigned an anonymous ID code that will enable their use of the program.

 .

 Evaluation measures and work performed while using DrPST will be stored to the laptop for later retrieval by the investigators.

 The laptops will be secured on site.

 Only age and gender will be collected.

 No identifying information (e.

g.

, name, address, dob, SS#) will be collected.

 All entered data will be stored according to the assigned ID.

 Computer-based Dartmouth Research Problem Solving Therapy (DrPST) for Depression in Employee Assistance Programs (EAP)@highlight

The investigators have developed an interactive, multimedia computer-based depression treatment program (Dartmouth Research Problem Solving Therapy; DrPST).

 DrPST is based on an evidence-based psychotherapy called Problem Solving Therapy in which depressed patients identify problems in their lives and work through a structured format for solving these problems.

 The investigators have subjected DrPST to Phase 1-3 feasibility, acceptability and efficacy trials which have been positive and without adverse events.

 The purpose of the current study is to make DrPST available through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and the Faculty and Employee Assistance Program (FEAP) at Dartmouth College in order to assess the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness under naturalistic conditions.
