(thirdQuint)Interventional Study Comparing NLP Protocol to the Common Practice Protocol in the Event of PPPTSD.

 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is considered to be a major Public Health disorder in the Western world with 8% prevalence.

 When including partial/Sub-clinic PTSD, prevalence rises dramatically.

 Studies examining the common intervention methods indicate certain clinical effectiveness although none presents sweeping efficiency.

 Therefore, this syndrome is still a significant clinical problem in Public Health.

 This study focuses on women population who have experienced trauma in childbirth.

 Such women experience full post traumatic symptoms (Full PTSD) or Partial/Subclinical PTSD.

 This syndrome is defined in professional literature as PPPTSD (Post-Partum Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).

 While childbirth is a healthy part of the cycle of life, birth itself is an event that may involve a risk to the mother and child life.

 PPPTSD prevalence ranges between 1%-6% and is expressed in at least two of the criteria listed in the DSM.

 8.

3%-28% of women suffer from partial PPPTSD.

 Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a "one-on-one" intervention method, connecting Neurological processes (N), Linguistic (L) and learned behaviors (P), in order to allow conceptual/perceptual, mental and behavioral changes.

 Even though NLP is used since the 1970's and field testimonies report its effectiveness, there are only few studies regarding its effectiveness in the field of PTSD.

 "Group intervention", which combines both CBT tools and dynamic group therapy, is part of the common treatment usually implemented at Maccabi Healthcare Services in the event of PTSD.

 This study's main objective is to examine the effectiveness of the NLP PTSD protocol in comparison to the common intervention protocol used at Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel (Treatment as usual).

 The study population will include 60 women, up to one year after birth, with PPPTSD, out of which 30 will be treated in 12 sessions implementing Maccabi Healthcare Services common group protocol and 30 will be treated in 5 individual sessions implementing the NLP PTSD protocol.

 Interventional Study Comparing NLP Protocol to the Common Practice Protocol in the Event of PPPTSD@highlight

The purpose of this interventional study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the NLP PTSD protocol in the event of PPPTSD in comparison with the common practice protocol.

 The study's main hypothesis is that the implementation of both protocols will be equally effective and result in reduction of the overall PTSD level.
