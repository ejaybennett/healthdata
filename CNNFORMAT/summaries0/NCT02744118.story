(fifthQuint)Helping Eliminate Marijuana Use Through Pediatric Practice.

 The HEMPP study involves three phases: Researchers will (1) Develop a marijuana screening and brief counseling intervention for adolescents, based on expert input, current literature, and themes gathered from focus groups with adolescents and clinicians; (2) Pilot test the acceptability of the 5As marijuana intervention in 2 pediatric primary care practices, where researchers will test the intervention and determine acceptability via in-depth interviews with clinicians, office staff, adolescents and parents; and (3) Pilot test the feasibility of the 5As marijuana intervention in 8 practices (4 intervention/4 comparable control), wherein each practice will enroll 100 adolescents and conduct baseline/exit interviews with all of them.

 Twenty percent of adolescents/practice (including identified marijuana users) will complete one follow-up interview 3-6 weeks after their practice visit.

 These interviews will assess physician-delivery of the intervention and any change in use, attitude or behavioral intentions toward marijuana since their clinical visit.

 Findings will inform the development of a future large-scale trial of adolescent marijuana use, screening and cessation counseling in pediatric primary care.

 The long-term goal is to improve clinical preventive services for adolescent marijuana cessation.

 Conducting this work within the AAP PROS network will lead to rapid dissemination of effective interventions.

 Helping Eliminate Marijuana Use Through Pediatric Practice@highlight

This study adapts the Public Health Service (PHS) 5As model for use with adolescent marijuana users and pilot the intervention to test feasibility and acceptability in pediatric primary care settings.

 The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1: Develop a marijuana screening and brief counseling intervention for adolescents based on the Public Health Service 5As model and previously developed adolescent smoking cessation intervention.

 Hypothesis 1: The 5As model can be adapted for use as a marijuana screening and counseling intervention for adolescents.

 Aim 2: Test the feasibility and acceptability of the 5As marijuana screening and brief counseling intervention in pediatric primary care practice.

 Hypothesis 2a: Pediatric clinicians will find the 5As intervention feasible and acceptable for addressing marijuana use in routine clinical visits with adolescents and their families; and Hypothesis 2b: Adolescents will find the 5As intervention delivered by their clinicians to be acceptable in the context of routine preventive services delivery.
