(firstQuint)Influence of Non Invasive Mechanical Ventilation on Tissue Perfusion in Patients After Cardiac Surgery.

 Patients submitted to open chest cardiac surgery will be enrolled after ICU admission.

 These patients will be submitted to noninvasive mechanical ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure right after extubation and tissue perfusion markers (central venous oxygen saturation (SVcO2) and lactate) will be obtained via central venous catheter.

 Noninvasive mechanical ventilation is a common resource in the ICU to reduce extubation failures and to improve clinical outcomes, whether it can influence tissue perfusion remains unclear.

 This study evaluates whether noninvasive ventilation affects tissue perfusion and whether tissue perfusion markers in the ICU are correlated with better clinical results for patients after heart surgery.
