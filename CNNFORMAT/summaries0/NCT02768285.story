(firstQuint)Apical Patency and Postoperative Pain.

.

 Apical patency (AP) is a procedure that prevents accumulation of soft and hard tissue debris within the cement canal.

 However, some RCTs indicate that maintaining an AP causes postoperative pain, whilst some RCTs pointed out there is no difference in terms of pain when AP has been performed.

 We, therefore, would like to conduct a RCT to increase the sample size of the previously performed RCTs to do an systematic review.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether maintaining an apical patency causes postoperative pain in posterior teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis.
