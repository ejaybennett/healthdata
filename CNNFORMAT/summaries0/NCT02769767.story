(secondQuint)Polymorphisms of Interleukins, Glypican, and Human Leukocyte Antigen Genes and Treatment Response in Multiple Sclerosis.

.

 Genes HLA-DRB1 * and some genes involved in inflammation and immunity have been linked to risk of MS and the response to treatment with immunomodulators.

 The HLA-DRB1 * genes have been associated with risk and response to treatment in MS in multiple studies; however, other genes have been controversial.

 This research aims to estimate the risk for MS that confers some variations in the sequence of IL-7R, GPC5, CTSS, HLA-DRB1 genes.

 Furthermore, it seeks to determine whether these gene variants (polymorphisms) are associated with treatment response to immunomodulators.

 Subjects with MS and healthy subjects will be taken to assess the risk for MS.

 Besides the investigators obtain the medical history of relapse to assess response to treatment in accordance with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and relapses.
