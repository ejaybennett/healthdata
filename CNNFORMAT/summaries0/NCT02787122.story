(thirdQuint)Pilot-trial of Emotion-focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Patients With Schizophrenia.

 Cognitive Behavior Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is an effective treatment for patients with psychosis.

 Several meta-analyses showed an effect of CBTp in addition to antipsychotic treatment of small to medium effect size with regard to positive symptoms, general psychopathology and depression.

 Nevertheless, present research suggests that are especially emotional processes are closely related to positive symptoms and delusions, such as negative emotions, low self-esteem, depression and anxiety, whereas present interventions of CBTp focus often especially on cognitive interventions in order to change delusions as well as more cognitive risk factors for delusions such as reasoning biases and a dysfunctional causal attribution style.

 Thus, the aim of the present single-blind randomized-controlled pilot therapy study was to assess the efficacy of a new form of emotion-focussed Cognitive behavior therapy for psychosis with regard to change in positive symptoms and delusions in comparison to standard treatment.

 The main hypotheses are: - Efficacy of CBT-E: patients with schizophrenia who receive CBT-E show a more pronounced reduction of delusions (primary outcome), as well as a more pronounced reduction of positive symptoms, depression and general psychopathology, a stronger improvement in general and social functioning and will receive lower doses of antipsychotic medication (secondary outcomes) at post-treatment.
