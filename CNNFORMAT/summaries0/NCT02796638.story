(fifthQuint)Adaptive Servo-Ventilation In Acute Heart Failure Patients Protecting the Heart and Kidneys.

 OBJECTIVE(S): The main goal of this study is to evaluate the utility of a Minute Ventilation Adaptive Servo-ventilation (MV-ASV) device in mitigating deterioration in renal function and prevent kidney injury in patients admitted with acute heart failure compared to those receiving usual care.

 We will be assessing the effects of MV-ASV on diuretic dose, urine output and new and exciting biomarkers of renal function and kidney injury.

 If our hypothesis proves correct, it strongly suggests that ASV lessens hypoxia to the kidney and could lead to a new paradigm for the treatment of AHF.

 When use of high dose of diuretics are anticipated or in whom CKD or AKI is present on arrival to the Emergency Department, use of MV-ASV might decrease the amount of diuretics needed, allow for continued use of ACE inhibitors, and ultimately mitigate rises in creatinine and decreases in effective glomerular filtration.

 Since kidney injury is a major factor in those patients with early 30-day readmission following discharge, this therapy could become quite popular.

 RESEARCH DESIGN: This is an interventional, principal investigator-initiated project with patient enrollment, cohort development and data analysis.

 We will recruit 66 patients with acute heart failure and evidence of volume overload and elevated BNP, since we anticipate a 10% dropout.

 Half will be pre-selected to have CKD with eGFR cent The comparison of groups of size 30 and 30 has a power of 0.

815 to detect an effect equal to a group difference of (0.

75) standard deviations.

 This would apply to all variables in univariate tests at significance level of 0.

05 with appropriate corrections for multiple comparisons.

 CLINICAL RELATIONSHIPS: The potential benefit of this study includes the validation of the use of an ASV device in the treatment of heart failure.

 ASV treatment might decrease the amount of diuretics needed, allow for continued use of ACE inhibitors, and ultimately mitigate rises in creatinine and decreases in effective glomerular filtration.

 ASV treatment may lessen hypoxia to the kidney and could lead to a new paradigm for the treatment of AHF.

 IMPACT/SIGNIFICANCE: Heart failure is a major cause of both death and healthcare spending in the United States.

 ASV is a cost effective, non-invasive treatment that can improve symptoms and cardiac outcomes in patients with heart failure.

 Validation of an MV-ASV device as an effective treatment could help improve prognosis and quality of life in patients with this often terminal condition.

 Adaptive Servo-Ventilation In Acute Heart Failure Patients Protecting the Heart and Kidneys@highlight

The primary hypothesis of this study is: the use of minute ventilation-adaptive servo-ventilation (MV-ASV) during hospitalization will mitigate deterioration in renal function and prevent kidney injury in patients admitted with acute heart failure (AHF) compared to those receiving usual care.

 We will validate and extend our pilot study by taking a deeper dive into the effects of ASV on diuretic dose, urine output and new and exciting biomarkers of renal function and kidney injury.

 If our hypothesis proves correct, it strongly suggests that ASV lessens injury to the kidney and could lead to a new paradigm for the treatment of AHF.

 When use of high dose of diuretics are anticipated or in whom chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI) is present on arrival to the Emergency Department, use of MV-ASV might decrease the amount of diuretics needed, allow for continued use of ACE inhibitors, and ultimately mitigate rises in creatinine and decreases in effective glomerular filtration.

 Since kidney injury is a major factor in those patients with early 30-day readmission following discharge, this therapy could become quite popular.
