(firstQuint)Clinical Trial of Adjuvant Chemotherapy Followed by Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Compared With Adjuvant Chemotherapy Alone in Patients With Gallbladder Carcinoma and Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.

 The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in gallbladder carcinoma (GBCA) or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC) is unknown.

 A retrospective study suggested that chemoradiotherapy provides greater benefit than chemotherapy alone in GBCA patients.

 SWOG S0809, a phase II study showed that adjuvant chemoradiotherapy has promising efficacy in GBCA or EHCC.

 The present phase III clinical trial is designed to compare adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy with chemotherapy alone.
