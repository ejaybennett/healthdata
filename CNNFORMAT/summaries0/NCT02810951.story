(secondQuint)A Study of FCX-007 for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB).

 RDEB is a congenital and progressive orphan skin disease caused by the deficiency of the protein type VII collagen (COL7).

 The objective of this study is evaluate the safety FCX-007 intradermal injections in RDEB subjects.

 Additionally, the trial will evaluate type VII collagen expression, the presence of anchoring fibrils resulting from FCX-007, as well evidence of wound healing.

 Six adult subjects are expected to be treated with FCX-007 in the Phase I portion of the trial and six subjects age 7 or older in the Phase II portion of the trial.

 All subjects will receive FCX-007 to one or more paired target RDEB wounds.

 Proof of mechanism will be monitored through digital photography of target wounds and assays conducted on biopsies taken from target wounds.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of FCX-007, evaluate C7 expression and the presence of anchoring fibrils resulting from FCX-007 and to analyze wound healing as a result of FCX-007 administration in subjects with RDEB.
