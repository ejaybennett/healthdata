(fifthQuint)Endourology Disease Group Excellence (EDGE) Consortium: Antibiotics (Abx) for Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) Part 2.

 This study will be a multi-institutional randomized clinical trial of a short course of pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis in addition to perioperative antibiotics.

 Once patients have been identified and enrolled into the study, they will be grouped based on the sensitivity profiles of their positive urine culture or the presence of indwelling kidney drain tube (nephrostomy tube, nephroureteral stent, ureteral stent).

 Each of these groups will be individually randomized as follows: Group 1) Kidney stone subjects with indwelling drain tube (nephrostomy tube or ureteral stent) and negative urine culture Randomization: - 7 day course of oral Macrobid (Nitrofurantoin) 100 mg twice daily + sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim > doxycycline> ciprofloxacin > keflex > cefpodoxime.

 Group 3) Kidney stone subject with positive urine culture sensitive to only intravenous/intramuscular antibiotics (resistant to oral agents) Randomization: - 7 day course of an IV/Intramuscular (IM) antibiotic (proven effective on sensitivity profile) + sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim > doxycycline> ciprofloxacin > keflex > cefpodoxime.

 Antibiotics the day of surgery will be a dose of ampicillin IV (2g) and gentamicin IV (5mg/kg) within 120 minutes of surgery start time.

 Patients with penicillin allergy will receive vancomycin IV (1g) instead of ampicillin and patients with gentamicin/aminoglycoside allergy will receive ceftriaxone IV (2g) instead of gentamicin.

 Postoperative antibiotics in the absence of sepsis (see definition of sepsis below) will be 90/min), low systolic blood pressure ( 38.

3 Celsius, hypothermia 20 min or leukocytosis >12000 or leukopenia <4000, further urine culture, blood culture and serum lactate will be obtained.

 The patient will be discharged from the hospital per the usual clinical protocols.

 Post-discharge the patient will be seen in clinic 1-12 weeks after surgery.

 Patients will undergo a non-contrast CT abdomen/pelvis, an abdominal plain radiograph, and/or a renal ultrasound during this postoperative period.

 Demographic fields will be obtained preoperatively and include age, race, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (for comorbidity assessment), body mass index (BMI), and prior stone disease.

 Disease fields that will be obtained include stone size (maximal axial and coronal dimensions), degree of hydronephrosis (mild/moderate/severe), history of diabetes mellitus, history of cardiac disease, hypertension, prior urinary tract infection, history of bowel diversion, or neurogenic bladder.

 Perioperative fields include OR (surgical) time, type of anesthesia, number of access tracts, use of internalized ureteral stent, nephrostomy tube, or nephroureteral stent, estimated blood loss, and intraoperative complications.

 Postoperative fields will include postoperative maximum body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, urine culture results, stone culture results, stone composition, white blood cell count, serum lactate, postoperative serum creatinine, need for admission to intensive care unit, hospital length of stay (LOS), and stone-free status at 1-12 week postoperative imaging.

 Patients will be followed during routine clinical visits as part of their continuing care.

 Endourology Disease Group Excellence (EDGE) Consortium: Antibiotics (Abx) for Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) Part 2@highlight

This study will be a multi-institutional randomized clinical trial of a short course of pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis in addition to perioperative antibiotics prior to undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

 The select patient population will be those patients deemed to be at a moderately increased risk of postoperative infectious complications.

 These higher risk patients are those with indwelling urinary drainage tubes and those with a positive preoperative urine culture.
