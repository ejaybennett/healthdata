(secondQuint)Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy Combined With Stereotactic Body Radiation in Advanced Metastatic Disease.

 Patients who will receive anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy with at least 1 site of measurable metastatic disease which will not be irradiated will be candidates for the study.

 Patients will be randomized (1:1) to CBI combined with SBRT or CBI alone.

 SBRT at 9.

5Gy x3 fractions will be delivered within 1-21 days of the start of first cycle of CBI.

 The first six patients will be treated and observed for toxicity in the safety run-in phase for 30 days after radiation before continuing with further accrual.

 Radiation dose reduction is allowed if necessary to meet tissue constraints (6Gyx3 Minimum Dose).

 Response rates will be determined from the non-irradiated lesion/lesions.

 Blood draws will be obtained to analyze anti-tumor immune responses.

 Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy Combined With Stereotactic Body Radiation in Advanced Metastatic Disease@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) combined with checkpoint blockaded immunotherapy (CBI) will improve the response to the anticancer treatment compared to CBI alone in patients with advanced metastatic cancer.
