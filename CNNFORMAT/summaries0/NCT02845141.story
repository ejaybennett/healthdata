(thirdQuint)Synthetic Bone Graft Substitute vs.

 Autologous Spongiosa in Revision Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.

 * Study design: Monocentric, prospective, randomised study.

 Patients who need revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and show a tunnel enlargement of >10mm will have a first operation filling the tibial/femoral tunnel either with bone graft substitute (Actifuse) or autologous spongiosa.

 5 - 6 months after this first operation a CT will be performed to assess the bony consolidation of the former tibial/femoral tunnel.

 An MRI will be performed to assess vitality of the bone substitute.

 An osseous biopsy will be taken from the tibial/femoral tunnel at the revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction approximately 6 months after bone grafting.

 Clinical evaluation will be performed 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months postoperative.

 At 6 months postoperative additional radiological evaluation and clinical assessment using the SF36 questionnaire will be performed.

 - Treatment: Either autologous spongiosa or Actifuse (MIS applicator) will be administered by the investigator as a bone graft substitute for tunnel enlargement in patients undergoing revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

 - Duration of Participation: The participation of each subject will be approximately 12 months.

 Each subject will undergo revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction approximately 6 months after bone grafting.

 A biopsy will be taken at this operation.

 A clinical and radiological follow up is planned for further 6 months.

 * Subjects: Male and female patients 18 years.

 Approximately 40 patients who undergo revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction will be included in the study.

 Inclusion criteria: Patients in need of revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction Exclusion criteria: Infection, wound healing complications.
