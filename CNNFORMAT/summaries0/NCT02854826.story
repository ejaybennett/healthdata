(thirdQuint)Systems Addressing Frail Elders (SAFE) Care Implementation.

 Three Magnet hospitals in Los Angeles County (Huntington Hospital, Torrance Memorial Medical Center and Ronald Reagan UCLA Health System) are collaborating on this demonstration and evaluation project (Multiple Case-Study Design).

 The project will engage interprofessional hospital leadership; provide training and coaching in implementation processes of the SAFE Care model; and track outcome of the SAFE Care model as implemented in the three collaborating site hospitals (three case studies).

 The investigators hope to contribute to the existing state of the science in dissemination and implementation of evidenced-based innovations.

 The collective data from the three sites (collected through interviews with hospital leadership and staff and with de-identified patient data on program implementation outcomes) will provide information about the effectiveness of the implementation process and support further dissemination.

 Systems Addressing Frail Elders (SAFE) Care Implementation@highlight

Systems Addressing Frail Elders (SAFE) Care is a nurse-led interprofessional team model to rapidly identify and provide safe and effective inpatient care to high risk older adults and help support their successful transition back to the community.

 Developed and demonstrated to be effective in one hospital - the model is now being disseminated and studied in three additional hospitals (multiple organizational case study).
