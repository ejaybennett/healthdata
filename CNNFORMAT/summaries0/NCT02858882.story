(thirdQuint)Vitamin D Status and Muscle Function.

 To examine vitamin D status in young elite swimmers and if there is an association between vitamin D status and muscle strength, twenty-nine swimmers, 12 female and 17 male (16-24 years) residing at latitude 55-56N were included to the trial conducted in March-April.

 Blood samples were analysed for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s-25(OH)D) and hand-grip strength was measured as marker of muscle strength.

 Subjects vitamin D and calcium intake were assessed by food frequency questionnaire and sun exposure and training status by questionnaires.

People living at Northern latitudes are at risk of suffering from vitamin D insufficiency due to low sun exposure and the risk may be even more pronounced among elite swimmers since indoor training further reduces sun exposure.

 In light of this, the investigators want to examine vitamin D status in young elite swimmers and if there is an association between vitamin D status and muscle strength.
