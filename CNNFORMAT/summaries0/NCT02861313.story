(firstQuint)Oral Health Related Quality of Life and Peri-implant Condition in Single Implant Overdenture.

 Single implant retained mandibular overdenture is considered an economic and simple treatment modality for edentulous subjects.

 Resin matrix (CM LOC) is one of the low profile attachments which represent a promising retention values with subsequent improvement in chewing ability and in turns enhance patient quality of life.

Oral health impact profile for edentulous patient (OHIP-EDENT) is more specific to edentulous subjects.

 Peri-implant soft tissue health (bleeding, inflammation, etc.

.

.

) is a valuable marker to implant success.

 The study will record different attachment influenced-tissue response and its relation to implant success and oral health related quality of life (OHRQOL).

 Oral Health Related Quality of Life and Peri-implant Condition in Single Implant Overdenture@highlight

Comparing the quality of life and periimplant condition around a single implant retained mandibular overdenture in two groups one will have a ball attachment and the other is having a (CM-LOC) one.
