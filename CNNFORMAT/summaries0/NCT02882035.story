(thirdQuint)Opioid Free Anesthesia: What About Patient Comfort?.

 Opioids used as part of balanced anesthesia have known undesired side effects such as: respiratory depression, post-operative nausea and vomiting, pruritus, difficulty voiding and ileus.

 The purpose of this study was to determine whether opioid free anesthesia influences the quality of recovery.

 A multimodal approach combining ketamine, lidocaine and clonidine was used as an alternative for an opioid based anesthesia.

 The hypothesis of this study was that patient comfort and satisfaction level after an opioid free anesthesia would be higher compared to after a more traditional opioid anesthesia.
