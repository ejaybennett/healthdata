(firstQuint)Integrative Approaches for Cancer Survivorship 2: Project 2.

 Post-treatment cancer survivorship is often associated with a void in care given the drop-off in support provided to survivors from the medical team as well as family and friends.

 The investigators aim to develop and test a Health Education intervention in breast cancer survivors.

 Specifically, the investigators aim to develop the manualized Health Education intervention; to assess feasibility; and to provide preliminary data on the effects of the intervention.

 The data from this pilot study will be used to inform future study.
