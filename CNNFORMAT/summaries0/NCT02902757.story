(fifthQuint)FDG PET/CT in Monitoring Very Early Therapy Response in Patients With Glioblastoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess very early response to therapy in glioblastoma patients using 18F-FDG PET/CT.

 II.

 Evaluate very early changes in FDG uptake within 48 hours of start of therapy and correlate them with objective response parameters such as Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) and survival.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard FDG PET/CT scan 6-8 weeks before start of chemotherapy and one additional FDG PET/CT scan within 48 hours of the start of chemotherapy.

 FDG PET/CT in Monitoring Very Early Therapy Response in Patients With Glioblastoma@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies fluordeoxyglucose (fludeoxyglucose) F-18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in monitoring very early therapy response in patients with glioblastoma.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as FDG PET/CT, may help measure a patient's response to earlier treatment.

 Chemotherapy can induce very rapid changes to the tumor's glucose consumption which can be measured with imaging.

 FDG PET/CT shortly after the start of therapy may help identify very early therapy response in patients with glioblastoma.
