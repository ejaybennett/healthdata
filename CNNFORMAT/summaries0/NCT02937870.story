(thirdQuint)A Bite Force Study Comparing Two New Test Adhesives With Currently Marketed Denture Adhesive.

 This will be a 4-treatment, 4-period, randomized, crossover, proof of principle bite force study which will compare bite force measurements over a 12 hour period across two cream denture adhesives with a currently marketed cream denture adhesive (positive control), and a negative/no treatment control.

 A short questionnaire regarding the flavor and texture characteristics of each denture adhesive after a single use will also be administered to give an indication of participant satisfaction of these attributes.
