(fifthQuint)Early Oral Intake After Pancreaticoduodenectomy in the Age of ERAS.

 Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is an interdisciplinary, multimodal concept and has become an important focus of Pancreaticoduodenectomy procedures following universal accepted and practice in gastrointestinal and colorectal surgeries.

 Early oral diet without restrictions after operation is recommended strongly according to ERAS guideline.

 However, several studies demonstrated that only half validated the true practice of the postoperative oral diet.

 Furthermore, Oral intake tolerance after PD is controversial.

 Only 23% of patients were able to take solid food at day 3.

 It appears that adequate nutritional intake only via oral diet is a severe challenge.

 Besides, Studies showed that insufficient amount of dietary intake was significantly associated with extended duration of postoperative hospitalization and parenteral nutrition.

 Importantly, Specific clinical study on early oral intake after PD is very limited.

 Therefore, the present study is aim to evaluate the tolerance, safety, and efficacy in the patients undergoing PD in the age of ERAS.
