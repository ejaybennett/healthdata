(thirdQuint)Urine Sample Collection From Non Pregnant Peri and Post-menopausal Women.

 Each subject will be provided with a urine sample collection container, a transport container, barcode labels, prepaid envelopes and a full set of study instructions, together with the materials required to facilitate the collection of a follow-up urine sample and completion of follow up form, where applicable.

 Subjects admitted into the study that are unsure of their pregnancy status will be provided with a marketed Clearblue HPT, to test for pregnancy prior to beginning the study.

 If a subject informs the trial site that they have become pregnant prior to urine sample collection, they will be withdrawn from the study and no urine sample will be collected.

 The subject will return their materials to the study site, and the co-ordinator will complete the exit form.

 Subjects will be required to collect a urine sample, label their sample (as soon as collected) with the appropriate bar-coded label provided and return this to the study site.

 Where it is not possible to return the sample as soon as collected, urine samples must be stored in a domestic fridge in the container provided for a maximum of 1 week and then sent to the study site at their earliest convenience.

 Subjects will receive follow-up to establish pregnancy status unless 12 months from their last menstrual period (LMP).

 On completion of the study, subjects will be reimbursed for their participation.

 It is anticipated that sample collection will be carried out remotely (i.

e.

 at the volunteers home) but volunteers may attend the study site for sample collection should they require.
