(thirdQuint)Polyneuropathy in Diabetes Mellitus Type 2.

 Diabetic polyneuropathy is one of the most common long-term complications of diabetes.

 Neuronal hyperexcitability is thought to be a key factor in the development of neuropathic pain.

 The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and underlying mechanisms of diabetic polyneuropathy and painful diabetic polyneuropathy.

 Polyneuropathy in Diabetes Mellitus Type 2@highlight

This is a population-based study of type 2 diabetes patients with and without neuropathy recruited from the Danish National Type 2 Diabetes cohort (DD2).

 Perspective: The study will identify risk factors for developing diabetic polyneuropathy and painful diabetic polyneuropathy and provide information on the underlying mechanisms, which will hopefully contribute to significant improvements in the treatment and prevention of diabetic polyneuropathy in future.
