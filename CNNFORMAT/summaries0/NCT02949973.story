(secondQuint)Aurinia Early Urinary Protein Reduction Predicts Response.

 Voclosporin is a next generation CNI intended for use in the prevention of organ graft rejection and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

 The aim of the current development program is to investigate whether voclosporin added to the standard of care treatment in active LN is able to reduce disease activity, as measured by a reduction in proteinuria.

The background therapy will be MMF 2 g daily, initial treatment with IV methylprednisolone followed by a reducing course of oral corticosteroids.

 Patients with active, flaring LN will be eligible to enter the study.

 They are required to have a diagnosis of LN according to established diagnostic criteria (American College of Rheumatology) and clinical and biopsy features suggestive of active nephritis.

 Efficacy will be assessed by the ability of the drug combination to reduce the level of proteinuria while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.
