(secondQuint)Proximal Roux-en-y Gastrojejunal Anastomosis on Delayed Gastric Emptying After Pylorus-resecting Pancreaticoduodenectomy.

 Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is a common complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), occurring in 20% to 70% of the patients.

 DGE is usually not a life-threatening complication, but it contributes significantly to increased length of hospital stay, health care costs, and patient discomfort.

 In a recent study by Sakamoto et al, proximal Roux-en-y gastrojejunal anastomosis is associated with a reduced incidence of DGE after pylorus-resecting pancreaticoduodenectomy (PrPD); however, these results may have been biased because of the retrospective nature.

 Therefore, the investigators conducted the present randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of the proximal Roux-en-y gastrojejunal anastomosis on reducing DGE following PrPD.

This study aims to evaluate whether the incidence of delayed gastric emptying (DGE) can be reduced by proximal Roux-en-y gastrojejunal anastomosis in comparison with the standard gastrojejunal anastomosis in pylorus-resecting pancreaticoduodenectomy (PrPD).
