(secondQuint)Tweet4Wellness: An Online Virtual Support Group for Promoting Increased Physical Activity.

 Sedentary behavior is a risk factor for heart disease, independent of meeting physical activity guidelines.

 Tweet4Wellness is an innovative light physical activity, specifically walking, intervention which randomly assigns participants to a 25-person private, online support group that will receive daily, theory-based messages as peer-to-peer discussion prompts.

 Many text-based interventions do not base the intervention text messages in behavior change theory, but this study will base the daily messages in the behavior change theories such as implementation intentions, social support, mindfulness, and social learning theory.

 The trial will be conducted over two, 3-month periods.

 For the first 3 months, there will be 3 groups: Group 1 will receive the Twitter intervention and a "Fitbit" triaxial pedometer to track their steps throughout the day; Group 2 will receive the Fitbit pedometer only; Group 3 will be a waitlist control, and receive an online Center for Disease Control (CDC) website on physical activity and walking improvement.

 For the second 3 months: Group 1 will receive new daily Twitter discussion prompts and continue monitoring their physical activity with the Fitbit; Group 2 will receive the Twitter intervention and continue monitoring their physical activity with the Fitbit; Group 3 will receive both the Twitter intervention and a Fitbit pedometer.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether a Twitter-based intervention with a private, online support group can significantly increase number of walking steps compared to self-monitoring of physical activity alone or a control group in sedentary women at a women's heart clinic.
