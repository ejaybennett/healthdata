 Metabolome Analysis in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis@highlight

The aim of this study is to investigate discriminant metabolites in urine from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from healthy individuals.

 Then we determine if the patient's metabolic fingerprint could predict the development or flare-up of RA.
