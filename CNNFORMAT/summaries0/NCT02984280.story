(secondQuint)Specific Respiratory Infections as Triggers of Acute Medical Events.

 We will conduct a time series study correlating anonymised population level data on all samples from NHS laboratories testing positive for six common respiratory viruses with admissions to NHS hospitals in England for a range of cardiac and vascular outcomes over the time period 01/01/2004 to 31/12/2014.

 This will involve generating Poisson regression models controlling for factors such as seasonal and long-term trends, environmental temperature and humidity.

 This study is funded by an Academy of Medical Sciences Starter Grant for Clinical Lecturers.

This study will investigate whether there is a population-level association between circulating respiratory viruses and NHS hospital admissions for acute vascular events using data from national infection surveillance and Hospital Episode Statistics.
