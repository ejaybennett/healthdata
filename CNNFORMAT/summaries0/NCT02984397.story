(fifthQuint)Chronic Widespread Pain and White Blood Cell Activation.

 We have designed a proof-of-concept (POC) trial composed of three arms.

 The first two arms will be a randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study, designed to assess the potential efficacy of KF for the treatment of pain and associated symptoms in adolescent with CWP.

 The third arm will consists of assessing standard of care (SOC) data from patients who do not wish to participate in the study, but agree to allow us to use their SOC data to be compared with that of patients participating in the study.

 This arm will help to evaluate the potential beneficial effect of being part of the study ("placebo" effect) receiving a new treatment for a condition where the SOC have limited success rate.

 Chronic Widespread Pain and White Blood Cell Activation@highlight

Our goal is to conduct a proof-of-concept trial to test the efficacy of KF treatment in adolescents with severe CWP not responding to the standard of care (SOC) treatment program in a multidisciplinary tertiary care chronic pain clinic.

 The changes associated to the interventions (KF or placebo) will be quantified using the Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale after 16 weeks of treatment.

 Secondary, we aim to evaluate the effects of KF on the pain sensitivity, physical and emotional functioning, and we will also explore the potential biological underlying mechanisms.
