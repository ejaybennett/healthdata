(thirdQuint)Sphenopalatine Block or Epidural Bloodpatch for Post Dural Puncture Headache: Randomized Controlled Trial.

 Introduction: Recently sphenopalatine block emerged as an alternative to epidural blood patch for post dural puncture headache but the investigators do not know if it has significant efficacy when compared to epidural blood patch.

 Method: randomized clinical trial where patients with moderate to severe post dural puncture pain will randomly receive either sphenopalatine block or epidural blood patch.

 Pain relief to no pain or low intensity pain will be the main outcome.

 Pain recurrence, survival without pain and side effects (tinitus, low back pain, new dural puncture, sore throat) will be secondary outcomes.
