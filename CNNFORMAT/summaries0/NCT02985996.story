(fifthQuint)Body Compartment PK for New HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Modalities.

 Men who have sex with men (MSM) and Transgender women (TGW) who have sex with men continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV.

 Over 60% of new HIV infections in the US occur among MSM.

 The majority of HIV infections among MSM and TGW occur through exposure to the rectal mucosa during receptive anal intercourse (RAI).

 Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a new HIV prevention method that is recommended by CDC and WHO for MSM at risk of HIV infection.

 PrEP entails taking an anti-HIV medication (Truvada(R); tenofovir/emtricitabine) on a daily basis to prevent HIV infection.

 However, current tenofovir- based regimens have shown to have side effects that researchers are hoping to reduce in newly developed anti-HIV agents.

 This study is designed to examine the ability of these new agents to penetrate mucosal tissues and potentially prevent HIV infection during RAI exposure for MSM and TGW.

 Body Compartment PK for New HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Modalities@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of new anti-HIV agents to penetrate different body compartments in HIV negative men who have sex with men and transgender women.

 These new agents might be considered for pre-exposure prophylaxis regimens in the future.

 This study will include 90 healthy, HIV-negative men who have sex with men and transgender women who are not taking hormones aged 18-49 years.

 Participant must be willing to participate in 1 of the 3 study phases, be willing to take Truvada(R) (PrEP) or Genvoya(R), and willing to undergo blood draws, urethral swabs, and rectal biopsy procedures.
