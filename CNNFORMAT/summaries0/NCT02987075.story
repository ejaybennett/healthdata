(firstQuint)A Comparison of Ongoing Pregnancy Rate Between Cleavage Stage and Early Compacting Embryo Transfer at 662 Hours After ICSI Using Single Step Culture Medium.

 A prospective cohort study to compare the outcomes of transferring the early compacting and the cleavage day 3 embryos.

 All participants were treated with a gonadotropin-releasing antagonist protocol according to local protocol.

 Recombinant follicle stimulating hormone was given for five days starting on the second or third day of the menstrual cycle at a starting dose individualized for each participant as follows: 150, 225 or 300 IU/day, respectively, in participants with anti-Mullerian hormone levels of 2 hours) using the Istanbul consensus.

 As a rule, two useful embryos are transferred in patients if having either early compaction or still on cleavage stage.

 Early compaction embryo transfer group: transfer of 2 utilizable compacting embryos.

 Cleavage stage embryo transfer group: transfer of 2 utilizable non-compacting embryos have 7-9 cells with under 20% fragmentation.

 Embryo transfer was performed using a soft catheter by a standard technique under ultrasound guidance.

 Intensive luteal phase support was provided using progesterone gel and estradiol.

 At least 18 days after OPU, a urinary pregnancy test is performed.

 If the pregnancy test is positive, vaginal and/or abdominal ultrasonographic investigation is performed between 35 and 42 days (5 to 6 weeks) after ET to confirm a clinical pregnancy and at least 70 days (10 weeks) after ET to confirm an ongoing pregnancy.

 Other clinical parameters will also be evaluated: serum hormone levels, fertilization rate, number and quality of day 3 embryos, implantation rate, ectopic pregnancy rate and miscarriage rate.
