(secondQuint)Structured Trauma Quality Improvement Meetings at Four Trauma Centres in India.

 This project will be conducted as a prospective before-and-after study at four major trauma centres in India, with the intervention occurring between pre- and post-intervention phases.

 Included in the study will be all patients presenting to any of the four trauma hospitals with a potentially life-threatening or limb-threatening injury.

 The intervention will be the introduction of a structured Trauma Quality Improvement Meeting (TQIM), using a checklist and training program.

 The primary outcome will be compliance with the TQIM checklist, measured as the proportion of discussed cases (trauma deaths) for which problems with care, preventability and corrective actions were discussed and / or agreed.

 The secondary outcomes will include in-hospital risk-adjusted mortality, hospital length of stay and time to emergency surgery.

 Data collection will occur at all meetings at the four trauma hospitals at which trauma deaths are discussed.

 Data will also be collected in a dedicated trauma registry.
