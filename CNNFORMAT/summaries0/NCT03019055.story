(thirdQuint)Study of CAR-20/19-T Cells in Patients With Relapsed Refractory B Cell Malignancies.

 This is a single center, single arm, open label phase I study to demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing CAR-T cells expressing tandem receptors against both CD20 and CD19 (CAR-20/19-T) in a completely closed system using the CliniMACS Prodigy device and then determine the safety of this dual targeted CAR in a first-in-human study of patients with relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies.

 Secondary outcomes will include response rates, and observed toxicities of the treatment, specifically the development of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), an inflammatory storm that has been seen with previous CAR-T therapies.

 Study of CAR-20/19-T Cells in Patients With Relapsed Refractory B Cell Malignancies@highlight

This is a phase 1, interventional single arm, open label, treatment study designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of infusion of autologous T cells engineered to contain an anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 scFv coupled to CD3 and 4-1BB signaling domains in patients with relapsed and/or refractory CD19 or CD20 positive B cell malignancies
