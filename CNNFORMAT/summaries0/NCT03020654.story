(thirdQuint)The Use of Virtual Reality for the Treatment of Visual Vertigo.

.

 Visual vertigo occurs after the balance system suffers damage (e.

g after a viral infection such as labyrinthitis).

 This causes an over-reliance on the eyes to maintain balance which causes disorientation in busy environments such as the supermarket.

 The treatment involves trying to desensitise the individual to visually stimulating situations.

 Further head and eye exercises are completed alongside the exposure to overcome the damage done to the balance system.

 The Use of Virtual Reality for the Treatment of Visual Vertigo.

@highlight

This study investigates the use of virtual environments presented on a head mounted display for the rehabilitation of those suffering with visual vertigo.

 The control group and treatment groups will be presented with two different sets of environments and be given the same head and eye exercises to complete within the environment.

 They will also be provided with at home exercises to complete.
