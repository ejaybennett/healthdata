(secondQuint)An Evaluation of Healthy Marriage and Relationship Education Program: Elevate.

 The descriptive study is based on the theory that couples can learn skills through participating in the Elevate curriculum that will help them function better as a couple resulting in improved relationship quality/stability, improved co-parenting skills, improved financial management, and reduced financial stress.

 As a result of improved relationship skills and better management of stress, couples will then provide more supportive, safe, and stable family environments for children.

 Individuals who are eligible (biological and foster parents of children 0-18) and agree to participate in the study will complete surveys at three time points--before participating in Elevate, 4-6 weeks after participating, and 8-10 months after participating in Elevate.

 The surveys include items related to couple functioning behaviors, relationship quality/stability, parenting/co-parenting skills, and financial management and distress.
