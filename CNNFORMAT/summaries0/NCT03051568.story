(secondQuint)Evaluating 18F-FDG PET/CT With Liver SUVmax-based Criteria for Prognosis of Patients With Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma.

 In this study investigators develope a semi-quantitative interpretation using the liver SUVmax as reference to interpret 18F-FDG PET/CT.

 Positive lesions in PET were indicated as SUVmax of residues higher than the threshold or new 18F-FDG avid lesions.

 Investigators compare the prognostic accuracy of the liver SUVmax-based criteria with the 5-PS criteria and SUVmax interpretation with respect to predicting disease progression during chemotherapy or survival in PTCL.

 Furthermore,investigators improve the prognostic ability of interim PET/CT by comparing the results to the clinical prognostic factors.

 Evaluating 18F-FDG PET/CT With Liver SUVmax-based Criteria for Prognosis of Patients With Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a semi-quantitative interpretation using the liver SUVmax as reference can better interpret 18F-FDG PET/CT and predict disease progression during chemotherapy or survival in PTCL.
