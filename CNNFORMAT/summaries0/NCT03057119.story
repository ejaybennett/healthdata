(fifthQuint)Feasibility of SBIRT-PN.

 The current project will pilot SBIRT with a peer navigator (SBIRT-PN) versus treatment at usual (TAU) to increase substance use treatment engagement among HIV-positive adults aged 50 years and older.

 The investigators will recruit patients from the Southern HIV and Alcohol Research Consortium (SHARC) HIV primary care clinic network.

 In order to develop effective substance use intervention models for HIV care settings the specific aims of the current project are: Aim1: Examine the feasibility of the SBIRT-PN model at the UF Health Infectious Disease-Medical Specialties Clinic.

 The investigators hypothesize that the SBIRT-PN model will demonstrate high feasibility among providers within the UF Health Infectious Disease - Medical Specialties Clinic.

 Aim2a: Assess the acceptability of SBIRT-PN.

 The investigators hypothesize that SBIRT-PN will demonstrate high acceptability among patients enrolled in this condition.

 Aim2b: Assess the acceptability of SBIRT-PN among HIV-positive individuals by age cohort (younger vs older).

 The investigators hypothesize that SBIRT-PN will demonstrate higher acceptability among older HIV-positive patients enrolled in this condition.

 Aim3: Assess influence of SBIRT-PN model on treatment engagement and substance use compared to enhanced treatment as usual (TAU).

The investigators hypothesize that those in the SBIRT-PN condition will evidence greater treatment engagement and a reduction in substance use.

 Feasibility of SBIRT-PN@highlight

Substance misuse is a common problem among HIV+ individuals.

 Research suggests that a Screening, Brief Intervention, and Treatment (SBIRT) model can be effective in reducing substance misuse in the general older adult population; however these findings have not been verified in the more vulnerable HIV+ older adult population.

 The present study seeks to address the problem of substance misuse in older HIV+ adults by piloting a SBIRT model for older HIV+ adults in a in a primary care setting.

 Individual reductions in alcohol and drug use can have significant effects on public health and safety when observed over a large population at risk for substance use problems.

 With wider dissemination statewide, a relatively low-cost intervention such as SBIRT could offer demonstrated benefits in this population.
