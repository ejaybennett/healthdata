(thirdQuint)An Extension Trial of Inclisiran Compared to Evolocumab in Participants With Cardiovascular Disease and High Cholesterol.

 ORION-3, an extension of study MDCO-PCS-15-01 (ORION-1) [NCT02597127], is a Phase II, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of inclisiran (ALN-PCSSC) injection(s).

 All participants who completed ORION-1 (at least up to and including Day 210) and meet the study criteria will be enrolled into this study.

 ORION-3 is a long-term extension trial with an active comparator (evolocumab) in participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD-risk equivalents (diabetes, familial hypercholesterolemia) and elevated LDL-C, despite maximum tolerated dose of LDL-C lowering therapies.
