(fifthQuint)Evaluating Suspected Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMN) With SpyGlass Pancreatoscopy.

 In this part retrospective, part prospective single-center study we look in to the patients who have undergone SpyGlass pancreatoscopy in Helsinki University Hospital in the recent years, and recruit patients continuously to obtain a significant amount of study subjects.

 We investigate the radiological findings and diagnoses before the SpyGlass procedure, and if ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) has been performed, also brush cytology.

 During the SpyGlass procedure we collect direct visual guided biopsies of the suspected IPMN area and the flushing liquid used in the pancreatic duct.

 We then compare the diagnosis given by the collected samples to the ones the patients had based on examinations before the SpyGlass pancreatoscopy.

 Our SpyGlass pancreatoscopy technique is different compared to previous studies.

 With our equipment we are able to provide pancreatoscopy to patients, who previously have had an endoscopic stenting procedure affecting their pancreatic duct.

 We also collect and analyze the flushing fluid for malignant cells, which haven't been done before.

 With these new means we hope to get more accurate results.

 Evaluating Suspected Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMN) With SpyGlass Pancreatoscopy@highlight

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) have a potential to develop into a malignant disease with varying severity.

 Decision making on when and how to make a therapeutic intervention is not simple.

 Endoscopic equipment that can enter the pancreatic duct itself can provide the much needed additional information on the cystic condition.

 Visual inspection, direct visual guided biopsies from the target and the cytology of the flushing fluid of the pancreatic duct may be helpful in the decision making process of when and how to treat the condition.

 We study whether SpyGlass pancreatoscopy brings accuracy to the diagnostic process concerning IPMNs and does it provide additional information to help make decisions about therapeutical interventions.

 We also document complications related to the procedure itself in the following weeks after the procedure.
