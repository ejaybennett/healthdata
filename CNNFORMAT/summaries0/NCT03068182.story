(secondQuint)Effects of Arm Crank Versus Treadmill Exercises on Heart Rate Variability in Adult Subjects.

.

 A one hundred thirty male volunteers were equally and randomly assigned to; Group-I: Sixty-five participated in an arm crank moderate intensity exercise for 40 minutes.

 Group-II: Sixty-five participated in a treadmill moderate intensity exercise for 40 minutes.

 Halter heart rate monitor and automatic sphygmomanometer were used to measure heart beat intervals and arterial blood pressure respectively.

 Effects of Arm Crank Versus Treadmill Exercises on Heart Rate Variability in Adult Subjects.

@highlight

Cardiovascular response to exercise affects the capacity of all body organs depending upon intensity, duration and mode of exercises.

 The aim was to compare acute effects of arm crank with treadmill moderate intensity exercises on heart rate variability in normal participants.
