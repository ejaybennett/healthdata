(fifthQuint)Interprofessional Training in a Psychiatric Study Unit.

 Research question and basic idea: Interprofessional collaboration is a skill that many health professionals need to develop.

 Interprofessional training offers a way to improve collaboration and patient care.

 The increasing number of psychiatric patients with complex needs, requires mental healthcare providers to enhance their skills.

 It necessitates that healthcare professionals collaborate effectively; nevertheless, many have not been trained in an interprofessional environment.

 Health professionals lack sufficient knowledge of other professional roles and competences to engage in teamwork.

 Interprofessional study units have been designed to create an optimal learning environment for healthcare students.

 These study units provide a new environment for learning, where students can learn from each other and develop competence in interprofessional collaboration.

 This collaboration gives students from several health professions an opportunity to achieve a greater understanding of the overall picture of the patients life.

 The limited data available suggest interprofessional collaboration interventions can improve health-care processes and outcomes; however, better designed studies are needed.

 Objective: Therefore, we will investigate whether placement at a psychiatric study unit compared with placement at a standard psychiatric ward improves students interprofessional skills.

 Methods Design This quasi-experimental study with an intervention group (of 100 students) and a control group (of 90 students), where students in the intervention group receive interprofessional training in the psychiatric study unit in Slagelse (SL3), while students in the control group receive training in standard psychiatric wards (SL2,SL4,SL5).

 The intervention is an interprofessional clinical study unit including students from nursing, medicine, psychology, social work and nursing assistants.

 Sample size and feasibility: The power calculation in this study is based on findings in a cross-sectional study.

 We use the students' interprofessional skills as the primary outcome.

 In the cross-sectional study the students had a mean score (RIPLS) of 69.

98 (SD 25.

5).

 When the sample size was calculated, 70 patients were needed in both the intervention and the control group.

 82 students have clinical placement in the psychiatric study unit in Slagelse annually (SL3) and 67 students have clinical placement in the standard psychiatric wards (SL2, SL4 and SL5).

 Therefore, it seems realistic to include 190 students within 18 months.

 Participants: Students taking part in their clinical placement in Psychiatry West in Slagelse.

 Primarily including students from Nursing, in their 3rd year clinical placement, graduate medical students 4th term, clinical placement in psychiatry and nursing assistants in their 2nd year clinical placement.

 Students from the intervention group are similar to the control group in terms of stage of education and duration of clinical training.

 Allocation and recruitment: Students in both groups are allocated by program coordinators and supervisors from the involved university and colleges (University of Copenhagen, University College Zealand and Social and Healthcare College Zealand).

 The supervisors are responsible for the two groups of students and provided lists of names and current e-mail addresses that we entered into the web-based survey system EasyTrial.

 We use EasyTrial to send personal e-mails to all students inviting them to participate with a link to their personal questionnaire.

 Intervention: In 2015, Psychiatry in Slagelse established an interprofessional clinical study unit.

 The aim was to create a new environment for learning, where students could learn from each other and develop competence in interprofessional collaboration.

 In the study unit there are more students than in the other standard psychiatric wards and several professions are included.

 A facilitator team is responsible for the interprofessional training.

 In autumn 2016 seven professionals participate in course of facilitating interprofessional collaboration and training.

 The intervention involved the total staff participation in an initial eight-hour interactive workshop on the subject.

 The study unit is based on two educational interventions: Student participation in clinical care teams and interprofessional group tuition sessions.

 Clinical care team: The interprofessional clinical care team ensures that the patient pathways are well-planned and well-coordinated.

 Professionals included in the patient's care are part of the team alongside with the patient and their relatives.

 In the study unit the students are also part of the team.

 The team meets weekly.

 The team conference is an important interdisciplinary element in support of patient care during hospitalization.

 This is very important as patients' needs are often complex.

 Interprofessional group tuition: Interprofessional group tuition is a method to improve professional reflection on clinical practice.

 Patients in the study unit and their treatment and care are in focus.

 The group tuition takes an entire day with a mixture of theory and patient cases, in which all professional groups of students participate.

 The supervisors are responsible for planning the sessions.

 Ethical considerations: The study is licensed by the Danish Data Protection Agency (2008-58-0020) and needed no further ethical approval according to Danish legislation (16-000014).

 Data is anonymized and stored in a secure server.

 Students will be informed about the project and its purpose immediately before participation.

 The return of questionnaires will be considered consent to participation.

 Time schedule: Data collection is started October 2016 and will run for 18 months.

 Data analysis will start January 2018.

 Publications are planned for 2018.

 The PhD study is scheduled for 3 years and will end on 31 March 2019.
