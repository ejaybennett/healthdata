(secondQuint)Comparison of Single Versus Multicenter Outcomes for Pelvic Organ Prolapse Repair Using a Mesh-capturing Device.

 112 women operated by two surgeons at one center (2 years follow up) are to be compared to 207 women operated by twenty six surgeons at twenty four centers (1 year follow-up).

 Screening at baseline for apical (uterine or vaginal vault) prolapse stage II with or without concomitant anterior or vaginal wall prolapse stage 2 according to the pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) system.

 Surgical data including operation data, complications and hospital stay are to be compared.

 Anatomical outcome measurements by POP-Q evaluations.

 Subjective symptoms are to be evaluated by prolapse specific symptom questionnaires (PFIQ-7, UDI-6 and PFIQ) whereas sexual function to be estimated by PISQ-12.
