(secondQuint)Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cell Transplantation for the Treatment of Cerebral Palsy.

 Cerebral palsy (CP) is a chronic childhood disorder defined by a range of motor and cognitive impairments and results in a substantial suffering to the patient and a tremendous socio-economic burden to the individual, family, and healthcare system.

 With no effective treatments or interventions, therapies for CP are currently focused on supportive and management strategies.

 Stem cell transplantation has been suggested as a putative intervention for neural pathology, as mesenchymal and neural stem cells, as well as olfactory ensheathing glia and Schwann cells, which have shown some regenerative and functional efficacy in experimental central nervous system disorders.

 In this trial, the investigators study the safety and efficacy of the intrathecal transplantation of specific populations of purified autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells in patients with cerebral palsy.
