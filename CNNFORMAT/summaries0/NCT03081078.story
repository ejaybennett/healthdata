(thirdQuint)Effects of Community-based Caring Contact on Post-discharge Young Adults With Self-harm.

 The proposed study will determine whether community-based caring contact via a mobile app connection with or without volunteer support in addition to treatment as usual (TAU; psychiatric and psychosocial treatments) is effective in reducing suicidal ideation, enhancing treatment compliance, reducing thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness and hopelessness among post-discharge self-harm young adults, and if personalized contact by volunteers has additional effects reducing suicidal ideation among post-discharge self-harm individuals.

 108 participants aged 18-39 with an index self-harm episode will be recruited from the Accident & Emergency Department (AED) of 4 local public hospitals, and randomized into the TAU, mobile app group with, and without volunteer support.

 Each participant will complete a questionnaire at the 4 measurement time points at baseline, during the 6-month observation (3 and 6 months) and at post-intervention (9 months from baseline).

 The primary outcomes include Suicidal ideation, hopelessness, thwarted belongingness & perceived burdensomeness, treatment (TAU) compliance, and suicidality.
