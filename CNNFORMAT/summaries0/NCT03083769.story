(secondQuint)Functional Genetic Variants Affecting Tacrolimus Trough Levels and Side Effects in Chinese Renal Transplantation and Liver Transplantation.

.

 Tacrolimus is an effective immunosuppressive drug widely used in solid organ transplantation to prevent rejection.

 It is characterized by a narrow therapeutic range and large inter- and intra- individual variability in its pharmacokinetics.

 Many factors are associated with the variability.

 Of these factors, genetic factor play an important role.

 Full understanding of this mechanism is important for the personalized use of tacrolimus and reducing the risk of side effects.

The CYP3A5*3 (A6986G) resulting in a splicing defect and the absence of protein activity, was identified as a functional variant (Kuehl P.

2001).

 The CYP3A4*1G was also reported as a functional variant (Richards-Waugh LL.

 2014).

 In addition, other functional variants will also be identified and analyzed in our project.

 Our project has two parts:first, retrospective study, 1000 renal patients from two centers (two cohort, each from one center) using tacrolimus as immunosuppressive drug were recruited.

 In the two cohort, functional genetic variants that can affect the dose corrected tacrolimus trough levels will be identified.

 Second, prospective study, in this part, there are two cohorts, renal transplantation cohort and liver transplantation cohort.

 For renal transplantation cohort, all the patients will be stratified to different groups according to the different genotypes.

 The side effects (acute rejection, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity) will be observed.

 For liver transplantation cohort, all the patients will be stratified to different groups according to the different donors' genotypes and the side effects (acute rejection, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity) will also be observed.

 During the study period, all the therapeutic procedures of the patients are as usual.

 This will be the largest cohort of this kind of study in Chinese population.

 The findings will be useful for the patients to improve the therapeutic efficacy and reduce the side effects.

 Functional Genetic Variants Affecting Tacrolimus Trough Levels and Side Effects in Chinese Renal Transplantation and Liver Transplantation.

@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether functional genetic variants can affect tacrolimus dose corrected trough levels and associate with the side effects in Chinese renal transplantation and liver transplantation.
