(secondQuint)Acute Kidney Injury in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.

 Patients admitted to the hospital for acute chest syndrome or vaso-occlusive pain events may consent to participate in this study.

 Patients will consent to daily blood and urine collection during their hospitalization and during well clinic visits.

 Each AM, participants will have blood and urine collected, processed, and strored for future analysis of biomarkers of injury.

 Patients will also have strict urine output recorded.

 Acute kidney injury (AKI) will be defined by the current KDIGO definition based on either a rise in serum creatinine or decline in urine output.

 Patient medical course will be reviewed to determine interventions and outcomes of their admission based on the development of AKI.

 Acute Kidney Injury in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease@highlight

Patients with sickle cell disease may be at risk for acute kidney injury during sickle cell crisis (pain or acute chest syndrome).

 This study will evaluate blood and urine biomarkers of kidney injury during an admission for crisis and during well clinic follow-up.
