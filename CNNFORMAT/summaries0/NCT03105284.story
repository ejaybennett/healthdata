(secondQuint)Adipose-tissue Derived Stem Cells in Flaps Versus Liposuction.

 Adipose tissue-derived stem cells are of great interest due to their relevance in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.

 A reason, being their capacity for multipotent differentiation, tissue repair and immune modulation.

 To evaluate a physiological concentration level of ASCs in human fat we investigate two extraction methods of fat, excision and liposuction.

 This is done through a standardised setup with patients acting their own control.

 The study is carried out in accordance with the guidelines provided by the International Federation for Adipose Therapeutics and Science and International Society for Cellular Therapy.

 Adipose-tissue Derived Stem Cells in Flaps Versus Liposuction@highlight

The aim of the study is to evaluate a physiological concentration of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASC) in excised fat versus fat harvested by liposuction.

 Participants will act as their own control as both extraction methods are performed on each participant.
