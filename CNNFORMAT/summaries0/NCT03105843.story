(fifthQuint)Sensory-Mechanical Responses to Eucapneic Voluntary Hyperventilation and Hypertonic Saline.

 Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by eosinophilic airway inflammation.

 Individuals with classic asthma experience paroxysmal symptoms including cough, wheeze, shortness of breath and chest tightness.

 Cough variant asthma (CVA) is asthma in which chronic cough (cough lasting eight weeks or more) is the sole or predominant symptom of asthma.

 The pathophysiologic mechanisms which differentiate asthma, CVA, and eosinophilic bronchitis without asthma are not fully understood.

 We have recently identified individuals with chronic cough who cough during methacholine but have normal airway sensitivity (ie.

 do not have asthma or CVA) (COUGH) and may or may not have eosinophilic bronchitis.

 The purpose of this research is to further explore the pathophysiologic basis for cough in these conditions using two 'indirect' inhalation challenge tests: eucapneic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH) and hypertonic saline (HS), which induce osmotic and/or temperature changes in airway.

 Specifically, this study will collect preliminary data on the sensory-mechanical responses of individuals with CVA, COUGH and healthy controls to EVH and HS challenge.

 Sensory-Mechanical Responses to Eucapneic Voluntary Hyperventilation and Hypertonic Saline@highlight

The objectives of this study are to determine the sensory-mechanical responses to Eucapneic Voluntary Hyperventilation (EVH) and Hypertonic Saline (HS) in individuals with cough variant asthma (CVA) and methacholine-induced cough with normal airway sensitivity (COUGH) and compare these responses to a control group of healthy individuals without asthma or chronic cough.

 We hypothesize: 1.

 EVH and HS cause dyspnea, cough, small airway obstruction with resultant dynamic hyperinflation, gas trapping and autoPEEP in individuals with CVA and COUGH, but not healthy controls.

 2.

 The sensory-mechanical responses to both hyperosmolar challenges (EVH and HS) are comparable within groups (CVA, COUGH and healthy controls).
