(thirdQuint)Study of LN-145, Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes in the Treatment of Patients With Cervical Carcinoma.

 LN-145 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients with recurrent, metastatic, or persistent cervical carcinoma.

 The cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving a NMA lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen, followed by infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.
