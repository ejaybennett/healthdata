(thirdQuint)VRC 705: A Zika Virus DNA Vaccine in Healthy Adults and Adolescents.

 This is a multicenter, randomized study to evaluate safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a 3-dose vaccination regimen with the Zika virus wildtype (ZIKVwt) DNA vaccine, VRC-ZKADNA090-00-VP or placebo (VRC-PBSPLA043-00-VP).

 The placebo is a sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

 The hypotheses are that the ZIKVwt DNA vaccine will be safe and will elicit a ZIKV-specific immune response.

 Participants will receive study product intramuscularly (IM) in the limbs as specified by the group assignment by PharmaJet needle-free device.

 In Part A, 90 participants will be randomized to vaccine at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 4 mg or 8 mg dose of vaccine split between 2 or 4 injections.

 In Part B, 2400 participants will be randomized to vaccine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 4 mg dose of vaccine or 1 mL of placebo split between 2 injections.

 Vaccine safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring of clinical and laboratory parameters throughout the study.

 Solicited reactogenicity symptoms will be collected for 7 days after each product administration.

 The study schedule will include clinic visits with safety and immunogenicity blood samples collected at particular time points.

 The vaccine dose and administration plan for Part B was selected based on Part A and Phase 1 data.

 Vaccine efficacy will be evaluated in Part B by comparing incidence of symptomatic ZIKV infections between vaccine and placebo groups.

 During the study, when participants exhibit any possible symptom of ZIKV infection, they will be evaluated by blood and urine ZIKV polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

 Stored blood and urine samples will also be assessed retrospectively by ZIKV PCR to identify possible asymptomatic cases.

 A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will oversee the study.
