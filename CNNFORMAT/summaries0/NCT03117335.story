(thirdQuint)Recombinant Endostatin Combined With Vinorelbine and Cisplatin in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 Recombinant endostatin injection Sulijia is a new type of recombinant protein drugs inhibiting tumor angiogenesis developed by a group of Chinese scientists and clinician.

 It is expressed in E.

 coli which Consists of 184 amino acids.

 It appears to be better than NP chemotherapy alone in terms of efficacy in phase I/II trials for advanced NSCLC.

 In this study, a randomized, double-blind, Placebo plus NP as control, multi-center phase III trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Sulijia plus NP in the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients.

 PFS (progress free survival) is the primary end-point with OS (overall survival), ORR (objective response), DCR (disease control rate) and safety as the secondary end-point.

 A total of 560 patients have been recruited.

 Recombinant Endostatin Combined With Vinorelbine and Cisplatin in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

The main object of this trial is to offer treatment of recombinant endostatin ( Sulijia) combined with Vinorelbine and Cisplatin (NP) plus maintenance therapy with Sulijia for advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, expecting to improve progression free survival (PFS) , disease control rate(DCR) , objective response rate(ORR) and Overall survival (OS) compared with chemotherapy alone, and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sulijia.
