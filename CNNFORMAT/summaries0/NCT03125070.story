(thirdQuint)Self-Management Program and Survivorship Care Plan in Improving the Health of Cancer Survivors After Stem Cell Transplant.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine whether 2-5 year hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) survivors with elevated cancer-related distress or poor health care adherence, adherence to cardiometabolic or subsequent malignancy surveillance who are randomized to receive the online, patient-centered, self-management stepped care program will report reduced distress, and improved health care adherence for cardiometabolic or subsequent malignancy surveillance at 12 months when compared with an active control group who receive access to HCT survivorship best practices.

 II.

 Determine characteristics of intervention participants who require telehealth stepped care at 1-month, because they 1) do not meet criteria for adequate knowledge of subsequent malignancy and cardiometabolic risks, or 2) do not report improved distress, or 3) have not logged in to the online program.

 III.

 Determine resources that would be needed to sustain the intervention as a national HCT survivorship program if implemented through the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR)/National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Process measures of internet study reach and utilization, as well as depression, physical function, physical activity level, and knowledge of survivorship needs in HCT survivors.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

 GROUP I: Patients receive immediate access to the INSPIRE online program and personalized survivorship care plan.

 GROUP II: Patients receive an online program linking to existing online survivor resources and a personalized survivorship care plan.

 Patients may receive access to the INSPIRE online program after 12 months.

 Self-Management Program and Survivorship Care Plan in Improving the Health of Cancer Survivors After Stem Cell Transplant@highlight

This randomized clinical trial studies health informatics and a self-management program in improving the health of cancer survivors after stem cell transplant.

 After transplant many survivors may feel stressed or may be unsure of what health care they need as a transplant survivor.

 A self-management program called "INSPIRE," along with a personalized survivorship care plan may improve stress and health care for transplant survivors.
