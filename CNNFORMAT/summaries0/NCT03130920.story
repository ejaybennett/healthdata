(secondQuint)Hepatoprotective Effect of Remote vs Local Preconditioning of Liver.

 In this randomized control study, a total of 60 patients were randomized into 3 groups: remote ischemic precondition group - RIPC (3 intervals of 5 minute right upper limb ischemia with 3 intervals of 5 minute reperfusion), local ischemic precondition group - LIPC (15 minutes of inflow liver occlusion followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion before liver transection), control group - CG (group without ischemic preconditioning before liver transection).

 Patients were also stratified according to the extent of the hepatectomy.

 Hepatoprotective effect was evaluated by comparing serum transaminase levels, bilirubin levels, albumin, and protein levels, coagulograms and pathohistological exams.

 We also measured flow rate by Doppler ultrasound of hepatic artery and portal vein before and after preconditioning.

 Hepatoprotective Effect of Remote vs Local Preconditioning of Liver@highlight

The aim of this study is to evaluate hepatoprotective effect from ischemia-reperfusion injury of remote ischemic preconditioning of the liver against local ischemic preconditioning of the liver during human liver resections.
