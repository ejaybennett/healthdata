(secondQuint)Vitamin D Supplementation for Treatment of Dyslipidemia.

 Vitamin D receptor gene mutations have been associated with increased incidence of arterial hypertension.

 While, hyperlipidemia and lipoprotein oxidation in bone is leading to osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoblastic differentiation It has been reported that vitamin D supplementation has shown pro-atherogenic effects in rats, and its deficiency is associated with the deterioration of atherogenesis These contradictory findings on the progression of atherosclerosis were examined in this study.

 Aim: This study will be conducted to assess possible reduction in lipid profile (LDL-Triglecerides-cholesterol) among pre-menopausal women in vit D group compared to standard treatment group after 3 months & 6 month of follow up as prophylaxis step for atherosclerosis.

 Subject and methods: Randomized clinical trial with double blinding will be performed on two groups study gp and control gp.

 The cases will recruited from outpatient ckinic of medicine department in Mansoura university Hospital.

 Sample size: based on pilot study after start of trial Study groups: Intervention group: High dose vitamin D3 IM treatment group according to vitamin D3 level after laboratory assessment.

 Standart treatment group: Balanced diet mix of CHO, lipid, protein and fat diet minerals and vitamins for same period of follow up.

 Inclusion criteria : pre menopausal females (35-45 years old) - No comorbodity - Negative hx of contraceptive pill sor drug hx of anti hyperlipidemic drugs - Absent chronic diseases There is possible recruiting of postmenopausal women according to difficulty in finding premenopausal women.

 Methods: study patients will be subjected to: - Full history taking,clinical examination, Anthropometric measurements.

 - Laboratory investigations: Vitamin D3 assessment for all study patients.

 Outcome that will be measured before and after follow up: 1.

 Serum 25 hydroxy Vitamin D3 2.

 CRP 3.

 Serum Calcium level 4.

 Complete Lipid profile: LDL-HDL-Triglycerides -Total cholesterol quantitative and qualitative assessment.

Patient will be fasting for at least 12-14 h then 5 mL venous blood sample will be drawn from each patient into plain tube and left to clot.

 Serum for routine analysis and the other aliquot will be stored at -21C analysis will be separated by centrifugation into two aliquots; one will be used.
