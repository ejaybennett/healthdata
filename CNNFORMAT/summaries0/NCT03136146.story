(fifthQuint)Study of Clofarabine, Etoposide, Cyclophosphamide [CEC], Liposomal Vincristine (VCR), Dexamethasone and Bortezomib in Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (LL).

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study part based on when you join this study.

 At least 1 group of up to 6 participants is planned to be enrolled in the safety lead-in part of the study, and up to 54 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.

 If the doctor thinks it is needed, more groups may be enrolled in the safety lead-in part of the study.

 If you are enrolled in the safety lead-in, the dose level of clofarabine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, liposomal vincristine, and bortezomib will depend on when you join the study.

 If there are no intolerable side effects after the first 6 participants, Phase 2 will open for all future participants.

 If intolerable side effects were seen, 6 more participants will be enrolled in the safety lead-in and will receive a lower dose of the drug combination than the group before them.

 This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the drug combination is found.

 If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will receive the drug combination at the highest dose that was tolerated in the safety lead-in.

 All participants will receive the same dose level of dexamethasone or rituximab/ofatumumab.

 Study Drug Administration: Each cycle is about 28 days.

 You will receive the study drugs in induction and consolidation phases.

 Induction therapy is designed to help control the disease.

 If at any point during the induction phase the disease appears to be responding to treatment (this is called remission), you will begin the consolidation phase.

 Consolidation therapies are designed to keep the disease in remission.

 Induction and/or Reinduction (Cycles 1-2): - You will receive clofarabine by vein over about 1-2 hours on Days 1-5.

 - You will receive etoposide by vein over about 2 hours on Days 1-5, after you receive clofarabine.

 - You will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1-5 about 4 hours after you receive clofarabine.

 - You will receive liposomal vincristine by vein over about 1 hour on Days 2 and 11.

 - You will receive dexamethasone by mouth or by vein over about 15 minutes on Days 1-5.

 The study doctor will determine how you receive the drug.

 - You will receive bortezomib as an injection under the skin on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11.

 - You will receive either ofatumumab or rituximab by vein over about 4-24 hours on Days 2 and 11.

 The amount of time that this dose will take depends on how you tolerate the drug.

 - You will receive pegfilgrastim as an injection under the skin on Day 6.

 Depending on how the disease responds to induction treatment, you may receive a 2nd induction course (reinduction) or begin consolidation treatment.

 If you need to receive reinduction, this will be given in 1 additional cycle.

 Consolidation (5 Cycles: Cycles 2-6 or 3-7): - You will receive clofarabine by vein over about 1-2 hours on Days 1-4.

 - You will receive etoposide by vein over about 2 hours on Days 1-4, after you receive clofarabine.

 - You will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1-4 about 4 hours after you receive clofarabine.

 - You will receive liposomal vincristine by vein over about 1 hour on Days 2 and 11.

 - You will receive dexamethasone by mouth or by vein over about 15 minutes on Days 1-5.

 - You will receive bortezomib as an injection under the skin on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11.

 - You will receive pegfilgrastim as an injection under the skin on Day 6.

 - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will receive either ofatumumab or rituximab by vein over about 4-24 hours on Days 2 and 11 of your first 4 cycles of consolidation (Cycles 2-5 or 3-6).

 If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may be given other chemotherapy, such as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) or other intrathecal chemotherapy (such as methotrexate or cytarabine) to help prevent central-nervous-system leukemia.

 Intrathecal chemotherapy is given by injecting the chemotherapy directly into the cerebrospinal fluid by use of a lumbar puncture/spinal tap or Ommaya reservoir.

 The study doctor and separate consents will explain TKI therapy and intrathecal chemotherapy to you in more detail, including the type of chemotherapy you will receive and its risks.

 If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may also be given standard drugs (such as rasburicase or ondansetron) to help decrease the risk of side effects.

 You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

 If you cannot come to the hospital for the therapy, you may be able to receive the study drug(s) at a doctor's clinic closer to your home.

 Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse or comes back during treatment, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow the study directions.

 Study Visits: One (1) time each week during Cycles 1-6, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 If your doctor thinks it is needed, on Days 14 (+/- 3 days) and 28 (+/- 5 days) of Cycle 1, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the status of the disease.

 This will then be done every 2 weeks unless the disease appears to respond to treatment.

 If your doctor thinks it is needed, at any time during the study you may have a chest x-ray or CT scan of the chest.

 Up to 42 participants will be enrolled in the study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.

 Study of Clofarabine, Etoposide, Cyclophosphamide [CEC], Liposomal Vincristine (VCR), Dexamethasone and Bortezomib in Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (LL)@highlight

You are being asked to take part in this study because you have acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma that is relapsed (has come back) or refractory (has not responded to treatment) This clinical research study has 2 parts: lead-in and Part 2.

 The goal of the safety lead-in portion of this study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the combination of clofarabine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, liposomal vincristine, dexamethasone, and bortezomib in patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL).

 The goal of Part 2 of this clinical research study is to learn if this drug combination can help to control the disease.

 This will also be studied in the safety lead-in.

 The safety of this drug combination will be studied in both parts of the study.

 This is an investigational study.

 The chemotherapy drugs used in this study are all FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of certain types of cancer.

 The combination of these drugs is investigational.

 The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.
