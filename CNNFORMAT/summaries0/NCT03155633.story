(thirdQuint)Run, Recovery, Repeat, Always Healthy ("Corre, Recupera, Repite, Siempre Saludable").

 The marathon runners suffer a high fatigue, as has been studied by different investigations, the proposal of this study is to know how the recovery processes are produced in runners who have completed a 42km test.

 To do this, baseline measurements of the runners have been made through stress tests and determinations of biomarkers in blood and urine.

 Subsequently blood and urine samples were taken the day before the marathon test and blood and urine samples were then taken again on arrival at 24h, 48h, 96h, 144h, and 196h.

 At the same time, an intervention was carried out in the recovery phase, with the runners in three groups.

 The first one performed rests during the 9 days after the race, the second performed continuous race monitored every 48h from the end of the race, and the third group performed aerobic work on an elliptical machine under the same conditions as the group of Continuous race.

This study has as main objective to know how the processes of recovery are realized after a race of marathon.

 For this, the participants of a marathon race are divided into three work groups during the 9 days post-marathon, one with rest in the recovery period, another with continuous race three sessions every 48h and another with three sessions of elliptical every 48h .
