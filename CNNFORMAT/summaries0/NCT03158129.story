(fifthQuint)Study Of Induction Checkpoint Blockade For Untreated Stage I-IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers Amenable For Surgical Resection.

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups.

 This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

 If you are in Group A, you will receive nivolumab alone.

 If you are in Group B, you will receive ipilimumab and nivolumab.

 Study Drug Administration: You will receive nivolumab by vein over 60 minutes on Days 1, 15, and 29.

 If you are in Group B, you will also receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes on Day 1.

 Length of Treatment: You may receive 3 doses of nivolumab before your scheduled surgery.

 However, in some cases fewer than 3 doses of nivolumab may be allowed before surgery.

 If you are in Group B, you may receive 1 dose of ipilimumab.

 Your surgery to remove the disease will most likely be performed at least 21 days after the last dose of nivolumab.

 You will sign a separate consent form that explains the procedure and its risks.

 Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up.

 Study Visits: Within 7 days before your Day 15 and Day 29 nivolumab doses: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 5 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

 At least 14 days after the last nivolumab dose on Day 29: - You will have a PET-CT scan and a CT scan of the chest.

 - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

 - You will have lung function tests.

 - You will provide a stool sample for biomarker testing.

 Leftover tissue removed during surgery (normal tissue, tumor tissue, and lymph tissue) will be collected and stored at MD Anderson for use in future biomarker testing.

 No extra tissue will be removed, as it is tissue that would be removed anyway for surgery and to check the status of the disease.

 A research bank will be created so that biomarker testing can be performed for as long as needed.

 Your samples will be given a code number.

 No identifying information will be directly linked to your samples.

 Only the researcher in charge of the bank will have access to the code numbers and be able to link the samples to you.

 This is to allow medical data related to the samples to be updated as needed.

 End-of-Treatment Visit: Within 8 weeks after surgery: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

 Follow-Up: After the end-of-treatment visit, your medical record will be reviewed or you will be called, contacted by mail, or e-mailed to check on your health.

 If you are called, these calls should last about 5 minutes.

 You may also be asked these questions during regularly scheduled clinic visits.

 The follow-up period will last for as long as the study doctor thinks the information is needed.

 Study Of Induction Checkpoint Blockade For Untreated Stage I-IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers Amenable For Surgical Resection@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to compare nivolumab alone to nivolumab plus ipilimumab when given to patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that can be surgically treated.

 Researchers want to learn how effective both study treatments may be in helping to control NSCLC after surgery.

 This is an investigational study.

 Nivolumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of NSCLC that has spread.

 Ipilimumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of melanoma.

 Combining these drugs is investigational.

 Your doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

 Up to 66 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
