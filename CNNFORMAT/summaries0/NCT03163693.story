(firstQuint)The Effects of Dexmedetomidine on cTnI and GP-BB in Patients Undergoing OPCABG.

 Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective 2-adrenoceptor agonist used as a sedative or adjuvant anesthetic drug in clinical settings.

From clinical observation, dexmedetomidine has been revealed to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events in patients with heart diseases during non-cardiac surgeries.

Therefore, the aim of this sudy is to observe the impact of dexmedetomidine on Cardiac Troponin I and Glycogen Phosphorylase Isoenzyme BB in patients during cardiac surgeries.
