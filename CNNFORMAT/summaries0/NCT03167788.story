(thirdQuint)Red Cell Rejuvenation for the Attenuation of Transfusion Associated Organ Injury in Cardiac Surgery.

 In the REDJUVENATE trial, we propose to establish whether the administration of rejuvenated red cells will reduce inflammation and organ injury in cardiac surgery patients at risk of large volume blood transfusion when compared to standard care.

 Organ injury and sepsis accounts for the majority of all deaths following cardiac surgery.

 Once organ injury is established care is primarily supportive and there are no effective treatments.

 Prevention is therefore a key clinical strategy to prevent death, morbidity and high healthcare costs attributable to these complications.

 Sepsis and inflammatory organ injury are also the principal causes of death following paediatric cardiac surgery, trauma, non-cardiac complex surgical procedures and in critical care; clinical settings that are also among the principal consumers of blood components.

 National and international blood management strategies are focused on these patients.

 Evidence of a clinical benefit attributable to the use of rejuvenated red cells in cardiac surgery patients is therefore likely to translate into more widespread benefits to patients and the National Health Service (NHS).

The REDJUVENATE Trial proposes to test the hypothesis that postoperative organ injury and inflammation will be less if patients undergoing cardiac surgery who are at risk of large volume blood transfusion (defined as the administration of 4 units of red cells) receive rejuvenated washed cells compared to standard care (unwashed aged stored cells).
