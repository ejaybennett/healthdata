(thirdQuint)Online Videos and New Feeding Content to Enhance a Current EFNEP Program.

 During Phase I of the project (first two years), the leadership team composed of both research and extension investigators will work with the media production team to edit the SEEDS videotapes to meet the needs of the current project and to develop the website and activities for use in the online condition.

 Phase II (second two years) will be a large scale evaluation of this program.

 In this phase, classes of EFNEP participants in Colorado and Washington will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1) Eating Smart cent Being Active alone (control); 2) Eating Smart cent Being Active plus feeding videos at the weekly EFNEP sessions, plus facilitated group discussion (in-person); or 3) Eating Smart cent Being Active plus online videos and activities, (online).

 Pre- and post-program assessments, 6- and 12-month follow ups will be conducted to assess responsive feeding, providing structure, food exploration, child eating behaviors, parent knowledge, and child dietary intake.

 Child dietary intake will be obtained on a sub-sample of 60 participants.

 In Phase III (year 5), the investigators will begin dissemination.

 A total of 350 participants will be recruited in five locations to participate in the project: 175 from two counties in Colorado and 175 from three counties in Washington (English and Spanish participants).

 A total of 4 to 10 mothers will be recruited for each group.

 After recruitment, groups will be randomly assigned to the three conditions ensuring a relatively equal number of participants per condition.

 Data from children who have any kind of food allergies or diabetes or are on special diet will be excluded from the analyses.

 To ensure program fidelity, program educators will complete implementation checklists, and 20% of the sessions will be attended by an additional grant staff member to conduct implementation observations and assess participant engagement.

 Detailed records of participant attendance will be collected to assess dosage effects and attrition.

 All assessments will be conducted by grant project staff blind to the group status of the participants.

 Retention of participants will be maximized using strategies such as obtaining multiple phone numbers for each family; obtaining external contact information for siblings and close friends; sending interim reminders with the goal of fostering contact should the family move; and phone calls, emails or letters between data collection points to each family.

The goal of this study is to further increase the impact of a validated and widely-used Eating Smart cent Being Active EFNEP curriculum by teaching parents responsive feeding practices resulting in the development of healthier patterns of child eating behavior and food intake.

 Additionally, the effectiveness of two delivery strategies for adding feeding video-based content will be examined (in-person versus online lessons).
