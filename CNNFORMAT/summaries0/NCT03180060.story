(fifthQuint)Meta-Analysis of Stress Myocardial Perfusion Imaging.

 Review question: What non-invasive cardiovascular imaging tests (SPECT, Stress Echo [SE], Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [CMR], CT Perfusion [CTP] and PET myocardial perfusion) have the best diagnostic accuracy to detect obstructive coronary artery disease using four different cutoffs, two anatomic (invasive coronary angiography) and two functional (invasive fractional flow reserve)? Which non-invasive cardiovascular imaging tests (SPECT, Stress Echo, CMR, CTP and PET myocardial perfusion) have the least bias and heterogeneity in their published data? Searches: Search in MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases for the literature published in English or Spanish from January 1970 to December 2015 of all prospective and retrospective studies performed with Stress Echo, SPECT, PET, CMR and CTP in patients with suspicion or known CAD compared against the reference standard of ICA (two cutoffs: lesions >50% and >70%) and/or invasive FFR (two cutoffs: 60% to be considered for further analysis, any disagreements between the junior and/ senior review authors over the risk of bias in particular studies were solved by discussion during an extra research meeting of two senior authors, with involvement of a third reviewer when necessary.

 The publication bias was evaluated in graphic manner using Funnel plots and in mathematical form with Begg and Egger tests.

 A value of p<0.

05 was defined as significant.

 Strategy for data synthesis: We performed Forrest plots for each test and HSROC curves with the Moses-Littenberg method.

 We calculated AUC and Q* for each test.

 Total values of sensitivity, specificity, DOR, LR+ and LR-, as well as 95% CI were calculated using the bivariate model of Teitsma and the models of HSROC (hierarchical summary ROC) of Rutter and Gatsonis.

 The differences between the tests were evaluated using meta-regression comparing different models with the likelihood ratio test.

 The analysis of heterogeneity between studies was evaluated in graphic form in the HSROC curves, and in mathematical manner with meta-regression and the calculation of Higgins' I2; this last test, Higgins' I2, was not reported within the results, since in diagnostic test accuracy studies, this I2 statistic alone may not be informative as they do not consider threshold effect; in comparison to this same statistical test when it is used for the analysis of heterogeneity between therapeutic and or interventional studies, since a threshold effect can be considered.

 In our study the publication bias was evaluated in graphic manner using Funnel plots and in mathematical form with Begg and Egger tests.

 A value of p<0.

05 was defined as significant.

 Analysis of subgroups: To analyze statistical differences in diagnostic accuracy between modalities, we based the analyses on mathematical combinations and used the term "certainty" to refer to diagnostic accuracy that one imaging modality has over the other one; then we performed the meta-regression analysis for comparison of "certainty" between two imaging modalities at the same time.

 We used a graphic representation for the results.

 We did a post-hoc analysis by sub-groups to all other variables, common to every technique and/or specific for each imaging modality studied.

 Dissemination plans: A paper will be submitted to a leading journal in this field.

 The findings of the review produced solid evidence that can change current worldwide practice for the benefit of patients, institutions and public health services by obtaining higher accuracy in the diagnosis of significant coronary artery disease in terms of myocardial ischemia, thus avoiding extra unnecessary tests, less harm to the patients and less unnecessary expenses.

 Current review status: Completed but not published.

 Meta-Analysis of Stress Myocardial Perfusion Imaging@highlight

Background: Detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is important due to its high prevalence and its medical and economic implications.

 Purpose: A systematic review of the diagnostic performance of stress echocardiography (Echo), SPECT, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), CT Perfusion (CTP) and PET versus invasive coronary angiography (ICA) or fractional flow reserve (FFR) using hierarchical summary ROC (HSROC) methods.

 Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCOPUS for literature published in English or Spanish from January 1970 to December 2015.

 Study Selection: For inclusion, studies had to meet the Cochrane guidelines, had to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity methods, and use ICA and/or FFR.

 Only those studies with STARD methodology 60% were included.

 Data Extraction: Ten investigators extracted patient and study characteristics and 4 resolved any disagreements.
