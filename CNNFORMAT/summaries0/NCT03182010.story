(firstQuint)Ultrasound Evaluation of Cesarean Scar After Uterotomy Closure With Barbed and Conventional Sutures.

 The aim of this randomized control trial is to compare the residual myometrial thickness and the depth of cesarean section scar defect after uterine incision closure with barbed or conventional sutures.

 Primigravida patients undergoing transverse lower segment cesarean section will be included in the study.

Cesarean section incision will be closed with double layers of continuous barbed or conventional sutures.

 Ultrasound examination will be performed 6 months after the operation to measure the residual myometrial thickness and the scar depth.
