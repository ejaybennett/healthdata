(firstQuint)Study of Antithrombotic Treatment After Intracerebral Haemorrhage.

 Patients with spontaneous ICH have an increased risk of recurrent ICH and they also have an increased risk of ischaemic diseases.

 Around 40-50% of patients use, or have an indication, for antithrombotic drugs at the time of ICH.

 However, little is known about the benefits and harms of using antithrombotic drugs for prevention of ischaemic events in patients who have had an ICH.

 There are only observational studies addressing this question.

 Because of the lack of randomised-controlled trials and the inconclusive findings of the observational studies, guidelines have variably endorsed both starting and avoiding antithrombotic drugs after ICH.

 The investigators therefore want to study the effect and safety of using antithrombotic drugs after ICH.

 Furthermore, since findings on MRI can be biomarkers for subsequent bleeding, there will also be performed a sub-study of the association between such findings on MRI and risk of recurrent ICH during treatment with antithrombotic drugs.

 Patients with indication for antithrombotic drugs who survive primary ICH, will be randomised to either starting or avoiding antithrombotic drugs.

 The follow up period is 2 years, and the primary effect variable is new ICH.

 The investigators will also evaluate functional outcome, death, intracranial haemorrhage, extracranial haemorrhage and ischemic events.

The study evaluates the effects of antithrombotic drugs (anticoagulant drugs or antiplatelet drugs) for prevention of ischaemic events in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage.
