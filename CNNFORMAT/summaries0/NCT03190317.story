(fifthQuint)Health Information for Infected Veterans.

 Over the last twenty years, HIV has transformed from a terminal disease to a condition with near normal life expectancy for patients who follow ideal treatment regimens.

 HIV-infected individuals still face many challenges and need to be active in self-management of their HIV and other conditions in order to live a healthy life.

 In order to ensure that this population of HIV-infected individuals actively self-manages their condition, personal health records (PHRs) should be used more often.

 PHRs may simplify disease self-management, improve health outcomes, and reduce unnecessary health care use.

 The VA has one of the nation's largest PHR systems - My HealtheVet (MHV).

 MHV includes features that can help patient's self-manage their disease (e.

g.

, prescription refill, viewing lab results view, secure messaging).

 While there has been recognition that MHV holds promise as a self-management tool, there has not yet been an examination of use of MHV features and their relationship to health outcomes in any chronic disease group, let alone in HIV-infected Veterans.

 The objective of this project is to evaluate MHV use by HIV-infected Veterans and their providers, by completing three aims/steps.

 Aim/Step 1: Describe the relationship between use of MHV tools for self-management across HIV-infected Veterans and determine their relationship to health outcomes and care processes in these Veterans through review of medical records.

 We will use the VA medical record data, which allows us to study the diverse VA patient population with patients from a range of personal backgrounds, geographic locations, and VA health care networks.

 HIV infection will be determined by the presence of two outpatient HIV diagnoses or one inpatient HIV diagnosis.

 This study will use a retrospective group of HIV-infected Veterans who used MHV between October 2007- April 2017 to evaluate the relationship between patient HIV care outcomes and MHV tool use.

 We will look at data to carefully consider HIV-infected patient health status, health care received, and activity.

 We will also look at Quality of Care (QC) outcomes which include medication adherence, CD4 count, viral load testing and detectable viral load, appointments, patient cancellations, patient no-shows, emergency department visits, flu vaccination, and syphilis and lipid testing.

 This aim/step will allow us to examine differences in VA patients who have opted to use MHV versus those who have not opted to use MHV.

 Aim/Step 2: Describe how Veterans with HIV use MHV for self-management, and why they choose to use (or not to use) specific MHV tools; and similarly how and why providers use (or do not use) MHV.

 We will interview Veterans and providers to learn what motivates certain patients and providers/staff to use MHV the way they do, or to understand MHV system issues, as well as attitudes and perceptions that prevent others from using MHV.

 We will select patients and providers from six VA medical centers and interview those with high-, low, or no- MHV use.

 We will discuss how they use MHV to manage their HIV and other conditions.

 We will discuss with them how their providers use MHV as a tool for communication and coordination.

 With Veterans not using MHV (or minimal use) we will ask about their reasons.

 The interviews will be audio-recorded.

 Aim/Step 3: Incorporate findings from Aims/Steps 1 and 2 to design an intervention that will be tested by Veterans and providers.

 We will compare the data from aims/steps 1 and 2 to develop an intervention that may improve self-management in Veterans with HIV.

 We will identify Veterans and providers from two VA medical centers that will help us test the intervention through "cognitive walkthroughs.

" Cognitive walkthroughs are used to test an intervention that is in the early stages of development.

 Veterans and providers will be the first to test if the intervention is acceptable and feasible.

 They will also offer feedback to the researchers as it relates to problems with using the intervention.

 The cognitive walkthroughs will be audio- and video-recorded.

 Health Information for Infected Veterans@highlight

This is a study of study of My HealtheVet (MHV) use by Veterans diagnosed with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and VA providers/staff who care for them.

 We hope to learn and understand how MHV can improve the self-management of chronic conditions like HIV.

 First, we will review Veteran medical records to look at the relationship between use of MHV and whether it has a positive or negative impact on the Veteran's management of HIV.

 Next, we will interview Veterans to find out how they use MHV for self-management and both Veterans and providers to find out why they choose to use (or not to use) specific MHV tools.

 Lastly, we will use the information we found from the first two steps and create an intervention that will encourage non-MHV users to use the MHV tools that can help them achieve their health-related goals.

 Once the intervention has been developed, Veterans and providers will participate in a "cognitive walkthrough" where they will help the researchers test the intervention to see if it is usable, possible, and acceptable.
