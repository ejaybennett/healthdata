(firstQuint)TAK-228 and TAK-117 Followed by Cisplatin and Nab Paclitaxel for Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer.

 Seventy to eighty percent of breast cancers have a gene expression profile which is characterized by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and high proliferation.

 HRD leads to errors in DNA pathway [non -homologous end joining (NHEJ)] that repair DNA-breaks, a process required for metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) survival.

 The hypothesis of this pilot trial is that administration of the oral combination of TAK-228 and TAK-117 (PIKTOR) will inhibit NHEJ in metastatic TNBC, leading at the time of disease progression to metastases that are HR-deficient and sensitive to cisplatin plus nab paclitaxel therapy.
