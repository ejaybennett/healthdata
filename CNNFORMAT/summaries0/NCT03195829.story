(firstQuint)Feasibility Study of a Computerized Cognitive Stimulation.

 Involvement in social and leisure activities has been associated with a decreased risk of dementia in the elderly with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).

 MCI is a crucial phase to prevent the worsening of cognitive decline in elderly at risk to develop dementia.

 These last years, the use of computerized training programs to enhance cognitive functioning showed positive and promising results.

 However, the effects on psychosocial factors still poorly documented in cognitive interventions in MCI.

 It seems essential to promote these factors involving social ties, group dynamic, the motivation, as factors that can contribute to enhance social life and cognitive functioning.

 This feasibility study evaluated a computer-based cognitive stimulation in elderly with MCI and explore the effects on cognitive and psychosocial components.
