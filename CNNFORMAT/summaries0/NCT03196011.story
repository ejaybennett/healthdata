(fifthQuint)Traditional Versus Alternative Alignment in TKR.

 Research Question: When performing total knee replacement (TKR), does the use of the alternative alignment method result in improved function by comparison to a group undergoing the same procedure but using traditional technique? Primary Aim: To identify if the group undergoing TKR using alternative alignment method have a significantly improved functional outcome at 1 year when assessed by the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) of at least 5 points in the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) by comparison to the group using traditional alignment technique.

 Secondary Aims: To identify if the use of alternative alignment method when performing TKR results in: - Shortened length of stay (LOS) in hospital - Improved short term function when assessed by peak quadriceps or hamstrings muscle torque measured by myometer - Lower hospital costs as a result of reduced LOS or operating time - Enhanced improvement in patient outcome scores Knee Osteo-arthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Euroquol (EQ5D) at short, mid and long term timeframes - Enhanced positioning of the implants as assessed by a Computerised Tomography (CT) scan rotational profile assessment - Enhanced range of knee flexion - Any significant differences in component positioning, limb alignment or component wear - Any significant changes in functional ability as measured by the Exeter Functional Lab protocol or Nurture activity assessment tool or the Instride Accelerometer by comparison to the TKR performed with traditional instruments.

 The research team will achieve these aims: - By enrolling 126 patients into this study over a period of 2 years - By carrying out a prospective randomised study looking at the subject matter over a period of 8 years - By analysing patients functional status pre and post-surgery using patient generated questionnaires and data from the Exeter functional lab - By analysing patients the 1 year radiological results from the plain x-rays to look at limb alignment, component position and wear - By analysing the TKR component position on the pre and post-operative Computerised Tomography (CT) scans - By collecting length of stay data taken from the patient administration system - By collating all of the data from the study into a spread sheet for analysis by a professional statistician Scientific Background: Despite being one of the most successful of orthopaedic operations, a number of patients remain dissatisfied after TKR surgery.

 In a study of 253 patients, 1 year after TKR, Noble et al reported 11% of patients were neutral in their satisfaction after their surgery and 14% reported that they were either dissatisfied (3%) or very dissatisfied (11%).

 Reasons for this are not always clear.

 Various changes to surgical technique have tried to address this over the years.

 These include computer assisted navigation and patient specific knee replacement parts.

 However, to Brin et al, the clinical significance of this remains to be proven.

 More recently, attention has focussed on the alignment of the leg.

 Classic mechanical alignment (MA) in TKR is meant to co-align the prosthetic components to the mechanical axes of the femur and tibia and restore neutral overall limb alignment.

 Traditionally, surgeons have believed that implant durability is maximized when postoperative limb alignment is corrected to 0 3 degrees relative to the mechanical axis.

 When implanting the tibial component of a TKR, the surgeon will try and put the device perpendicular to the tibial mechanical axis.

 This is done make sure the stresses on the new knee are equally placed on either side of the joint to try and prevent asymmetrical or accelerated wear on one side of the prosthesis.

 However, Bellemans et al examined 250 asymptomatic volunteers and identified that 32% of men and 17% of women have a varus deformity of the knee.

 Therefore, for many people, placement of the tibial component perpendicular to the tibial mechanical axis may result in the alignment of the leg changing considerably, putting new strains on the soft tissues around the knee itself as well as altering the biomechanics of the adjacent ankle and hip joints with the potential to generate soft tissue strain in these areas also.

 It is possible that this alignment change is a major contributing factor to the dissatisfaction of some patients with TKR.

 Concerns that a failure to achieve "correct" positioning of the TKR components may adversely affect the survivorship of the artificial joint may not be well founded.

 Bonner et al reported upon the survivorship 501 TKRs after 15 years of follow up.

 396 implants were within 3 of the mechanical axis and 105 were not.

 Whilst this latter group may have been expected to have performed inferiorly, the results showed no statistically significant difference in the survivorship of the 2 groups when revision for aseptic loosening was used as the end point for the analysis.

 Similarly, Parratte et al reviewed 398 TKR cases in whom 292 had post-operative limb alignment within 0-3 of the mechanical axis and 106 were outside of this.

 The authors concluded that a postoperative mechanical axis of 0 3 did not improve the fifteen-year implant survival rate.

 Surgeons such as Waterson et al are therefore now questioning the old philosophy of alignment.

 There has been a move to change surgical practice and put the knee replacement parts in place in a way that replicates the alignment of the patient's own original knee-natural, alternative or kinematic alignment (KA).

 Importantly, several studies looking at this KA have not shown any loss of satisfaction with results of knee replacement, and show some signs that in the short term, function of the knee may be better with the new technique.

 Waterson et al reported 1 year follow up data in 71 patients undergoing TKR randomised to either KA (n = 36) or MA (n = 35).

 No significant differences were found between them in function one year post-operatively.

 The authors recommended further research is required to see if any theoretical long-term functional benefits of KA are realised or if there are any potential effects on implant survival.

 Interestingly, in this work, there was a greater improvement in the mean American Knee Society Score (AKSS) in the KA group at six weeks when compared with the MA group (p = 0.

05).

 The measurements of peak torque in the quadriceps were also significantly better in the KA group at six weeks and three months (p = 0.

003 and p = 0.

02 respectively) by comparison to the MA group.

 Whilst this randomised control trial failed to demonstrate any discernible difference between TKRs implanted in KA or MA at 1 year, the authors recommended mid- to longer-term follow-up to confirm the equivocal functional outcome and that survival of the TKR is not compromised by KA relative to MA.

 This new study takes this concept further using manual instruments to try and achieve KA.

 Mizner et al reported deficits in quadriceps force of 30-40% in patients for up to a year after TKR by comparison to age matched subjects.

 They describe reduction of quadriceps muscle performance has been correlated with fall risk, walking speed, speed and quality of sit-to-stand transfers, and performance during stair climbing in individuals older than 60 years of age.

 Such functional deficits can impact significantly on quality of life and this functional reduction could be a contributory factor to the dissatisfaction with TKR reported by some patients.

 Bade et al identified similar reductions in quadriceps strength after TKR at 1 and 3 months post-op that took 6 months to recover to pre-operative levels.

 Again, this can have implications for functional recovery and satisfaction.

 If Waterson's work on KA versus MA shows improvements in early quadriceps function, then it is important to see if this can be progressed further and translated into improved function and satisfaction after TKR.

 Dossett et al reported the results of their work and evaluated an alternative alignment method (KA with patient-specific cutting guides) compared to the alignment results with MA with conventional instruments.

 This was a randomized controlled trial of 41 KA and 41 MA patients.

 In this work, the authors point out that because a mechanically aligned TKR strives to correct limb alignment to a straight line, the kinematics of the knee can be altered.

 They outline the principle behind KA i.

e.

 placement of the components so that the orthogonal 3-D orientation of the 3 axes that describe normal knee kinematics is restored to that of the pre-arthritic knee.

 Two of their secondary outcome measures showed results in favour of the KA knee: The Oxford Score (OKS-0 is best and 48 worst) was 8 in the KA group and 15 in the MA group, a difference of 7 points, which was significant (P.

001).

 The range of knee flexion was 120 in the kinematically aligned group and 115 in the MA group, a difference of 5, which was significant (P .

043).

 It was also of interest that in the Dossett paper the operative time in the kinematically aligned group was 21 minutes less than the mechanically aligned group (P mu Sv) as described by the Health Protection Agency Centre for Radiation, Chemicals and Environmental Hazards (HPA-CRCE) Report 012, 2010.

 In addition, patients enrolled in this trial will require 2 additional whole leg AP x-rays, 1 lateral x-ray of the knee and 2 CT scans covering the hip, knee and ankle.

 The total dose that a patient participating in this trial will receive is 1.

7mSv, of which 1.

6mSv is in addition to standard care.

 Participants are >/= 60 years of age and pregnant women are excluded from the trial.

 The lifetime risk of developing a cancer resulting from the total radiation dose is 1 in 21,900 for a 60 year old patient; this would fall to 1 in 84,900 for an 80 year old patient.

 For the ages of the expected cohort, this is considered to be a very low risk (HPA-CRCE-028, 2011 and NRPB, 2001) and is equivalent to around 8.

5 months of natural background radiation in the UK.

 The lifetime risk of developing a cancer resulting from the excess dose in this trial is 1 in 23,000 for a 60 year old patient; this would fall to 1 in 93,800for an 80 year old patient.

 For the ages of the expected cohort, this is considered to be a low risk (HPA-CRCE-028, 2011 and NRPB, 2001) and is equivalent to around 8 months of natural background radiation in the UK.

 With participants consent, the research team will send anonymised data regarding the navigation findings during the operation, as well as CT and X-ray findings from pre-and post-surgery to Stryker UK.

 This will be with the purpose of providing information to allow the company to improve surgical technique, as well as implant and instrumentation design.

 No personal identifiers will be used when this information is sent to Stryker UK Conflicts of Interest: Stryker UK have supported this study financially.

 However, it remains completely independent from them in study design, results and dissemination of findings.

 The 4 operating surgeons all undertake consultancy work for Stryker UK and will complete the necessary applications regarding this on the ethics application for this study.

 Traditional Versus Alternative Alignment in TKR@highlight

As many as 20% of patients are unhappy with the results of total knee replacement (TKR).

 Various changes to surgical technique have tried to address this but have not led to a significant improvement in the numbers of patients satisfied with their operation.

 Recently, attention has focussed on alignment of the leg.

 When viewed from the front, a number of people do not start with a straight, mechanically aligned leg.

 Traditionally, when implanting a knee replacement, the surgeon tries to put the shin bone half of the knee replacement perpendicular to the floor to equalise stresses on the in and outside of the joint.

 However, this may result in the alignment of the leg changing considerably, straining the soft tissues around the knee and contributing to dissatisfaction with TKR.

 There has been a move by some surgeons to change practice, and to implant the TKR in a way that replicates the alignment of the patient's own original knee- alternative alignment.

 Studies looking at alternative alignment have not shown any loss of satisfaction with results of TKR and indeed are showing some signs that in the short term, function of the knee may be better with the new technique.

 The research team are planning to run a study comparing the knee replacement used in Exeter- the Triathlon- when put in place using traditional alignment versus using the alternative alignment methods.

 The outcomes will be assessed in various ways including patient satisfaction questionnaires, measuring muscle strength, flexibility around the knee, and by assessments of alignment of the new knee on X-rays and Computerised Tomography scans.

 The research team will look at short term results for satisfaction and function of the knee, and in the long term look at wear and survivorship to see if patient satisfaction with TKR can be improved.
