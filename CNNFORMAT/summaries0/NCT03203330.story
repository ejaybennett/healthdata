(fifthQuint)A Study to Determine the Safety and Efficacy of TG-C in Subjects With Kellgren and Lawrence Grade 2 or 3 OA of the Knee.

 This protocol is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of TG-C in treating symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee and determining disease modifying effects of TG-C.

 This study is intended for the treatment of patients with KL Grade 2 and 3 osteoarthritis and OARSI JSN Grade 1 and 2.

 Assessments will be made on both the symptomatic effects of pain (VAS), function (WOMAC), and Quality of Life (SF-12) as well as the physical effects (JSW, MRI evaluations of whole knee joint organ tissues and structure) and biochemical biomarkers.

 This is a placebo-controlled study, TG-C will be compared to normal saline as a control.

 Additionally, this protocol is designed to evaluate the safety of TG-C.

 Safety will be evaluated by observation of the injection site for irritation or other effects, the incidence and severity of adverse events, and changes in physical examination findings, radiographic criteria, and laboratory tests.

 Patients will be followed for 24 months for both safety and efficacy.
