(secondQuint)The Effects of Dark Chocolate (70% Cacao) on EEG Brain Waves in Vigorously Active Individuals.

 The procedures include: On day one, participants will fill out a dark chocolate Likert scale, physical activity assessment, and demographic questionnaire.

 Day two and three, on consecutive days will include, three EEG measurements will be recorded: 1) at baseline, 2) during visualization of rest for one minute, and 3) during visualization of usual vigorous exercise for one minute.

 The second day all three measurements will be recorded without dark chocolate (70% cacao).

 The third day all three measurements will be recorded again.

 Measurements 2 and 3 will be recorded savoring dark chocolate and after fully ingesting the dark chocolate respectively.

 The Effects of Dark Chocolate (70% Cacao) on EEG Brain Waves in Vigorously Active Individuals@highlight

The purpose of this graduate student study is to determine if ingestion of dark chocolate (70% cacao) will change brain frequencies between visualization at a state of rest and a state of exercise performance via electroencephalography (EEG) in vigorously active individuals.
