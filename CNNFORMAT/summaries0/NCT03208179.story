(thirdQuint)Improving PRegnancy Outcomes With Intermittent preVEntive Treatment in Africa.

 Intermittent preventive treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) is one of the pillars of malaria prevention in pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa, in addition to prompt case management and use of long lasting insecticide treated bednets.

 However, mounting resistance to SP by Plasmodium falciparum increasing renders IPTP-SP ineffective.

 Two exploratory trials in Uganda and Kenya demonstrated that IPTp with DP was superior to IPTp-SP for the prevention of malaria infection in pregnancy.

 However, neither study was adequately powered to look at adverse birth outcomes.

 This study is a confirmatory efficacy trial in Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya to determine the efficacy and safety of IPTp with DP alone or in combination with AZ.

 This will be a 3-arm trial, superiority, partial blinded, placebo controlled, randomized trial comparing IPTp with SP, versus IPTp with DP alone, and IPTp with DP+AZ with the following hypotheses: - IPTp with DP is superior to IPTp with SP in preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes.

 - The combination of DP with AZ further reduces adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to IPTp with DP alone.

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of monthly intermittent preventive treatment using dihydroartemisinin piperaquine (DP) alone or in combination with azithromycin (AZ) compared to sulphadoxine-pyrimthamine (SP) for the prevention of malaria in pregnant women in the second and third trimester.
