(secondQuint)Phase 1/2 Study of LOXO-195 in Patients With Previously Treated NTRK Fusion Cancers.

 The trial will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation (Phase I ) and dose expansion (Phase 2) .

 Patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors are eligible if progressed or intolerant to prior TRK inhibitor.

 During Phase 1, a maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended dose for further study will be identified for in patients age 12 and older and patients age <12.

 During Phase 2, the same patient population as designated for Phase 1 will be treated with the dose of LOXO-195 which has been identified during phase 1 to assess specified endpoints.
