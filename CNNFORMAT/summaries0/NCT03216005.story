(firstQuint)Investigation of Femoropopliteal In Situ Valve Formation With the InterVene System.

 Prospective, non-randomized, multicenter pre-market feasibility study to evaluate subjects treated with the BlueLeaf System for the treatment of symptomatic CVI of the lower extremity.

 The BlueLeaf System is designed to form autogenous tissue leaflets from vein walls in the femoral and popliteal veins without the use of a permanent vascular implant for the treatment of CVI.
