(secondQuint)Utility of Tracheal Ultrasonography for the Confirmation of the Endotracheal Tube Placement.

 Confirmation of the ETT placement has utmost importance in the management of airway in emergency medicine (EM).

 Visual examination of the tube (fogging), auscultation, chest x-ray, capnography, capnometry and fiberoptic bronchoscopy are the main tools used for confirmation with increasing diagnostic utilities.

 Recently, tracheal ultrasonography (US) was introduced as a reliable, cheap and readily available method of confirmation of ETT placement.

 Utility of Tracheal Ultrasonography for the Confirmation of the Endotracheal Tube Placement@highlight

The aim of this study is to compare tracheal ultrasound with direct visualization of tracheal rings for the confirmation of endotracheal tube placement in intubated patients.

 We hypothesize that this method is more reliable, cheap, and readily available for all emergency physicians.
