(firstQuint)Phase II Trial of FOLFOXIGIL Versus FOLFOXIRI as First-line Therapy in Patients With mCRC.

 The triple drug regimen FOLFOXIRI (irinotecan, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and folinate) for the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer has shown a significant increase in response rate and overall survival compared to FOLFIRI and FOLFOX.

 The combination of GOLF chemotherapy with GM-CSF and IL-2(GOLFIG regimen) has shown more active than the standard FOLFOX chemotherapy in first-line mCRC patients,through the chemoimmunomodulatory effects.

 SO the FOLFOXIGIL chemoimmunotherapy regimen was designed with the same principle to evaluate the antitumor frontline efficacy in comparison with the FOLFOXIRI regimen as first-line treatment of mCRC patients.

 This is a multicenter, randomized controlled, double-blind, phase II trial.
