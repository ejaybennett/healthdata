(thirdQuint)Functional Assessment in Liver Transplantation.

 Patients will be asked to perform the following study procedures: 1.

 Assessment for hepatic encephalopathy using the Numbers Connection Test.

 This test requires the patient to connect numbers in sequence that are scattered at random on a piece of paper.

 2.

 Measures of frailty and disability selected to capture the multi-dimensional aspects of frailty including functional status and physiologic reserve: Fried Frailty Score: weakness (test of grip strength), exhaustion (patient interview), slowness (gait speed), low activity (patient interview) Short Physical Performance Battery: repeated chair stands, balance testing with feet together, 13-foot walk 3.

 Laboratory tests will all be obtained from the medical record: creatinine, total bilirubin, INR, sodium, albumin.

 All of these tests are necessary for listing for liver transplantation.

 4.

 Blood draw, urine and stool samples will be collected for a sub-group of 1000 patients.

 5.

 Adipose, muscle, liver tissue, and blood will be collected during the liver transplant surgery for a sub-group of 1000 patients.

 Functional Assessment in Liver Transplantation@highlight

This will be a prospective cohort study of patients with cirrhosis who are listed for liver transplantation.

 Subjects will undergo geriatric assessments of frailty, functional status, and disability using functional status measures at baseline and at every clinic visit in the pre-transplant setting.

 Subjects will again undergo functional assessments at every clinic visit through 12 months after transplant.
