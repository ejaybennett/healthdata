(firstQuint)A Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Ascending Oral Single Dose of TAK-418 in Healthy Participants.

 The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-418.

 TAK-418 is being tested in healthy participants in order to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single oral doses.

 The study will enroll approximately 40 healthy participants.

 The study consists of equally divided 5 sequential cohorts of 8 participants each.

 Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the following treatment groups to receive TAK-418 or placebo-matching-which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Cohort 1: TAK-418 5 mg - Cohort 2: TAK-418 15 mg - Cohort 3: TAK-418 45 mg Fasted + TAK-418 45 mg Fed - Cohort 4: TAK-418 90 mg - Cohort 5: TAK-418 180 mg All participants will be asked to take TAK-418 or placebo-matching capsule once on Day 1 in each cohort.

 A washout period of minimum 7 days will be maintained between the doses in Cohort 3.

 This single center trial will be conducted in the United States.

 Participants in this study, will be assigned to one of 5 possible dose cohorts.

 Female participants in Cohorts 1-2 or 4-5, will be in the study for up to 42 days, and male participants will be in the study for up to 212 days.

 Female participants in Cohort 3, will be in the study for approximately 49 days, and male participants will be in the study for up to 219 days.

 This includes 2 in house stays of up to 4 days and 3 nights (Day -1 to Day 3) each.

 Female participants will return for an outpatient visit on Day 4, and for a final follow-up visit on Day 14 (+/- 2 days) (for Cohort 3, the outpatient visit is on Day 4 after each in-house stay, and the final follow-up visit is Day 14 [+/- 2 days] after the second in house stay).

 Male participants will return for additional outpatient visits on Days 91 and 93 (+/- 7 days) and may return for outpatient visits on Days 182 and 184 (+/- 7 days) (depending on results from the Day 93 Visit).
