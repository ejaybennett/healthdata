(secondQuint)Experimental Pain Study to Assess Local Anesthetic Efficacy and Safety of CTY-5339 on Gingival Mucosal Tissue in Normal Volunteers.

 In a blinded study, either benzocaine alone or the combination of benzocaine and tetracaine will be sprayed onto the gingival mucosal tissue.

 Onset and duration of local anesthesia will be evaluated over a one hour period using pin prick and QST heat stimulation.

 Subjects will receive both treatments in a cross-over design with each session separated by 4-14 days.

 A total of 50 subjects (normal volunteers) will be evaluated.

The purpose of this study is to determine if the topical application to gingival tissue of the combination of benzocaine and tetracaine has a longer duration of local anesthetic activity than benzocaine alone.
