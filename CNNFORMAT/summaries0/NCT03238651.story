(thirdQuint)A Study of TAK-659 as a Single Agent in Adult East Asian Participants With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).

 The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-659.

 TAK-659 is being tested to treat people who have NHL or people who have relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL.

 This study will assess the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of single-agent TAK-659 in East Asian participants with NHL including DLBCL.

 The study will enroll approximately 27 to 38 participants, including at least 6 Japanese at RP2D dose level.

 Participants will be assigned to one of the following treatment groups: Dose Escalation Part: TAK-659 DLBCL Expansion Part: TAK-659 RP2D This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan and Republic of Korea.

 The maximum duration of participation in dose escalation part of the study is up to 12 months, unless in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor the participant would derive benefit from continued therapy beyond 12 months.

 In DLBCL expansion part, participants who stop treatment for any other reason other than PD will continue to have PFS follow-up at the site every 2 months from the last dose of study drug up to 6 months or until PD.

 Participants will be followed 28 days after last dose of study drug or until the start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first, for a follow up assessment.

The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK-659 when administered in East Asian participants with NHL who do not have an effective standard treatment available and to characterize the plasma and urine pharmacokinetic (PK) of TAK-659 in East Asian participants with NHL.
