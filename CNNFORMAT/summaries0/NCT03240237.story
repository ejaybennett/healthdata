(thirdQuint)CCM in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.

 This is a pilot clinical study of CCM in addition to optimal medical therapy (OMT) over a 24 week period.

 The primary endpoint shall be a mean change in KCCQ score.

 To further improve the accuracy and objectivity of measurements, assessments of peak VO2 (oxygen uptake) will also be performed.

 Tests can be performed using upright and semi-supine bicycle ergometer or using treadmill.

 In sites where more than one option is available, bicycle ergometer is the preferred option.

 Treadmill is only allowed in case no bicycle is available at the site.

 Each subject shall be consistently tested using the same method throughout the study.

 This pilot study will collect efficacy and safety data in heart failure patients having NYHA class II and III symptoms despite appropriate medication with baseline ejection fraction equal or greater than 50% (HFpEF populations).

 CCM in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction@highlight

This pilot study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of CCM therapy in heart failure patients with baseline EF50% (HFpEF) who have New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or III symptoms despite appropriate medication.

 The terminology of the HF classification HFpEF is based on the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Heart Failure Guidelines.
