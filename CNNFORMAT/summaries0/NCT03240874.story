(fifthQuint)SweetMama: Testing of a Novel Technology for Diabetes Education and Support to Pregnant Women.

 In prior work, the investigators created a text messaging curriculum that was well-received by patients for diabetes-related education and support during pregnancy.

 The team has now drawn upon these earlier phases to develop a mobile health behavior tool to educate and support low-income, minority pregnant women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

 This "first-of-its-kind" mHealth platform for pregnant women with GDM or T2DM is called SweetMama.

 SweetMama is a theory-driven application that delivers an interactive, goal-oriented educational and motivational diabetes-focused curriculum.

 SweetMama currently functions as a user-friendly application in which participants are delivered curriculum messages and have the opportunity to receive novel educational, motivational, or supportive content when desired by patients.

 To perform usability testing, the investigators will first conduct focus groups with 10-20 low-income pregnant women with DM to evaluate tool functionality, design, and interpretability.

 The investigators will then conduct a phase of individual usability testing with 20 women, who will use SweetMama for 4 weeks followed by qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (questionnaires and user interaction data) assessments of tool satisfaction and use.

 SweetMama: Testing of a Novel Technology for Diabetes Education and Support to Pregnant Women@highlight

Diabetes during pregnancy is a challenging clinical situation requiring substantial patient engagement.

 The investigators have developed a novel early-phase tool, called SweetMama, incorporates educational, motivational and supportive elements to positively impact maternal health behaviors.

 This phase of work involves develop an optimized version of SweetMama via a 2-step sequential process of in-depth usability testing - focus groups and individual usability testing followed by refinement of SweetMama based on participant input.
