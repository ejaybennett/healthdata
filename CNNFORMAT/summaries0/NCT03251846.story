(fifthQuint)Pediatrics Owning Performance Study.

 This is a prospective, single-arm, single-subject clinical trial to study outcomes related to device use in the pediatric diabetes population.

 Patients will be recruited at the Children's Minnesota McNeely Diabetes Clinic and satellite clinics during routine office visits over a 6-month period until recruitment goals are met.

 Enrolled subjects will be given a POPS! Device (meter, lancet/test strips, and software app) to use for 6 months with periodic check-ins and follow-ups.

 Primary outcome, HbA1c, will be measured at baseline and 6-month follow-up.

 Secondary aims include assessment of blood glucose testing frequency and quality of life scores following 6-months of device and app use.

 The investigators will also describe sustained use over the study period, average blood glucose and variability, and frequency of hypoglycemic events (blood glucose <70).

 Historical data for each patient will also be recorded from medical records, with each patient serving as their own comparative control.

A more convenient blood glucose monitoring system integrated with a responsive mobile health app may facilitate improved diabetes control in adolescent and young adult patients with Type 1 diabetes.

 The primary aim of this study is to determine if the POPS diabetes management system can improve diabetes control in the adolescent and young adult population.

 The investigators hypothesize that use of the POPS diabetes management device and mobile application (app) will be associated with lower HbA1C after 6-months of use in adolescent and young adult T1D patients.
