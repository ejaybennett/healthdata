(thirdQuint)Low Dose Decitabine + Modified BUCY Conditioning Regimen for High Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia Undergoing Allo-HSCT.

 Allo-HSCT is the most effective treatment stratagey for high risk acute myeloid leukemia.

 At present, modified BUCY is the standard conditioning regimen for AML undergoing allo-HSCT in our institute.

 However, relapse occured in as high as 30-50% high risk AML patients after allo-HSCT.

 Thus, the best conditioning regimen for this subgroup remains to be optimized.

 Low dose decitabine in combination with chemotherapy have been shown to improve comple remission rate of high risk AML patients.

 To reduce the relapse rate after allo-HSCT, low dose decitabine is added in the modified BUCY regimen.

 In this study, the safety and efficacy of low dose decitabine + modified BUCY vs modified BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in high risk undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.

The purpose of this prospective, open-label, randomized multicenter study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of low dose decitabine in combination with modified BUCY vs modified BUCY as a myeloablative conditioning regimen for high-risk patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT).
