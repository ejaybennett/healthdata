(fifthQuint)Olaparib Combined With High-Dose Chemotherapy for Refractory Lymphomas.

 Busulfan Test Dose: You will receive a test dose of busulfan by vein over about 60 minutes.

 Before and after you receive this low-level test dose of busulfan, blood will be drawn several times to check how the level of busulfan in your blood changes over time.

 This is called pharmacokinetic (PK) testing.

 This information will be used to decide the next dose needed to reach the correct blood level that matches your body size.

 You will most likely receive this test dose as an outpatient during the week before you are admitted to the hospital.

 If it cannot be given as an outpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -13 (13 days before your stem cells are returned to your body) and the test dose will be given on Day -12.

 Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for PK testing about 11 times: once before your test dose of busulfan and 10 times over the 11 hours after the dose.

 The blood samples will be repeated again on the first day of high-dose busulfan treatment (Day -9).

 A temporary heparin lock line will be placed in your vein to lower the number of needle sticks needed for these draws.

 If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed for any reason, you will receive the standard fixed dose of busulfan.

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of olaparib based on when you join this study.

 Up to 8 dose levels will be tested.

 Between 3-6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level.

 The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level.

 Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.

 This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of olaparib is found.

 All participants will receive the same dose level of vorinostat, melphalan, and rituximab (for those who receive it).

 The first participants enrolled on this study may receive a lower dose of gemcitabine, but all other participants will receive the same dose level of gemcitabine.

 Study Drug Administration: Starting 2 days before you are admitted to the hospital and on the day you are admitted, you will receive palifermin by vein over about 30 seconds each day to help decrease the side effects in the mouth and throat.

 On Day -11 through Day -3, you will take olaparib by mouth 2 times a day, about 12 hours apart, with or without food, with a glass of water.

 The olaparib tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed, dissolved, or divided.

 Olaparib tablets can be taken with or without food.

 If you vomit after taking your olaparib dose, but you can see all the tablets are intact, you should retake that dose.

 If you miss or vomit a scheduled dose, you should take the scheduled dose up to 2 hours after that scheduled dose time.

 If more than 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, the missed dose should not to be taken and you should wait and take your next scheduled dose.

 On Day -10 through -3, you will take vorinostat by mouth.

 The study staff will tell you how many olaparib and vorinostat tablets to take.

 You will also receive dexamethasone by vein over about 3-5 minutes 2 times each day.

 Dexamethasone is a standard drug given to help decrease the risk of certain side effects.

 On Day -10, if you have a type of B-cell cancer, you will receive rituximab (a treatment used for certain lymphomas) by vein over about 3-6 hours as part of your standard care.

 The study doctor will tell you if you will receive rituximab.

 On Day -9, you will receive gemcitabine by vein over 4 1/2 hours.

 On Days -9, -8, -7, and -6, you will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours.

 On Day -4, you will receive gemcitabine by vein over 4 1/2 hours and then melphalan by vein over 30 minutes.

 On Day -3, you will receive melphalan by vein over 30 minutes.

 On Days -2 and -1, you will rest (you will not receive chemotherapy).

 On Day 0, you will receive your stem cells by vein over about 30-60 minutes.

 You will receive 3 more doses of palifermin by vein, over about 30 seconds each time, on Days 0, +1, and +2.

 As part of standard care, you will receive G-CSF (filgrastim) as an injection just under your skin 1 time each day starting on Day +5 until your blood cell levels return to normal.

 The study doctor will discuss this with you, including how filgrastim is given and its risks.

 You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects.

 You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

 Length of Study: You will be taken off study about 100 days after the transplant.

 You may be taken off study earlier if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Study Tests: Within 7 days before starting study treatment, you will have an EKG to check your heart function.

 This may be repeated during the study, if your doctor thinks it is needed.

 As part of your standard care, you will remain in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks after the transplant.

 While you are in the hospital, blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn every 1-2 days for routine tests.

 After you are released from the hospital until about 30 days after the transplant, you will need to stay in the Houston area to be checked for infections and side effects.

 Between discharge and Day 30, you will come to the clinic every 1 to 2 days for standard follow-up visits.

 The results of these routine tests will also be included in your study record.

 Between Days 30 and 100 after the transplant, you will come to the clinic about every 2 weeks for standard follow-up visits.

 The results of these routine tests will also be included in your study record.

 Every 2 weeks, or more often if your doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 These blood tests may instead be performed by your personal doctor, as long as they agree to provide care as part of this study.

 About 100 days after the transplant: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

 - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease.

 To collect a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy, an area of the hip is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle.

 Olaparib Combined With High-Dose Chemotherapy for Refractory Lymphomas@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety and effectiveness of the combination of olaparib and high-dose chemotherapy (vorinostat, gemcitabine, busulfan, and melphalan, either with or without rituximab) in patients who have non-Hodgkin's or Hodgkin's lymphoma and are receiving an autologous stem cell transplant.

 This is an investigational study.

 Olaparib is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

 Vorinostat is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of lymphoma.

 Melphalan is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of myeloma.

 Busulfan is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of leukemia.

 Gemcitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of lymphoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer.

 Rituximab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 The use of these study drugs in combination to treat non-Hodgkin's or Hodgkin's lymphoma is investigational.

 The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

 Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
