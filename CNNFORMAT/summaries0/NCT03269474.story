(fifthQuint)Computational Drug Repurposing for EBS.

 Although gene, cell, and protein-based therapies are in development for patients suffering from epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), new pharmacological treatments are in dire need.

 Characterizing molecular changes in EBS, including gene expression, can identify new therapeutic targets and drugs that modulate those targets.

 However, sifting through gene expression information to identify the most promising drug targets is a complex data challenge.

 The goal of the study will identify a computational approach to evaluate and identify existing drugs approved for other diseases that can be repurposed for EBS patients.

 The study will perform an unprecedented characterization of gene expression changes in EBS patients compared to healthy, non-EBS individuals across multiple tissues.

 Using a validated computational drug discovery platform, researchers will analyze gene expression and drug data using unique algorithms.

 In the first year, a list of ten, safety drugs more probable to treat the EBS disease state will be identified.

 The most promising drugs discovered will then be tested in the clinic setting.

The study will compare gene expression differences between blistered and non-blistered skin from individuals with EBS, as well as normal skin from non-EBS subjects.

 State of the art computational analysis will be performed to help identify new drugs that might help EBS wound healing and reduce pain.

 Researchers will focus on drugs that have already been approved for treatment of other dermatologic or non-dermatologic diseases, and therefore be repurposed for treatment of EBS.

 Drug development is a very expensive process taking decades for execution.

 Drug repurposing on the other hand, significantly reduces the cost and shortens the amount of time that is needed to bring effective treatments to clinical use.

 To date, there is no specific treatment targeting the physiology and immunologic response in EB patients during wound healing.

 Market availability of repurposed medications will provide EBS patients rapid access to treatments, thus improving their quality of life.
