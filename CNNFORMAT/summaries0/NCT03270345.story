(thirdQuint)One-Day Prevalence Study on Pressure Injuries in Intensive Care Units.

 The objective is to provide an up-to-date, international "global" picture of the extent and patterns of pressure injuries in ICUs.

 Thereto , the plan is to perform a 1-day, prospective, multicenter point-prevalence study.

 The large scale of the project should allow thorough epidemiological analyses.

 More precisely the study will enable to identify: - major risk factors for pressure ulcer development; - preventive measures used in distinct ICU populations and countries; - shortages in the availability of evidence-based measures to prevent pressure sores; - malpractice pressure sore prevention in particular regions or countries; - occurrence rates of pressure ulcers with/without accurate adjustment for risk profile and preventive measures taken; - benchmarking between regions/countries; clinical outcomes associated with pressure ulcers (major organ derangements and mortality); - economic outcomes associated with pressure ulcers (length of ICU stay) and linking these outcomes with local practice regarding prevention measures applied/available.

 - country and regional differences in prevalence of pressure ulcers and outcome.

 Pressures ulcer stages will be graded following the classification system jointly developed by the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel and European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel.

 Data to be recorded include patient demographics, data on severity of underlying disease and acute illness, organ failure, pressure ulcers, major risk factors for pressure ulcers, and measures taken to prevent pressure ulcers.

 One-Day Prevalence Study on Pressure Injuries in Intensive Care Units@highlight

The objective of this study is to provide an up-to-date, global picture of the extent and patterns of pressure injuries in ICUs.

 Point prevalence studies are only of value when performed on a vast scale.

 To sample a representative cohort, it is the intention to recruit about 1200 ICUs with all continents covered and as many countries as possible within each continent.
