(secondQuint)Comparing Forearm and Upper Arm Combi Cast for Distal Forearm Fractures in Children.

 Children with distal radial or forearm fractures needing closed reduction are eligible for this study.

 By drawing lots either an immobilization with an upper arm or forearm combicast will be performed.

 Regular controls after 5, 10, 28 days, 4 weeks and 7 weeks will be performed to check the rate of displacement, consolidation time, wearing comfort and movement of the elbow joint after taking off the cast.

 Comparing Forearm and Upper Arm Combi Cast for Distal Forearm Fractures in Children@highlight

The standard treatment for children with closed reduction of displaced distal forearm fractures is an immobilization with an upper arm combicast.

 The hypothesis is that an forearm immobilization with combicast in children 4-16 years might be sufficient.
