 The study, designed to assess the safety and tolerability of two doses given one month apart of Ad26.

RSV.

preF, an investigational RSV vaccine candidate based on a Ad26 vector expressing the RSV F protein, will be conducted in a double blinded manner.

 The study will be divided in two sequential cohorts: cohort 0 (18-50 year-old adults) and cohort 1 (12-24 month-old RSV seropositive toddlers).

 The vaccine safety will be monitored by reporting solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) and all serious adverse events (SAEs).

 The data will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) to assess safety data and to ensure the continuing safety of the participants enrolled in this study.

 The safety will be monitored throughout the study.
