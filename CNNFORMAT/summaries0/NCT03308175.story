(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Effects of Flat and Modified Inclined Fixed Anterior Bite Planes on Mandibular Position in Growing Females With Skeletal Class 2 Malocclusion Due to Mandibular Deficiency and Deep Bite.

 Two groups of patients the first for flat fixed anterior bite plane, the second for modified inclined fixed anterior bite plane.

Full records are taken to patients.

 Then bands selection for upper first molars,impressions for upper arch with bands fitted and impression to lower arch, fabrication of either flat/ modified inclined fixed anterior bite planes and cementation in patient's mouth,evaluation of results after 8 months.

 Evaluation of the Effects of Flat and Modified Inclined Fixed Anterior Bite Planes on Mandibular Position in Growing Females With Skeletal Class 2 Malocclusion Due to Mandibular Deficiency and Deep Bite@highlight

This study will be conducted to see if unlocking mandible from deep bite in growing females by flat fixed anterior bite plane will change mandibular position in skeletal mandibular deficiency and if there is a difference in the change of mandibular position if we assisted the mandible by holding it in a more forward position by modified inclined fixed anterior bite plane .

These results will be compared to normal mandibular growth from previous records of a matched control group in the discussion afterthat.
