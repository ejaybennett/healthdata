(fifthQuint)Timing of Antihypertensive Medications on Key Outcomes in Hemodialysis.

 High blood pressure (BP) is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and upwards of 90% of patients with end- stage renal disease (ESRD) have high BP.

 Appropriate BP management, therefore, is a fundamental part of patient care in ESRD, yet the question of when best to take antihypertensive medications relative to the hemodialysis treatment session remains unanswered.

 Many patients on hemodialysis suffer from an abrupt fall in BP during the dialysis session (i.

e.

, intradialytic hypotension [IDH]), a phenomenon that is associated with numerous adverse outcomes.

 In an attempt to minimize IDH, patients are often told to withhold antihypertensive medications prior to hemodialysis, and current guidelines suggest taking antihypertensive medications at night to minimize IDH.

 However, there are no data regarding the safety of these antihypertensive medication timing strategies, or whether these strategies are effective in reducing IDH.

 Timing of Antihypertensive Medications on Key Outcomes in Hemodialysis@highlight

For patients with kidney failure requiring hemodialysis treatment, sometimes the blood pressure will drop too low during dialysis.

 In an effort to prevent that from occurring, patients are frequently told to skip doses of their blood pressure medications.

 However, whether this actually prevents blood pressure drops during dialysis, and whether it may cause more uncontrolled high blood pressure is unknown.

 TAKE-HOLD will study the effect of taking or holding blood pressure medication on blood pressure for patients on hemodialysis.
