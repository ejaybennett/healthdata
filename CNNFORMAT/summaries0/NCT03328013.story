(fifthQuint)Impact of HPV Vaccination to Catch up in the Emergence of Lesions of the Cervix.

 In France, the observed vaccination coverage is very low for a complete regimen and has been declining since 2010.

 This low coverage makes it impossible to benefit from the efficiency observed in the other countries.

 Indeed, a high HPV vaccination coverage rate would allow an epidemiologically significant impact with a reduction in cervical cancer mortality.

 In France, it is estimated that the vaccination of 80% of girls between the ages of 11 and 14 would reduce the incidence of 72% of CIN2 and 54% of CIN3.

 Nevertheless, there is less data on patients who have been vaccinated in catch-up.

 These patients are 25 years of age or older in 2017, and make smears.

 The aim of this study is to demonstrate whether HPV catch-up vaccination results in a decrease in the abnormal smear rate compared to the rate in unvaccinated patients.

 If our study shows the benefits of catch-up vaccination, these data will help to mobilize doctors to vaccinate girls 15-19 years of age against HPV if they have not been able to benefit between 11 and 14 years as recommended.

 Impact of HPV Vaccination to Catch up in the Emergence of Lesions of the Cervix@highlight

In France, the vaccination coverage observed for HPV vaccination is low for a full-scale regimen, and has been falling since 2010.

 A high rate of HPV vaccination coverage has a significant epidemiological impact with a reduction in cervical cancer mortality.

 There is less data on vaccinated catch-up patients.

 In 2017, these patients are 25 years of age or older and carry out screening smears.

 The aim of this study is to demonstrate whether HPV catch-up vaccination results in a decrease in the abnormal smear rate compared to the rate in unvaccinated patients.

 If so, these data will help mobilize doctors to vaccinate patients against HPV, even in catching-up.
