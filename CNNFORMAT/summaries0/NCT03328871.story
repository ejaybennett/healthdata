 The Combination Therapy of Fractional Laser and PRP Compared With Nanofat Grafting and PRP Synergy in Treating Striae Gravidarum.

@highlight

Nowadays, multiple treatment modalities have been applied clinically to treat striae gravidarum, such as laser therapy, microdermabrasion, platelet-rich plasma injection(PRP), etc.

 To some extent, these treatments can improve striae gravidarum.

 One is fractional laser and PRP injection synergy, and the other one is treated by nanofat grafting with PRP injection.
