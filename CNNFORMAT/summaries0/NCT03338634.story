(secondQuint)Pilot Testing of Food Images in Children.

 The Pilot Test Session will take place in the Children's Metabolic Kitchen and Eating Behavior Lab in Chandlee Laboratory.

 Child Procedures: Both Child and parent's current height and weight will be obtained.

 After being seated at a computer, they will complete the Children's Anxiety Meter-State (CAMS) and a Freddy Fullness pictorial hunger score.

 Then their ability to discriminate between portion sizes will be assessed.

 They will be shown several pictures of macaroni and cheese on a standard white plate with a grey tablecloth background and asked to determine which picture had a larger amount of food.

 Finally, they will view 180 pictures of common foods and non-food objects (office supplies).

 After each picture, children will be instructed to answer questions about the image (what is this image, how happy does it make you feel and how excited does it make you feel).

 Children will then score their hunger again with a Freddy Fullness pictorial hunger score and take a Post-Scanning Questionnaire.

 Parent Procedures: Parent's current height and weight will be obtained and he/she will complete a demographic questionnaire.
