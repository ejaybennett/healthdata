(firstQuint)Serum Concentration of Wnt2 and Wnt4 in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome.

 It has been reported that wnt effecory moleculars (wnt2, wnt4, wnt11,wnt10b, DKK1, DKK2) increased in myocardium at acute phase after myocardium infarction in animal experiment.

 These moleculars can be detected in serum or plasma from human subjects.

 However, there is few relevant studies about wnt2 and wnt4 concentration in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

 This study valuates the serum wnt2 and wnt4 concentration in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

 It will possibly enable to find the relationship between serum wnt2 or wnt4 concentration and Hs-CRP, cTnI and prognosis in patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome.
