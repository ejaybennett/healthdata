(fifthQuint)Fertility Life Counselling Aid- FeLiCiA.

 Eligible participants will be recruited by randomisation into a pilot trial of the intervention.

 The pilot trial will be in two groups- the intervention group (FELICIA) and the control group (No intervention/ treatment as usual).

 The intervention group will be see undergo a 6 weekly counselling sessions, using the FELICIA manual to deliver infertility counselling.

 The counselling sessions are to be delivered by the nurses at the infertility clinic who will be trained by the researcher to deliver this intervention.

 The FeLiCiA manual was developed by Dr Abiola Aiyenigba who is the principal investigator.

 FeLiCiA is based on the THINKING HEALTH PROGRAMME developed by Prof Atif Rahman, who will also be supervising the research.

 Further details are available in the FeLiCiA manual, which is attached to his proposal for further reference.

 Semi structure interviews: Qualitative research will be carried out using one to one interviews.

 Patient will be asked to discuss their views regarding the benefits of the intervention in helping them manage the stresses that they face dealing with infertility.

 Study Site: The study will be carried in the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria Study Population The study population will consist of patients attending clinics for the treatment of infertility at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria Sampling Method (N=42): For the external pilot RCT for testing the FeLiCiA intervention, thirty-eight patients are required to have an 80% chance of detecting, as significant at 5% level, an increase in the primary outcome measure from 5% in the control group to 40% in the experimental group.

 We increase this sample size by 10% to account for drop out during the 6 weeks, making up a total of 42 patients to be recruited for the trial.

 Randomization: The participants who have consented to participate in the research will be randomized into 2 groups - the Intervention group and the Control Group.

 The randomization is blinded and allocated using sealed opaque envelopes.

 The envelopes have been prepared by an independent person; all those carrying out the research have no idea what the contents of the envelopes indicate.

 Patients who are eligible and wish to continue with the research will be handed a brown sealed envelope, opened for the first time in the presence of the participant.

 Depending on the content of the envelope patients will be randomized into either the intervention or control group.

 The intervention group will receive the FeLiCiA counselling intervention while the Control group will receive treatment as usual.

 Counselling sessions will take place via discussion once every week for six weeks.

 Each counselling session will last no more than 1 hour.

 Interviews will also take place at the 2 follow up periods at the end of the sis weeks counselling and six months post counselling.

 (See follow up procedure).

 Semi structure interviews: Participants recruited for the qualitative study (one to one interviews) will be interviewed on one occasion for one to one qualitative research.

 An interview sessions is expected to last no more than 1 hour.
