(fifthQuint)Biomarkers of Processed Meat Intake.

 The intake of processed meat has been linked to several adverse health outcomes such as cancer.

 However, little is known about the respective effects of the single products in this diverse group.

 Most epidemiological studies rely on self-reported questionnaires to assess the intake of different foods.

 Even though this method is relatively easy to perform, it is prone to errors such as memory biases of subjects or difficulties in estimating portion size.

 The use of food specific biomarkers may overcome this limitation by offering an objective quantification of dietary exposure.

 No biomarkers for the consumption of processed meat products have been established yet.

 Twelve human healthy adults will participate in a randomized cross-over dietary intervention study and will consume three different processed meat products, fresh meat or no meat, each during 3 successive days followed by a 10-day washout period.

 The metabolite profile in urine and plasma samples will be analysed to find metabolites that are specific for the intake of the processed meat products.

 The identification of these biomarkers in blood and urine will allow a more precise estimation of intake of different processed meat products.

 This will enable a more robust estimation of the risk linked to the intake of processed meat products.

 Biomarkers of Processed Meat Intake@highlight

The intake of processed meat products has been linked to several adverse health outcomes.

 However, estimation of their intake proves difficult.

 This study aims at identifying biomarkers of intake for processed meat products in blood and urine.

 For this, participants of a randomized cross-over dietary intervention will consume highly controlled diets containing non-processed pork, different processed meat products or no meat.

 Urine and plasma will be collected and analysed to identify sets of metabolites that are specific for the intake of the processed meat products.
