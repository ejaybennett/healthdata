(fifthQuint)Satisfaction Following Cesarean Section.

 Presently, the standard of care at our practice is that the discharging physician decides the type and amount of opioid medication to prescribe a patient following a cesarean section.

 After informed consent has been obtained, patients will be enrolled in our randomized-control, equivalence study.

 The experimental group will be prescribed 20 oxycodone-acetaminophen and the control group will be prescribed 28 oxycodone-acetaminophen at the time of discharge.

 Both groups will also be provided with a handout on non-opioid analgesia.

 The groups will be assigned randomly in blocks.

 The investigators will recruit patients either in the clinic, if participants are to have a scheduled cesarean section, or at some time during the hospital admission for delivery.

 The satisfaction survey and pain scale will be administered at the postoperative check by the clinic staff and providers.

 If the patient does not show up for their postoperative visit, 3 attempts total will be made by an investigator to reach the patient and administer both surveys by phone within 2 weeks of discharge.

 A preliminary analysis of the data will be done once half the study patients have been recruited.

 First, block randomization will help limit discrepancies between groups.

 Subject evaluation will generally be limited to no more than 3 weeks following surgery.

 Evaluations will occur at the postoperative visit via two surveys (see below).

 If the patient does not show up for the clinic visit, 3 attempts will be made by an investigator to reach the patient and administer both surveys by phone within 2 weeks of discharge.

 The investigators will recruit patients either in the clinic, if participants are to have a scheduled cesarean section, or at some time during the hospital admission for delivery.

 The satisfaction survey and pain scale will be administered at the postoperative check by the clinic staff and providers.

 These surveys will be stored in a secure location at the clinic.

 If the patient does not show up for their postoperative visit, 3 attempts total will be made by an investigator to reach the patient and administer both surveys by phone within 2 weeks of discharge.

 A preliminary analysis of the data will be done once half the study patients have been recruited.

 The investigators do not foresee any threats to the external or internal validity of the study.

 The investigators are taking many measures to limit study bias.

 First, block randomization will help limit discrepancies between groups.

 Also, strict adherence to the inclusion and exclusion criteria will also help limit confounders that may make data difficult to interpret, such as non-opioid naive patients and complications that may potentially increase pain and opioid requirements.

 Lastly, blinding of patients to the number of pills participants receive will help mitigate patient bias.
