(fifthQuint)Computer-based Intervention for Alcohol-using HIV/HCV+ Women.

 Women co-infected with HIV and HCV are at elevated risk for adverse health outcomes associated with alcohol use.

 Evidence-based alcohol reduction interventions for this vulnerable population are limited.

 To address this gap, the proposed study will harness the multidisciplinary expertise and experience of collaborative Russian-U.

S.

 research team to adapt an effective computer-based intervention, called CBT4CBT, to enhance its appropriateness for HIV/HCV co-infected women and evaluate its efficacy.

 The proposed study will be conducted in three sequential stages: (1) Adaptation, (2) Implementation, and (3) Evaluation.

 Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: (1) adapted computer-based alcohol reduction intervention, or (2) standard-of-care control condition.

 The proposed trial design and analysis provide an appropriate conceptual and methodological framework to assess the efficacy of the adapted computer-based intervention.

 The intervention, if effective, may be an efficient and cost-effective alcohol reduction strategy that is scalable and can be readily disseminated and integrated in clinical care at other AIDS Centres in Russia to enhance women's health and reduce HIV/HCV transmission risk.
