.

 Fibromyalgia is a disease characterized mainly by generalized pain, with great repercussion in the patient's quality of life as well as in his work and social performance.

 There are different therapies that have not been totally effective for the management of this pathology, for that reason it is necessary to look for cost-effective options and the reach of all the patients to obtain remission of the symptoms.

 Fibromyalgia affects 1-4% of the general population, patients manifest chronic pain and other comorbidities such as sleep disorders, fatigue, depression, psychological stress and cognitive disturbances.

 It is a significant cause of loss of employment and disconnection from the social environment.

 A longitudinal, prospective, randomized study with patients diagnosed with Fibromyalgia will be performed at the outpatient clinic of the Rheumatology Service at the University Hospital "Dr.

 Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez "of the Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon.

 DEFINITION OF VARIABLES Dependent variable: Vitamin D levels Conceptual definition: it is considered as pro-hormone, its active metabolite 1-25-dihydroxyvitamin D functions as a hormone since it has its own receptors found in all human cells.

4 Operational definition: Normal levels> 30-100 ng / ml, 10-30 ng / ml insufficiency and a deficit 0.

05 shall be considered significant.

 The statistical package SPSS version 17.

0 for Windows 7 will be used.

 METHODS Allocation method: Consecutive incident patients will be included, those eligible for the study will be assigned to treatment groups using a pre-established allocation table, which was generated in the randomization module of the True Epistat statistical program.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 1.

 Four visits are planned for the evaluation of subjects.

 2.

 At the first visit, the subjects attend the consultation 12 of the Department of Rheumatology at the University Hospital "Dr.

 Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez "where they are evaluated by a rheumatologist to confirm the diagnosis of Fibromyalgia according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology of 1990 and 2010.

 The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) will be applied at baseline and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

 3.

 Once the diagnosis of Fibromyalgia has been made, at the same first visit, a joint ultrasound will be performed by Rheumatologist expert in the field, in order to evaluate the presence of synovitis only in those patients with Primary Fibromyalgia.

 4.

 All patients included in the Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Study will continue with their standard established treatment for the disease and may receive salvage treatment for pain management if they so require.

 5.

 On the second visit, 15 ml of blood sample will be taken through venipuncture.

 4ml of serum will be stored in aliquots of 0.

5mL each in a freezer at -80 C located in the laboratory of the Rheumatology Service, in order to determine basal levels of vitamin D.

 Levels of c-reactive protein and Sedimentation to correlate them with the clinical data of inflammation obtained to the interrogation.

 We will determine levels of serum calcium to rule out the possibility of hypercalcemia at the start of the study and as a safety measure.

 In the case of clinical suspicion of Fibromyalgia secondary to rheumatoid arthritis, the study of rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies will be carried out.

 The Mini-Neuro-psychiatric Interview will be applied by an expert Psychiatrist from the UANL, previously trained to perform this task.

 6.

 At the second visit, subjects will be randomized to placebo or 50,000 international units of Vitamin D3 weekly for 12 weeks.

 It should be noted that neither the Rheumatologist who performed the Fibromyalgia diagnosis nor the person who will be responsible for providing the placebo or the vitamin will know the contents of the capsules.

 A double-blind study is planned.

 7.

 At week 6 of the study a telephone call will be made to all patients to assess adverse effects.

 8.

 The third visit will be performed at week 12 of the study, subjects from both groups are again assessed through the FibromyalgiaImpact Questionnaire (FIQ) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).

 A 15 ml blood sample will be taken to determine vitamin D levels as well as serum calcium levels for monitoring adverse effects.

 9.

 After completing 12 weeks of vitamin D supplementation or placebo as appropriate.

 All subjects in the placebo group will have the option of receiving vitamin D3 supplementation 50,000 IU orally in capsules per week for 12 weeks and then on a fourth visit they will be given a 15ml blood sample to measure vitamin D levels.

 It means that the study will be opened to know the subjects who received placebo after having completed the first twelve weeks.

 The blood samples obtained will be stored in the Laboratory of the Department of Rheumatology only during the duration of the study.

 DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM A patient file will be included (Case report form).

 Finally, the data will be transferred to the database and analyzed with the SPSS program for Windows 7 version 17.

@highlight

Fibromyalgia is a disease that significantly decreases the quality of life of people who suffer from it, has great repercussions at the socio-economic level due to the incapacity it produces.

 It is characterized by generalized pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, psychological stress and mental alterations, besides presenting painful points in different parts of the body to physical examination.

 Having few effective treatments is necessary to explore new options in their management to improve the general conditions of the patient.

 Previous studies have shown that patients with fibromyalgia have had low levels of vitamin D in the blood, a favorable response from post-vitamin D supplementation has been seen.

 This vitamin has been associated with pain pathways and with increased The perception of the same when it is in smaller amount.

 We will select patients with Fibromyalgia diagnosis from the external consultation of Rheumatology of the University Hospital "Dr.

 Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez "of the UANL, over 18 years old who have not been previously supplemented with vitamin D, will initially be measured in blood of vitamin D, in addition to calcium as a safety measure, we will have a group that will only receive placebo and Another that will be supplemented with 50 thousand units weekly for 12 weeks, we will apply a questionnaire that measures pain scale and another one that measures the impact of the disease in the daily life of the patient, this will be done in a beginning and at the end of the 12 weeks .
