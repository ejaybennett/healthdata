(fifthQuint)Impact of Chlordecone on Active Chronic Hepatitis.

 Actually, there is no data concerning the impact of chlordecone on the evolution of fibrosis to cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis whereas many studies have been reported liver damage in mice.

 The goal of this study is to know if co-exposition to chlordecone can induce evolution to cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis due to alcohol or viral hepatitis.

 At first, we will assess a group of patients with chronic hepatitis B, C or due to alcohol without fibrosis.

 And they will be compared to patients with cirrhosis exposed to chlordecone too.

 Patients will be included in 2 hospital centers.

 All these patients should have an active liver disease.

 The activity will be defined by histology or elevated transaminases (>2N), fibrosis will be defined by histology or an association of fibroscan and biological markers.

 Exposition to chlordecone will be evaluated by a blood chlordecone measure for every patient.

 Impact of Chlordecone on Active Chronic Hepatitis@highlight

Chlordecone is known to induce liver damage in rat and mice but no data exists in human being.

 However chlordecone was used until 1993 in French West Indies for banana fields, it is important to test what damage can be induced now, for patients exposed.

 We should consider chlordecone as a potential cofactor of liver fibrosis.

 So we have chosen to compare two populations of chronic hepatitis B, C or alcoholic, with cirrhosis or without fibrosis due to active hepatitis, who had been exposed to chlordecone.
