(firstQuint)A Multicenter Trial of a Shared DECision Support Intervention for Patients Offered Implantable Cardioverter-DEfibrillators.

 The investigators propose the DECIDE-ICD trial: a type II effectiveness implementation hybrid trial of the investigators ICD PtDAs.

 The Investigators will use a 6-site stepped-wedge design, with implementation guided by normalization process theory(R) and evaluation guided by the RE-AIM framework.

 The investigators aim to evaluate reach and effectiveness of the ICD PtDAs using a pragmatic, stepped-wedge design on decision quality (knowledge and value-concordance) and psychosocial outcomes.

 - Hypothesis 1a: PtDAs will reach over 50% of eligible patients.

 - Hypothesis 1b: ICD PtDAs will be effective in improving decision quality in real-world practice.

 - Hypothesis 1c: Better informed patients will have lower anxiety, higher rates of planning for the possibility of deactivation, and increased identification of a surrogate decision maker.

The investigators goal is to assess real-world effectiveness of patient decision aids (PtDA) for high-risk decisions using the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) as a model.
