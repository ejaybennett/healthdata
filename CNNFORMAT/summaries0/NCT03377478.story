(secondQuint)Expanding the Pool in Lung Transplantation.

 The investigators are proposing a proof of concept study in which positive donors will be used for HCV negative patients.

 Following lung transplantation patients will undergo HCV antibody, virus PCR, and liver function testing.

 Recipients whom test positive for HCV viremia for 2 consecutive tests at any point will complete 12 weeks of Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir therapy.

 This initial study would enroll 100 patients and utilize donors that are young, otherwise healthy whom are Hepatitis C antibody positive but Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAT) negative (HCV Ab+/NAT-).

 The recipients would be limited to those patients who have previously consented to receive a high risk lung transplant, consented to participant in this study, and who are physiologically optimized for transplantation (e.

g.

, low risk for lung transplantation).

To perform a study (100 patients) utilizing Hepatitis C positive (HCV Ab+/NAT -) donor lungs for hepatitis C negative recipients with post-operative surveillance and treatment only if a recipient infection occurs.
