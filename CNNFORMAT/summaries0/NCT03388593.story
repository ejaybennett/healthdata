(firstQuint)Study of the Survival of Recombinant Human Neuregulin-1 in Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) Patients.

 The mortality of chronic heart failure patients remains high, in spite of current treatment.

 RhNRG-1(recombinant human neuregulin-1)directly work on the cardiomyocyte and restored the normal structure and function of it.

 Both the preclinical trials, phase II clinical trials and already completed phase III clinical trails have confirmed that rhNRG-1 effectively enhance the heart function, reverse the remodeling of left ventricular, and reduce all-cause mortality in heart failure animals and humans.

 More importantly, rhNRG-1 can significantly reduce the mortality of heart failure subjects with baseline NT-proBNP level 1600 pg/mL and NYHA class II to III.

 Study of the Survival of Recombinant Human Neuregulin-1 in Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) Patients@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of rhNRG-1 in reducing the death rate of heart failure subjects with baseline NT-proBNP level <1600 pg/mL and NYHA class II to III.
