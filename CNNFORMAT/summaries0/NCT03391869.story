(fifthQuint)Trial of Local Consolidation Therapy (LCT) After Nivolumab and Ipilimumab (LONESTAR).

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in the study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 This is done because no one knows if one group is better, the same, or worse than the other.

 - If you are in Arm A, you will receive ipilimumab and nivolumab.

 - If you are in Arm B, you will receive LCT plus ipilimumab and nivolumab.

 You will have an equal chance (50/50) of being assigned to either arm.

 The study doctor will tell you to which arm you have been assigned.

 Before you are randomized to a study group, you will complete a questionnaire about any symptoms you may be having and how those symptoms are affecting your daily living.

 This questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to complete.

 Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle will be 6 weeks (42 days).

 Ipilimumab is given by vein over about 90 minutes and nivolumab is given by vein over about 60 minutes.

 All participants will receive 2 cycles of ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment alone before being assigned to either Arm A or Arm B.

 This is called Induction.

 If you have a complete response (meaning the disease goes away), you will continue to receive nivolumab and ipilimumab as part of your standard care and you will not be randomized as described above.

 However, you will continue to take part in follow-up for this study.

 After Induction, you will receive nivolumab on Days 1, 15, and 29 of each cycle (about every 2 weeks) and ipilimumab on Day 1 of each cycle (about every 6 weeks).

 If you are in Arm B, you will receive LCT within 14 days after your last dose of nivolumab during Induction.

 The study doctor, surgeon, and radiation oncologist will decide if you will have surgery and/or radiation therapy.

 You will sign a separate consent for surgery and/or radiation therapy which describes the treatment in more detail, including its risks.

 After you receive LCT, you will begin to receive nivolumab and ipilimumab as described above.

 Length of Study: You may receive nivolumab/ipilimumab for up to 2 years.

 You will receive LCT one time.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Your participation in this study will be over after follow-up (described below).

 Treatment Beyond Progression: If the disease appears to be getting worse (progression) or the tumor(s) appear to be getting larger, and you agree, you may still be able to receive ipilimumab and nivolumab if you and your doctor decide it is in your best interest.

 You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as possible as described below.

 Sometimes the disease appears to get worse but the study drugs are actually working.

 However, there are risks of continuing to receive the study drugs if the disease is actually getting worse.

 You are still at risk for side effects due to study drugs.

 This could also delay starting other treatments.

 The disease may get worse to the point that you are no longer able to receive other treatments.

 If you choose to receive the study drugs after the disease appears to get worse, you will continue to have study visits as described below.

 The study doctor will discuss this option with you.

 Study Visits: Induction: Before starting Induction therapy and after completing Induction therapy, you will complete the symptoms and daily living questionnaire and blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers.

 Within 3 days before Days 1, 15, and 29 of each cycle: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 At least 10 days after your last dose of nivolumab, you will have a CT scan or PET/CT to check the status of your disease.

 If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an MRI/CT scan of your brain.

 Post-Induction: Every 1-2 weeks during LCT (if you are in Arm B), you will have a physical exam.

 At the end of LCT (if you are in Arm B) or after completing 3 doses of nivolumab (if you are in Arm A), blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

 If you have a certain side effect and the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

 Within 3 days before Days 1, 15, and 29 of each cycle: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 On days you also receive ipilimumab, this sample will be used for thyroid function testing.

 Every 8 weeks, you will have a CT scan or PET/CT to check the status of your disease and you will complete the symptom and daily living questionnaire.

 If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an MRI/CT scan of your brain.

 If the disease gets worse at any time while on study, you will complete the symptom and daily living questionnaire, and blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

 End-of-Study Visit: Within 8 weeks after your last dose of study drugs: - You will have a physical exam.

 - You will complete the symptom and daily living questionnaire.

 - Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

 Long-Term Follow-Up: After you have completed treatment or the disease has gotten worse, you or a family member may be contacted by phone, letter, e-mail, or during a clinic visit to learn how you are doing and if you have started any new therapies.

 If you are called, this call should last about 5-10 minutes.

 This follow-up will continue for as long as you are taking part in this study.

 You will be called at least every 3 months for at least 1 year after the end of radiation therapy.

 During these calls, you will be asked if you have had any side effects related to radiation.

 Treatment Beyond Progression: If the disease appears to be getting worse or the tumors appear to be getting larger, you may still be able to receive the study drugs if you and your doctor decide it is in your best interest.

 Sometimes the disease appears to get worse but the study drug is actually working.

 This is not considered standard in the treatment of cancer.

 Your doctor will discuss with you alternative treatment options which will include available FDA approved therapies as well as participation in other clinical trials.

 However, there are risks of continuing to receive the study drug because the disease may actually be getting worse.

 You are still at risk for side effects due to the study drug.

 This could also delay starting other treatments.

 The disease may get worse to the point that you are no longer able to receive other treatments.

 If you choose to receive the study drug after the disease gets worse, you will continue to have study visits as described above.

 The study doctor will discuss this option with you.

 Trial of Local Consolidation Therapy (LCT) After Nivolumab and Ipilimumab (LONESTAR)@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if local consolidation treatment (LCT-- surgery and/or radiation) plus immunotherapy (ipilimumab and nivolumab) is more effective than ipilimumab and nivolumab alone in treating patients with metastatic (has spread) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not previously received immunotherapy.

 This is an investigational study.

 LCT is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of NSCLC.

 Nivolumab and ipilimumab are FDA approved and commercially available for treatment of many types of cancer.

 It is considered investigational to use nivolumab and ipilimumab to treat metastatic NSCLC.

 The study doctor can explain how the study drugs and LCT are designed to work.

 Up to 270 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
