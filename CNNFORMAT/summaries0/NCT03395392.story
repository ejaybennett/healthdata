(fifthQuint)NRX101 for Moderate Bipolar Depression and Suicidal Ideation.

 Background and Rationale: NMDA antagonist drugs have increasingly been demonstrated to reduce symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation.

 Specifically, NRX-100 (ketamine HCl, 0.

5 mg/kg IV over 40 minutes) has been shown to induce acute reductions in suicidality and depression in patients with bipolar depression, relative to control.

 Numerous reports have documented a 50% reduction in the MADRS depression scale and a 75% reduction in suicidality following a single infusion of ketamine in patients with suicidal ideation and depression.

 While the repeat use of ketamine is not supported and may be contraindicated by the literature, D-cycloserine (DCS), when combined with SSRI antidepressants in patients with treatment resistant depression, and when combined with atypical antipsychotics, in particular lurasidone (NRX-101), has shown separation from control and ability to maintain remission from suicidality and depression over 6 weeks with oral use.

 Primary Objective: - To test the hypothesis that treatment with NRX-101 is superior to lurasidone in maintaining improvement in symptoms of depression as measured by the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Score (MADRS).

 Secondary Objectives: - To test the hypothesis that patients treated with NRX-101 are less likely to experience treatment failure than those treated with standard of care.

 Treatment failure is defined as a 25% or greater return to baseline levels of depression or suicidality, or the need to implement a new treatment plan.

 - To demonstrate that patients treated with NRX-101 are less likely to suffer from akathisia than those treated with lurasidone.

 - To demonstrate safety and tolerability for both NRX-101 vs.

 lurasidone.

 Methodology: A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, trial in which patients with moderate levels of bipolar depression (MADRS >20) and subacute levels of suicidal ideation (C-SSRS 2 or 3) are randomized to receive twice daily oral NRX-101 or lurasidone (standard of care).

 NRX101 for Moderate Bipolar Depression and Suicidal Ideation@highlight

NMDA antagonist drugs have increasingly been demonstrated to reduce symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation.

 NeuroRx has developed NRX-101 (fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine and lurasidone) for oral use in the treatment of bipolar depression with suicidal ideation.

 This study will test the hypothesis that NRX-101 is superior to lurasidone alone (the standard of care) in maintaining remission from symptoms of depression (primary endpoint) and suicidal ideation or behavior (declared secondary endpoint) over a six week period of twice-daily oral dosing.
