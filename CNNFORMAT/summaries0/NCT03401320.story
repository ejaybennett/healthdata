(secondQuint)Evaluation of IM Letrozole ISM Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability in Healthy Post-menopausal Women (LISA-1).

 The objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of a single ascending doses of Letrozole ISM(R) (Rovi), and secondly, to evaluate safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of Letrozole ISM, measure estrogen levels, and characterize oral letrozole pharmacokinetic profile to be used in subsequent comparison to Letrozole ISM.

 The study will be carried out in healthy post-menopausal women who satisfy inclusion and exclusion criteria.

 The study design includes a screening period and 2 treatment periods.

 Treatment Period 1 will comprise of 14 oral dose administrations of 2.

5 mg Femara(R).
