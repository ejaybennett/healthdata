(fifthQuint)MRgFUS Versus EBRT in Patients With Metastatic Non-spinal Bone Disease.

 This is a prospective, randomized, double arm study to collect data on safety and effectiveness of ExAblate MRgFUS and EBRT treatments of metastatic bone tumors.

 Following treatment assignment and treatment itself, subjects will be followed for up for 6 months to evaluate pain relief as well as quality of life.

 Additional data regarding dosage and frequency of analgesic consumption for the management of the bone tumor induced pain will also be collected.

 MRI of the treated lesion will be obtained 3 and 6 months post therapy to evaluate effect on the lesion in both radiation and MRgFUS arms.

 This is clinically acceptable and widely utilized diagnostic method in follow up of this patient population.

 Data will be collected for total of 144 patients, 72 patients treated by EBRT and another 72 patients treated by FUS.

 Treating physician, as of his/her normal practice, might offer additional treatment of other type in cases where pain score of the treated lesion will not improve by at least 2 points, and will remain 4 or greater.

 Additional treatment may be performed up to one month following treatment.

 Prior to offering alternative treatment, an MRI will be performed to evaluate effect on the lesion.

 Patient receiving another treatment, different from the initial one (i.

e.

 patient initially treated with FUS is now treated by EBRT) will be considered as treatment failures for the primary analysis and their post-x-over follow-up results will be analyzed separately.

 MRgFUS Versus EBRT in Patients With Metastatic Non-spinal Bone Disease@highlight

The objective of this trial is to collect and compare safety and effectiveness data of Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) using the ExAblate 2100 device and radiotherapy in the treatment of metastatic bone tumors.

 This study is designed as a prospective, double arm, randomized study with External Beam radiation therapy (EBRT) serving as control arm.

 The study hypothesis is that MRgFUS is an effective non-invasive and safe treatment for the palliation of metastatic bone tumors with a low incidence of co-morbidity as compared to EBRT.
