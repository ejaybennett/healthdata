(thirdQuint)Music vs.

 No Music During Cesarean Delivery on Patient Satisfaction.

 Background: Several studies have demonstrated that music can improve various outcomes during labor and delivery.

 However, many of these studies suffer from severe methodological flaws.

 In particular, patient satisfaction is often measured on a simple VAS scale, where 0 is no satisfaction and 10 is the highest satisfaction.

 However, patient satisfaction is a complex parameter to measure, and may be affected by a number of different factors.

 This will be the first study performed on the labor and delivery unit to assess patient satisfaction with a validated, reliable, 22-question survey in the setting of music or no music during the cesarean delivery.

 Although "music" is an all-encompassing term that describes sound with different pitches and rhythms that comes together as a harmonious whole, not all music is the same.

 Using "music" for therapeutic purposes would be the equivalent of using "antibiotics" to cure an infection; it is too general of a term, and unlikely that such a general use of music would show a valid therapeutic benefit.

 However, a study demonstrated that specific selections of Mozart piano sonatas, which have a specific rhythm and mode, improve patient anxiety through a biochemical mechanism (changing the plasma levels of IL-6 and epinephrine).

 Therefore, in this study, the term "music" will specifically means the same Mozart sonatas as described in the prior study.

 Objectives: The objective of this study is to determine the effect of music on patient satisfaction and anxiety during cesarean delivery.

 The study will evaluate this objective by studying the following outcomes: - The primary outcome of this study is patient satisfaction.

 This outcome will be measured using Morgan's "Maternal Satisfaction Scale for Cesarean Section" (MSSCS) on post-operative day one during the hours of 8am-1pm.

 - The secondary outcome will include anxiety at several time points (immediately prior to and after neuraxial technique placement as well as at the end of surgery).

 This will be evaluated using a simple numeric rating score from 0-10, where 0 is no anxiety and 10 is the greatest anxiety.

 The hypothesis is that parturients exposed to music during cesarean delivery will have greater overall satisfaction and less anxiety.

 Study Timelines: - Participation begins at the time of consultation for cesarean delivery on the day of surgery, where the co-investigator Dr.

 Dahlawi will approach the participants and ask them to sign the ICF, and it ends after the post-anesthesia check on postoperative day 1.

 After recruitment and consent, patients will be randomized using a computer-generated randomization scheme will be used to allocate patients to one of the arms of the study.

 - The two arms of the study are as follows: - Control group: baseline hemodynamics and anxiety screen; no music - Intervention group - Mozart: A study investigator will turn on a playlist of pre-selected Mozart music.

 - Given the sample size calculation and that not all women who are approached will consent to the study, the investigators expect recruitment to take 12 months.

 - The estimated date for primary analyses will be November 2018 - The investigators estimate that it will take an additional 12 months to complete the study, including statistical analysis and manuscript preparation.

 Procedures: After reviewing their medical records, the co-investigator, Dr.

 Dahlawi, will approach parturients meeting inclusion criteria on the day of admission for scheduled cesarean delivery at Tufts Medical Center.

 The research study will be explained and parturients will be given an informed consent form to read.

 After the parturient read through the informed consent form, think about the risks and benefits, and ask questions, she will be asked to sign the form if she wishes to participate in the study.

 The informed consent form will then be stored in the principal investigator's locked office.

 Once a study subject is enrolled, the anesthesia provider, obstetric provider, as well as the nurse will be informed that this parturient is part of the study.

 Once the subject is recruited, patient demographic data and baseline vitals signs (including anxiety levels) will be collected.

 All parturients will receive a standardized spinal technique using 1.

6 mL of 0.

75% hyperbaric bupivacaine with 15mcg fentanyl and 200mcg morphine, which is the typical standard dose at Tufts Medical Center in nulliparous parturients.

 Upon entry into the operating room, parturients who are randomized to music will start to listen to the Mozart piano sonatas during the entire procedure, while those randomized to no music will not listen to any music.

 After at least 5 minutes of listening to music and immediately after the spinal anesthetic is placed, anxiety levels and vitals signs will be assessed again.

 At the end of surgery, after coming into the PACU, anxiety and vitals will be assessed.

 Finally, on postoperative day 1, during the hours of 8AM - 1PM, patient satisfaction will be assessed by administering the MSSCS, which should take about 10 minutes to complete.

 After that, her participation in the study will end.

 Statistical Analysis: - Given that the primary outcome is the satisfaction between two groups, a statistical test to compare proportions (the Chi-squared test) will be used.

 - Given that the secondary outcomes include mean patient anxiety levels and mean blood pressure, a statistical to compare means (Student's t-test) will be used.

 No Music During Cesarean Delivery on Patient Satisfaction@highlight

Several studies have demonstrated that music can improve various outcomes during labor and delivery.

 However, many of these studies didn't measure satisfaction rate accurately.

 This study aim to assess patient satisfaction in the setting of music or no music during the cesarean delivery.

 The study will be conducted in the labor and delivery unit and the expected number to enroll and complete the study is 22.
