(thirdQuint)Pharmacokinetic Study of Intranasal Dexmedetomidine in Pediatric Patients With Congenital Heart Disease.

 The high anxiety levels that children may experience during the preoperative period may be associated with negative medical, psychological, and social consequences.

 To reduce this stress, and to facilitate separation from parents and the induction of anesthesia, children are often given a sedative prior to undergoing a procedure.

 Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective a2-adrenergic receptor agonist with sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties.

 While off-label in its use, the administration of dexmedetomidine by the intranasal route has become a popular and effective technique for sedation in children because it is non-invasive, easy to administer, well tolerated, and relatively fast in onset.

 Despite this, little consistent data have been published on its onset time, duration of action, or optimal dose.

 The only available pharmacokinetic (PK) data on dexmedetomidine in pediatric patients is in children who were administered IV dexmedetomidine.

 We are proposing a prospective open-label inter-subject cohort dose-escalation pharmacokinetic study to obtain peak dexmedetomidine drug concentration level in plasma and the corresponding time point following intranasal administration in the pediatric patient with cardiac disease.

The main objectives of the study are to determine peak plasma drug concentration levels and corresponding time of dexmedetomidine following intranasal administration in children age 1 mo to 6 yr with congenital heart disease undergoing an elective diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization procedure.
