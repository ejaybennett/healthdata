(thirdQuint)Decision-making Impairments in OCD: An Integrated Behavioral Economics Model.

 The primary aims of this study are to examine the extent to which individuals with OCD avoid decisions that involve ambiguity through the use of self-report and behavioral measures.

 Specifically, the investigators will examine how individuals with OCD minimize risk at the expense of monetary profit under conditions of ambiguity (relative to risky but unambiguous options) compared to non-psychiatric controls utilizing a series of judgment and decision-making (JDM) tasks.

 The investigators will also explore two different strategic responses to ambiguity: information gathering and escape/avoidance.
