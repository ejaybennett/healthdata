(thirdQuint)Multi-modality Imaging and Collection of Biospecimen Samples in Understanding Bone Marrow Changes in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Undergoing TBI and Chemotherapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Temporal assessment of treatment impact on bone marrow.

 II.

 Relative assessment of bone marrow status between total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) and conventional TBI.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Correlation of dual energy computed tomography (DECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging with biological samples for cellularity/adiposity.

 II.

 Relative assessment of chimerism engraftment kinetics between TMLI and TBI.

 III.

 Relative assessment of circulating cytokines between TMLI and TBI.

 IV.

 Feasibility of fluorothymidine F-18 (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging biomarker as a predictor of treatment response.

 V.

 Correlation of FLT PET imaging with biological correlate for leukemia.

 VI.

 Characterize relative distribution of leukemia in bone marrow (BM) environment.

 OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.

 COHORT I (TLMI+FLT): Patients may undergo optional fluorothymidine F-18 PET scan over 2 hours at baseline, and on days -1, 30, and 60.

 Patients undergo DECT and water-fat MRI scan over 30 minutes at baseline, on days -1, 30, 60, and 180, and at years 1 and 2.

 Patients also undergo collection of bone marrow and blood samples at baseline, on days -4, -1, 30, 60,100, and 180, and at years 1 and 2.

 COHORT II (TMLI): Patients undergo fluorothymidine F-18 PET, DECT, water-fat MRI, and collection of bone marrow and blood samples as in Cohort I.

 COHORT III (TBI): Patients undergo DECT and water-fat MRI scan over 30 minutes at baseline and 1 year.

 Patients undergo collection of bone marrow and blood samples at baseline, on days 30 and 100, and at 1 year.

 Multi-modality Imaging and Collection of Biospecimen Samples in Understanding Bone Marrow Changes in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Undergoing TBI and Chemotherapy@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies multi-modality imaging and collection of biospecimen samples in understanding bone marrow changes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing total body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy.

 Using mutli-modality imaging and collecting biospecimen samples may help doctors know more about how TBI and chemotherapy can change the bone marrow.
