(fifthQuint)Comparing Efficacy and Safety of AryoGen Pharmed Biosimilar Trastuzumab (AryoTrust) Versus Herceptin in Breast Cancer.

 This is A Phase III, randomized, two-armed, patient-outcome assessor-data analyzer blinded, parallel active controlled non-Inferiority clinical trial study to evaluate efficacy and safety of AryoTrust cent (Aryogen Trastuzumab) in comparison to Herceptin(R) (Genentech/Roche) in patients with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive breast cancer.

 Patients who met the following criteria will be recruited.

 The inclusion criteria are: 18-65 years old female patients, Patients with newly diagnosed stage III (locally advanced) or in-operable stage II (due to sizes larger than 5 cm or high tumor to breast ratio) tumors are candidates for participation, Willing and able to sign an informed consent, Pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the breast, ECOG status of 0-1, With any ER/PR status, HER2 positive (Immunohistochemical (IHC) 3+ intensity, amplification of the HER2 gene on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH+ ) or HER2 positive results of Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH)).

 Exclusion criteria are: Clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease, History of any other malignancy including previous breast cancer, second non-breast malignant disease, History of previous chemotherapy, Left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 100 mmHg or systolic > 200 mmHg), A severe conduction abnormality (having pacemaker or diagnosed by the ECG) and any other significant cardiovascular disease, Hematologic abnormalities including baseline Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) of 1,500/ mu L or platelet count 100,000/ mu L, Liver dysfunction including (baseline) Alanine amino transferase (ALT) and/or aspartate amino transferase (AST) 3 Upper Limit Normal (ULN), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 3 ULN, serum total, bilirubin > 1.

5 ULN, Renal dysfunction, defined as serum creatinine 2.

5 mg/dL, Pregnant, lactating women or women of childbearing potential who are not willing to use adequate contraception, Current Corneal abrasion and ulcer.

 The main objective is to verify the non-inferiority of AryoTrust cent (Aryogen trastuzumab) vs.

 Herceptin(R) (Genentech/Roche trastuzumab), both given concomitantly with docetaxel after doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide in the neoadjuvant setting according to pathological, clinical response and immunogenicity assay in patients with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive breast cancer.

 The primary objective of this study is to verify the non-inferiority of AryoTrust cent vs.

 Herceptin(R), given concomitantly with docetaxel after doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide in the neoadjuvant setting according to pathological complete response (pCR) rate.

 The secondary objectives are to verify the non-inferiority of AryoTrust cent vs.

 Herceptin(R), given concomitantly with docetaxel after doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide in the neoadjuvant setting according to clinical objective response (cOR), clinical complete response (cCR), clinical partial response (cPR), clinically no change (cNC), clinical progressive disease (cPD), breast conservation rate.

 Evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of AryoTrust cent vs.

 Herceptin(R), are also the other secondary outcomes.

 This study has two arms and 108 subjects will participate with a 1:1 allocation and receive AryoTrust cent vs.

 Herceptin(R) randomly given concomitantly with docetaxel (for 4 21-day cycles) after four 14-day cycles of Doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide For primary outcome analysis, Treatment differences in proportions will be calculated.

 A 95% two-sided confidence interval will be constructed and the lower bound to determine non-inferiority with a 2.

5% significance level will be used.

 We will use the lower bound of a 95% two-sided confidence interval to determine non-inferiority with a 2.

5% significance level for all secondary efficacy endpoints include clinical complete response (cCR), clinical partial response (cPR), clinically stable disease (cSD), clinical progressive disease (cPD), clinical objective response (cOR), breast conservation rate.

 All safety data will be analyzed descriptively by each treatment group.

 same protocol and procedures have been implemented by using same SOPs.

 Regular and strict monitoring visits have been provided to ensure all processes will be carried out in accordance with GCP.

 Probable variation of eligibility criteria and evaluation criteria are resolved through investigator meetings.
