(firstQuint)Glucose Absorption and Gut Hormone Secretion After Gastric Bypass.

 Glucose is a potent stimulus for GLP-1 secretion after gastric bypass surgery and the SGLT-1 transporter appears to be crucial for this response.

 The study will investigate the effects of SGLT-1/SGLT-2 inhibition (by canagliflozin) on secretion of GLP-1 and other gut hormones after gastric bypass surgery.
