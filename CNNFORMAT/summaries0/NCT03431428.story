(thirdQuint)Comparison of Short-term Efficacy and Long-term Prognosis for Reduction Surgery and Radical Resection in Almost-cCR Rectal Cancer Patients.

 Patients with low rectal cancer were treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy, and two cycles of XELOX at the interval.

 All almost-cCRs after neoadjuvant treatment were randomly divided into minimal operation group or Mile's group.

 All cCRs were treated with "watch and wait".

 Patients after local recurrence were randomly divided into minimal operation group or Mile's group.

 If pathological result was pathological staging 3 after neoadjuvant therapy(ypT3) in minimal operation group or local postoperative recurrence occurred, patients need supplement of abdominoperineal resection (APR).

 With 3 years follow-up,the main research goals are 3 years of progression-free survival(PFS) and overall survival(OS).

 Secondary endpoints are side effects of chemotherapy, assessment of quality of life, surgical complications, adverse prognostic factors and so on.

 Comparison of Short-term Efficacy and Long-term Prognosis for Reduction Surgery and Radical Resection in Almost-cCR Rectal Cancer Patients@highlight

The aim of this study is evaluate the effect of two different surgical treatment on lower rectal cancer after almost clinical complete response(almost-cCR).

 All almost clinical complete response(almost-cCRs) were entered into two groups randomly.

 The estimated sample size of the minimal operation group was 221, and 221 in the Mile's group.

 Three years' progression-free survival(PFS) and overall survival(OS) were compared.
