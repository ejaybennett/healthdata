(secondQuint)The Use of L-arginine to Mitigate the Cardiovascular Effects of Exposure to Traffic-related Air Pollution.

 The present study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of L-arginine (L-Arg, a precursor of nitric oxide in human body) supplement to counteract the acute cardiovascular effects of exposure to traffic-related air pollution among a group of non-smoking adults with elevated blood pressure.

 A large number of epidemiologic studies have provided compelling evidence that exposure to traffic-related air pollution contributes to the increases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and the mechanism of action includes vasoconstriction and cardiac ischemia.

 It is well known that nutritional factors are very important determinants of cardiovascular health.

 However, few studies have explored the joint effects of air pollution and nutritional factors on cardiovascular health.

 Existing data from many laboratory studies and small clinical trials suggest that L-Arg has beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system by lowering blood pressure and protecting myocardiocytes against external stimuli.

 The study will explore whether L-Arg supplement improves blood pressure levels and prevents any potential cardiac ischemia and myocardial injury upon acute exposure to traffic-related air pollution among high-risk individuals.

 Dietary intakes, lifestyle habits, use of medication/dietary supplements, blood pressure, resting electrocardiogram and plasma parameters will be assessed for potential eligible participants at screening visits.

 After a 5-day L-Arg-free run-in period, 200 eligible participants will be assigned to either the interventional group or control group using a computerized method with a randomized block design.

 They will receive over 2 weeks daily doses of either L-Arg (9g each day in 3 times) or placebo and undergo a 2-h exposure scenario (0900-1100 hours) of walking along a traffic road on the 14th day.

 Participants will be counseled to maintain an isocaloric diet and to abstain from other L-Arg rich foods during the study.

 Concentrations of major traffic-related air pollutants, including particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter 2.

5 1/2m (PM2.

5) and black carbon, will be measured during the 2-h exposure scenario, and primary and secondary outcome measures including blood pressure, ST-segment depression and plasma parameters will be assessed repeatedly at various time points (depending on the parameters) around the 2-h exposure scenario.

The present study is aimed to investigate whether oral L-arginine supplementation reduces the adverse cardiovascular effects of exposure to traffic-related air pollution among a group of non-smoking adults with elevated blood pressure.
