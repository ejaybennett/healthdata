(fifthQuint)Pembrolizumab in Combination With Decitabine and Hypofractionated Index Lesion Radiation in Pediatrics and Young Adults.

 Patients will receive pembrolizumab and decitabine every 28 days, and a single 3 day course of fixed-dose hypofractionated index site radiotherapy.

 One cycle lasts 28 days.

 One block lasts 84 days (3 cycles per block).

 Radiation is given in block 1 only (cycle 2 only).

 Blocks may repeat for a total of 9 times (27 cycles) if patient meets criteria to continue protocol therapy.

 Pembrolizumab in Combination With Decitabine and Hypofractionated Index Lesion Radiation in Pediatrics and Young Adults@highlight

This pilot study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of the combination of pembrolizumab, decitabine and fixed-dose hypofractionated index site radiotherapy in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed, refractory or progressive non-primary CNS solid tumors and lymphomas.

 Primary Objectives - To determine the feasibility of administering pembrolizumab in combination with decitabine and hypofractionated index lesion radiation - To identify the treatment-related toxicities and tolerability of the combination of decitabine and pembrolizumab - To identify the treatment related toxicity and tolerability of the combination of decitabine and pembrolizumab with hypofractionated index lesion radiation Secondary Objective To preliminarily define the anti-tumor efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab, decitabine and hypofractionated index lesion radiation in patients with relapsed, refractory, or progressive non-CNS solid tumors and lymphomas using overall response rate (CR + PR) by irRECIST after 3 cycles (1 block) of therapy.

 Exploratory Objectives To profile the kinetics of the immune response and to correlate with promotor methylation changes, nuclear imaging, stool microbiota diversity, and tumor associated antigen immune responses.
