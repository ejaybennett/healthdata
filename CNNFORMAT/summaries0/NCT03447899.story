(fifthQuint)Longitudinal, Multi-Dimensional Assessment of Recovery and Added Benefit of a Behavioral Health Intervention for Children With Abusive Head Trauma.

 60 children (ages 6 months to 2 years) and their caregiver referred to the Non-Accidental Brain Injury Care Clinic at the Children's Hospital Colorado (CHCO) will recruited for participation in the study.

 Consenting patients will be randomized to receive care as usual or to receive the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention.

 Data for all participants will be collected at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months.

 Outcomes in multiple dimensions, will be assessed including clinical recovery, cognitive, language, and motor functioning, family functioning, caregiver mental health including anxiety, depression, competency, and stress.

 The investigators will also examine service use over time.

 Analyses will first assess trajectories of recovery for both groups using data for all time points.

 Analyses assessing the intervention will focus on caregiver mental health features, family functioning, service use, and child scores on language motor, cognitive, and socio-emotional measures.

 Finally, injury, initial family, and child functioning data will be aggregated in a latent class approach to assess what family and child characteristics may be most amenable to improvement in general and for the intervention group in particular.

 Longitudinal, Multi-Dimensional Assessment of Recovery and Added Benefit of a Behavioral Health Intervention for Children With Abusive Head Trauma@highlight

Family dynamics and caregiver responses to a child with traumatic brain injury are implicated both as precipitating events as well as factors influencing outcomes of abusive head trauma (AHT).

 However, no family behavioral health intervention exists to meet the unique needs of families with infants and very young children with AHT.

 The study utilizes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the efficacy of an evidence-based behavioral intervention to improve outcomes for families and children with AHT.

 The investigators will examine outcomes in multiple dimensions, including clinical, cognitive, family, caregiver, child behavior, and service usage over time compared to patients not receiving the intervention.

 The investigators will then examine characteristics of patients and families that are best suited for this behavioral health intervention.
