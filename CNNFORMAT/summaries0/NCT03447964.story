(secondQuint)Plasma Dihydroceramides Are Associated With Hepatic Steatosis in Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.

 Sphingolipids represent a major class of lipids that are structural and signaling molecules.

 Major bioactive sphingolipids include ceramide, dihydroceramide, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate and sphingomyelin.

 Sphingoliplids are involved in development of various chronic metabolic diseases.

 Some ceramides species are implicated in pancreatic -cell apoptosis and in insulin resistance in muscle, fat and liver.

 Some studies have shown association between inhibition of ceramide synthesis, insulin sensibility and lower hepatic steatosis.

 The deposition of hepatic lipids, especially triacylglycerol, defines the development of hepatic steatosis.

 However, sphingolipids appear to play an important role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and in its progression.

 Changes in plasma shingolipids concentrations may also contribute to the pathogenesis in cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis.

 Distribution of plasma sphingolipids concentrations in type 1 and type 2 diabetes has poorly been studied.

 The objective of the CERADIAB study is to compare plasma sphingoliplids concentrations in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients.

Sphingolipids are associated with metabolic diseases.

 Distribution of plasma sphingolipids in type 1 and type 2 diabetes has never been studied.

 The objective of the CERADIAB study is to compare plasma sphingoliplids concentrations in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients.
