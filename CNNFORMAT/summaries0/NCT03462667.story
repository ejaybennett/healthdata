(firstQuint)Intensive Preoperative Ostomy Education for the Radical Cystectomy Patient.

 Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the USA.

 The primary treatment for invasive bladder cancer is a radical cystectomy (RC) with a urinary diversion.

 Patients that have this procedure must deal with a stoma that requires daily care and manual skills.

 A stoma is an artificial opening that allows urine to pass from the ureters outside the body.

 Having a surgery that results in a stoma can dramatically change a person's life.

 This study is being done to test a new education session called the stoma boot camp.

 The session was created to help people deal with changes in their post-surgery life and living with a stoma.

 The session requires a one time visit to the study site and lasts about two hours.

 Participants can bring a support person to the boot camp if they choose.

 During the two hour session, nurses will provide teaching, counseling, and hands on practice with an artificial stoma.

The purpose of this study is to learn if the stoma boot camp is a good and effective way to help people adapt to life with a stoma after surgery.
