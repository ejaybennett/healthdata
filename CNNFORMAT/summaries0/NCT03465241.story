(fifthQuint)ctDNA Dynamic Monitoring and Its Role of Prognosis in Stage II to IIIA NSCLC by NGS.

 In the NGS era, ctDNA detection can truly reflect the real tumor tissue gene mutation map and frequency.

 It becomes the evaluation of therapeutic effect and the important monitoring indicators of clinical follow-up after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy.

 The second generation of high-throughput gene sequencing (NGS) is an important means of detecting ctDNA, which can detect trace ctDNA from smaller plasma samples.

 The DNA dynamic monitoring of stage II to IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was performed by the NGS technique to verify prognostic predictive effect of ctDNA in stage IIA to IIIA NSCLC patients after operation.

 The lung cancer related genes mutation map and frequency between primary tumors and infiltrated regional lymph nodes seems not exactly consistent.

 In this study, the investigators will compare the lung cancer related genes mutation map and frequency between primary tumors, bloodstream and infiltrated lymph node by the NGS technique.

 ctDNA Dynamic Monitoring and Its Role of Prognosis in Stage II to IIIA NSCLC by NGS@highlight

The second generation of high-throughput gene sequencing (NGS) is an important means of detecting the tumor DNA and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which can detect trace ctDNA from smaller plasma samples.

 This project is chiefly to study the role of ctDNA dynamic monitoring of stage IIA to IIIA NSCLC by NGS technique to verify the prognostic predictive effect of ctDNA.

 And the investigators also wander the concordance of lung cancer related genes mutation map and frequency between primary tumors and infiltrated regional lymph nodes.
