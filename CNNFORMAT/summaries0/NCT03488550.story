(secondQuint)Single-dose Study of ANX007 in Participants With Primary Open-angle Glaucoma.

 This is a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, safety study evaluating up to 3 dose levels of ANX007 administered as single IVT injections.

 Approximately 9 to 15 eligible participants are enrolled into one cohort each.

 All participants receive ANX007 in an open-label manner.

 The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravitreal (IVT) injection of ANX007 in participants with primary open-angle glaucoma.

 Secondary objectives are to evaluate the serum pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity.

 An exploratory objective will evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of ANX007 on serum C1q activity.
