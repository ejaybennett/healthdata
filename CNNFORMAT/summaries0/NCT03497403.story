(firstQuint)Socket Preservation Procedure Studying Soft and Hard Tissue Outcomes.

 The effect of different surgical techniques for socket preservation on soft tissue parameters has seldom been investigated.

 The aim of this study was to evaluate One with a cross-linked membrane used in secondary intention healing and the other with a non-cross-linked membrane used in primary intentional healing.

 Thirty subjects requiring tooth extraction were randomly allocated to either control group C (allograft covered with a non-cross-linked collagen membrane with primary closure) or experimental group E (allograft covered with cross-linked collagen membrane left exposed).

 Sites were surgically re-entered at 6-months.

 Soft and hard tissue measurements, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and cast measurements were taken at baseline & 6-months.

Two different surgical protocols for socket preservation were compared.

 Soft and hard tissue outcomes were measured clinically and radiographically at baseline and six months post operatively.
