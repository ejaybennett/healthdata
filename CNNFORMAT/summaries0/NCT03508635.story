(secondQuint)CORT125134 Single Ascending Dose (SAD) and Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD).

 This is a 3-part, single-center study of single and multiple ascending doses of CORT125134 in healthy subjects.

 Part I is a single dose study.

 Initially, subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 1 of up 6 cohorts, each containing 10 subjects, in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled assessment of single-ascending doses (SAD) of CORT125134.

 Within each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of CORT125134 and 2 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of matching placebo.

 Thereafter, Cohort 7 will be a food-effect cohort, in which all 8 subjects will receive a single dose of CORT125134 after a high-fat breakfast (open label).

 Cohorts 8 and 9 will be pharmacological effect cohorts, in each of which 10 subjects will receive a challenge agent (prednisone, 25 mg) alone on Day -19; with an active comparator (mifepristone, 600 mg) on Day -12, and with CORT125134 on Day 1 in an open-label single sequence crossover design.

 Pharmacological effects will be explored by measuring effects on peripheral blood eosinophil, lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, serum osteocalcin, assay of mRNA expression of FKBP5 and GILZ in whole blood (proof of pharmacological effect, PoPE Cohort 8) and by measuring effects on oral glucose tolerance (proof of concept, PoC Cohort 9).

 Part 2 and 3 will be double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled assessments of multiple oral ascending doses (MAD) of CORT123154.

 Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 1 of up to 4 cohorts (Cohorts 10-13), each containing 12 subjects.

 Within each cohort, 9 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive CORT125134 and 3 subjects to receive matching placebo daily for 14 days (Days 1-14).

 The effects of CORT125134 on response to prednisone challenge will be additionally explored in Cohorts 12 and 13 in a single sequence crossover, with prednisone being given alone on Day -5 and in combination with CORT125134 or placebo on Day 14.

 Throughout the study, routine safety tests and assessments of PK (CORT125134 and CORT125201) will be performed, and changes in serum cortisol and plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) measured.

 CORT125134 Single Ascending Dose (SAD) and Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dose-related safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacological effects (PD) of CORT125134 and its active metabolite CORT125201 after single and multiple ascending oral doses of CORT125134 in healthy subjects.
