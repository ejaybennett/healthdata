(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Therapeutic Effect of HU Pulse Therapy for CML Patients.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Compare the time of WBC decreased by 10%,20%,30%,50% of these patients treated with these two drugs.

 II.

 Compare the time of spleen size decreased by 10%,20%,30%,50% of chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia patients treated with imatinib to those treated with hydroxyurea pulse therapy.

 III.

 Compare the time to achieve complete remission (CR) of these patients treated with these two drugs.

 iv.

 Estimate the overall survival, event-free survival, progression-free survival (OS, EFS, PFS) and major cytogenetic response of these patients treated with these two drugs.

 OUTLINE: Patients are to receive one of two treatments.

 Arm I: Induction: Patients receive oral hydroxyurea daily (hydroxyurea pulse therapy) until hematological remission.

 Maintenance: continuing hydroxyurea pulse therapy to maintain white blood cells below 8.

 0 * 109 / L.

 Arm II: Induction: Patients receive imatinib 400mg qd until acceptable blood counts are achieved.

 Maintenance: Follow the recommendations of the NCCN guidelines for chronic-phase CML treatment.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

 Evaluation of the Therapeutic Effect of HU Pulse Therapy for CML Patients@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) aimed to avoid CML conversion (AP, BC).

 Hydroxyurea pulse therapy for chronic-phase CML patients is effective based on the investigator's previous studies, and the scheme cost lower than imatinib.

 It is not yet known the efficacy compared Hydroxyurea pulse therapy with imatinib for chronic-phase CML, especially to achieve hematological remission in short time.

 PURPOSE: Non-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of hydroxyurea pulse therapy with that of imatinib in treating chronic-phase CML patients.
