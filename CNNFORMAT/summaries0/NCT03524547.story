(secondQuint)Endotracheal Tube Shapes for Intubation With Videolaryngoscope.

 Since the intubation using videolaryngoscope does not need straightened oral-pharyngeal-laryngeal axis, certain curvature of endotracheal tube is needed for the successful intubation using the videolaryngoscope.

 Participants in both groups will be intubated with videolaryngoscope (McGrath MAC(R)).

 Stylet will be inserted in the endotracheal tubes and will be bent to a specific shape by the assigned group.

 In the J-shaped tube group, endotracheal tube will be molded to a shape similar to the blade of the videolaryngoscope (McGrath MAC(R)).

 In the 60-degrees-curved tube group, endotracheal tube will be bent 60 degrees.

 Time to intubation, intubation attempts and ease of intubation wil be assessed.

 Endotracheal Tube Shapes for Intubation With Videolaryngoscope@highlight

In this study, investigators will compare the efficacy of two shapes of endotracheal tube molded by stylet in endotracheal intubation using videolaryngoscope (McGrath MAC(R)).

 The participants will randomly be divided into two groups; J-shaped tube and 60-degrees-curved tube.
