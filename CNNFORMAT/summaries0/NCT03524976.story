(firstQuint)Treatment of Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas With SQUID Liquid Embolic Agent.

 Traditionally, there are two therapeutic options for the treatment of Dural Arteriovenous Fistula (DAVF): (1) the surgical approach consisting of craniotomy and ligation of the vein and (2) the endovascular approach with embolization of shunting zone.

 Onyx cent (EVOH (Ethylene Vinyl Alcohol) in solution in an organic solvent, DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide), is the main embolic agent used for the endovascular treatment of DAVF.

 During the occlusion procedure with Onyx cent , residual malformed compartments become gradually less visible on x-ray to the operator, due to the high radiopacity of Onyx cent , resulting in a potential risk during treatment.

 Moreover, viscosity is frequently not as low as required to penetrate the shunt.

Thus, development a new embolization system with lower radiopacity and lower viscosity to achieve improved occlusion is needed.

 SQUID cent is a new liquid embolic agent, with variable radiopacity and viscosity.

 The purpose of this study is assessment of safety, efficacy, and short-term outcome of SQUID cent in the embolization of DAVFs .
