(fifthQuint)Methylphenidate and Physical Activity in Reducing Cancer-Related Fatigue in Participants With Metastatic Melanoma Who Receive Anti-PD1 Immunotherapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the effects of methylphenidate plus physical activity (MP) compared to placebo plus physical activity (PL) in reducing cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with metastatic melanoma scheduled to receive anti-PD1 immunotherapy, as measured by changes in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) subscale scores after 2 weeks of intervention.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To explore the effect of MP on anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), depressed mood (HADS), cancer symptoms (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), physical activity (mean day time activity as measured by actigraphy), and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-1 RA, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-10, and MCP1), before and after treatment.

 EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the frequency and factors associated with CRF as assessed by FACIT-F, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue (PROMIS-F), Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), actigraphy, Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-1 RA, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-8, MCP-1), before and during 4 initial doses of Immunotherapy.

 II.

 To explore the effects of MP on percentage (%) of patients with dose reduction and/or discontinuation anti-PD1 immunotherapy due to CRF.

 OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 ARM I: Participants receive methylphenidate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Participants also complete physical activity consisting of walking and resistance exercise over 25-40 minutes once daily (QD) 4 days a week.

 After 2 weeks, participants may continue methylphenidate at the discretion of the treating physician for up to 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 ARM II: Participants receive a matched placebo PO BID and complete physical activity as in Arm I.

 Methylphenidate and Physical Activity in Reducing Cancer-Related Fatigue in Participants With Metastatic Melanoma Who Receive Anti-PD1 Immunotherapy@highlight

This phase III trial studies how well methylphenidate and physical activity works in reducing cancer-related fatigue in participants who are receiving anti-PD1 immunotherapy for melanoma that has spread to other places in the body.

 Central nervous systems stimulants, such as methylphenidate, may help to improve cognitive function.

 Physical activity uses techniques, such as aerobic and resistance exercises, which may help to improve quality of life.

 Giving methylphenidate and physical activity may help in reducing cancer-related fatigue in participants with metastatic melanoma who receive anti-PD1 immunotherapy.
