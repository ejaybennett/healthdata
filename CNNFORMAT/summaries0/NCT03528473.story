(fifthQuint)Adapted Physical Activity (APA) in a Breast Cancer Population.

.

 This is an interventional, comparative, single group assignment study including post-menopausal, physically inactive breast cancer patients in oncological follow-up with or without hormone therapy (within one-three months of the beginning of treatment), that had completed adjuvant post-surgical treatment (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy).

 All patients will be first assigned to the control group and, after 3-month interval with no physical training, will be shifted into the 6-months exercise intervention group.

 Thus, the patients act as their own control at the end of the study.

 The duration of the study is 1 year (with 3-, 9-,12- and 18- months follow-up) during which the patients will follow APA program of mild to moderate strength and aerobic exercises.

 Physical activity will be adapted according to arm and shoulder morbidity, after fracture risk assessment.

 Exercise will be concentrated solely on leg muscles (pedalling on a cycle or bed ergometer) in individuals with limitations in the range of motion of the arms (eg, due to breast, axillary, or thoracic surgery).

 In patients experiencing ataxia, dizziness, or peripheral neuropathy, walking outdoors and mostly cycle-ergometry training will be preferred to other activities that also involve large muscle groups but require additional balance and coordination (eg, treadmill walking, outdoor cycling).

 Exercises will be performed at the Unipolar Spinal Unit of "S.

 Maria della Misericordia" Hospital, Perugia.

 The aim of the study is to confirm the positive effect of APA on metabolic stress, body mass composition, functional capacity and quality of life in breast cancer patients in oncological follow-up.

 Currently, only few data are available about the relationship between physical activity and microcirculatory hemodynamics that, together with oxidative stress, could be involved in genesis and progression of breast cancer.

@highlight

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a 6-months program of Adapted Physical Activity (APA) on body composition, insulin resistance and adipokines, oxidative stress and microcirculatory haemodynamics in post-menopausal, physically inactive breast cancer patients in oncological follow-up with or without hormone therapy that had completed adjuvant treatment (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy).

 Furthermore, the study will determine the impact of APA on functional capabilities, on self-reported physical activity, quality of life and psychic health.
