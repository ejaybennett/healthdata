(fifthQuint)Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin With G-CSF, Cladribine, Cytarabine and Mitoxantrone in Treating Participants With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia or High-Grade Myeloid Neoplasm.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) when added to GCLAM in patients with newly-diagnosed AML requiring induction chemotherapy.

 (Phase I) II.

 To evaluate the 6-month event-free survival (EFS) rate with GO + GCLAM treated at the MTD.

 (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Describe, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, the toxicity profile of the study regimen.

 II.

 Compare, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, measurable residual disease (MRD) rates with GO + GCLAM at the MTD to patients treated previously with GCLAM alone.

 III.

 Estimate, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, the relationship between MRD status after induction therapy and relapse risk/time to relapse as well as relapse-free and overall survival.

 IV.

 Compare, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, complete remission rates with GO + GCLAM at the MTD to patients treated previously with GCLAM alone.

 V.

 Compare, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, overall survival rates with GO + GCLAM at the MTD to patients treated previously with GCLAM alone VI.

 Evaluate, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, the impact of GO dosing regimens on the duration of cytopenias.

 VII.

 Collect biological specimens for use for the future laboratory investigation of biomarkers for response to GO.

 OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of gemtuzumab ozogamicin followed by a phase II study.

 INDUCTION THERAPY: Participants receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) either as a single dose on day 1, or as three doses on days 1, 4, and 7.

 Participants also receive G-CSF subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-5, cladribine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV on days 1-3.

 Patients who do not achieve a CR or CRi following the first course of induction are eligible for a second course, which is given without gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

 Participants with a complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) may then proceed to Post-Remission Therapy.

 POST-REMISSION THERAPY: Participants receive G-CSF, cladribine, and cytarabine as in Induction Therapy during course 1, and cytarabine IV every 12 hours on days 1-6 of courses 2-3.

 Treatment repeats every month for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for 5 years.

 Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin With G-CSF, Cladribine, Cytarabine and Mitoxantrone in Treating Participants With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia or High-Grade Myeloid Neoplasm@highlight

This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dosing frequency of gemtuzumab ozogamicin when given in combination with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), cladribine, cytarabine and mitoxantrone (GCLAM) and to see how well they work in treating participants with acute myeloid leukemia or high-grade myeloid tumors (neoplasms) that have not been previously treated.

 Antibody-drug conjugates, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, act by directly delivering toxic chemotherapy to cancer cells.

 Granulocyte colony stimulating factor is a growth factor used to stimulate leukemia cells and render them more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cladribine, cytarabine and mitoxantrone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Giving gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with G-CSF, cladribine, cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride may work better in treating participants with acute myeloid leukemia or high-grade myeloid neoplasm.
