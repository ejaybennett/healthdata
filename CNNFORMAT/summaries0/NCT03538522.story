(firstQuint)A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Safety and Efficacy Study of NA-831.

 Mild cognitive impairment ("MCI") is defined as the "symptomatic pre-dementia stage" on the continuum of cognitive decline.

 Currently, no medications have proven effective for MCI.

 Preclinical experiments indicate that NA-831 is an endogenous small molecule that exhibits neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and cognitive protective properties across a range of disease models.

 NA-831 has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers.

 This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NA-83 in 126 subjects with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease.
