(secondQuint)MEV for Retroclavicular Approach to Infraclavicular Block.

 A "biased coin up-and-down sequential design" will be applied to assess the minimum effective volume in 90% of patients for the retroclavicular brachial plexus block.

 The first subject received 25 ml 0.

5% bupivacaine .

 Each subsequent patient received a dose that depended on the response of the previous one.

 If the previous block is successful, the block will be performed either by a reduction of the volume by 2.

5 ml with a probability ss = 0.

11 or by a same dose of the previous one with a probability 1-ss = 0.

89 in the next patient.

 MEV for Retroclavicular Approach to Infraclavicular Block@highlight

In this study, the primary objective was to estimate the minimum effective volume of bupivacaine 0.

5% resulting in successful block in 90% of patients (MEV90) for ultrasound-guided retroclavicular approach to infraclavicular brachial plexus block.
