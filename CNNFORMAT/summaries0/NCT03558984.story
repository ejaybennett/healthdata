(fifthQuint)Efficacy and Safety of D-PLEX in the Prevention of Sternal Infection Post Cardiac Surgery.

 This is Phase III study to evaluate the anti-infective efficacy and safety of D-PLEX, a new formulation of extended release of Doxycycline, over a period of 3 months post operation by preventing sternal infection post cardiac surgery in patients above the age of 18, including high risk patients for infection.

 Study will be conducted in about 40 sites in US and Europe, recruitment period will last about 12 months.

 D-PLEX will be administered as a single application.

 For subjects randomized to the investigational treatment arm, D-PLEX treatment will be applied at the end of the index surgery just before closing the chest, as an adjunct to the SOC prophylactic antibiotic treatment.

 For subjects randomized to the control arm, the surgical treatment will be as per the SOC.

 Pre- and post-operative care for both arms will be performed per site SOC.

 Patients will followed-up during 6 months after surgery.
