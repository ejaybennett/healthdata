(fifthQuint)Mobile Electronic Devices for Visual Impairment.

 By converting text into speech and being cheaply and readily available, smartphones and tablets offer a completely new type of assistive technology for visually-impaired people (VIP).

 Research on these mobile electronic devices (MED) is relevant to rehabilitation and enablement of individuals with all types of visual impairment, with all degrees of severity.

 The majority of UK adults have a smartphone, but take-up is least amongst the over 75s who form the majority of the VI population.

 This is the population in whom MED have the greatest potential to reduce social isolation and increase independence, so it is important that the potential benefits are not restricted to those already comfortable with technology.

 Despite the great interest regarding what could be achieved with MED, evidence is currently lacking that they do provide significant improvements in quality of life, and that the specific training which is currently offered by many different organisations can help to facilitate effective use of MED.

 The study aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of two different models of training in giving the user on-going access and improved quality of life.

 The two models to be compared will be a "training course only", versus a scheme in which each participant is paired with a "buddy" (a local university student) who can provide continuing assistance by visiting the participant at home.

 VIP who are interested in purchasing a MED will be recruited and trained.

 The usage of devices will be assessed by questionnaire from completion of training to 6 months and through a tracking app.

 Validated questionnaires will be used to measure changes in quality of life, depression, adaptation to vision loss, and ability to carry out everyday tasks, before and after training, and 6 months later.

 Mobile Electronic Devices for Visual Impairment@highlight

Mobile electronic devices (MED) including, smartphones and tablets, offer a new type of assistive technology for visually-impaired people (VIP).

 They offer the possibility to replace optical magnifiers for those with mild impairment, and braille or auditory for those with severe visual loss, using standard consumer devices, which are relatively cheap and convenient.

 However not all VIP and rehabilitation professionals are familiar with the devices and their potential.

 In this study VIP who are interested in purchasing a MED will be recruited and trained.

 The effectiveness of this training will be determined by assessing the usage of devices by the participants from completion of training to 6 months, using questionnaires, and by remote monitoring of their MED.

 Validated questionnaires will be used to measure changes in quality of life, depression, adaptation to vision loss, and ability to carry out everyday tasks, before and after training, and 6 months later.

 Ongoing support has been found to be important when introducing users to new technology, in the form of volunteers to provide assistance and advice.

 The standard "training course only" model will therefore be compared to a scheme in which each participant is paired with a "buddy" (a university student) who can provide continuing support by visiting the VIP regularly at home.
