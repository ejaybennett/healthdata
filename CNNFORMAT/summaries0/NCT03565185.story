(firstQuint)Comparison Of Two Different Type Robot Assisted Gait Training In Rehabilitation Of Stroke.

 There are different types of devices in robotic rehabilitation which has been used in recent years for stroke.

 Investigators aimed to compare the results of rehabilitation with an exoskeleton device(Robogait) and with an end-effector device(Lokohelp) in robot-assisted gait training of stroke rehabilitation.
