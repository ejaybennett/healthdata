(secondQuint)A Phase 1 Study of FOR46 in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC).

 This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of FOR46 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

 This study will be conducted in two parts: Dose escalation: This part will evaluate increasing doses of FOR46 to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

 The first patient enrolled on the study will receive the lowest dose of FOR46.

 Once this dose is shown to be safe, a second patient will be enrolled at the next higher dose.

 Patients will continue to be enrolled into either single or multiple patient groups receiving increasing doses until the MTD is reached.

 Dose expansion: This part of the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of FOR46 at a dose shown to be safe in the dose escalation part of the study.

 Patients will be enrolled into 1 of 2 groups, based on histology.
