(fifthQuint)Phase I Trial of an Intervention to Increase Condom Use by HIV-Discordant Couples.

 There is a significant risk of HIV transmission to HIV-uninfected partners in HIV-discordant couples.

 While condom use has been a major component of most AIDS prevention programs since the mid-1980s, there has been little emphasis on promoting condom use within stable partnerships.

 The most effective way to promote condom use among discordant couples remains largely unknown.

 A pilot study to assess the acceptability of intervention precedes the main study.

 The Phase I study recruits 15 HIV-infected men and 15 HIV-infected women and their partners at each of three sites (India, Thailand, and Uganda).

 Volunteers participate in a multi-session group-based condom promotion program for approximately 12 months.

 Couples are organized into small groups consisting of 4 to 6 couples per group.

 Each group meets for a total of 4 sessions within a 2- to 4-week period.

 Follow-up interviews are conducted at Months 1 and 3 following completion of the intervention.
