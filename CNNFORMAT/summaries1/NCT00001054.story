(fifthQuint)The Safety and Effectiveness of Valacyclovir HCl in the Treatment of Herpes Simplex or Varicella/Zoster Infections in HIV-1 Infected Children.

 Varicella and zoster are common problems in HIV-infected children.

 It is believed that chronic oral therapy with acyclovir may result in subtherapeutic concentrations of acyclovir, resulting in resistance to that drug.

 Valacyclovir hydrochloride, which converts to acyclovir in the body, increases acyclovir bioavailability by 3-5 fold.

 In the first cohort, patients with stable herpes simplex virus receive valacyclovir hydrochloride at 1 of 2 doses, depending on body surface area (BSA), for 10 days.

 If acceptable safety is seen at this dose level, a second cohort of patients with stable herpes simplex virus receive a higher dose, depending on BSA, for 10 days.

 A third cohort of patients with varicella or zoster receive a selected dose based on results from the previous cohorts.
