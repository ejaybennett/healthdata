(thirdQuint)Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Plus Sargramostin in Treating Patients With Advanced Neuroblastoma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Define the antitumor effects of monoclonal antibody 3F8/sargramostim (3F8/GM-CSF) in patients with advanced neuroblastoma.

 - Assess the biological effects of 3F8/GM-CSF in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive monoclonal antibody 3F8 IV over 1.

5 hours on days 0-4 and 7-11 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) IV over 2 hours on days -5 to 11.

 Treatment is repeated every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of progressive disease, HAMA response, or unacceptable toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-40 patients will be accrued for this study over 4 years.

RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

 Combining colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, with monoclonal antibodies may be an effective treatment for advanced neuroblastoma.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody 3F8 plus sargramostim in treating patients who have advanced neuroblastoma.
