(thirdQuint)Cyclophosphamide Plus Topotecan in Treating Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the efficacy of cyclophosphamide followed by topotecan in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia.

 II.

 Confirm safety and tolerability of this combination on this schedule in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously over 1 hour on day 1 followed by topotecan as a continuous 120 hour infusion starting 12 hours after completion of cyclophosphamide.

 Treatment may be repeated every 3-6 weeks for at least 2 courses.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cyclophosphamide plus topotecan in treating patients who have refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia.
