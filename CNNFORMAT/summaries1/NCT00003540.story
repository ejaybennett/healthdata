(secondQuint)Gemcitabine in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate to gemcitabine in women with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with two to four chemotherapy regimens, including doxorubicin and paclitaxel.

 - Characterize the nature of toxicity of gemcitabine in this patient population.

 - Determine the response duration to gemcitabine in this patient population.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks (days 1, 8, and 15) followed by 1 week of rest.

 Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects.

 Patients are followed until death.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 13 months.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine in treating women with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with doxorubicin and paclitaxel.
