(thirdQuint)Lymphocyte Infusion in Treating Patients With Relapsed Cancer After Bone Marrow or Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Offer donor lymphocyte infusion as adoptive immunotherapy in patients with relapsed malignancies after allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and who are not eligible for other FHCRC protocols.

 OUTLINE: Patients with rapidly progressive disease receive reinduction chemotherapy and radiotherapy prior to study therapy.

 Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) begin after recovery from chemotherapy or sooner, if clinically indicated.

 Patients receive 1 or more DLI from the original donor.

 Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, then every 3-6 months for 9 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: An unlimited number of patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: White blood cells from donors may be able to kill cancer cells in patients with cancer that has recurred following bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of donated white blood cells in treating patients who have relapsed cancer following transplantation of donated bone marrow or peripheral stem cells.
