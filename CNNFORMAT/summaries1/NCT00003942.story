(thirdQuint)Gene Therapy, Chemotherapy, and Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With HIV-Related Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the safety of infusion of RevM10 or RevM10/polAS transduced hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in addition to high dose chemotherapy and standard peripheral blood stem cell support in patients with HIV-1 related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 II.

 Determine gene marking of lymphocytes and myeloid cells in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and/or lymph nodes after infusion of RevM10-HSC or RevM10/polAS-HSC in these patients.

 III.

 Determine the antiretroviral effect of this treatment in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive mobilization therapy and undergo leukapheresis according to a standard protocol.

 High dose chemotherapy is administered on days -7 to -1, also according to a standard protocol.

 On day 0, autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with genes RevM10 or RevM10/polAS are infused.

 Unmodified autologous peripheral blood stem cells are reinfused on day 1.

 Patients are followed daily for 2 weeks, weekly for 2 weeks, monthly for 1 year, then annually thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 14 months.

RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for RevM10 into a person's peripheral stem cells may improve the body's ability to fight cancer or make the cancer more sensitive to chemotherapy.

 PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of RevM10-treated stem cells plus chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have HIV-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
