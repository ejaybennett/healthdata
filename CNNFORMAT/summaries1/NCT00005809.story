(thirdQuint)Computerized Tomographic Colonography Compared With Standard Diagnostic Procedures in Detecting Colorectal Neoplasia.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Compare retrospectively the accuracy of computerized tomographic colonography (CTC) vs pathology and colonoscopy in the detection of clinically important colorectal neoplasia, defined as at least one proven lesion with a diameter measuring at least 1 cm.

 II.

 Compare the physician image display preferences and interpretation time across three viewing platforms for CTC images.

 OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, multicenter study.

 Radiologists evaluate each patient's optimal diagnostic computerized tomographic colonography (CTC) data.

 Patients' CTC findings are evaluated by a radiologist at a central facility using an imaging display software platform from General Electric, Vital Images, or the Mayo Clinic.

 CTC findings are compared with conventional colonoscopy findings and pathologic analysis.

 A comparison is made between physician image display preferences and interpretation time across three viewing platforms for CTC images.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures such as computed tomographic colonography may provide a less invasive method of identifying patients who have colorectal neoplasia.

 PURPOSE: Diagnostic study to compare the effectiveness of computerized tomographic colonography with that of standard diagnostic procedures in detecting colorectal neoplasia.
