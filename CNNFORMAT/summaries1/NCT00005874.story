(secondQuint)Nitrocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcomas.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess the efficacy and toxicity of nitrocamptothecin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas or other soft tissue sarcomas.

 OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease (gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas vs other soft tissue sarcomas).

 Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5.

 Treatment continues weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Responding patients who undergo surgery then receive an additional 4-6 courses (4 weeks/course).

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34-78 patients (17-39 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcomas.
