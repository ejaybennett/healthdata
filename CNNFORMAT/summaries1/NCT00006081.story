(thirdQuint)Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Stomach Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction treated with bryostatin 1 and paclitaxel.

 - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on days 2, 9, and 16.

 Treatment continues every 4 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients with a complete response (CR) receive up to 4 more courses after achieving CR.

 Patients are followed until death.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Stomach Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining bryostatin 1 and paclitaxel in treating patients who have unresectable locally advanced or metastatic stomach cancer.
