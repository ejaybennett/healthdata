 The multi-disciplinary behavioral, group-based intervention focuses on dietary and exercise changes, with group meetings over an 18-month period.

 Participants are assessed at 6-month intervals (for a total of 18 months) to examine the impact of the interventions on body weight and blood sugar control (primary outcomes), as well as on blood pressure, cholesterol, quality of life and attitudes (secondary outcomes).
