(fifthQuint)Filgrastim-Treated Donor Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Acute Leukemia</p>.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation reduces the incidence of non-leukemic mortality in patients with acute leukemia.

 - Determine the kinetics and durability of engraftment after treatment with this regimen in these patients.

 - Determine the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the leukemia-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: Donors receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days -5 to -1.

 Donors then undergo leukapheresis on days -1 and 0.

 Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days -7 to -4.

 Patients receive 2 doses of intrathecal methotrexate per local guidelines between days -10 and -3.

 Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2.

 Patients receive infusion of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells on day 0.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.

 Filgrastim-Treated Donor Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Acute Leukemia</p>@highlight

RATIONALE: Transplanted peripheral stem cells can sometimes be rejected by the body's tissues.

 Treating donor peripheral stem cells with filgrastim may increase the number of donor white blood cells.

 This may help to decrease the rejection of the transplanted cells in patients receiving them as treatment for acute leukemia.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of filgrastim-treated donor peripheral stem cells in treating patients with acute leukemia who are undergoing peripheral stem cell transplantation.
