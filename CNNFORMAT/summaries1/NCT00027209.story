(secondQuint)Hormone Replacement in Menopausal Women With Epilepsy.

 This study will help to answer questions regarding the use of hormone replacement therapy that women with epilepsy face as they reach menopause.

 The total duration of the study is 6 months and involves 7 visits to the doctor.

 The purposes of the study are to discover if and how menopause and treatments for the symptoms of menopause change epilepsy in women, to determine which if any factors present before and/or during menopause may predict the influence of menopause on a woman's seizure disorder, and to find any possible interactions between hormone replacement therapy and anti-seizure medication in order to find the optimal dose of hormone replacement therapy for women with epilepsy.
