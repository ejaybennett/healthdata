(thirdQuint)Treatment of Medically Unexplained Physical Ailments (Somatization Disorder).

 Patients with Somatization Disorder suffer from medically unexplained physical ailments and experience significant distress and disability.

 This disorder is an important problem for the primary health care system because patients with Somatization Disorder use health care resources extensively but receive little benefit.

 To date, no medical or psychiatric intervention has been demonstrated in controlled trials to produce clinically significant and lasting symptom relief or improved functional status in Somatization Disorder patients.

 Patients in primary care settings with multiple unexplained symptoms are treated with 10 weekly sessions of CBT or "treatment as usual.

" Physical symptoms, comorbid psychiatric symptoms, disability, and health care utilization are measured and assessed through a combination of structured interviews and self-reports.

 Assessments are performed at study start, mid-treatment, end of treatment, and at a 6-month follow-up.
