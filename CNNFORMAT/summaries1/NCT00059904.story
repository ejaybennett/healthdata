(fifthQuint)Rituximab and Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Intermediate- or High-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the clinical efficacy of rituximab and interleukin-2 in patients with relapsed or refractory intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 - Determine the 2-year progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

 - Correlate response with natural killer cell numbers and rituximab, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and soluble IL-2 receptor levels in patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

 Patients receive rituximab IV once weekly on weeks 1-4 and interleukin-2 subcutaneously 3 times weekly on weeks 2-9.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 12 weeks for 2 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50-100 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

 Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells.

 Combining rituximab with interleukin-2 may kill more cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining rituximab with interleukin-2 in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
