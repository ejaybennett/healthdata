(thirdQuint)Intrapleural BG00001 in Treating Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma or Malignant Pleural Effusions.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and toxicity of intrapleural BG00001 in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma or malignant pleural effusions.

 - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the success of gene transfer/interferon beta gene expression in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine systemic and intrapleural cytokine responses and cellular and humoral immune response in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine, preliminarily, tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive BG00001 via an intrapleural catheter on day 1.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BG00001 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

 Patients are followed weekly for 1 month, biweekly for 1 month, monthly for 4 months, and then every 6 months for 15 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Using BG00001 to insert the gene for interferon-beta into a person's pleural cavity may improve the body's ability to fight cancer.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of intrapleural BG00001 in treating patients who have malignant pleural mesothelioma or malignant pleural effusions.
