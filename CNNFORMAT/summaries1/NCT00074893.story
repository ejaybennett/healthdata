(thirdQuint)Protective Brace to Prevent Hand and Arm Injuries.

 Workers who use hand-held power tools absorb significant vibration energy in their arms and hands and may develop musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) such as carpal tunnel syndrome and hand-arm vibration syndrome.

 Protective braces may be worn to decrease the incidence of occupational MSDs.

 The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has identified key attributes for protective braces; these attributes include vibration damping, comfort, non-interference with worker dexterity, and maintenance of safe hand temperature.

 Most currently available braces do not adequately address these NIOSH requirements.

 This study will evaluate the efficacy of a brace with piezoelectric damping material.

 Participants in the study will be fitted with a brace on each hand.

 One brace will have piezoelectric damping material and the other will be a currently available, off-the-shelf commercial brace.

 Hand-held joysticks and handles mounted to a vibration shaker table will be used to simulate power tool use.

 Participants will undergo a series of tests designed to measure hand acceleration and vibration while grasping the study joysticks and handles.

 The tests will take approximately 30 minutes.

 Protective Brace to Prevent Hand and Arm Injuries@highlight

When people use hand-held power tools, their hands and arms vibrate along with the tool they are holding.

 People who frequently use hand-held power tools may develop injuries related to this vibration.

 This study will evaluate a protective brace designed to prevent vibration-related hand and arms injuries.
