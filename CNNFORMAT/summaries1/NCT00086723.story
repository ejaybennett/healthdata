(thirdQuint)In Vivo Angiostatin Generation Using Tissue Plasminogen Activator and Captopril in Treating Patients With Progressive Metastatic Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of captopril and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in patients with progressive metastatic cancer.

 - Determine the in vivo generation of angiostatin by western analysis in patients treated with this regimen.

 Secondary - Determine the antitumor effect of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) IV over 6 hours and oral captopril twice daily on days 1-5.

 Courses repeat every 14 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tPA and captopril until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified.

 In Vivo Angiostatin Generation Using Tissue Plasminogen Activator and Captopril in Treating Patients With Progressive Metastatic Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Tissue plasminogen activator and captopril may help the body generate angiostatin.

 Angiostatin may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

 PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tissue plasminogen activator and captopril and to see how well they work in treating patients with progressive metastatic cancer.
