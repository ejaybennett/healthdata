(thirdQuint)Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Lymph Nodes Using Ferumoxytol in Patients With Primary Prostate or Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the range of optimal timing for magnetic resonance imaging of lymph nodes after administration of ferumoxytol, in terms of assessing signal intensity using pre-defined pulse sequences in regions of interest and visual criteria, in patients with primary prostate or breast cancer who are scheduled to undergo surgical lymph node dissection or sampling.

 Secondary - Correlate MRI signal intensity with histological findings in patients undergoing this procedure.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

 Patients undergo a baseline MRI.

 Within 24 hours after the baseline MRI, patients receive ferumoxytol IV over 10-15 seconds (or over 1 hour).

 Patients then undergo MRI immediately after ferumoxytol administration (at the discretion of the principal investigator) and then at 24-28 hours.

 Patients are followed at 2 weeks.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-14 patients (6-8 with prostate cancer and 4-6 with breast cancer) will be accrued for this study.

 Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Lymph Nodes Using Ferumoxytol in Patients With Primary Prostate or Breast Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using ferumoxytol may improve the ability to detect cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes and may help plan effective cancer treatment.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well MRI using ferumoxytol works in detecting metastases to the lymph nodes in patients with primary prostate cancer or primary breast cancer.
