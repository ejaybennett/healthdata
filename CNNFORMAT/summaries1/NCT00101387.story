(thirdQuint)Effects of Lumbar PENS and Exercise in Older Adults With Chronic Low Back Pain.

 Each year, a significant number of elderly individuals experience at least one episode of LBP.

 When LBP becomes chronic, it can lead to functional and emotional impairment, increased health care utilization, and decreased quality of life.

 Standard treatment for LBP typically consists of non-opioid analgesics and physical therapy; however, analgesic-associated morbidity in older adults often limits their utility.

 This study will determine the efficacy of PENS treatment, a neuroanatomically guided form of electroacupuncture, and exercise in reducing pain in older adults with chronic LBP.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: PENS alone, PENS placebo, PENS plus GCAE, or PENS placebo plus GCAE.

 The treatments will be given twice weekly for 6 weeks.

 Pain intensity, physical function, health care utilization, and psychosocial function will be assessed with self-report and performance-based measures.

 These assessments will be conducted at study start, immediately after the last treatment session, and 6 months after study completion.

 Effects of Lumbar PENS and Exercise in Older Adults With Chronic Low Back Pain@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether a form of electrical acupuncture, called percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS), can reduce pain and disability in older adults with chronic low back pain (LBP).

 This study will also determine the effects of general conditioning and aerobic exercise (GCAE) on chronic LBP.
