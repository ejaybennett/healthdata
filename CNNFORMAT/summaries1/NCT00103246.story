(fifthQuint)Photodynamic Therapy Using Silicon Phthalocyanine 4 in Treating Patients With Actinic Keratosis, Bowen's Disease, Skin Cancer, or Stage I or Stage II Mycosis Fungoides.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of photodynamic therapy using topically delivered silicon phthalocyanine 4 in patients with actinic keratosis, Bowen's disease, squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer, or stage IA, IB, IIA, or IIB mycosis fungoides.

 - Determine the safety and toxicity of this therapy with emphasis on whether it induces photosensitivity in non-treated sites in these patients.

 - Determine the antitumor mechanism of this therapy, by monitoring tissue changes via clinical, histological, immunohistochemical, and other biochemical markers, in these patients.

 - Determine, preliminarily, the dose of this therapy that results in highest clearing rates in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive topical silicon phthalocyanine 4 (Pc 4).

 One hour later, patients undergo photodynamic therapy.

 Treatment repeats weekly for up to 3 weeks (up to 3 total treatments for the same lesion OR up to 3 lesions treated if multiple lesions are present).

 Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of Pc 4 and visible light until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1 of 3 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

 Three additional patients are treated at the MTD.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 2 weeks.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-45 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses a drug that becomes active when it is exposed to a certain kind of light.

 When the drug is active, tumor cells are killed.

 Photodynamic therapy using silicon phthalocyanine 4 may be effective against skin cancer.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of photodynamic therapy using silicon phthalocyanine 4 in treating patients with actinic keratosis, Bowen's disease, skin cancer, or stage I or stage II mycosis fungoides.
