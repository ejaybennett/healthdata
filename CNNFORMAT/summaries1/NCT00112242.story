(thirdQuint)Immunotherapy of Stage III/IV Melanoma Patients.

 Current peptide vaccines suffer from low efficiency, since they induce only weak immune activation.

 We have recently confirmed that in humans the immune response was readily detectable in local lymph nodes while no or only weak activation could be identified in circulating lymphocytes.

 Increased doses of antigen and adjuvant allow a better extension from local to systemic immune responses.

 - Group 1 : vaccination with Melan-A analog (ELA) peptide + Montanide - Group 2 : vaccination with Melan-A analog (ELA), NY-ESO-1b analog and MAGE-A10 peptides + Montanide - Group 3: vaccination with Melan-A analog (both EAA and ELA), Mage-A10, NY-ESO-1 peptides+ Montanide + CpG adjuvant - Group 4: vaccination with Melan-A (ELA), Mage-A10,long NY-ESO-1LP peptides + Montanide + CpG - Group 5: vaccination with Melan-A(both EAA and ELA), Mage-A10, long NY-ESO-1 LP peptides + Montanide + CpG + low dose rIL-2.

 Immunotherapy of Stage III/IV Melanoma Patients@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether vaccination with melanoma antigen peptides [Melan-A/Mart-1 (both EAA and ELA), NY-ESO-1b analog, Long NY-ESO-1 LP and MAGE-A10] and Montanide, CpG adjuvants and low dose rIL-2 can induce an immune response in melanoma patients and to assess the safety of this vaccination.
