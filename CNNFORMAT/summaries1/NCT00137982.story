(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Therapeutic Strategies for Treatment of Ectopic Pregnancies (EP) and Evaluation of Subsequent Fertility.

 The first group includes non active ectopic pregnancies defined by score or algorithm.

 In this case, we propose a randomized controlled trial between medical and conservative surgery.

 In all others clinical situations, we proposed surgery treatment.

 In a randomized controlled trial we compare conservative versus radical treatment.

 The patients are followed-up during 2 years with phone contact every 6 months.

 Evaluation of Therapeutic Strategies for Treatment of Ectopic Pregnancies (EP) and Evaluation of Subsequent Fertility@highlight

Three protocols are used to treat ectopic pregnancies: medical treatment by methotrexate, conservative surgery or radical surgery.

 There are no data about subsequent fertility except in a cohort study.

 The investigators propose to evaluate the true subsequent fertility with a follow-up of 2 years, in a randomized controlled trial.
