(fifthQuint)Steroid-Free Versus Steroid-Based Immunosuppression in Pediatric Renal (Kidney) Transplantation.

 Corticosteroids (steroids) have been a cornerstone of immunosuppressive therapy for kidney (renal) transplantation for over 40 years.

 However, poor growth and bone loss caused by the use of steroids are devastating to pediatric kidney recipients.

 The negative physical implications of steroid use also greatly impacts patients' compliance to their prescribed steroid-containing regimens.

 The development of a steroid-free regimen for post-transplant pediatric patients is sorely needed.

 This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a steroid-free based treatment regimen in children and adolescents who have received kidney transplants, compared to a standard of care steroid-based regimen.

 Participants in this study will be pediatric patients with end-stage kidney disease who will undergo kidney transplantation at the start of the study.

 Patients will participate in this study for 3 years.

 Participants will be randomized (1:1) to one of two groups.

 The study includes 23 study visits over 3 years.

 A physical exam, medication history, adverse events reporting, blood pressure readings, growth assessment, and blood collection will occur at most visits.

 At the time of transplantation, participants will have a kidney biopsy.

 Participants will also undergo cataract screening within 4 months of transplantation.

 Steroid-Free Versus Steroid-Based Immunosuppression in Pediatric Renal (Kidney) Transplantation@highlight

Over the last 40 years, corticosteroids (steroids) have been an important part of drug regimens used to prevent organ rejection and to maintain the immune health of individuals who have received organ transplants.

 Unfortunately, the negative physical effects of steroids can be severe, especially in children.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of a steroid-free treatment regimen for children and adolescents who have received kidney (renal) transplants.
