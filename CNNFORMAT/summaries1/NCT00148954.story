(secondQuint)RIGHT: Rhythm ID Going Head-to-Head Trial.

 RIGHT will compare the incidence of Ventricular Tachycardia/Fibrillation (VT/VF) therapies delivered for Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) episodes using VITALITY 2 devices with Rhythm ID cent to that of ICDs employing other rhythm discrimination algorithms.

 Appropriateness of therapies will be assessed after independent adjudication of all VT/VF events leading to therapy.

 Comparisons will be made between device manufacturers across patient populations receiving either a dual- or single-chamber device.
