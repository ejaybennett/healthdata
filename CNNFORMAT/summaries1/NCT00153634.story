(thirdQuint)Standard vs.

 Biofilm Susceptibility Testing in Cystic Fibrosis (CF).

 Patients were screened to determine eligibility and to obtain a sputum culture.

 Eligible patients were randomized to either the standard or biofilm study arm.

 Antibiotic selection was performed centrally according to a standard algorithm using the susceptibility test results of the assigned study arm.

 On Day 0, patients were started on a 14-day course of two antibiotics as selected per protocol.

 Antibiotics were administered intravenously (IV) and/or orally.

 A follow-up phone call or visit occurred on Day 7.

 An end of treatment visit was conducted after completion of antibiotic therapy.

 A total of 39 patients were randomized.

 Many screened patients were ineligible for randomization based on microbiology results.

 Standard vs.

 Biofilm Susceptibility Testing in Cystic Fibrosis (CF)@highlight

This was a randomized multi-center clinical trial to compare the microbiological efficacy, clinical efficacy, and safety of using standard versus biofilm susceptibility testing of P.

 aeruginosa sputum isolates to guide antibiotic selection for treatment of airway infection in clinically stable patients with CF.
