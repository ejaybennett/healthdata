(firstQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Oxymorphone Extended Release in Opioid-Experienced Patients With Chronic Non-Malignant Pain.

 Patients with chronic low back pain on stable opioid treatment will be converted to oxymorphone extended release (ER)and enter an open-label treatment phase.

During the Open-Label Titration Period (up to 28 days), patients will receive daily oxymorphone ER PO q12h.

 Patients stabilized on a dose that provides adequate pain relief will be randomized to either continue on the stabilized dose of oxymorphone ER or receive placebo in a double-blind fashion for a total duration of 12 weeks.
