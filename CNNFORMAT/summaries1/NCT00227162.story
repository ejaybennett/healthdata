(secondQuint)Pilot Study of Changing Exercise and Physical Activity Behavior in Asthma Patients.

 The goals of this pilot study are to empirically test different interventional approaches to induce positive affect and self-affirmation.

 At the start of the study all patients in conjunction with their physicians will select a program of mild to moderate physical activity or exercise to be adopted and maintained on a routine basis.

 Patients also will complete the Paffenbarger Physical Activity and Exercise Index.

 Patients then will be divided into four groups according to the intervention they receive: 1) positive affect; 2) self-affirmation; 3) positive affect and self-affirmation; 4) control.

 The main outcome is the change in the Paffenbarger Physical Activity and Exercise Index scores from enrollment to 4 weeks.
