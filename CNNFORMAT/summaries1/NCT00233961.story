(thirdQuint)G-CSF in Stimulating Peripheral Stem Cells for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Complete Remission.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility and safety of harvesting adequate numbers of CD34-positive peripheral blood stem cells using filgrastim (G-CSF) in patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia in complete cytogenetic remission.

 - Determine the safety of temporarily discontinuing treatment with imatinib mesylate and using G-CSF during the harvesting procedure, in terms of the percentage of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive cells before and after stem cell harvest, in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) and then undergo apheresis for up to 5 days.

 After completion of apheresis, patients resume treatment with imatinib mesylate off study.

 Patients may later undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, when deemed necessary.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

 G-CSF in Stimulating Peripheral Stem Cells for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Complete Remission@highlight

RATIONALE: Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, helps stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored until transplant.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of G-CSF in stimulating peripheral stem cells for autologous stem cell transplant in treating patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia in remission.
