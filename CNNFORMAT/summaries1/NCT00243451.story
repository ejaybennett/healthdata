(secondQuint)Early Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Individual Patients.

 Our goal with this proposal is a prospective, longitudinal study that will examine subjects over a three-year span to establish the presence of MCI, evaluate progression of disease, and determine the validity of this method in detecting early MCI.

 Specifically, we predict that by using our Cognitive Decline Index (CDI) method of objective examination of FDG PET brain images from patients diagnosed with MCI or mild AD, we can accurately discriminate very early abnormalities in cerebral metabolism, and that this research method can be validated and translated into a clinically useful tool for the early detection of MCI.

 Our long-range goals are the development of methods and tools that enable the detection of pathology in individual patients at risk for cognitive impairment.

 Early Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Individual Patients@highlight

Our central hypothesis is that the early metabolic lesions of MCI can be reliably detected in individual subjects by objective analysis of [18]F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) brain images, earlier and more accurately than by subjective clinician rating.
