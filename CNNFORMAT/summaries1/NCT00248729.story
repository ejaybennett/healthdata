(secondQuint)Effectiveness and Safety Study of Etomidate Versus Midazolam to Help Place a Breathing Tube Outside of the Hospital.

.

 Study Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the utility of etomidate and midazolam for sedative facilitated intubation (SFI), without paralytics, in pre-hospital adult patients.

 Methods: This prospective, double-blind, randomized trial was conducted with two ground pre-hospital Advanced Life Support (ALS) units.

 All patients age 18 or over transported by the two participating systems requiring pre-hospital SFI were eligible for participation.

 The ambulances were stocked with blinded numbered syringes, each containing either 7mg of midazolam or 20mg of etomidate.

 Contact with the Medic Command physician was not required and no paralytics were used.

 If sedation was not achieved with the study drug, medics could request additional sedation from a Medical command physician; only midazolam or diazepam were available outside of the study.
