(fifthQuint)Use of Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) to Assess Tumor Response to Neoadjuvant Treatment for Distal Rectal Cancer.

 Patients with distal rectal adenocarcinoma will be submitted to an initial whole body PET/CT prior to the preoperative chemoradiation therapy with 5-fluorouracil and 5040 cGy.

 Six weeks and 12 weeks after the preoperative treatment is finished the PET/CT will be repeated.

 At 1 and at 2 years after preoperative treatment is concluded another PET/CT will be performed.

 The colorectal surgeon evaluating the response to chemoradiation therapy will be blinded to the results of the PET/CT, as the radiologist will be blinded to the response assessment.

 PET/CT results will not be used to determine treatment strategy, unless metastatic disease or other disease is diagnosed.

 Patients with a complete clinical response at 8 weeks will be rigorously followed while patients with an incomplete clinical response at 8 weeks will be submitted to radical surgery.

 PET/CT results will be compared to current radiological studies and final pathological reports.

 Use of Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) to Assess Tumor Response to Neoadjuvant Treatment for Distal Rectal Cancer@highlight

Preoperative chemoradiation therapy is the preferred initial treatment option for distal rectal cancers.

 However, assessing tumor response to preoperative chemoradiation therapy remains a challenge to the colorectal surgeon, especially when determining if there is a complete response, observed in more than 10% of cases.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of the PET/CT in assessing distal rectal tumor response to preoperative chemoradiation therapy.
