(secondQuint)Cyclophosphamide in Treating Young Patients With Severe Autoimmune Enteropathy.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the rate of treatment-free remission in young patients with severe autoimmune enteropathy treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide.

 Secondary - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-4.

 Patients then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 10 and continuing for 3 days or until blood counts recover.
