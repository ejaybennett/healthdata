(firstQuint)Microvascular Reactivity.

.

 Studies of microvascular responsiveness often employ iontophoresis to fascilitate drug absorption.

 Iontophoresis is a confounding stimulus in such studies, and we are attempting to create tests of the microvasculature that do not require iontophoretic drug delivery.

 Microvascular Reactivity.

@highlight

This study attempts to test capillary responses to various challenges without the need for iontophoresis (electrical current).
