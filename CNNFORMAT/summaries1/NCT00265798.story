(thirdQuint)Sorafenib in Treating Patients With Malignant Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor That Progressed During or After Previous Treatment With Imatinib Mesylate and Sunitinib Malate.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the objective response rate of patients with imatinib and sunitinib-resistant malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor who are treated with BAY 43-9006.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the toxicity experienced by patients with imatinib and sunitinib -resistant malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor who are treated with BAY 43-9006.

 II.

 To determine progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with imatinib and sunitinib -resistant malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor who are treated with BAY 43-9006.

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To examine if mutational status of KIT and PDGFA in patients with imatinib- and sunitinib resistant malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor correlate with response to BAY 43-9006.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to response to prior treatment with imatinib mesylate and sunitinib malate (imatinib mesylate- and sunitinib malate-responsive disease vs primary imatinib mesylate- and sunitinib malate-refractory disease).

 Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

 Sorafenib in Treating Patients With Malignant Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor That Progressed During or After Previous Treatment With Imatinib Mesylate and Sunitinib Malate@highlight

This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor that progressed during or after previous treatment with imatinib mesylate and sunitinib malate.

 Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.
