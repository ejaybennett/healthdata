(fifthQuint)An Evaluation of Hyperbaric Treatments for Children With Cerebral Palsy.

 The study proposed herein is a randomized, double blind study to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of HBO in children (ages 3-8 years) with a diagnosis of spastic CP.

 Ninety-four children will be randomly assigned to either a hyperbaric oxygen treatment group or hyperbaric air treatment (HBA) group.

 Each group will receive 40 dives of 60 minutes duration each at 1.

5 atmospheres of pressure (ATA) (the HBO group receiving 100% oxygen, and the HBA group receiving an air mixture containing 14% oxygen, which simulates 21% oxygen at 1.

5 ATA).

 Neurological testing (Gross Motor Function Measure, Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory, and the Test of Variables of Attention) will be performed at baseline, immediately after experimental treatment #40, and at 3 and 6 months after experimental treatment #40.

 Statistical analysis will be performed on these test data to determine any changes from baseline, or between group differences, in the functional capabilities of the study subjects.

 An Evaluation of Hyperbaric Treatments for Children With Cerebral Palsy@highlight

The study is to evaluate the effectiveness of hyperbaric treatments and the potential longer-term effects in children between the ages of 3 and 8 years with spastic cerebral palsy (CP).

 One group will receive 100% oxygen and the other group will receive the equivalent of 21% oxygen (room air).

 The children will receive pre-treatment testing (baseline).

 After 40 experimental treatments are completed, the children will be retested at 0, 3, and 6 months to evaluate any changes.
