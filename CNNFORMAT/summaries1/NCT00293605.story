(secondQuint)Effect of Cemented Stem Design on Periprosthetic Bone Mass Following Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty.

 120 patients will undergo routine hip replacements using either the C-Stem, Exeter Stem or Charnley stem implants.

 Patients will be clinically evaluated pre-operatively and randomised to one of the three implants.

 Post-operatively, patients will be clinically reviewed for 2 years using bone mineral density scans, radiological review, blood and urine analysis for bone markers and validated questionnaires to assess clinical data (Oxford Hip and Harries Hip).

 Patients will be assessed for prothesis migration using the EBRA methods.

 Effect of Cemented Stem Design on Periprosthetic Bone Mass Following Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty@highlight

Total hip replacement is a common procedure for the treatment of osteoarthrosis of the hips, the aims of this study are to determine the effect of implant stem design on bone quality surrounding the implant using three stem designs that are routinely implanted at this hospital.
