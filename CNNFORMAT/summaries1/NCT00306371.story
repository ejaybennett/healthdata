 Double-Pass Treatments of Facial Acne With a 1450 Nm Laser.

 Numerous light based therapies are currently being used for the treatment of acne.

 Non-ablative mid-infrared lasers have the advantage of decreasing inflammatory acne and improving acne scars.

 Specifically, the 1450 nm laser has been shown to be quite effective.

 However, it is associated with considerable pain at higher fluences despite topical anesthetics, especially when treating inflammatory acne.

 The goal of this study was to determine the possibility of using low fluence settings to treat moderate to severe acne at a more tolerable pain level without compromising treatment effectiveness.
