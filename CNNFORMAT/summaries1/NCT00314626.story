(secondQuint)Antiretroviral Treatment Simplification Study With Efavirenz + Abacavir + 3TC Once Daily.

 Treatment simplification is a therapeutic strategy that allows patients with controlled viral replication to switch to an easier-to-take antiretroviral system to promote long-term adherence and thus maintain controlled viral load for longer, delaying the evolution of the HIV infection.

 The combination of ABC+3TC+EFV is a potent and easy-to-take regimen (2 tablets once a day) that could be suitable for the simplification of antiretroviral treatment in patients with controlled viral load with a regimen that includes 2 NRTI taken twice daily.
