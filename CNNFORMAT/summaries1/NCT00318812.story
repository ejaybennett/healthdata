(secondQuint)Heme Iron Polypeptide for Iron Deficiency Anemia in Chronic Renal Failure.

 Iron deficiency anemia is common in patients with pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease, and is associated with significant morbidity.

 Conventional treatment with oral iron salts or IV iron formulations are costly and are associated with side effects.

 Heme iron polypeptide is a newly available formulation of oral iron which can be administered orally, is well absorbed by uremic patients, and has potentially fewer side effects.

 Comparison: Iron deficient anemic patients will be randomized to either oral heme iron polypeptide or IV iron sucrose for six months.
