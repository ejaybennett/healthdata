 This multicenter study is open and has 2 treatment groups with Hiberix cent + a commercially available MenC vaccine as active controls.

 Priorix cent is given concomitantly in both groups.

 In the primary phase, two blood samples are taken from all subjects for immunogenicity analyses: before and one month after vaccination.

 Study in Toddlers to Demonstrate Non-inferiority of GSK Biologicals' Hib-MenC & to Evaluate Persistence up to 5 Years.

@highlight

The purpose of the primary phase of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of a single dose of GSK Biologicals' Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningococcal C (Hib-MenC) conjugate vaccine when given in the second year of life to subjects primed in infancy with a Hib vaccine, but not with a meningococcal serogroup C vaccine, versus commercially available Hib and MenC vaccines.

 In the extension phase, at Years 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5, one blood sample is taken at each year to follow the antibody persistence up to 5 years after vaccination.

 No additional vaccine is administered during the extension phase.
