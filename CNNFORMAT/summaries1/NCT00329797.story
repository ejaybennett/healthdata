(fifthQuint)Zoledronate in Preventing Osteoporosis and Bone Fractures in Patients With Locally Advanced Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy and Hormone Therapy.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the potential benefit of bisphosphonate therapy comprising zoledronate plus vitamin D and calcium supplement vs standard therapy with vitamin D and calcium supplement in the prevention of osteoporosis and associated bone fractures in patients with locally advanced nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate undergoing radiotherapy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy.

 Secondary - Evaluate the potential benefit of these regimens on quality of life in these patients.

 - Evaluate the potential benefit in bone mineral density over a period of 3 years for patients treated with these regimens.

 OUTLINE: This is randomized multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to T score of the hip by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan ( -2.

5 vs - 1.

0) and planned duration of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy (1-2 1/2 years vs > 2 1/2 years).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline and every 6 months during treatment.

 Zoledronate in Preventing Osteoporosis and Bone Fractures in Patients With Locally Advanced Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy and Hormone Therapy@highlight

RATIONALE: Zoledronate may prevent bone loss in patients with prostate cancer undergoing radiation therapy and hormone therapy.

 It is not yet known whether zoledronate is more effective than calcium and vitamin D alone in preventing osteoporosis and bone fractures in patients with prostate cancer.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying zoledronate to see how well it works compared to calcium and vitamin D alone in preventing osteoporosis and bone fractures in patients with locally advanced nonmetastatic prostate cancer undergoing radiation therapy and hormone therapy.
