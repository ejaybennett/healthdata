(thirdQuint)Nitric Oxide-Releasing Acetylsalicyclic Acid in Preventing Colorectal Cancer in Patients at High Risk of Colorectal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the effects of nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid on aberrant cryptic foci (ACF) in patients at high risk for colon cancer.

 Secondary - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the presence or absence of ACF in these patients.

 - Determine the expression of PGE2, COX-1, COX-2, NF-kB, and -catenin in colon tissue.

 - Determine the safety and tolerability of long-term nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study.

 Patients are stratified according to gender and race (black vs non-Hispanic white vs Hispanic white vs Asian).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive oral nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid twice daily for 6 months.

 - Arm II: Patients receive nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid twice daily for 6 months at a higher dose than in arm I.

 - Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 months.

 Patients undergo sigmoidoscopies at baseline and at the completion of study treatment.

 Biopsies of aberrant cryptic foci (ACF) and non-ACF sites are collected at both sigmoidoscopies.

 Tissue is examined for biomarkers (PGE_2, COX, NF-kB, -catenin).

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing, or coming back.

 The use of nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid may prevent colorectal cancer.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid in preventing colorectal cancer in patients at high risk of colorectal cancer.
