(firstQuint)Randomized, Controlled Trial to Test the Efficacy of Interferon Beta in the Treatment of Intermediate Uveitis.

 Deuter et al were the first to show the anti-edematous effect of interferon alpha on inflammatory macular edema (Deuter C.

 In an interventional, multi-centric pilot-study we could demonstrate a positive effect of interferon beta on ED associated uveitis, especially in reducing the macular edema.

 Undesired effects of the treatment were not observed.

 Thus we want to test the efficacy and safety of interferon beta compared to standard treatment with methotrexate in a prospective, clinically controlled trial on patients who suffer from intermediate uveitis with inflammatory macular edema who either have associated ED or have no systemic disease association, i.

 Randomized, Controlled Trial to Test the Efficacy of Interferon Beta in the Treatment of Intermediate Uveitis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate if interferon beta is superior to the standard treatment with Methotrexate for the treatment of intermediate uveitis and macular edema.
