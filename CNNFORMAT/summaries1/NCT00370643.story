 Hyperglycaemia in the intensive care unit and perioperative period has been accused to be one of the causes of worse clinical outcome.

 It is known that in open heart surgeries the glucose level must be set less than 200mg/dl, but new trials had set the glucose level lower than that: 140mg/dl in some studies and even lower (80-110mg/dl).

 Our trial had the intention to seek if there is difference setting glucose level in 2 different ones would modifies clinical outcome.
