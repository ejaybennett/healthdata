(thirdQuint)Outpatient Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

 A select stable population of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention are randomized to standard of care in-hospital stay for one night or early discharge to a nearby hotel.

 During PCI, patients receive bivalirudin as their anti-coagulant and also must be eligible for an angioseal closure device.

 Patients that stay overnight in the hotel must be accompanied by a family member.

 They return to the cath lab the next day for groin check and blood work.

 Satisfaction questionnaires are filled out by all patients.
