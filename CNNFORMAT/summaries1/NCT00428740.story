(secondQuint)Long-Term IOP Fluctuation and VF Progression After Triple Procedure.

 Previous studies reported that lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) slowed the advancement of visual field damage in glaucoma patients.

 However, even if the IOP can been substantially lowered, reduction of mean and peak IOP does not always prevent visual field progression.

We believe that the long-term IOP fluctuation may play a significant role in visual field deterioration in those patients.

Long-term intraocular pressure (IOP) fluctuation may be significantly associated with the progression of glaucomatous visual field loss, even in patients kept always low IOP after triple procedure, an effective approach for patients with coexisting glaucoma and visually significant cataracts.
