(thirdQuint)Jet Injection of 1% Buffered Lidocaine Versus Topical ELA-Max for Anesthesia Prior to Intravenous (IV) Catheterization in Children.

 A prospective, block-randomized, controlled trial comparing J-Tip jet injection of 1% buffered lidocaine to a 30-minute application of 4% ELA-Max for topical anesthesia in children 8-15 years old presenting to a tertiary care pediatric emergency department for PIV insertion.

 All subjects recorded self-reported Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores for pain at time of enrollment and pain of PIV insertion.

 Jet injection subjects also recorded pain of jet injection.

 Subjects were videotaped during jet injection and PIV insertion.

 Videotapes were reviewed by a single blinded reviewer for observer-reported VAS pain scores for jet injection and PIV insertion.

 Jet Injection of 1% Buffered Lidocaine Versus Topical ELA-Max for Anesthesia Prior to Intravenous (IV) Catheterization in Children@highlight

This trial is a comparison of the anesthetic effectiveness of J-Tip needle-free jet injection of 1% buffered lidocaine to the anesthetic effectiveness of topical 4% ELA-Max for peripheral intravenous catheter (PIV) insertion.

 The researchers hypothesize that the jet injection of lidocaine will provide superior anesthesia to the ELA-Max prior to PIV insertion.
