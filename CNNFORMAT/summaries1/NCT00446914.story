(fifthQuint)High Blood Pressure Strategy (HBPS).

 Approximately 5,000 patients will participate in the study at 11 family practice sites throughout Ontario.

 Each of the 11 clinic sites will be randomised to either intervention or delayed intervention 9 months later.

 The intervention is a systems change involving interprofessional education and management tools to bring together physicians, nurses and pharmacists with the patient.

 Patients will be monitored by their family doctor or nurse practitioner at scheduled follow-up visits during a period of 36 months for an effect of the intervention over time on the patient's blood pressure.
