(secondQuint)Extension Study to Evaluate Safety and Tolerability of Peginesatide for Long-Term Treatment of Anemia in Participants With CKD (EU).

 Anemia associated with chronic kidney disease is due to several factors, primarily the inability of the diseased kidneys to produce adequate amounts of endogenous erythropoietin.

 Ancillary factors include the shortened lifespan of red blood cells, iron and other nutritional deficiencies, infection, and inflammation.

 The presence and severity of anemia are related to the duration and extent of kidney failure.

 Anemia is associated with increased mortality, increased likelihood of hospitalization, reduced cognitive function, and increased left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure.

 Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) have been established as a treatment for anemia in subjects with chronic kidney disease, and have improved the management of anemia over alternatives such as transfusion.

 Peginesatide is a parenteral formulation developed for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease.

 Peginesatide binds to and activates the human erythropoietin receptor, and stimulates erythropoiesis in human red cell precursors in a manner similar to other known erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.

 Study participants had received at least 24 weeks of peginesatide dosing in a previous Affymax-sponsored study and were to receive doses of peginesatide for up to 54 months.

 However, the Sponsor ended the study early.

 Extension Study to Evaluate Safety and Tolerability of Peginesatide for Long-Term Treatment of Anemia in Participants With CKD (EU)@highlight

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of peginesatide for the maintenance of hemoglobin in participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who had received at least 24 weeks of peginesatide treatment in an earlier study.
