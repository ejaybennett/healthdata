(secondQuint)Trial of Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus in Tuberous Sclerosis and LAM.

 Inherited mutations of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene cause tuberous sclerosis while acquired (somatic) mutations of either gene are associated with sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).

 Renal angiomyolipomas are a feature of both disorders.

 TSC1 and TSC2 regulate signalling through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.

 Inhibition of mTOR may result in a decrease in size of TSC 1/2 assciated lesions.

 We are treating patients with tuberous sclerosis or sporadic LAM with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in a non-randomised, open label pilot study of safety and efficacy.

 Change in size of renal angiomyolipomas is the primary end point.

 Trial of Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus in Tuberous Sclerosis and LAM@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus as a treatment for renal angiomyolipomas in patients with tyberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
