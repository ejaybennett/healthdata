(thirdQuint)Predicting Insulin Resistance in American Indian Youth.

 Type 2 diabetes is rapidly becoming more prevalent in the United States but especially among minority populations at a younger age.

 Identification of risk factors, including traditional risk factors such as increased BMI, lack of exercise, increased glucose in the diet, higher blood pressure and lipids, along with other factors such as chronic stress, use of alcohol or other drugs has not previously been done with minority youth.

 If risk factors can be identified, more strategies for prevention of diabetes can be developed that specifically target this population.

 This study will enroll 300 Native American Youth over a 4 year period and perform body measurements including height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and lab values including a 2hour glucose tolerance test, fasting lipids, and a urine albumin creatinine ratio test.

 In addition, subjects will be asked to identify behavior and feelings of stress in everyday lives.

 Subjects who are determined to be at increased risk of developing diabetes will be asked to repeat the tests in one year.

 The results will be reported to the tribal council to help determine prevention strategies.

 Predicting Insulin Resistance in American Indian Youth@highlight

The purpose of this study is to identify risks that may contribute to increased insulin resistance which may help explain some of the increased incidence of type 2 diabetes in American Indian Youth, at the Rosebud reservation ages 5 to 18 years old.

 If specific positive indicators of insulin resistance are present, individuals are recruited back in one year for repeat of all measures.
