(fifthQuint)Prospective Clinical Evaluation of the New Aegis Plate for Anterior Interbody Fusions.

 To assess and compare clinical outcomes and fusion rates in patients undergoing an instrumented ALIF procedure.

 Comparisons in all variables will be made across diagnostic categories.

 Comparisons between type of interbody spacer, graft type, and type of instrumentation will also be made.

 This study is part of a larger Continuous Quality Improvement initiative at the Columbia Orthopaedic Group.

 The purpose of this effort is to improve surgical and non-surgical outcomes by using rigorous statistical analysis of our outcomes to guide our treatment decisions.

 Through an iterative feedback process we hope to optimize patient outcomes.
