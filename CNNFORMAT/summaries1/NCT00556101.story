 WB-MRA is performed in patients referred for conventional x-ray based angiography.

 The WB-MRA is performed first in all patients.

 After both examinations are completed the patients will be asked to fill in a questionnaire containing questions about their experience of the 2 procedures.

 We will then compare the results for the procedures.

Investigation of how the patients experience whole body MRA.
