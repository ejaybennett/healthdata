(thirdQuint)Genetic Substudy of the Alternans Before Cardioverter Defibrillator (ABCD) Trial.

 The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that therapy directed primarily by a T wave alternans (TWA) test, measured non-invasively during exercise, is equivalent to therapy directed by an electrophysiological study (EPS) in predicting spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmic events (VTEs) in patients with ischemic heart disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT).

 In the absence of any previous life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia (i.

e.

, for primary prevention), ICD implantation is currently indicated in patients with ischemic heart disease, left ventricular dysfunction, asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and a positive EPS.

 The objective of this study is to demonstrate that a TWA test directed therapy is equivalent to EPS directed therapy in guiding ICD implantation for the purpose of primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with ischemic heart disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.

 Genetic Substudy of the Alternans Before Cardioverter Defibrillator (ABCD) Trial@highlight

The ABCD clinical study (ClinicalTrials.

gov Identifier NCT00187291) was designed to determine if a T-Wave Alternans (TWA) test is equivalent to an Electrophysiology Study (EPS) in predicting life-threatening heart rhythms in patients with ischemic heart disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and non-sustained tachycardia.

 The purpose of the ABCD Genetic sub-study is to identify genetic markers that predict TWA status and arrhythmia risk in this same population.
