(fifthQuint)Phase 2b Study of PTC124 in Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DMD/BMD).

 This study is a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, efficacy and safety study, designed to document the clinical benefit of PTC124 when administered as therapy of patients with DMD/BMD due to a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon) in the dystrophin gene.

 It is planned that ~165 boys who are at least 5 years of age and can walk at least 75 meters (80 yards) will be enrolled.

 Study subjects will be enrolled at sites in North America, Europe, Israel, and Australia.

 They will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either a higher dose of PTC124, a lower dose of PTC124, or placebo.

 Subjects will receive study drug 3 times per day (at breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for 48 weeks.

 Subjects will be evaluated at clinic visits every 6 weeks.

 Additional safety laboratory testing, which may be performed at the investigational site or at an accredited local laboratory or clinic, is required every 3 weeks for the first 24 weeks of the study.

 At the completion of blinded treatment, all compliant participants will be eligible to receive open-label PTC124 in a separate extension study.

 Phase 2b Study of PTC124 in Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DMD/BMD)@highlight

Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys.

 It is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining normal muscle structure and function.

 Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years.

 A specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of DMD/BMD in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease.

 PTC124 is an orally delivered, investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation.

 This study is a Phase 2b trial that will evaluate the clinical benefit of PTC124 in boys with DMD/BMD due to a nonsense mutation.

 The main goals of the study are to understand whether PTC124 can improve walking, activity, muscle function, and strength and whether the drug can safely be given for a long period of time.
