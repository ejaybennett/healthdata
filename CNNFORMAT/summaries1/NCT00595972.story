(secondQuint)Epirubicin Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (FU) Combined With Endostar in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer.

 Although there is no standard regimen in the treatment of metastatic gastric cancer, ECF regimen (epirubicin, cisplatin and FU) is often considered as a reference regimen.

 And ECF regimen has been suggested as the first line therapy for A/MGC by FDA.

 According to the result of a Chinese phase III clinical trial in metastatic lung cancer, endostar-- a new angiogenesis inhibitor prolonged the overall survival, time to progression and improved response rate.

 So we designed this clinical trial to evaluate whether endostar can bring survival benefits to patients with advanced and metastatic gastric cancer patients.
