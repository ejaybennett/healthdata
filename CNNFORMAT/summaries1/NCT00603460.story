(fifthQuint)DCVax-L Vaccination With CD3/CD28 Costimulated Autologous T-Cells for Recurrent Ovarian or Primary Peritoneal Cancer.

 Description of treatment for Phase I: - Patients will be offered, if medically indicated, tumor resection or needle aspiration of malignant effusion in order to make additional doses of DCVax-L vaccine.

 - If subjects have not received DCVax-L vaccination within the last 3-4 weeks, and if DCVax-L is available, subjects have the option of receiving one dose of DCVax-L after enrolment, to boost the frequency of vaccine-primed T cells.

 - Subjects will receive a single course of outpatient lymphodepleting chemotherapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2/d for 3 days) and intravenous fludarabine (30 mg/m2/d for 3 days) both administered on days 8 to 10.

 - Ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated lymphocytes will be infused ~2 days after last day of fludarabine infusion.

 - Patients will receive DCVax-L vaccine ~24-48 hrs after T cell infusion.

 - Subjects will be contacted every 6 months for 5 years for survival.

 Description of treatment for Phase II: In ARM-IIA: - Patients will be offered, if medically indicated, tumor resection or needle aspiration of malignant effusion in order to make additional doses of DCVax-L vaccine.

 - Subjects will receive intradermal vaccinations with DCVax-L every 8 weeks, for four cycles total.

 The first vaccine will be administered on day 0, which can be no sooner than 4 weeks from previous DCVax-L vaccination related to clinical study UPCC-11807.

 - Subjects will receive oral cyclophosphamide at metronomic schedule and dose (50 mg daily) every other week, starting ~3 weeks after DCVax-L in every vaccine cycle.

 - Patients will be offered (with the right to refuse) CT-guided needle biopsy or needle aspiration of malignant effusion after the second vaccine.

 In ARM-IIB: - Patients will be offered, if medically indicated, tumor resection or needle aspiration of malignant effusion in order to make additional doses of DCVax-L vaccine.

 - Subjects will undergo ~10-15 liter leukapheresis to derive vaccine-primed peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) on day 0.

 The apheresis material will be transferred to the Cell and Vaccine Facility at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn CVPF) for T cell manufacturing.

 - If subjects have not received DCVax-L vaccination within the last 3-4 weeks, and if DCVax-L is available, subjects have the option of receiving one dose of DCVax-L after enrolment, to boost the frequency of vaccine-primed T cells.

 - Subjects will receive a single course of outpatient lymphodepleting chemotherapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2/d for 3 days) and intravenous fludarabine (30 mg/m2/d for 3 days).

 - Ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated lymphocytes will be infused ~2 days after last day of fludarabine infusion.

 - Patients will receive DCVax-L vaccine boosts every 8 weeks for a total of four vaccines.

 The first DCVax-L will be given ~24-48 hrs after T cell infusion.

 - Following DCVax-L, subjects will receive oral cyclophosphamide at metronomic schedule and dose (50 mg daily) every other week x 3 cycles, starting ~3 weeks after DCVax-L in every vaccine cycle.

 - Patients will be offered (with the right to refuse) CT-guided needle biopsy or needle aspiration of malignant effusion ~1-2 weeks after the second vaccine.

 DCVax-L Vaccination With CD3/CD28 Costimulated Autologous T-Cells for Recurrent Ovarian or Primary Peritoneal Cancer@highlight

Subjects with recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma or primary peritoneal cancer, who have previously undergone vaccination in clinical study UPCC-11807 with DCVax-L, an autologous vaccine with DC loaded in vitro with autologous tumor lysate.

 Phase I Subjects enrolled in this study will receive leukapheresis; followed by cyclophosphamide/fludarabine-induced lymphodepletion; followed by adoptive transfer of ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated vaccine-primed peripheral blood autologous T cells; followed by a single DCVax-L vaccination, to establish feasibility and safety of this approach.

 Primary Objectives of Phase I To determine the feasibility and safety of administering vaccine-primed, ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated autologous peripheral blood T cells in combination with DCVax-L vaccination, following lymphodepletion with high dose cyclophosphamide/fludarabine.

 Phase II Twenty-two additional subjects will be randomized to receive either: - ARM-IIA: maintenance DCVax-L vaccination, in combination with oral metronomic cyclophosphamide, or - ARM-IIB: leukapheresis, followed by cyclophosphamide/fludarabine-induced lymphodepletion, followed by adoptive transfer of ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated vaccine-primed peripheral blood autologous T cells, followed by maintenance DCVax-L vaccination, plus oral metronomic cyclophosphamide.

 Primary Objective of Phase II To assess the distribution of progression-free survival at 6 months for patients treated with maintenance DCVax-L vaccination plus oral metronomic cyclophosphamide as well as patients treated with ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated vaccine-primed peripheral blood autologous T cells after lymphodepletion with high dose cyclophosphamide / fludarabine, followed by DCVax-L boost vaccination and metronomic oral cyclophosphamide.
