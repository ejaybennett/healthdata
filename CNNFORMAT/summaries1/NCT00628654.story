(secondQuint)Glycan Analysis in Diagnosing Cancer in Women With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer and in Healthy Female Participants.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the accuracy of glycan analysis to distinguish between normal healthy control female subjects and those with ovarian epithelial cancer.

 Secondary - Compare the new assay to the standard CA 125 for diagnostic accuracy.

 OUTLINE: - Ovarian cancer patients: Blood samples are obtained periodically for up to 2 years.

 Patients undergoing surgery have blood samples drawn before and after surgery.

 Medical charts are reviewed periodically for up to 3 years.

 - Healthy volunteers: One blood sample is obtained.

 Volunteers also complete a 1-page questionnaire.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 healthy female participants and 400 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures, such as glycan analysis, may be effective in finding ovarian epithelial cancer.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well glycan analysis works in diagnosing cancer in women with ovarian epithelial cancer and in healthy female participants.
