(thirdQuint)Prospective Evaluation of the Effects of Topical Therapy With Sulfamylon For 5% Topical Solution on Autograft Healing in Subjects With Thermal Injuries Requiring Meshed Autografts: A Comparison to a Historical Control Group.

 This is a prospective, non-inferiority, multi-center, historically controlled, open label study that will evaluate the effects of topical therapy with Sulfamylon(R) For 5% Topical Solution on autograft healing in subjects with thermal injuries requiring meshed autografts against a similar historic control population in which Sulfamylon(R) For 5% Topical Solution or mafenide acetate or other mafenide salt forms were not used.

 Prospective subjects meeting the entrance criteria will receive Sulfamylon(R) solution as topical antimicrobial treatment on moist dressings following initial meshed autograft procedure (Day 1).

 Sulfamylon(R) solution will be used every 6-8 hours, or as needed, to keep the dressing moist.

 The graft will be evaluated on Days 5-7, Days 12-14 and Days 18-21, unless the subject is discharged, dies, or experiences graft loss / regrafting of the initial meshed autograft prior to Assessment 4 (Days 18-21).

The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of treatment with Sulfamylon(R) solution as the initial topical moist dressing over meshed autografts following the initial graft procedure on preventing graft loss in a prospective cohort of subjects versus a historical control group in a non-inferiority trial.
