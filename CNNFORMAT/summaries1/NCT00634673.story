(fifthQuint)Postprandial Fatty Acids and FABP2 in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM).

 Background: The presence of Ala54Thr polymorphism of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein 2 gene (FABP2) might influence the intestinal absorption of dietary fatty acids (FAs) and has been associated with diabetic nephropathy.

 Objective: We studied the postprandial serum FAs in type 2 diabetic patients homozygous for Thr54 (TT; n = 11) or for Ala54 (AA; n = 15) after a standard meal.

Design: Patients received a sandwich (7.

95% protein, and 34.

70% carbohydrate) in the morning after 12-h fasting and FAs in chylomicrons (gas chromatograph), plasma glucose, and serum triacylglycerols were measured at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h.

 Results: TT and AA patients did not differ regarding age (61.

 The increase in serum glucose and triacylglycerols after the meal (ANOVA,P<0.

 The maximum increase of FAs occurred at 6-h postprandial, but only in TT patients: saturated FAs increased from 464.

 Conclusion: The presence of the T allele of Ala54Thr polymorphism of FABP2 gene in type 2 diabetic patients increases absorption of dietary FAs, including the trans-unsaturated FAs, and this might turns these patients more susceptible to the effect of diet composition.

 Postprandial Fatty Acids and FABP2 in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM)@highlight

This study will be conducted in type 2 diabetic patient's to evaluate the if there is a different response of serum lipids after a standard meal (rich in saturated fatty acids) in patients who have the presence of a genetic alteration.

 This alteration that will be evaluated is a polymorphism, change of an amino acid in the gene of FABP2.

 This gene that can influence the absorption of lipids in the intestine and subjects who have the altered genotype (presence of T allele) can have an abnormal lipid profile as compared to subjects without this genotype.
