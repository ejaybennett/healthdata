(firstQuint)Clinical Trial of Integrated Treatment for Pain and Opioid Dependence.

 This study aims to develop a novel manualized intervention using tailored cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) and buprenorphine medication to effectively treat the co-occurring disorders of non-malignant pain and opioid dependence (POD).

 Specific Aims: 1.

 To conduct a pre-pilot phase with 16 patients with POD receiving buprenorphine maintenance treatment (BMT).

 In the pre-pilot phase, we will also explore the effects of different daily buprenorphine dosages on pain and opiate use.

 2.

 To conduct a pilot randomized, clinical trial to obtain data regarding the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy (compared to Physician Management(PM) only) of manual-guided CBT or Educational Counseling (EC) for patients with POD treated with BMT (N=75).
