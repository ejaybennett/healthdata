 Before the patients receive the palonosetron, a physical exam and blood tests are performed to determine eligibility.

 If eligible and willing, subjects are given Palonosetron intravenously.

 Subjects are given the Palonosetron and Dexamethasone 30 minutes before the first dose of Irinotecan and Bevacizumab chemotherapy.

 The total expected duration of participation is 57 days.

 Subjects are also asked to complete 4 questionnaires about nausea and vomiting, as well as daily functioning and fatigue.

 Subjects are asked to complete these questionnaires before starting chemotherapy, the day of starting chemotherapy and for the next 4 days after receiving chemotherapy, for a total of 6 times.

 Subjects are asked to complete this set of questionnaires each of the 3 times that they receive chemotherapy during the 6-week treatment cycle.

 The other treatments subjects would normally receive for their brain tumor and their routine care are not affected by the study.
