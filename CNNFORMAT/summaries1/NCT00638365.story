(firstQuint)Dose Escalation Study of KB001 in Cystic Fibrosis Patients Infected With Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.

 CF patients often have lung infections.

 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is the most significant bacteria in CF, with up to 80% of CF patients eventually becoming infected.

 These patients are often treated with antibiotics with variable results.

 This study will examine the impact of a single-dose of an investigational drug, KB001, on Pa bacteria in the CF lung.
