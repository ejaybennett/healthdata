(firstQuint)Study of Memantine to Treat Huntington's Disease.

 Results of several published clinical trials suggest that memantine has a beneficial effect in dementing conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease; however, the effects of memantine on cognitive and behavioral function in HD are unknown.

 Our hypotheses are that HD patients who are administered memantine will show improved performance on psychometric tests of memory and executive functions in addition to behavior and that patients treated with memantine will show more improvement after six months than after three months of treatment.
