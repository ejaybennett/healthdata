(firstQuint)Bioequivalence Study of ARQ 197 Amorphous and Crystalline Polymorphs A and B in Normal Healthy Volunteers.

 This is a bioequivalence study designed to compare three solid states of ARQ 197 in normal healthy volunteers using a randomized crossover design.

 The primary objective is to obtain pharmacokinetic data to assess bioequivalence among three solid states of ARQ 197: amorphous, crystalline polymorph A and crystalline polymorph B.
