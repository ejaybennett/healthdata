(fifthQuint)Sex, Aging and Antiretroviral Pharmacokinetics.

 Purpose: To longitudinally quantify systemic and genital tract antiretroviral pharmacokinetics and viral responses in HIV-infected post-menopausal women.

 These parameters will be compared to pre-menopausal women to determine if the absence or presence of estrogen influences treatment responses and infectiousness of HIV.

 Participants: 30 post-menopausal and 12 pre-menopausal HIV-infected women Procedures (methods): First dose, steady state, and longitudinal pharmacokinetics of the most commonly prescribed antiretroviral agents will be assessed in the systemic and genital tract compartments in a cohort of post- and pre-menopausal HIV-infected women.

 Concurrent blood plasma and genital secretions HIV RNA will be measured.

 Systemic and genital tract virologic responses will be correlated with antiretroviral concentrations and with each other.

 Sex, Aging and Antiretroviral Pharmacokinetics@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to learn about levels of antiretroviral drug levels and response to HIV virus in the genital tract of women who are post-menopausal.

 The investigators in this study think that the levels of hormones post-menopausal HIV-infected women may have in their bodies may affect the levels of antiretroviral drug, and therefore affect how much HIV virus they have in their bodies.

 Since women who have already gone through menopause have different levels of hormones, such as estrogen, than women who are pre-menopausal, the investigators would like to check the levels of antiretroviral drugs in their blood, their genital secretions, and their genital tissue.
