(thirdQuint)Quality of Life After Liver Resection.

 Background: Due to advances in operative methods and perioperative care, mortality and morbidity following major hepatic resection have decreased substantially, making long-term quality of life (QoL) an increasingly prominent issue.

 Objectives: We plan on evaluating whether postoperative diagnosis is associated with long-term QoL and health in patients who require hepatic surgery for benign or malignant diseases and how QoL evolves with time.

 Method: QoL will be evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 and the liver-specific QLQ-LMC21 module.

 All patients requiring hepatic surgery aged >18 years will be included in the study.

 QoL evaluation is carried out preoperatively and at set intervals postoperatively.

 Quality of Life After Liver Resection@highlight

Patients with malignant diseases are increasingly receiving more extensive hepatic resections, with im-proved preoperative and postoperative care leading to a reduced postoperative morbidity and mortality.

 In this setting, postoperative quality of life may become as important as overall patient survival.

 In this study we will be investigating the effect of the initial disease for which hepatic resection was carried out on short- and long-term quality of life.
