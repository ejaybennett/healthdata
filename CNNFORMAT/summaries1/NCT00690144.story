(firstQuint)High-fidelity Simulation in Health Care Education.

 High-fidelity simulation has many advantages in medical education.

 Simulation-based critical care training is especially valuable due to error-prone work settings and the high cost of patient adverse events.

 This study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of implementing the high-fidelity simulation in critical care training, and the feasibility of high-fidelity simulation as an evaluation tool.
