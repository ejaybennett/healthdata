(firstQuint)Outcomes of Triaged Family Care in Advanced Cancer.

 The purpose of this study is to: 1.

 determine if family dyads randomly assigned to either a brief or extensive family-based program of care have better proximal and distal outcomes from both a clinical and economic perspective than dyads randomly assigned to usual care 2.

 determine if the brief or extensive program of care has a differential effect on patient and caregiver outcomes depending on the patient's baseline risk for distress status (high versus low).

 A longitudinal, randomized clinical trial is being used for patients with advanced lung, colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer and their caregivers.
