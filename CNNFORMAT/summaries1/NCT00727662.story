(fifthQuint)A Yoga and Wellness Program for Breast Cancer Survivors With Persistent Fatigue.

 Fatigue is the most common and distressing side effect of cancer treatment and persists beyond successful treatment completion in approximately 30% of breast cancer survivors, causing serious disruption in quality of life.

 Behavioral interventions incorporating physical activity or relaxation/stress management have demonstrated beneficial effects on cancer-related fatigue, although research in cancer survivors is limited.

 Mind-body interventions such as yoga are extremely popular among cancer patients and offer a promising alternative to traditional treatments.

 Research is needed to establish the feasibility and efficacy of these interventions in cancer populations, particularly those who are experiencing problems with fatigue.

 A Yoga and Wellness Program for Breast Cancer Survivors With Persistent Fatigue@highlight

This randomized controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of an Iyengar Yoga intervention to a Wellness Seminar health education lecture series, for improvements in energy, mood and biological functioning in breast cancer survivors with persistent, post-treatment fatigue.

 It is anticipated that the Iyengar Yoga intervention will be feasible and acceptable to breast cancer survivors with minimal side effects and that the Yoga intervention will be effective in improving fatigue and physical performance.
