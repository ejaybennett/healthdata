(thirdQuint)Brain Stimulation for Epilepsy Long Term Follow-up.

 Medtronic is conducting a pivotal clinical trial entitled Stimulation of the Anterior Nucleus of the Thalamus in Epilepsy (SANTE).

 One of the requirements of the SANTE study is to evaluate the rate of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP).

 Medtronic is aware of approximately 18 subjects with various types of epilepsy that have been treated with neurostimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus outside the SANTE trial under five physician-sponsored studies.

 This protocol will initially collect information regarding the physician-sponsored study subjects' status.

 The goal of this study is to pool these data with the SANTE data for the purpose of estimating the SUDEP rate.

 This is a multi-center, retrospective and prospective clinical study in patients previously implanted with devices that provide bilateral neurostimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus during non-Medtronic-sponsored studies.

The purpose of this study is to collect subject data to evaluate the rate of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) with bilateral neurostimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus in people diagnosed with refractory epilepsy.

 The data obtained from the physician initiated studies will be pooled with data collected in Medtronic-sponsored studies to assess SUDEP risk.
