(fifthQuint)Cost-Effectiveness of Adding Web-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to Luvox CR for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).

 Primary Endpoint(s): Change in Y-BOCS score from baseline to endpoint at weeks 12 and 24; and, number (and percent) "responders" at weeks 12 and 24, defined as subjects with a 35% decrease in Y-BOCS score at endpoint and a Clinical Global Impressions score of 1 or 2 (very much or much improved).

 Secondary Endpoint(s): 1.

 change in scores on the Work and Social Adjustment Scale, a quality of life measure 2.

 change in scores on the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem scale; in particular, we will analyze change in work hours/week lost because of OCD, and change in effect of OCD on work productivity (0-10 scale).

 Cost-Effectiveness of Adding Web-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to Luvox CR for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)@highlight

This study will test the hypotheses that: 1.

 12 weeks of Luvox-CR plus web-based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) [CT-STEPS] will produce greater symptom relief of OCD than treatment with Luvox-CR alone; and, 2.

 subjects receiving 12 weeks of CT-STEPS added to Luvox-CR treatment after 12-weeks of Luvox-CR monotherapy will experience greater OCD symptom relief (from weeks 12-24) than those continuing Luvox-CR treatment and having access to CT-STEPS from week one.

 3.

 subjects who begin CT-STEPS at week 12 will be more likely to complete it than those who begin CT-STEPS at baseline.
