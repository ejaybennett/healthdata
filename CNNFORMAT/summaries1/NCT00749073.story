(fifthQuint)The Vertos MILD Preliminary Patient Evaluation Study.

 The Vertos MILD cent devices are used for image-guided Minimally Invasive Lumbar Decompression, referred to as the MILD cent procedure.

 This percutaneous procedure is performed under fluoroscopic image guidance through a dorsal approach to the spine.

 Lumbar decompression is performed through the removal of tissue and bone, where indicated.

 All procedures are conducted in accordance with the product labeling and indications for use.

 A minimum of ten up to a maximum of twenty-five adult patients will be enrolled and followed for a period of up to 6 months.

 Patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis who meet the study enrollment criteria will be offered the MILD cent procedure as an alternative to surgery or continued standard non-surgical medical management.
