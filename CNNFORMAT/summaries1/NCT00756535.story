(secondQuint)Exercise Training in a Geriatric Hospital Ward.

 Hospitalization of older people is connected with several adverse events.

 Hospitalization increases the risk of disability and long-term institutionalization.

 Immobilization during hospitalization can lead to deterioration of muscle strength and falls.

 Earlier studies have shown that strength training is beneficial even in the oldest old.

 Rehabilitation based on strength training exercises can prevent decline in functional capacity and shorten the length of hospitalization.
