(thirdQuint)Study of Nutrition Regimens in Treating Patients With Cancer of the Upper Aerodigestive Tract.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of immunonutrition (IMPACT(R)) in patients with de novo cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract.

 Secondary - Determine the best time to initiate treatment.

 - Compare the intermediate duration of treatment.

 - Compare nutritional parameters.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive standard oral or enteral nutrition (IMPACT(R) placebo) over 7 days prior to surgery and over 7 days after surgery.

 - Arm II: Patients receive oral or enteral neoadjuvant IMPACT(R) nutrition over 7 days prior to surgery and enteral adjuvant standard nutrition (IMPACT(R) placebo) over 7 days after surgery.

 - Arm III: Patients receive oral or enteral IMPACT(R) nutrition over 7 days prior to surgery and enteral adjuvant IMPACT(R) nutrition over 7 days after surgery.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 30 days after surgery and then at 2 and 3 months.

 Study of Nutrition Regimens in Treating Patients With Cancer of the Upper Aerodigestive Tract@highlight

RATIONALE: It is not yet known which regimen of enteral nutrition is more effective in preventing infections in patients undergoing surgery for cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing three nutrition regimens in treating patients with cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract.
