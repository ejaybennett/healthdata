(firstQuint)Study the Effects of CYP2C Polymorphisms on the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Glipizide.

 Compared with CYP2C19, CYP2C9 polymorphism appears to have a dominant role in glipizide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in vivo.

 This indicated that dose adjustment based on CYP2C9 genotype may improve antidiabetic treatment.
