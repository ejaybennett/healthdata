(thirdQuint)Phase  Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Followed by Concurrent Chemoradiation for Stage AB Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.

 Concurrent chemoradiation is the standard treatment for locally advanced NPC.

 The survival benefit gained from adding neoadjuvant chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiation has never been defined.

 In the present trail, we hope to assess the tolerance and survival benefits of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation in patients with stage IVAB NPC.

 Phase  Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Followed by Concurrent Chemoradiation for Stage AB Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to determine the tolerance and overall survival in patients with stage IVAB NPC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiation.

 Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the distant metastases free survival, and disease-free survival of patients with stage IVAB treated with this regimen
