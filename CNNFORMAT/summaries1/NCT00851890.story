(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Antiviral Activity of Multiple Doses of ABT-333 Alone and in Combination With Pegylated Interferon (pegIFN) and Ribavirin (RBV) in Subjects With Genotype 1 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection.

 This was a Phase 2a, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected adults with 2 planned sequential evaluations, Part 1 and Part 2.

 The study evaluated the safety, tolerability, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics of ABT-333 or placebo monotherapy, followed by 26 days of ABT-333 or placebo with pegylated interferon a-2a (pegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy.

 Review of safety and efficacy in Part 1 of the study showed similar response rates across ABT-333 doses so Part 2 of the study was not performed.

 The study also assessed emergence of resistant HCV in conjunction with kinetics of viral load decay and rebound in treatment-naive, HCV-infected participants.

The purpose of this study was to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of ABT-333 (also known as dasabuvir) in treatment-naive, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected participants.
