(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (Explores What the Body Does to the Drug), and Pharmacodynamics (Explores What a Drug Does to the Body) of JNJ-38431055 in Volunteers With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

 This is a double-blind (neither physician or participant knows name of the assigned study drug), placebo-controlled (substance containing no medication), crossover study in male and female volunteers with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 For each volunteer, the study consists of a screening phase (up to 45 days), a run-in phase during which volunteers discontinue their oral hypoglycemic drugs (28 days), a treatment phase during which volunteers will continue to be off their oral hypoglycemic drugs (28 days) and will receive 4 single dose study treatments in a randomized (study sequence assigned by chance) sequence, and a follow-up phase (10 days).

 After the follow-up phase volunteers will restart their oral hypoglycemic drugs.

 During the treatment phase there will be at least 7 days between each of the 4 treatments.

 The four treatments will be Dose 1 of JNJ-38431055, Dose 2 of JNJ-38431055, sitagliptin (Januvia), and placebo.

 The following safety evaluations will be taken throughout the study: Electrocardiogram (an ECG is a painless procedure that gives a picture of the electrical activity of the heart), Blood pressure, heart rate, and blood samples for laboratory tests.

 The primary outcome will be incremental glucose after an oral glucose tolerance test.

 Study drug will be administered as single oral doses separated by at least 7 days.

 The four treatments will be Dose 1 of JNJ-38431055, Dose 2 of JNJ-38431055, sitagliptin (Januvia), and placebo.
