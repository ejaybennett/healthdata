(thirdQuint)Study of Pap Smears From Patients Enrolled on Clinical Trial GOG-171.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the diagnostic accuracy of using previously reported morphometric criteria for chromatin distribution, shortest distance between nuclei, and/or the ratio of nucleoli area to nucleus area in a conventional Pap smear from patients with a cytologic diagnosis of atypical glandular cells of unspecified significance (AGUS) to predict the presence of significant glandular lesions (i.

e.

, adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS] or invasive cancer) and/or squamous lesions (i.

e.

, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN2 or CIN3]) of the cervix.

 Secondary - To optimize the diagnostic accuracy of using chromatin distribution, shortest distance between nuclei, and/or the ratio of nucleoli area to nucleus area in a conventional Pap smear from patients with a cytologic diagnosis of AGUS to predict the presence of significant glandular lesions (i.

e.

, AIS or invasive cancer) and/or squamous lesions (i.

e.

, CIN2 or CIN3) of the cervix.

 OUTLINE: Previously collected slides from Pap smears of patients enrolled on clinical trial GOG-171 are assessed for nuclear chromatin distribution, the shortest distances between the central points of neighboring cell nuclei, and nucleoli area/nucleus area (N/N) ratio via morphometric analysis.

RATIONALE: Studying Pap smears in the laboratory from women with atypical glandular cells of unspecified significance may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 PURPOSE: This research study is looking at Pap smears from women enrolled on clinical trial GOG-171.
