(thirdQuint)Tissue Sample Collection From Patients With Head and Neck Cancer and From Healthy Participants.

 OBJECTIVES: - Maintain and update a clinical database pertaining to diagnosis and treatment outcome of patients with head and neck cancer.

 - Develop a repository of biospecimens from these patients.

 OUTLINE: Tumor tissue samples and/or bronchial washings are collected from patients undergoing planned surgery and/or bronchoscopy, respectively.

 Buccal swabs and/or mouthwash samples and saliva samples are collected.

 Patients also undergo blood sample collection at baseline and then every 2-6 months thereafter.

 Healthy participants contribute blood samples, buccal swabs, and mouthwash samples at baseline only.

 Information about medical and family history and cancer risk factors is also collected.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: No limit.

 FOLLOW UP: Indefinite, until date of death or lost to follow up.
