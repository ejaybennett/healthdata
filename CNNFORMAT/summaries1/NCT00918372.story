(thirdQuint)Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in Women Marathon Runners.

 Single-center, non-randomized, prospective, observational study.

 The study population will be up to 100 female athletes who are competitive long distance runners, and have been so for a minimum of 10 years.

 Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) will be used to characterize the amount, severity and type of atherosclerotic lesions.

 MSCTA will be performed per usual practice using a minimum X-ray dose protocol.

 The study will determine whether moderate to high intensity, long term athletic training and competition is associated with enhanced coronary artery disease in women.

 Each participant will complete a life-style, training volume and risk factor questionnaire.

 These participants will be compared to an age, gender and risk factor matched cohort.

 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in Women Marathon Runners@highlight

The aim of this study is to determine the effects of extreme fitness in women.

 The incidence of coronary artery disease observed via multislice computed tomography (MSCT) angiogram will be compared with age and risk-matched controls from both sedentary and fitness activity groups who have never been significant runners.

 Life style, training volume and risk factors will be assessed.
