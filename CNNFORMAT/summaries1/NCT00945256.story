(thirdQuint)Muscle Perfusion and Protein Metabolism in Elderly.

 The purpose of this study was to examine muscle protein metabolism in healthy young and elderly subjects during pharmacologic vasodilation of the lower limb vasculature in combination with increased amino acids delivery.

 We obtained femoral arteriovenous blood samples and v.

 lateralis muscle biopsies during a primed continuous infusion of L-[ring-13C6] Phenylalanine.

 Muscle protein kinetics were measured in the basal state and during a 180 min infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and amino acids (Premsol 10%) (SNP+AA).

 Skeletal muscle microvascular recruitment and flow were measured during the basal state and SNP+AA using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEU).

 Muscle Perfusion and Protein Metabolism in Elderly@highlight

The purpose of this study was to examine the role skeletal muscle perfusion plays in mediating muscle protein synthesis in healthy older and younger individuals.

 The investigators hypothesized that normalization of muscle perfusion in older men and women via exercise or infusion of a vasodilator would enhance nutritive flow and skeletal muscle protein synthesis in the elderly similar to that of their younger counterparts.
