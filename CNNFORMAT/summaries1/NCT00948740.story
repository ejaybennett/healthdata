(secondQuint)The Effect of Vitamin D on Urinary Calcium Excretion in Kidney Stone Formers With High Urinary Calcium.

 We plan to conduct a clinic-based interventional study of 30 patients followed at Brigham and Women's Hospital with history of nephrolithiasis, urinary calcium excretion between 200 and 400 mg/day, and 25-vitamin D deficiency (defined as serum level 25ng/ml).

 The intervention is oral ergocalciferol 50,000 IU per week for 8 weeks [1], and each participant will serve as his own control.

 The outcome is the change in urinary calcium excretion.

 The planned study duration is 3 months.

 We will have greater than 95% power to detect a 10% increase in 24-hour urinary calcium.

The investigators hypothesize that a 3 month course of vitamin D supplementation to treat 25(OH)D deficiency in stone formers with high levels of 24-hour urinary calcium will not increase urinary calcium excretion by greater than 10%.
