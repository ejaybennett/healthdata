(thirdQuint)Study of Tissue Samples From Patients With Glioma or Other Brain Tumors.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To better understand the pathophysiology of gliomas and identify molecular markers that may predict prognosis and progression or that could identify new therapeutic approaches.

 Secondary - To compare gene expression profiles, in terms of response to treatment, and attempt to isolate subgroups of patients with objective response to certain types of chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Biological samples are collected from patients at time of surgery for diagnostic and/or treatment purposes.

 Study of Tissue Samples From Patients With Glioma or Other Brain Tumors@highlight

RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

 PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tissue samples from patients with glioma or other brain tumors.
