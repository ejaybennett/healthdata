(fifthQuint)Becaplermin Gel for MARTORELL's Hypertensive Leg Ulcers.

 Hypertensive leg ulcers are a variety of leg ulcer characterized by very painful and spreading lesions, related to cutaneous microangiopathy, occurring in patients presenting hypertension and /or diabetes.

 Healing takes a mean of 4 to 12 months.

 Current treatment is difficult and usually surgical (pinch or meshed skin grafts).

 Growth factors release by autografted skin may be a significant factor in the promotion of hypertensive leg ulcer healing.

 Recombinant human platelet derived growth-factor-BB gel (becaplermin gel) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of diabetic ulcers related to diabetic microangiopathy.

 The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of becaplermin gel for the healing of hypertensive leg ulcers.

 Study design: prospective, randomized, multi-centre, double blind, controlled, parallel groupPrimary aim: complete wound closure at week 8Secondary aims: complete wound closure at week 12, pain and quality of life assessment during the treatment( W4,8,10,12), % of wound area reduction at week 8 and 12 Method: Inclusion of 64 patients, 32 in each group.

 The study population consisted of consecutive patients presenting with one or more leg ulcers diagnosed as hypertensive MARTORELL's ulcers: hypertensive and/or diabetic patients, in absence of chronic venous insufficiency (C5-C6 of the CEAP) or peripheral arterial occlusive disease (presence of peripheral pulses or ankle brachial index 0.

8), superficial spreading necrotic ulcer, presence of spontaneous pain, and presence of a red purpuric margin.

 Treatment consists of a daily application of a continuous thin layer of becaplermin gel (Regranex Gel(R)) or Duoderm Hydrogel cent , during 8 weeks.

 The amount of the gel to be applied was determined based on ulcer area at inclusion (as recommended for Regranex gel(R)), and remains identical during all the treatment.

 Wound was then recovered by a moist saline gauze and a bandage.

 Duoderm Hydrogel cent is a sodium carboxymethylcellulose aqueous-based gel, similar in composition to becaplermin excipient.

At week 8, a pinch graft was proposed to patients whom the ulcer was not healed.

 Between weeks 8 and 12, if patient had not healed and was not grafted, dressing was chosen by the investigator, depending on the wound stage.

 All patients were followed until week 12.

 Becaplermin Gel for MARTORELL's Hypertensive Leg Ulcers@highlight

Background: No medical treatment has proved its efficacy for the treatment of hypertensive leg ulcers in a well designed trial.

 Primary aim of the study: to compare the rate of healing in hypertensive leg ulcers treated with becaplermin gel (Regranex Gel(R)) daily application versus the application of the same quantity of an hydrogel (Duoderm Hydrogel cent ), corresponding to the excipient of becaplermin gel.

 Method: Ambulatory or hospitalized patients presenting with an hypertensive leg ulcer, were randomized to receive either a daily application of becaplermin gel or hydrogel during 8 weeks.

 At week 8, a pinch graft was proposed to patients whom the ulcer has not healed.

 Primary aim of the study: Complete closure at week 8 Secondary aims: percentage of wound area reduction at week 8, complete closure at week 12, pain and quality of life during treatment Study hypothesis: becaplermin gel may promote the healing of hypertensive leg ulcers and be an alternative medical treatment to the skin graft usually proposed
