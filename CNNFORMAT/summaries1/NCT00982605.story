(secondQuint)EBUS-guided TBNA for Molecular Diagnostic of Mediastinal Lymph Nodes (LN).

 NSCLC is a common cancer.

 Accurate and early staging has a significant impact on outcome.

 EBUS-TBNA of involved mediastinal lymph nodes is critical.

 Molecular markers could improve mediastinal staging.

 EBUS-guided TBNA for Molecular Diagnostic of Mediastinal Lymph Nodes (LN)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to perform molecular diagnostic in mediastinal lymph nodes of non-small cell lung cancer patients sampled by endobronchial ultrasound guided finde needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA).
