(secondQuint)POSTconditioning During Coronary Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction Study.

 POST-AMI is a single-center, prospective, randomized trial, with a planned inclusion of 78 patients with ST-elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).

 Patients will be randomly assigned to postconditioning arm (primary angioplasty (PA) and stenting followed by brief episodes of ischemia-reperfusion performed during the first minutes of reperfusion) or non-postconditioning arm (PA and stenting without additional intervention).

 All patients will be treated medically according to current international guidelines, including glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors before PCI.

 The primary end point is to evaluate whether postconditioning, compared to PA without additional intervention, reduces infarct size estimated by magnetic resonance at 3010 days after the AMI.

 Secondary end points are microvascular obstruction observed at magnetic resonance, ST-segment elevation resolution, persistent ST-segment elevation, angiographic myocardial blush grade 1 months, and the reduction of major adverse cardiac events at 30 days and 6 months.

The POST-conditioning during coronary angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction (POST-AMI) trial will evaluate the usefulness of postconditioning in limiting infarct size and microvascular damage during the early and late phases after AMI.
