(fifthQuint)Cyclophosphamide, Autologous Lymphocytes, and Aldesleukin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Assess the safety and toxicity of cellular adoptive immunotherapy with autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) following cyclophosphamide conditioning and post-infusion aldesleukin (IL-2) in patients with metastatic melanoma.

 - Assess the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred lymphocytes.

 Secondary - Evaluate the antitumor effect of adoptively transferred autologous TIL following cyclophosphamide conditioning and post-infusion IL-2 in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2 and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) IV on day 0.

 Beginning 6 hours after TIL infusion, patients receive high-dose aldesleukin (IL-2) IV three times daily on days 0-5 (for up to 14 doses) OR low-dose IL-2 subcutaneously twice daily on days 0-14 (for up to 28 doses).

 Patients may then receive two additional courses of TILs and low-dose IL-2 (with or without cyclophosphamide), if indicated.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

 Cyclophosphamide, Autologous Lymphocytes, and Aldesleukin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Biological therapy, such as cellular adoptive immunotherapy using autologous lymphocytes, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing.

 Aldesleukin may stimulate the lymphocytes to kill tumor cells.

 Giving cyclophosphamide together with autologous lymphocytes and aldesleukin may be an effective treatment for metastatic melanoma.

 PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving cyclophosphamide together with autologous lymphocytes and aldesleukin and to see how well it works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.
