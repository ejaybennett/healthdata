(secondQuint)Sirolimus Conversions in African-American Renal Transplant Recipients.

 A major concern in transplantation is finding a successful regimen of medications to lower the potential for the body to reject the newly transplanted organ.

 The regimens in kidney transplantation include tacrolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids.

 This study will compare the effectiveness and safety of a regimen including Sirolimus, Prograf, and steroids compared to a regimen including Sirolimus, Cellcept and steroids.

 These regimens have already been researched in the Caucasian population, and both drug regimens are FDA approved.

 This study's focus is on the effectiveness and safety of these regimens in African-Americans.
