(firstQuint)Influence of Acupuncture to Ocular Microcirculation in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus.

 Diabetes is combined with severe vascular damage at the different stages of the disease, causing reduction in retinal perfusion.

 Acupuncture is supposed to regulate the perfusion.

 We propose a study to evaluate the effect of acupuncture to the vascular auto regulation in patient with Diabetes, compared to healthy people without vascular or retinal diseases.

 The perfusion of the retinal vessel will be examined by Retinal vessel analyzer (RVA), Heidelberg retinal Flowmeter (HRF) and the Ocular blood Flowmeter (OBF) before, during and after standardized specific acupuncture at healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes.
