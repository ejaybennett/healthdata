(thirdQuint)Effect of Combination of Mitiglinide and Metformin on Glycemic Control in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

 This was a 16-week, randomized, double-blind study for comparing metformin plus mitiglinide (Met+Mit) versus metformin plus placebo (Met+Pcb).

 An 8-week metformin run-in phase (500 mg twice a day for the first 4 weeks and 500 mg three times a day for the following 4 weeks) was followed by a 16-week trial phase (mitiglinide 10 mg or placebo three times a day added to metformin 500 mg three times a day).

 The subjects with an HbA1c >7.

0% at the end of the metformin run-in phase were randomized to a Met+Mit group or a Met+Pcb group of the trial phase.

 Effect of Combination of Mitiglinide and Metformin on Glycemic Control in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus@highlight

We performed a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial to assess the efficacy and safety of combined treatment with mitiglinide and metformin for patients with type 2 diabetes who show inadequate glycemic control with metformin monotherapy.

 Subjects with HbA1c >7.

0% after an 8-week metformin run-in phase were randomized to a 16-week trial phase with metformin plus mitiglinide (Met+Mit) or metformin plus placebo (Met).
