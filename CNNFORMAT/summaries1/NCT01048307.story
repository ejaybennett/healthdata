(fifthQuint)Effect of Prontosan Wound Irrigation Solution on Venous Ulcers.

 Investigational product, dose and administration: Prontosan(R) Wound Irrigation Solution (experimental group) and saline solution (control group) will be applied at inclusion and reapplied after dressing changes.

 The treatment scheme is as follows: 1.

 Prontosan(R) Wound Irrigation Solution (experimental group): - cleansing the wound bed at dressing change with Prontosan(R) Wound Irrigation Solution; a sterile gauze dressing impregnated with the Prontosan(R) solution will be placed on the immediate wound in the form of a moist compress and removed after approximately 15 minutes; - placing the primary dressing (Profore(R) WCL): the dressing will be impregnated with Prontosan(R) Wound Irrigation Solution; - fixing the dressing to the wound using multilayered elastic compression bandaging (Profore(R) bandaging system).

 2.

 Saline (control group): - cleansing the wound bed at dressing change with saline; a sterile gauze dressing impregnated with the saline will be placed on the wound in the form of a moist compress and removed after approx.

15 minutes; - placing the primary dressing (Profore(R) WCL): the dressing will be impregnated with saline; - fixing the dressing to the wound using multilayered elastic compression bandaging (Profore(R) bandaging system).

 Dressings will be changed and the treatment procedure will be repeated in the clinic 2x/weekly or more.

 The efficacy of the treatment procedure will be evaluated on the basis of a 2 week observation period.

 Treatment efficacy assessment: - Assessment of clinical signs and symptoms at entry to the study and after one and two weeks.

 - Quantitative and qualitative microbiological analysis at entry to the study and after two weeks.

 - Wound planimetry using PictZar(R) CDM at entry to the study and after two weeks.

 Primary aim: - clinical signs assessed by: 1.

 reduction of slough and necrotic tissue 2.

 control of exudate 3.

 presence of granulation tissue - reduction of inflammatory signs (surrounding skin) - reduction in wound size (assessed by wound planimetry) - reduction of bacterial load (quantitative and qualitative microbiological Secondary aim: - tolerance and safety assessment: 1.

 adverse drug reaction 2.

 adverse events 3.

 early withdrawal from the study.
