(thirdQuint)Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin and Carboplatin as First Line Treatment for Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is the first antineoplastic drug derived from the new technology of liposome formulation to be introduced in clinical practice.

 The low myocardium uptake of this formulation accounts for its reduced cardiac toxicity, confirmed both in preclinical models and in humans.

 Preclinical data have shown activity in NSCLC xenografts.

 This Phase II study is to explore the efficacy and toxicity of Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and Carboplatin in patients with previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not amenable to radiotherapy or surgical treatment.
