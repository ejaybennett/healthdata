(secondQuint)Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

 A Safety Study.

 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a common disorder in the infancy; the majority of ADHD have good clinical response to amphetamines alone or in association with antiepileptic drugs.

 It is described that some patients(10-30%) with ADHD do not respond to conventional pharmacological and psycho- pedagogical treatment; in those patients non invasive brain stimulation methods could be a supplementary option for symptomatic control.

 There are not many published papers describing the effects of rTMS in persons younger than 18 years; so the first step to extent its use in pediatric population should be to obtain evidences about its tolerance and safety.

 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

 A Safety Study@highlight

Low frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation(rTMS) is a safe and tolerable procedure in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD); it also could be a complement to the treatment of patients with poor symptomatic control to conventional treatment.
