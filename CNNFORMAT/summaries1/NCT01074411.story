(fifthQuint)Intraperitoneal Bortezomib and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of intraperitoneal (IP) bortezomib (BTZ) when administered with intraperitoneal carboplatin in women with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that is persistent or recurrent and who have failed primary therapy and at least one second-line therapy.

 II.

 To examine the safety of administering BTZ in combination with carboplatin by the IP route.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To estimate objective tumor response rate as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.

1 criteria.

 II.

 To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BTZ and carboplatin when administered intraperitoneally once every 21 days.

 III.

 To characterize the frequency of carboplatin hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) when administered as an intraperitoneal infusion in the context of recurrent ovarian cancer.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

 Patients receive bortezomib intraperitoneally (IP) and carboplatin IP on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.

 Intraperitoneal Bortezomib and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of intraperitoneal bortezomib when given together with intraperitoneal carboplatin in treating patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that is persistent or has come back.

 Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Bortezomib may help carboplatin work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

 Infusing bortezomib and carboplatin directly into the abdomen (intraperitoneal) may kill more tumor cells.
