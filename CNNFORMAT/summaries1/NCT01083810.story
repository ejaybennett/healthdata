(firstQuint)Evaluation of Kaletra Therapy Over the Long-term.

 Three to five year observation of lopinavir/ritonavir therapy.

 Reporting groups are 1) therapy-naive patients (144 weeks), 2) therapy-experienced but protease inhibitor naive patients (240 weeks,) and 3) non-B subtype infected patients (240 weeks).

 These three groups of participants with HIV-1 infection were at first registered as three different studies: KAL1RO (this study, NCT01083810, n=137), KAL2RO /KAL5RO (NCT01083836, n=92), and KAL6RO (NCT01081470, n=55) but were now reconciled under KAL1RO (NCT01083810) as a single study with three reporting groups.
