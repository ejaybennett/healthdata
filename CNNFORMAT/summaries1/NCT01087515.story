(thirdQuint)Pilot Study for Cell Based Therapies in Patients With Asthma.

 pDCs as well as TREGs will be co-incubated with generated allergen presenting cells, lymphocytes, and allergen.

 For in vitro experimentation immune cells will be collected from blood of grass mix or house dust mite sensitized atopic/asthmatic patients.

 Pilot Study for Cell Based Therapies in Patients With Asthma@highlight

The aim of this study is to investigate the immunomodulatory potential of Isolated Plasmacytoide Dendritic Cells (pDCs) and Regulatory T-cells (TREGs) isolated with clinical grade magnetic bead isolations techniques (MACS(R)) on the antigen presenting cell-induced proliferation of lymphocytes after allergen uptake in an in vitro cell culture system.
