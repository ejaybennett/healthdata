(firstQuint)Low Dose Versus Usual Dose Dexamethasone for Symptom Control in Children Undergoing Cranial or Craniospinal Radiation.

 Dexamethasone is an effective medication to ameliorate radiation induced headache and vomiting.

 In our Toronto experience dexamethasone in low doses (1 mg/m2/day) is sufficient in treating these symptoms.

 However this experience is not shared from many neuro-oncology centers of excellence that more commonly use 5 mg/m2/day according to the results of the trans-Canadian survey.

 A prospective multicenter trial evaluating the effectiveness of dexamethasone in different dose regimens in symptomatic children while undergoing CNS radiation will elucidate the appropriate dose.
