(secondQuint)Safety Study of Liver Natural Killer Cell Therapy for Hepatoma Liver Transplantation.

 To investigate whether adoptive transfer of IL-2 stimulated NKcells extracted from cadaveric donor liver graft exudates into recipient with HCC will lead to prevent recurrence of HCC after liver transplantation.

 The method we plan to use is to collect NK cells from the cadaveric donor liver perfusate at the time of organ recovery.

 The perfusate will be condensed by centrifuging and liver mononuclear cells (LMNC) were isolated by gradient centrifugation.

 LMNC will be cultured with anti-CD3 antibody.

 LMNC will be separted into a CD3-/CD56+ NK cell fraction and a non-NK cell fraction.

 The purity of isolated fractions will be assessed by Flow cytometric analyses.

 NK cells will be cultured with human recombinant IL-2 in 10% RPMI at 37 C in a 5% CO2 incubator.

 NK cells will be infused intravenously to the recipient with HCC who have liver transplant from the same cadaveric donor at post operative day 4 in attempt to prevent the metastasis and recurrence of HCC.

The objective of this study is to evaluate feasibility and safety of the adoptive transfer of activated natural killer (NK) cells extracted from cadaveric donor liver graft perfusate for liver transplant recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
