(firstQuint)Study for the Use of Alteplase in Patients Who Awaken With Stroke.

 Patients with ischemic stroke are currently only eligible for the treatment with intravenous thrombolysis if the stroke is diagnosed within 4.

5 hours from known onset of symptoms.

 Many patients awaken with stroke and are excluded from this therapy, following current guidelines.

 Patients who suffer from a stroke just before or after waking up may be candidates for thrombolysis and our study will use advanced neuroimaging to select those patients.
