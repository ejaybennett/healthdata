(thirdQuint)Effects of Levetiracetam (Keppra) on Alcohol Consumption.

 The investigators propose a 42-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in light to moderate and heavy alcohol users who are social drinkers.

 The specific aims are to: 1.

 Determine if levetiracetam alters daily alcohol consumption by comparing the mean drinks consumed per day during levetiracetam administration compared with the mean drinks per day consumed during placebo administration.

 2.

 Obtain blood that will be banked for future genetic analysis of polymorphisms in genes that may predict the level of response to alcohol or effects of levetiracetam on alcohol consumption.

 3.

 Test whether the AccuswayTM platform can detect changes in body sway in light to moderate or heavy social drinkers and in subjects taking levetiracetam versus placebo.

The overall goals of this study are to (1) expand knowledge about interactions of levetiracetam with alcohol by assessing the effects of levetiracetam compared to placebo in moderate and heavy social alcohol users and (2) to test the AccuswayTM platform as a tool to measure postural control (which has been used as a marker of intoxication) and the effects of levetiracetam on postural control.
