(firstQuint)Oral Contraceptives and Body Mass Index.

 This study is being conducted to understand how effective oral hormonal birth control (the pill) is for women with high body mass index ("BMI" - the ratio of your height and weight BMI").

 Previous studies of birth control traditionally do not include women above a certain BMI number, so safety and efficacy is not clearly understood in this population, yet the pill is still widely used in women with high BMI.

 Reproductive-aged, ovulatory women of obese (BMI >30 kg/m2), will be placed on oral contraceptives for 2 months, then randomized into two intervention arms for an additional 2 months.

 At several key time points, synthetic steroid pharmacokinetics, gonadotropins (LH, FSH) and ovarian hormone levels (estradiol, progesterone), ovarian follicular activity by ultrasound monitoring, and cervical mucus testing will be monitored.

 Oral Contraceptives and Body Mass Index@highlight

The main hypothesis for this study is that increased Body Mass Index (BMI) alters oral contraceptive metabolism in a manner which results in decreased effectiveness in obese women.
