(fifthQuint)Neurobehavioral Functioning in Pediatric Brain Tumor Patients After Proton Beam Radiation Treatment.

 The purpose of this study is to longitudinally examine neurobehavioral functioning outcomes and use of special education services in brain tumor and CNS tumor patients treated with proton radiation at MGH.

 Furthermore, we seek to correlate neurobehavioral data with pertinent clinical information.

 We anticipate better neurobehavioral functioning to be associated with use of protons (vs.

 photons, as reported in the literature).

 We also anticipate the need and utilization of special education services to be lower in brain and CNS tumor patients treated with protons (vs.

 photons, as reported in the literature).

 Lastly, we anticipate greater neurobehavioral deficits in patients whose proton radiation treatment involved the craniospinal axis compared to those who received proton radiation to the involved field.

 Neurobehavioral Functioning in Pediatric Brain Tumor Patients After Proton Beam Radiation Treatment@highlight

The aim of this study is to follow up with all of the pediatric brain tumor patients who received proton beam radiation therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for which there is baseline neuropsychological testing in order to measure changes, if any, in neurobehavioral functioning (executive skills, emotional/behavioral functioning, and adaptive abilities) and their use of special education services at one year or more post-treatment.

 The investigators will also correlate neurobehavioral data with pertinent clinical information.

 Participation will be maximized through the use of mail-in, parental- and self-report questionnaires.
