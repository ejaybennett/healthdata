(thirdQuint)Wheatgrass Juice / Lifestyle Recommendations / Cancer Patients' Quality of Life / Chemotherapy Treatment.

 Chemotherapy-naive patients will be offered to participate in a two arms study.

 Following consent, patients will be randomized to one of two arms.

 Patients in both arms will be provided by booklet and audio-cassette that specify lifestyle recommendations (diet, physical activity and breathing exercises).

 Patients in one of the study arms will be provided in addition with frozen wheatgrass juice (recommended daily dosage of 55-110 CC daily).

 Patients in both arms will be asked to fill in a daily patient's diary monitoring the practice of the lifestyle recommendations.

 Baseline assessment will include the following questionnaires: ESAS, MYCAW, FACIT- Fatigue.

 Evaluation will include weekly ESAS and FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire and subsequent evaluation (including ESAS, MYCAW, FACIT- Fatigue questionnaires) following 3 and 4 chemotherapy cycles of treatment.

 Follow-up evaluation will be performed at the completion of chemotherapy.

 Wheatgrass Juice / Lifestyle Recommendations / Cancer Patients' Quality of Life / Chemotherapy Treatment@highlight

This study is aimed to study the impact of wheatgrass juice and lifestyle recommendations (diet, physical activity and breathing exercises) on the well being, fatigue and hematological parameters of chemotherapy-naive patients with no evidence for symptoms of active oncological disease.

The researchers hypothesize that both wheatgrass juice and lifestyle recommendations can improve patient's well-being during chemotherapy.
