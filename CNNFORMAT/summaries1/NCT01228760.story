 The first aims to establish a safe dose of ASG-5ME.

 Once identified, the safety and preliminary estimate of antitumor activity of ASG-5ME will be tested in additional subjects with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who are either chemotherapy naive or chemotherapy exposed in expanded cohorts.
