(fifthQuint)Study Targeting Affect Regulation.

 In the multi-component intervention protocol, participants will complete expressive writing exercises where they will be asked to write about difficult life experiences.

 Following expressive writing, participants will receive stress management skills training to assist them with managing any acute increases in distress that arise from the writing experience.

 Participants in the attention-control condition will write about neutral topics and complete psychological measures.

 The overarching goals of this Phase Ib RCT will be to: 1) examine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and attention-control; and 2) determine whether intervention participants report reductions in traumatic stress symptoms over the 3 months following randomization.

 Findings from this Phase Ib trial will inform our efforts to implement a more definitive RCT of this intervention with HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using MSM.

 Study Targeting Affect Regulation@highlight

This Phase Ib pilot RCT will examine the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of a multi-component intervention to address traumatic stress symptoms among HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM).

 Following a baseline assessment, 56 participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) a 7-session intervention to address traumatic stress related to living with HIV/AIDS; or 2) a 7-session, attention-control condition.

 Follow-up assessments will be administered at 1 and 3 months post-randomization.
