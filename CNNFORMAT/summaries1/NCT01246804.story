(secondQuint)The Influence of GINkGo Biloba on the Pharmacokinetics of the UGT Substrate raltEgraviR (GINGER).

 Ginkgo biloba is an alternative medicine that is popular among HIV-infected patients because if its claimed positive effects on memory, concentration and depression.

 Alternative medicine can cause drug-drug interactions with regular HIV-medication.

 Raltegravir is a newly developed HIV integrase inhibitor.

 It is metabolized in the liver by UGT1A1 and therefore its pharmacokinetic profile can be influenced by inhibitors or inducers of UGT1A1.

 So far there are no data of the potential effect of ginkgo biloba on glucuronidation in vivo.

 The current study is designed to evaluate the potential inductive effect of ginkgo biloba on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir and the safety profile when used in combination.

 The Influence of GINkGo Biloba on the Pharmacokinetics of the UGT Substrate raltEgraviR (GINGER)@highlight

The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of ginkgo biloba (steady state) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of the UGT-substrate raltegravir.

 Furthermore the safety profile of the combination is studied.
