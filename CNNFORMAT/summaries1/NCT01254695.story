(fifthQuint)Improving the Efficacy of Sacral Nerve Stimulation for Fecal Incontinence by Alteration of Stimulation Parameters.

 Faecal incontinence is a devastating condition affecting daily living and has major influences on quality of life.

 Faecal incontinence affects 2,2 to 5 % of the adult population.

 The magnitude of the problem is probably underestimated, because most patients don't discuss this affliction with their general practitioner.

 A new treatment, SNS has over the last decade given new hope to these patients.

 But a group of these patients has minor effect of the treatment - despite a satisfactory test-stimulation period.

 This study aims to identify optimal stimulation parameters that will improve patient continence and quality of life.

 Four different stimulation parameters will be tested through a double blind, randomized crossover study - standard stimulation parameters (frequency: 14 Hz, pulse width 210 microsec.

) will serve as control stimulation.

 The study includes five arms that will be tested in a randomized order.

 Each arm will be tested for four weeks in which the patient fill in bowel habit diaries and standardized questionnaires.

 The first week in each period will not be evaluated - is serves as a wash-out period.

 Before any pacemaker changes anorectal manometry and rectal filling tests will be performed.

 Improving the Efficacy of Sacral Nerve Stimulation for Fecal Incontinence by Alteration of Stimulation Parameters@highlight

Faecal incontinence is a devastating condition affecting 2,2 to 5 % of the adult population.

 The magnitude of the problem is probably underestimated.

 Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS), has over the last decade given hope to patient failing conservative treatment.

 Some patient do not have optimal continence after SNS-therapy.

 This study aims to identify optimal stimulation parameters - that will improve the functional outcome of SNS-therapy thru a double blinded randomized cross-over study.
