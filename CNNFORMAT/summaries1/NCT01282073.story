(thirdQuint)Mycophenolate Mofetil in Patients With Progressive Idiopathic Membranous Nephropathy.

 Idiopathic membranous nephropathy is most common cause of glomerulonephritis in adults.

 Persistent high grade proteinuria or progressively decrease of renal function is a risk factor for end stage renal disease in idiopathic membranous nephropathy.

 It has been reported that cyclosporin in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy decreases proteinuria and improve renal function.

 Mycophenolate mofetil is a recently developed immunosuppressive agent with fewer side effect than cyclosporin.

 In this study patients with high risk group of progressive idiopathic membranous nephropathy will be treated with mycophenolate mofetil and low dose prednisone.

 The outcome will be compared to controls treated with cyclosporin and low dose prednisone.

 Mycophenolate Mofetil in Patients With Progressive Idiopathic Membranous Nephropathy@highlight

Cyclosporin decreases proteinuria and improve renal function in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy, but has a risk of side effects such as nephrotoxicity.

 The investigators plan to the study to evaluate whether mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) could be a reasonable alternative with fewer side effect.
