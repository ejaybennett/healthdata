(firstQuint)Reflux in Spinal Cord Injury Patients With Neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction.

 Vesico-ureteral reflux was the main cause for renal failure and reduced life expectancy in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction due to spinal cord injury.

 Neurogenic detrusor overactivity leads to high intravesical pressure and may induce reflux.

 Decreasing intravesical pressure and increasing bladder capacity is necessary to prevent reflux and secondary renal failure.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence of reflux in patients with spinal cord injury in relation to the lesion level, duration of injury and bladder management
