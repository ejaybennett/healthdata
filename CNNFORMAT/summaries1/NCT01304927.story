(fifthQuint)Vitamin D Supplementation and Male Infertility: The CBG-study a Randomized Clinical Trial.

 Background In 2008, approximately 8% of all newborn children were conceived by assisted reproduction.

 Intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI) accounts for ~50% of all treatments and is mainly used in cases of severely reduced semen quality.

 This is in many cases most likely caused by prenatal factors adversely affecting the developing testicles, and it is therefore unlikely that any treatment of adult men will be able to completely normalize their semen quality.

 However, less would also be clinically relevant.

 If reduced semen quality could be improved prior to any assisted reproduction a less invasive treatment would be needed.

 Eg.

 classical in vitro fertilization (IVF) rather than ICSI, simple intrauterine insemination (IUI) rather than IVF or natural conception rather than IUI.

 Several endocrine factors have been implicated in sperm production and maturation, but little is known about the potential role of VD.

 VD is a key regulator of calcium homeostasis and bone mineralization, although expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in various tissues has been related to several diverse actions.

 VD affects reproduction in several animal species, convincingly shown in rodents, where VD deficiency in male rats resulted in reduced sperm counts, and female rats inseminated with semen from VD deficient male rats had lower fertility rates.

 The impaired reproductive performance is reversible and can be corrected either by supplying VD or by normalizing calcium levels.

 Supported by VDR knockout mice, which showed decreased sperm counts, reduced sperm motility and histological abnormalities of the testis, which unlike the VD deficient male rats only partly can be restored by calcium supplements.

 The investigators have recently shown expression of VDR and the VD metabolizing enzymes in the human testis, ejaculatory tract and in mature spermatozoa.

 The investigators subsequently showed that VD in physiological concentrations increased intracellular calcium in spermatozoa.

 VD acts through a rapid non-genomic response and the VD induced increase in calcium may be crucial for the spermatozoa, because VD induced sperm motility and the acrosome reaction.

 Expression analysis of spermatozoa from fertile and infertile men showed that men with impaired semen quality have fewer that can metabolize VD than normal men(p 30 etc.

), tertiles/quartiles/quintiles or highest/lowest versus remaining at baseline.

 Data analysis for comparison of changes in vitamin D and calcium We will also compare the dose-response relationships between changes in vitamin D and calcium and primary and secondary endpoints between placebo and active substance group and in all men.

 We will determine delta values for circulating vitamin D progenitors, calcium ion, total calcium and albumin corrected calcium from start to 90 days and 150 days and compare the difference with the observed changes in primary and secondary endpoints.

 We anticipate that there is no difference in shapes of the dose-response curve between the different endpoints i.

e.

 they will be parallel and linear at least after transformation of the data.

 Afterwards, the same analysis will be conducted by using relevant confounders such as season, BMI, smoking, duration of abstinence, time from ejaculation to motility assessment etc.

 to see if this changes the results.

 SCREENING AND TIME COURSE Men, who are investigated at dept.

 of GR due to infertility will be screened for eligibility to the study, and those who meet the criteria for participation will be informed, and if they consent allocated to active treatment with VD or placebo.

 Allocation will be done by minimization using minim to avoid unbalanced grouping due to randomization failure.

 Following variables will be balanced: Sperm concentration, BMI, serum inhibin-B, and VD level.

 ETHICS AND SIDE EFFECTS All the patients will have fulfilled their investigation, before they are invited to the study.

 They will be informed of potential adverse effects, signs of intoxication and they can leave the trial at any point without any consequences.

 The trial will run in accordance with "good clinical practice".

 VD treatment gives virtually no side effects and the risk of intoxication is almost nonexisting in the suggested setting, with relatively low doses of VD and close monitoring of VD and calcium status.

 The participants will be exposed to oral VC/placebo, to 2 DXA scans, have 3 extra blood samples drawn and deliver 2 extra semen samples.

 All participants will be informed and counseling according to their VD status.

 PUBLICATION OF RESULTS All results, positive or negative will be submitted to peer reviewed scientific journals.

 Data will successively be obtained and transferred to a statistical database.

 PRACTICAL ISSUES Dept.

 of GR investigates annually more than 500 infertile men.

 Participants will be included from that group.

 The department have the clinical expertise, experience and capacity to perform all the investigations, except for the measurements of some of the blood samples, which will be analyzed by department of clinical biochemistry.

 VD and placebo oral suspensions are purchased from Glostrup apotek, while VD and placebo tablets are purchased from Ferrosan, MD Martin.

 The investigators are collaborating with associate professor in biostatistics J.

 Vitamin D Supplementation and Male Infertility: The CBG-study a Randomized Clinical Trial@highlight

Today, it is evident that vitamin D (VD) has more widespread effects than the classical actions related to bone mineralization and calcium homeostasis1.

 VD deficiency results in impaired reproductive performance in various species of animals, and recently the investigators have shown that the VD receptor (VDR), activating (CYP2R1, CYP27A1, CYP27B1) and inactivating (CYP24A1) enzymes are expressed in the human testis, epididymis, seminal vesicle, prostate and spermatozoa.

 Our following functional studies showed that VD increases intracellular calcium in mature spermatozoa, and hence may be important not only for spermatogenesis but also for sperm maturation.

 A new, and yet unpublished cross sectional study of 300 young healthy Danish men showed that men with lower levels of serum VD have significantly lower number of normally developed and motile spermatozoa.

 Hitherto, most cases of male infertility have been classified as "idiopathic", and infertile couples have been referred to symptomatic treatment at infertility clinics.

 These fertility treatments are often physically demanding for the female partner as well as expensive for the health care system.

 Any treatment that might improve semen quality of involuntary infertile men would be beneficial both for the infertile couples and the society in general.

 Our findings that VD may play a role for human semen quality have not yet been tested clinically.

 However, if VD supplementation proves efficient this opens for the first time for a causal, safe and cheap treatment of at least some cases of "idiopathic" impaired semen quality.

 The investigators believe our new human data supported by the results from the VD deficient and VDR KO animal studies and the high proportion of VD deficient Danish men provide sufficient evidence to initiate a randomized clinical trial of VD supplementation to infertile men.

 Infertile men have also have unfavorable altered levels of sex hormones and higher mortality than fertile men.

 Since VD deficiency is associated with increased mortality, regulation of aromatase, immune system, bone metabolism, glucose metabolism, cardiovascular system etc.

 our suggested clinical trial may also be able to evaluate several secondary endpoints in addition to the potential effect on semen quality.
