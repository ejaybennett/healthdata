(thirdQuint)The Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Unique and the Air-Q Intubating Laryngeal Airway (ILA) in Pediatric Patients.

 The goal for this randomized, crossover investigation is to compare a disposable version of the standard LMA, LMA Unique TM,with the air-Q ILA in pediatric patients.

 Oropharyngeal leak pressure is commonly used as an indicator of airway seal adequacy.

 Similarly, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope examination is often employed to assess proper placement of airway devices.

 Our hypothesis is that the air-Q ILA is superior to the standard LMA in both these regards: 1.

 We hypothesize that airway leak pressures will be higher with the ILA.

 Airway leak pressures will be measured by recording the circuit pressure at which an equilibrium is reached.

 2.

 We hypothesize that flexible fiberoptic view of the airway will be superior with the ILA.

 The airway view will be assessed using a previously used and published grading scale.

 The Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Unique and the Air-Q Intubating Laryngeal Airway (ILA) in Pediatric Patients@highlight

The air-Q(R) intubating laryngeal airway (ILA) is an supraglottic device used for both airway maintenance during routine anesthesia and as a conduit for tracheal intubation for patients with a difficult airway.

 The investigators goal for this study is to compare the performance of the ILA with the current standard of care the standard LMA during routine anesthesia.
