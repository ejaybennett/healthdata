v.

) Doses of Catumaxomab in Epithelial Cancer Patients.

 Epithelial cancer patients who are progressing on or after standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists.

 Catumaxomab (trifunctional anti-EpCAM x anti-CD3 antibody)Catumaxomab will be administered i.

v.

 once weekly (qwk) with each infusion lasting for 6 hours.

 The starting dose for catumaxomab will be 2 mu g.

 The dose escalation schedule is based on a Modified Fibonacci Schedule with the following dose cohorts: 2 mu g, 4 mu g, 7 mu g, 10 mu g, 14 mu g and 19 mu g qwk corresponding to dose increments of 100%, 75%, 43%, 40% and 36% respectively of the previous dose.

 Subsequent dose levels will correspond to dosing increments of about 30%, e.

g.

 25, 33, 43, 56 mu g.

 After completion of the DLT period, all patients will be offered continuation of catumaxomab treatment at the same dose until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first.

 The maximum length of treatment, however, will be restricted to an additional 12 weeks after the DLT period - resulting in a maximum treatment duration of 16 weeks total.

The study is designed as an open-label dose-escalation study to investigate the safety and tolerability of catumaxomab qwk in patients with epithelial cancer.

 The treatment period for dose escalation (dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period) consists of 4 weeks, comprising 4 single i.

 administrations of catumaxomab followed by 1 week for safety observations after each administration.

 All patients will be offered continuation of catumaxomab treatment at the same dose until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first.
