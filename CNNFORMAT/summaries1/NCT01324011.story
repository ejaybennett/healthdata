(fifthQuint)Family PALS (PArtners in Lifestyle Support).

 Type 2 diabetes disproportionately burdens African Americans, and already excessive rates of diabetes are expected to increase even further as rates of obesity rise.

 While there is evidence that diabetes self-management training is effective in improving metabolic control, and modest weight loss can delay the onset of diabetes, the investigators have limited knowledge of the best approach to self-management training from a family perspective in high risk groups such as African Americans.

 Family remains a valued dimension of African American life and may be an important behavioral context for interventions to improve disease management and health outcomes.

 Nonetheless, there are no trials of family-based interventions to improve diabetes self-care and achieve weight loss that have involved adult families.

 Participants: A total of 80 pairs (index participant + family member) or 160 adults will participate in this trial where a 20-session behavioral weight loss intervention will be tested.

 Participants include overweight or obese African Americans with type 2 diabetes and a paired co-participant identified as an overweight or obese adult family member without type 2 diabetes.

 Family members may self-describe as non-African Americans.

 Procedures (methods): Study participants will be enrolled in a randomized controlled trial using a 2:1 random allocation to the special intervention (a 20-session family-based behavioral weight loss intervention) or a usual care group (controls).

 Following the trial, participants in the usual care group will receive a 6-session weight management intervention (over a 2-month period) based on the 20-session special intervention.

NOTE: This study is in the trial-phase of a 5-year study that included a formative research phase (Phase 1 - IRB study # 07-1765 "Family-based Diabetes Self-management Training for African American Adults").

 During the first phase, eight focus groups were conducted with 68 participants and a validation study with 215 African American patients with type 2 diabetes.

 The data gathered in Phase 1 informs the refinement of the intervention in this phase.

 Purpose: The overall goal of this research is to evaluate, in a randomized controlled trial, a family-based diabetes self-management intervention for overweight/obese African American adults with type 2 diabetes (the "index participants") and a paired overweight family member (co-participant) who does not have diabetes.

 The primary outcome is weight change in the index participant.
