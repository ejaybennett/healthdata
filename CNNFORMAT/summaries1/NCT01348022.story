(secondQuint)Evaluation of Outcomes of EES Implantation for Unprotected Left Main Coronary Artery Stenosis (PRE-COMBAT 2).

 The primary objective of the PRECOMBAT-2 trial is to establish the safety and effectiveness of coronary stenting with the everolimus-eluting Xience V stent (EES) compared with the historical control (PRE-COMBAT-1) of bypass surgery and sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) for the treatment of an unprotected LMCA stenosis.

 The primary alternative hypothesis is that the experimental starategy (coronary stenting with the everolimus-eluting stents) is not inferior to the standard strategy (CABG) or SES.

 All consecutive patients with unprotected LMCA diseases at participating centers, who are treated with Xience V stent, will be evaluated for the entry into the study.

This study is a multicenter, open label, prospective, single arm trial Single arm group; following angiography, eligible patients with unprotected LMCA stenosis >50% by visual estimation, which is equally treatable by the both treatment strategy (EES stenting or CABG), will be treated with EES
