(thirdQuint)A Study of 5-Azacitidine (Vidaza) in Patients With Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia.

 In this study, eligible patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CMML will be treated with 5-azacitidine to determine the rates of complete hematologic response, hematologic improvement, complete and partial cytogenetic response, and overall and progression free survival.

 To develop biomarkers associated with response and gain insights into the mechanisms that determine response, gene expression profiling, genome-wide SNP array analysis, microRNA analysis, and DNA methylation analysis will be performed prior to therapy and at defined time points during the study.

 Phosphoproteomics profiling may be included in the analysis.
