(secondQuint)CHFR Methylation Status Esophageal Cancer Study.

 Primary Objectives cent To determine the rate of pathological complete response when the inclusion of paclitaxel in neoadjuvant therapy is based on the presence or absence of CHFR methylation in diagnostic biopsy specimens.

 Secondary Objectives - To determine the survival outcome with this treatment strategy.

 - To determine time to disease progression with this treatment strategy.

 - To determine the agreement between tumor CHFR methylation and detection in plasma.
