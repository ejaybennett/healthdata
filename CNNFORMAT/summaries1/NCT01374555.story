(secondQuint)Evaluation of the CardioSond Electronic Stethoscope in the Detection of Coronary Artery Disease.

 The CardioSond is a noninvasive medical device which detects heart sounds using ultrasensitive acoustic technology.

 The CardioSond produces a flow micro bruit score which is used to determine the likelihood of coronary artery disease.

 The CardioSond exam will be given to patients two times: once prior to administration of vasodilators and potential beta blockade agents as part of the normal cardiac CT angiography protocol and again immediately post CT angiography.

 No other data will be taken on the patient and the patients involvement in the study will cease after data collection.

 CT angiography data will be analyzed at a core lab at Medstar Research Institute and withheld from SonoMedica until all CardioSond acoustic data is analyzed and flow micro bruit scores are determined.

 A data review panel lead by the principal investigator will examine the results of both the CardioSond and CT angiography data to determine the comparative accuracy of the CardioSond in detecting CAD in the study population.

 Evaluation of the CardioSond Electronic Stethoscope in the Detection of Coronary Artery Disease@highlight

The study is designed to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the CardioSond digital electronic stethoscope in the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with and without known disease who are referred to cardiac computed tomography angiography (CT scans).
