(thirdQuint)Erythropoietin and Platelet Activation Markers.

 Introduction: Erythropoietin (EPO) enhances formation of red blood cells and also affects thrombopoiesis and platelet function.

 We hypothesized that the effect of erythropoietin may be reflected by changes in thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and endothelial cell function.

 Methods: Six male and six female subjects received recombinant human epoetin alpha (Erypo(R)) intravenously (300 Units per kg).

 Biomarker levels were assessed at baseline and 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours after administration.

 Results: Epoetin alpha increased TXB2 levels, which reached significance at 48h (2.

5- fold increase: 6.

65ng/mL vs.

 159ng/mL; p=0.

044) and remained at that level at 72h.

 In line, epoetin alpha increased E-selectin levels by 25% already at 24h (3921ng/ml vs.

 4926ng/ml; p17G/L vs.

 4310G/L; p45G/L vs.

 24452G/L; p=0.

005).

 Thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor concentrations were not significantly altered by epoetin alpha.

 Interestingly, gender differences in the baseline levels of E-selectin and thrombomodulin were observed.

 E-selectin and thrombomodulin levels were doubled in men compared to women (5124ng/mL and 2810ng/mL; p=0.

025 and 305ng/mL vs.

 165ng/mL; p=0.

002, respectively).

 Conclusion: Epoetin alpha increases levels of platelet activation markers.

 Further studies are needed to investigate whether measurement of TXB2 or E-selectin levels might be useful for estimation of thromboembolic risk during EPO-therapy.
