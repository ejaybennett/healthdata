(secondQuint)Sorafenib in First-line Treatment of Advanced B Child Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third cause of death for cancer in the world with an increasing incidence.

 No systemic therapy has proven effective in patients with advanced HCC until 2007, when results of the SHARP trial were presented.

 In this trial, the orally active multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib (800 mg/day) significantly prolonged survival compared with placebo in patients with advanced HCC and good liver function (Child A).

 The same authors concluded that the effect of the drug in the population of patients with more impaired liver function should be further studied.
