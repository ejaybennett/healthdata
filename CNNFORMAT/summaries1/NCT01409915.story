(firstQuint)Study of the Safety & Efficacy of Leukine in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.

 Preliminary preclinical results demonstrated that GM-CSF (Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, e.

g.

 Leukine(R)/Sargramostim) rapidly reduced cerebral amyloid deposition and completely reversed memory deficits in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

 To assess the efficacy of GM-CSF in humans, the investigators performed a retrospective analysis of a cognition study of human patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation for cancer and who garner cognitive impairments from the chemotherapy or irradiation.

 In the patients that received a colony-stimulating factor (CSF) to stimulate the bone marrow and recover immune system function, the investigators found that those who received GM-CSF (Leukine(R)/Sargramostim) plus G-CSF (Filigrastim) significantly improved in cognitive function as compared to those who received G-CSF alone.

 These findings combined with over two decades of accrued safety data using recombinant human GM-CSF, Leukine(R)/Sargramostim, in elderly leukopenic patients, suggested that Leukine(R) should be tested as a treatment to reverse cerebral amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment in AD.

A medicine that is FDA-approved for bone marrow stimulation (called Leukine) will be tested for its ability to be tolerated by Alzheimer's disease patients and potentially to improve their memory.
