(secondQuint)Safety Study of Gene Therapy for Ischemic Heart Disease in Korea.

 All the patients expected to undergo Coronary Artery Bypass Graft will screen for the participation in the clinical study.

 Subjects who signed the informed consent will receive all the screening tests within 21 days before surgery (Day 0).

 VM202RY will be injected into 4 sites or 8 sites on the coronary artery where complete revascularization was not done since vascular anastomosis could not be performed due to the bad vascular condition during surgery.

 VM202RY will be administered to Group1 (0.

5mg), Group 2 (1mg) and Group 3 (2mg) at different concentrations.

 Subjects will be scheduled to get inpatient treatment during the gene therapy period (7 days) and follow-up tests at Week 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 based on surgery day (Day 0).

 Adverse events and concomitant drugs will be checked.
