(fifthQuint)Computer-assisted Psychosocial Risk Assessment (CaPRA) for Refugee Health and Settlement.

 The recent waves of refugees to Canada belong to regions of prolonged conflict and, thus arrive in compromised state of mental, physical, and social health.

 This complexity asks for provision of integrated medical and social care to newly arrived refugees.

 With this aim, a university-community initiative developed a Computer-assisted Psychosocial Risk Assessment tool (CaPRA) in Dari/Farsi for Afghan refugees.

 This innovative eHealth approach is first of its kind for Canadian refugees accessing primary care.

 In this model of care, patients complete an interactive multi-risk iPad computer survey in their own language before seeing the provider.

 The computer then generates individualized recommendation sheet for patients and a risk-report for providers at the point of care.

 The tool was developed through a collaborative process by working with Access Alliance Multicultural Health and Community Services and advisory board with community representatives.

The purpose of this study was to examine preliminary effect of Computer-assisted Psychosocial Risk Assessment tool (CaPRA) among Afghan refugees visiting medical professionals (family physicians or nurse practitioners) at a Community Health Center.

 The investigators examined the tool's acceptability among patients and its impact on patient satisfaction and patient intention to visit a psychosocial counselor as a proxy of potential to integrate medical and social care.
