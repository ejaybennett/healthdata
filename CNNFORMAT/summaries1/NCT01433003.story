(fifthQuint)The Plasma Large-Volume Exchange RCT.

 Background: Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura / haemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) is a rare blood disorder with a high mortality rate of >95% when left untreated.

 In 1991, researchers discovered that treating TTP/HUS with plasma exchange vs.

 plasma infusion dramatically improved the survival rate, from 60% to 80%.

The optimal plasma dose for treating TTP/HUS is unknown; however, recent research suggests that high-dose plasma exchange may improve survival in patients with TTP/HUS.

 Hypothesis: Treatment of TTP/HUS with high-dose vs.

 standard-dose plasma exchange will significantly decrease the composite outcome of 1) treatment failure at day 5 and/or 2) non-response or death at 2 weeks.

 Methods: The investigators will conduct a multi-centre, parallel group randomized controlled trial.

 The investigators anticipate recruiting 150 eligible patients with idiopathic TTP/HUS from 9 centres across Canada over 2.

25 years.

 Patients will be randomized to receive high-dose plasma exchange (125 ml/kg/day up to 10 L/day plasma volume) or standard-dose plasma exchange (50-75 ml/kg/day; approximately 1-1.

5 plasma volume).

 The primary composite outcome includes treatment failure at day 5 or non-response or death from any cause at 2 weeks.

 Secondary outcomes include the individual components of the primary outcome, non-response or death from any cause at month 1 and month 6, days to remission, duration of hospital stay, number and volume of plasma exchange treatments, and cost minimization.

 Research Team: Our multi-centre team is part of the Canadian Apheresis Group, which was established in 1980 and currently operates in 30 centres across Canada.

 Collectively, the Canadian Apheresis Group treats 150 TTP/HUS patients each year.

 Our team includes experienced haematologists, nephrologists, epidemiologists and a biostatistician.

 The investigators have successfully collaborated on several projects and have an excellent publication record (>50 publications across more than 15 journals including the New England Journal of Medicine).

 Timeline and Budget: Because TTP/HUS is a relatively rare disorder (an orphan disease), the investigators will recruit patients over 2.

25 years from across Canada to achieve a sufficiently large sample size.

 A cost minimization study will be carried out in conjunction with the RCT to provide insight into potential costing.

 Future Directions: If the investigators can demonstrate that high-dose plasma exchange significantly improves the primary outcome, the investigators will pursue a multi-national collaboration with American, Chinese and European Centres to investigate other important outcomes including optimal dosing, cost-effectiveness and survival.

 Implications: This study has the potential to be the first major advancement in treating TTP/HUS in twenty years.

 The Plasma Large-Volume Exchange RCT@highlight

Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura / hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) is a rare, life-threatening disorder.

 TTP/HUS causes multiple blood clots to form, which prevents blood from reaching the brain and kidneys.

 TTP/HUS affects 3-5 people per million per year.

 Anyone can develop TTP/HUS, but it is most common among 30-40 year olds, and women are twice as likely as men to acquire the condition.

 TTP/HUS sometimes develops as a result of medication use, pregnancy or cancer; however, for the majority of patients (80%) the cause of TTP/HUS is unknown.

 In 1991, researchers discovered that plasma exchange was superior to plasma infusion in treating idiopathic TTP/HUS.

 During plasma exchange the patient's blood plasma is removed and replaced with healthy blood plasma.

 Without plasma exchange, the survival rate for TTP/HUS is extremely low, with fewer than 5% of patients surviving.

 Treating TTP/HUS with plasma exchange improved the survival rate to 80%.

 Although this represents a dramatic improvement, researchers are still searching for methods to improve survival.

 No major advances in treating TTP/HUS have occurred in the past 20 years.

 Recent research suggests that high-dose plasma exchange may improve the survival of TTP/HUS patients.

 The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to test whether treating TTP/HUS patients with high-dose versus standard-dose plasma exchange improves the treatment response.

 The investigators will recruit 150 patients with TTP/HUS from 9 centres across Canada over three years.

 The investigators will evaluate whether high-dose plasma exchange improves the treatment response, survival, and whether it reduces the number and volume of plasma exchange procedures and duration of hospital stay.
