(firstQuint)Safety Study of MM-121 in Combination With Multiple Anticancer Therapies in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 This study was a Phase 1 and pharmacologic dose-escalation trial of MM-121 in combination with certain anticancer therapies.

 The dose-escalation portion of the study employed a 3 + 3 design to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MM-121 administered weekly in combination with certain anticancer therapies in patients with advanced/recurrent cancer.

 Doses of MM-121 and/or the anticancer therapy were escalated until either the MTD is identified or the combination was shown to be tolerable at the highest planned doses.
