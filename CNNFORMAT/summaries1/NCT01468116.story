(secondQuint)The Effect of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Mitochondrial Function in Type 2 Diabetes.

 Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to development of insulin resistance in the muscle and hence to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

 Mitochondrial function can be studied non-invasively by 31 Phosphor Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (31PMRS).

 In this study we will investigate changes in mitochondrial function using the combination of 31 PMRS and Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) after gastric bypass.

 The Effect of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Mitochondrial Function in Type 2 Diabetes@highlight

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery induces resolution of type 2 diabetes, often within days after surgery and before significant weight loss.

 The aim of this study is to investigate whether changes in mitochondrial function contributes to the early improvement of type 2 diabetes after RYGB.
