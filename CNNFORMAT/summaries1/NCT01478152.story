(thirdQuint)Effect of Ectoin Inhalation Solution on Subjects With Mild Bronchial Asthma.

 Based on the anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled Ectoin(R) shown in previous animal studies, this trial aims to investigate the effects in terms of a reduction of the unspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to Methacholine challenge test on subjects with mild bronchial asthma.

 In addition, measurements of exhaled nitric oxide level as an indicator of bronchial inflammation will be investigated.

 This study will focus primarily on safety and dose finding in 12 to 18 subjects with mild bronchial asthma.

 After a screening visit, subjects will be treated with placebo, followed by increasing doses of Ectoin(R) (low, medium and high dose).

 All doses of Ectoin(R) inhalation solution and placebo will be administered for 5 - 7 days.
