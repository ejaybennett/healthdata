(thirdQuint)Exacerbation Prevention GOLD IV COPD With Non Invasive Mechanical Ventilation.

 Background: - There are many previous studies (no controlled trials or observational studies)that demonstrated minimal benefits (on gas exchange and marginal effect over exacerbations frequency) with the use of non invasive mechanical ventilation, in BiPAP modality with IPAP pressures 18cmH2O) specially on gas exchange, quality of life and functional status.

 - There are some issues that do not yet have a clear answer like the optimal inspiratory pressure (IPAP) or the ventilation modality (BIPAP or other) to obtain the maximal benefit on COPD patients.

 Additionally, is not clear also if the use of non invasive mechanical ventilation on COPD patients helps to reduce the frequency and severity of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD).

 This study have some characteristics that are different to the previous reports: - The inclusion of patients with frequent exacerbations phenotype (and therefore worst prognosis patients)that there are no included in previous trials - The intervention maneuver that is bilevel modality of non invasive mechanical ventilation at hig-intensity pressure (>18H2Ocm and <24H2Ocm) - The use of placebo maneuver (CPAP "Sham") - The home titration in three phases, over a week - The long-term use of the intervention and sham maneuver.

 Exacerbation Prevention GOLD IV COPD With Non Invasive Mechanical Ventilation@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of high-intensity non invasive mechanical ventilation (during one year to reduce the severity and frequency of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in patients with frequent AECOPD (frequent exacerbations defined more two or more AECOPD) and in GOLD IV stage (very severe COPD).

 The design is a randomised, double blind and controled with placebo (sham maneuver) clinical trial.
