(firstQuint)Observational Study of Baska Mask, a New Supraglottic Airway Device.

 Our group has performed a number of studies on novel airway devices.

 In this study we would like to evaluate a new supraglottic airway named Baska mask.

 We would like to monitor certain parameters (time to and ease of insertion, failure rate, seal pressures, complications etc) as regarding the performance and safety profile of this device.

 This is a descriptive case series of patients undergoing airway management under general anaesthesia.
