(thirdQuint)FUSION Regimen: Combined Pro re Nata and Fixed Regimen Ranibizumab in Exudative Age-related Macular Degeneration.

 This is a prospective, open-label, consecutive interventional case series in treatment-naive patients with exudative AMD.

 A loading phase of 2-3 injections is followed by a fixed-interval regimen of injections combined with a pro re nata regimen for 12 months.

 Endpoints include VA, presence of fluid at spectral domain optical coherent tomography (SD-OCT), adverse events and number of injections administered.

 FUSION Regimen: Combined Pro re Nata and Fixed Regimen Ranibizumab in Exudative Age-related Macular Degeneration@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of a combined fixed-interval and a pro re nata (PRN) regimens of ranibizumab (FUSION regimen) for the treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in patients with good visual acuity (VA) at baseline.

 To establish whether similar efficacy to monthly regimens can be achieved with fewer injections, even in patients with good VA.
