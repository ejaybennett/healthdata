(secondQuint)Study of a Diagnostic Device for Identifying Between Amniotic Fluid to Urine.

 Pregnant women sensing wetness and arriving to the delivery room with suspect PROM will use a self-testing device to test whether the wetness is caused by amniotic fluid leakage or urinary incontinence.

 Clinical evaluation will be performed to all pregnant women using standard clinical tests.

 The results of the standard clinical tests will be compared to the women's reading of the self-testing device results.

 Sensitivity and specificity of the device evaluation will be calculated.
