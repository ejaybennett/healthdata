(firstQuint)Comparison of Three Different No-contact Pachymetries.

 Corneal pachymetry is the measurement of corneal thickness, usually expressed in microns (1/2).

 Pachymetry is systematically used for the monitoring of corneal oedema, for the management and assessment of the progression risk of the ocular hypertension, for the diagnosis, the management and follow-up of keratoconus, as well as it is important in the pre and postoperative management of corneal surgical procedures.

 CCT is a factor well known to influence tonometry.

 Its assessment is fundamental in glaucoma practice to allow a correct intraocular pressure (IOP) evaluation.

 The purpose of this study is to compare CCT measurements using four different instruments: Scheimpflug camera tomography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), anterior chamber SD-OCT and ultrasound pachymetry.

 Comparison of Three Different No-contact Pachymetries@highlight

Study wants to compare central corneal thickness (CCT) obtained through 3 different no-contact instruments and to compare them with contact ultrasound pachymetry, actually the gold standard technique.
