(fifthQuint)Erlotinib Versus Pemetrexed as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma.

 Standard first-line treatment for advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) usually consists of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, but progression ultimately occurs for most patients.

 Second-line treatment options available to patients who suffer failure of first-line treatment include further chemotherapy (docetaxel and pemetrexed) or targeted therapy.

 Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) show great efficacy in patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation.

 High EGFR gene copy number was associated with great sensitivity and prolonged progression-free survival of NSCLC from EGFR-TKIs.

 This phase II study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of erlotinib compared with pemetrexed as second-line treatment for EGFR wild-type and EGFR FISH-positive lung adenocarcinoma.

 Erlotinib Versus Pemetrexed as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma@highlight

Both pemetrexed and erlotinib are second-line treatment options for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

 It is controversial that whether it is necessary to detect epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status for the EGFR-targeted therapy after the failure of standard chemotherapy.

 The role of EGFR gene copy number as a predictive marker remains controversial.

 Therefore, we investigate the efficacy of erlotinib and pemetrexed as second-line therapy in treating in patients with EGFR wild-type and EGFR FISH-positive advanced lung adenocarcinoma.
