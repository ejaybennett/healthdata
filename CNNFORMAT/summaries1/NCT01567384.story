(thirdQuint)A Phase I Study of OSI-906 in Combination With Pemetrexed in Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies.

 OSI-906 is a new agent that inhibits the insulin-like growth factor receptor pathway.

 Targeting this pathway appears to be a promising strategy to treat cancer based on laboratory studies.

 The present study will test if this agent can be administered safely in combination with pemetrexed, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent.

The purpose of the study is to test the safety of an experimental drug called OSI-906 when combined with pemetrexed at different dose levels and to find out the optimal doses of the two drugs that can be given as a combination.

 Pemetrexed has been widely used for treatment of certain solid organ tumors and is effective and approved for use in treatment of lung cancer and mesothelioma.
