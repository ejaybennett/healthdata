(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Gabapentin for Neuropathic Pain in Fabry Disease.

 Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder which results from reduced activity of the enzyme -galactosidase A.

 This reduced enzyme activity results in accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3), which causes disturbances in multiple organ systems.

 Patients often complain of acroparesthesia, caused by small-fiber neuropathy.

 Limited information is available regarding effective treatments for small-fiber neuropathic pain in Fabry disease, and no standard-of-care has yet been established.

 Opioid analgesics are often used because of their pharmacokinetic properties.

 While effective, the use of opioids has complications such as constipation, physical dependence and addiction.

 The purpose of this study is to determine efficacy of gabapentin vs.

 placebo at controlling peripheral neuropathic pain and reducing the use of opioid analgesics.

 The investigators are conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, single center, cross-over study.

 The primary endpoint is percent reduction in hydrocodone-acetaminophen use.

 placebo at controlling peripheral neuropathic pain in patients with Fabry disease, and reducing their use of opioid analgesics.
