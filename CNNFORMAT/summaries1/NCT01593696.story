(fifthQuint)Anti-CD19 White Blood Cells for Children and Young Adults With B Cell Leukemia or Lymphoma.

 Background: Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) that recognize the CD19 antigen have been constructed and are in clinical trials at several institutions.

 In this trial, the POB will utilize a chimeric receptor containing the signaling domains of CD28 and CD3-zeta, currently under study in the CCR in adults, for children and young adults with CD19 expressing malignancies.

 In co-cultures with CD19-expressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells show robust killing, and in xenograft models, can rapidly clear CD19- expressing ALL cell lines.

 Objectives: 1.

 Primary: To determine the safety and feasibility of administering escalating doses of anti-CD19-CAR engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes in two strata (prior allogeneic stem cell transplant [SCT] vs.

 no prior SCT) of children and young adults with B cell malignancies following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine preparative regimen.

 COMPLETED March 2014.

 2.

 Primary: To determine the safety of administering cells in two groups of children and young adults with B-cell malignancies expressing CD19: - Arm 1 - Patients without high-burden disease or patients for whom chemotherapy toxicity is a concern will receive standard preparative regimen.

 - Arm 2 - Patients with high-burden disease who receive standard chemotherapy to reduce burden, (defined as patients with ALL who have M3 bone marrow blasts and/or presence of peripheral blood blasts on routine CBC, or patients with lymphoma).

 3.

 Primary: To determine the feasibility of administering anti-CD19 CAR transduced T cells within 21 days of the target date in children and young adults with B-cell malignancies expressing CD19 enrolled on arm 2: Patients with high-burden disease who receive standard chemotherapy to reduce burden.

 1) Secondary: 1) To determine if the administration of anti-CD19-CAR engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes can mediate antitumor effects in children with B cell high-burden disease after standard chemotherapy, or in patients without high-burden disease who receive standard preparative regimen.

 2) To evaluate the ability of CRS treatment algorithm to reduce the incidence of Grade 4 Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) to less than or equal to 10% of patients.

 3) To measure persistence of adoptively-transferred anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells in the blood, bone marrow and CSF of patients.

 4) To describe the toxicity of administration of anti-CD19-CAR engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes in children and young adults with CNS disease.

 Eligibility: Patients 1-30 years of age, at least 15 kg, with a CD19-expressing B-cell malignancy that has recurred after or not responded to one or more standard chemotherapy-containing regimens for their malignancy and is deemed incurable by standard therapy.

 Patients with a history of allogeneic stem cell transplant who meet all eligibility criteria are eligible to participate.

 Design: - PBMC will be obtained by leukapheresis.

 Anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be manufactured from fresh or frozen PBMCs.

 On Day -7, PBMC will be enriched for CD3+ cells and cultured in the presence of anti-CD3/-CD28 beads followed by retroviral vector supernatant containing the anti-CD19 CAR.

 Total culture time is approximately 7-14 days.

 - Patients will be divided into the 2 groups listed above.

 Arm 1: Patients will begin preparative regimen comprising fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) on Days -4, -3 and -2 and cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m(2) on day -2.

 Arm 2: Patients with high-disease burden will be treated with intensive standard of care chemotherapy to decrease disease burden during cell manufacturing.

 - All patients: The CD19-CAR cells will be infused on Day 0, with up to a 72h delay allowed for fresh cells or a 21 day delay if cells are cryopreserved, if needed for resolution of clinical toxicities or to generate adequate cell numbers.

 - The previously determined maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 1 X 10(6) will be administered intravenously.

 - Patients will be monitored for toxicity, response and T cell persistence.

 Anti-CD19 White Blood Cells for Children and Young Adults With B Cell Leukemia or Lymphoma@highlight

Background: - Although progress has been made in treating children with B-cell cancers such as leukemia or lymphoma, many children do not respond to the standard treatments.

 One possible treatment involves collecting white blood cells called T cells from the person with cancer and modifying the cells to attack the B-cell cancer.

 The cells can then be given back to the participant.

 This study will use T cells that have been modified to attack the CD19 protein, which is found on the surface of some B-cell cancers.

 Objectives: - To see if anti-CD19 modified white blood cells are a safe and effective treatment for children and young adults with advanced B-cell cancer.

 Eligibility: - Children and young adults between 1 and 30 years of age who have B-cell cancer (leukemia or lymphoma) that has not responded to standard treatments.

 - The leukemia or the lymphoma must have the CD19 protein.

 - There must be adequate organ function.

 Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

 Blood and urine samples will be collected.

 Imaging studies or bone marrow biopsies may be performed depending on the type of cancer.

 - Participants will undergo a process where white blood cells are collected, called apheresis.

 These cells will be modified to contain the anti-CD19 gene.

 - Participants will have 3 days of chemotherapy to prepare their immune system to accept the modified cells.

 - Participants will receive an infusion of their own modified white blood cells.

 They will remain in the hospital until they have recovered from the treatment.

 - Participants will have frequent follow-up visits to monitor the outcome of the treatment.

 - If the participant benefits from the treatment, then he/she may have the option for another round of treatment.
