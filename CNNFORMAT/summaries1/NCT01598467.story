(firstQuint)Prospective Assessment of Robotic Sacrocolpopexy: a European Multicentric Cohort (PARSEC).

 To prospectively assess the outcomes of robotic sacrocolpopexy for repair of pelvic organ prolapse in high volume european centers.

 Primary outcome: anatomical cure rate (using simplified POP-Q staging system) Secondary outcomes: complication assessment (Clavien-Dindo), functional results, intraoperative variables, impact of surgery on quality of life (PFIQ-7, PISQ-12).
