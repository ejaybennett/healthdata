(firstQuint)A Study of Sativex in the Treatment of Central Neuropathic Pain Due to Multiple Sclerosis.

 Multiple sclerosis subjects with a clinical diagnosis of central neuropathic pain entered a seven to ten day baseline period, followed by a four week double blind, randomised, parallel group comparison of Sativex, with placebo.

 The study medication was self-titrated to symptom resolution or maximum tolerated or allowed dose.

 Visits occurred at the end of weeks one and four (end of the study) or earlier if they withdrew.

 A follow-up visit occurred 30 - 40 days after completion or withdrawal.
