(firstQuint)Carpal Tunnel Release Effects on Median Nerve Perfusion.

 The study will involve patients undergoing carpal tunnel release surgery at our institution, with no change in the actual procedure performed.

 Using the SPY Scope, we will measure blood flow prior to the carpal tunnel release, and again measure once carpal tunnel release has been performed, in order to compare the values.

 This may add roughly 15 minutes to the total procedure time, however, no steps in the actual operation will be altered or affected in any way.

This study aims to examine the effect of carpal tunnel release on blood flow to the median nerve using SPY scope imaging to view the perfusion to the nerve.
