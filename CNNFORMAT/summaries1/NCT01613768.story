(secondQuint)Eribulin Mesylate in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Salivary Gland Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the response rate of eribulin per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) in patients with locally advanced refractory or metastatic salivary gland cancer (SGC).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the safety and toxicity of eribulin in patients with locally advanced refractory or metastatic SGC.

 II.

 Evaluate the duration of response and time-to-progression.

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate overall survival.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8.

 Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

Researchers are doing a research study to examine the use of eribulin (eribulin mesylate) in patients with salivary gland cancer.

 Researchers want to know if eribulin is safe and effective in treating salivary gland cancer.
