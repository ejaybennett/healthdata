(secondQuint)The Effect of Attention Bias Modification Training on Reducing Depressive Symptoms.

 Attentional bias has been theorized to play a critical role in the onset and maintenance of depression.

 Attentional bias modification training (ABMT), an experimental paradigm that uses training to induce adaptive attentional bias, was developed to test the causal model and this has therapeutic implications in depression.

To test the effect of ABMT on treatment of depressive symptoms, a randomized, double-blind, placebo and blank controlled trial is conducted in college students who are experiencing mild-to-severe symptoms of depression.
