(fifthQuint)A Phase I/II Trial of Vemurafenib and Metformin to Melanoma Patients.

 This is a Phase I/II study.

 Phase I will be evaluating the safety of the FDA-approved Vemurafenib (960 mg orally, daily) in combination with Metformin (500 mg orally, twice daily for 2 weeks, then 850 mg orally,twice daily) in patients with unresectable Stage IIIC and Stage IV melanoma.

 Phase II will evaluate the clinical activity of the combined Vemurafenib/Metformin regimen.

 The safety profile of this combined Vemurafenib/Metformin regimen will be monitored during both phases.

 The treatment period consists of 28-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

 A Phase I/II Trial of Vemurafenib and Metformin to Melanoma Patients@highlight

The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of Vemurafenib in combination with Metformin in melanoma patients.

 The phase II part of the study will also evaluate the clinical activity of the combined regiment.

 Based on pre-clinical studies and a phase I trial, the investigators hypothesize that the combination of an FDA-approved non-toxic dose of oral Metformin with Vemurafenib will yield little toxicity and improve clinical outcomes in terms of objective response rates and survival in metastatic melanoma patients.
