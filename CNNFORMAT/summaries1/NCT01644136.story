(fifthQuint)Microspheres in Preventing Lymphatic Fluid Collection After Surgery in Patients With Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine whether, if applied to the lymph node basins after pelvic lymph node dissection, Arista could potentially reduce the formation of lymphoceles and consequently the need for secondary interventions.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection.

 After lymph node dissection, patients undergo microsphere-mediated lymphocele prevention to the lymph node basin on one side of the pelvis.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.

This study is being performed to investigate if the application of Arista absorbable hemostat (AH)(R), a product approved to stop surgical bleeding, can prevent lymphoceles.

 Lymphoceles are collections of lymphatic fluid which can occur after a lymph node dissection for cancer.

 These fluid collections can become symptomatic in some patients.

 Arista would be applied to one side of the pelvis after a pelvic lymph node dissection, to see if this decreases the number of postoperative lymph fluid collections seen on a computed tomography (CT) scan after surgery
