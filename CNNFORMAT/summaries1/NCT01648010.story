(firstQuint)Safety and Tolerability Study Which Evaluate Intravesical Instillation With Mitomycin C Mixed With TC-3 Drug Retaining Hydrogel Device In Patients With Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.

 Non-muscle-Invasive Bladder cancer is mainly treated by tumor resection (Trans Urethral Resection - TUR), followed by series of intravesical instillations of prophylactic chemotherapeutic drugs as Mitomycin C (MMC).

This treatment approach is limited due to rapid dilution the chemotheraputic drug by the incoming urine and clearance by urination.

 TheraCoat core technology is based on a reverse thermal (low viscosity at 5C) degradable gel (TC-3)for MMC retention in the urinary bladder.

 Prior to instillation, the TC-3 hydrogel,in a liquid state, is mixed with MMC.

TC-3 mixed with MMC is instilled to the bladder by a catheter.

Following gel insertion to the bladder, the gel solidifies and forms a drug reservoir inside the bladder.

 Upon contact with urine the gel dissolves and is cleared out from the bladder.

 Intravesical MMC using TheraCoat gel is expected to increase treatment efficiency due to prolongation of treatment duration and consequently improving bladder exposure to MMC.
