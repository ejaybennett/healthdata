(fifthQuint)CMC-544 and Allogeneic Transplantation for CD22 Positive-Lymphoid Malignancies.

 Study Drug Administration: The dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin you receive will depend on when you joined this study.

 The first group of 2 participants will receive the lowest dose level of inotuzumab ozogamicin.

 Each new group will receive a higher dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.

 Three (3) dose levels will be tested.

 For a stem cell transplant, the days before you receive your stem cells are called minus days.

 The day you receive the stem cells is called Day 0.

 The days after you receive the stem cells are called plus days.

 On Day -13, you will receive inotuzumab ozogamicin by vein over 1 hour.

 On Day -6, you will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids by vein to hydrate you.

 If you have a CD20-positive cancer, you will receive rituximab by vein over 4-6 hours.

 On Days -5, -4- and -3, you will receive fludarabine by vein over about 1 hour and bendamustine by vein over about 30 minutes to 1 hour.

 On Days -2 and -1, if you will be receiving a matched unrelated donor's (MUD) stem cells, you will receive ATG by vein over 3-4 hours.

 If you will be receiving a related donor's stem cells, you will "rest" (you will not receive chemotherapy drugs).

 ATG is given to suppress the immune system.

 Beginning on Day -2, you will receive tacrolimus as a continuous (nonstop) infusion until you are able to take it by mouth.

 Tacrolimus is given to help prevent transplant rejection.

 On Day 0, you will receive the stem cell transplant by vein.

 On Days +1 and +8, if you have a CD20 positive cancer, you will receive rituximab by vein over 4-6 hours.

 On Days +1, +3, and +6, you will receive methotrexate by vein over 30 minutes.

 Methotrexate is given to help prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD).

 On Day +11, if you received a transplant from a MUD, you will receive methotrexate by vein over about 30 minutes.

 When you are able to take tacrolimus by mouth, you will take it once or twice a day for about 6 months and then your doctor will tell you how to taper it off (gradually stop taking it).

 You will receive filgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time a day, starting 1 week after the transplant, until your blood cell levels return to normal.

 Filgrastim is designed to help with the growth of white blood cells.

 If the disease does not respond to treatment or gets worse, you will receive rituximab and a donor lymphocyte infusion containing T-cells by vein over 10-30 minutes.

 You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects.

 You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

 Study Visits: Before Day -13: - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to test for infectious diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis, and to check the status of the disease.

 - You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease.

 To collect a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy, an area of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle.

 - You will have a chest x-ray.

 - You will have a computed tomography (CT) scan of your neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

 - If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

 - If you have had Gilbert's Disease, you will have an abdominal ultrasound.

 As part of standard care, you will remain in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks after the transplant.

 After you are sent home from the hospital, you must remain in the Houston area to be checked for infections and other transplant side effects until about 3 months after transplant.

 During this time, you will return to the clinic at least 1 time each week.

 The following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be having.

 - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 About 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after transplant and, if your doctor thinks it is needed, at Years 2 and 3: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight.

 - You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be having and drugs you may be taking.

 - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check the status of the disease, and to learn how the transplant has taken.

 - If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease, - You will have a CT scan of your neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

 - If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET scan.

 Length of Study: You will be on study for up to about 3 years.

 You may be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if you have any intolerable side effects, if you are unable to follow study directions, if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, if the study is stopped, or if you choose to leave the study early.

 You should talk to the study doctor if you want to leave the study early.

 If you are taken off study early, you still may need to return for routine post-transplant follow-up visits, if your transplant doctor decides it is needed.

 If you are thinking about dropping out of this study, please tell the study doctor.

 The doctor can tell you about the effects of stopping treatment.

 You and the doctor can talk about what follow-up care and testing would help you the most.

 If you leave the study, your test results and information cannot be removed from the study records.

 CMC-544 and Allogeneic Transplantation for CD22 Positive-Lymphoid Malignancies@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn which dose level of inotuzumab ozogamicin (CMC-544) work best when given with fludarabine and bendamustine, with or without rituximab, before a stem cell transplant.

The safety of this treatment will also be studied.

 Fludarabine, bendamustine, and rituximab are commonly given before stem cell transplants.

 These drugs are designed to kill cancerous cells and suppress your immune system in order to lower the risk of stem cell transplant rejection.

 Inotuzumab ozogamicin is designed to kill cancerous cells and reduce the risk of the cancer coming back.

 This is an investigational study.

 Inotuzumab ozogamicin is not FDA approved or commercially available.

 It is currently being used for research purposes only.

 All other drugs given on this study are FDA approved and commercially available.

 Up to 30 patients will take part in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
