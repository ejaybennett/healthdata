(fifthQuint)Angio-Seal vs.

 Exo-Seal for Closure of Arterial Puncture Sites.

 Introduction In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) there is a rate of vascular complications of 0.

8% to 5.

5% (1).

 Albeit femoral sheaths sizes were reduced, arterial compression and long-term dressing after PCI still bear tremendous discomfort and groin pain for the patients.

 Furthermore, manual compression of the puncture site should be performed until activated clotting time is below 180 seconds (2).

 Therefore, vascular closure devices (VCD) were developed to reduce access site bleedings, to improve patients comfort, and to accelerate ambulation after PCI.

 The hemostatic puncture closure device Angio-Seal (St.

 Jude Medical, St.

 Paul, MS, USA) is a collagen based plug system with an anchor in the inner vessel wall.

 ExoSeal (Cordis, Warren, NJ, USA) is a extravascular polyglycol acid (PGA) plug, which closes the puncture site on an extravascular basis while occluding the puncture channel.

 The aim of the current, randomized study is, to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and reliability of 2 different vascular closure devices.

 Methods Consecutive patients with stable angina pectoris or silent ischemia with a positive stress test will be randomized to either Angio-Seal or Exo-Seal, and included into the study after giving written informed consent.

 Patients with contraindications for any VCD including 1.

 severe calcifications of the vessel site, 2.

 severe peripheral artery disease, 3.

 puncture in the origin of the femoral profundal artery, 3.

 non-femoral sheath insertion, 4.

 marked tortuosity of the femoral or iliac artery, and 5.

 marked obesity (BMI >40) or 6.

 cachexia (BMI s recommended technique.

 The operator should be familiar with any device used in the study, and should have performed vascular closure with those devices at least fifty times.

 After insertion of the VCD a circular groin dressing will be applied, and patients will be immobilized for 4 hours.

 After this, the arterial puncture site will be examined, and auscultation will be performed.

 If there is no relevant complication, ambulation will be initiated.

 Pain during closure procedure or manual compression will be categorized according to the Borg scale, with minor pain defined as Borg 5 (13).

 In patients with manual compression with or without patch, immobilization will last 8 hours.

 After this, inspection of the puncture site will be performed as mentioned above.

 Anticoagulation either with unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin will be restarted 6 hours after resolution of the dressing.

 On the subsequent day, ultrasound and Doppler spectral analysis of the puncture site will be performed in all patients.

 Complications will be assessed as being major or minor: Major complications are defined as need for vascular surgery, false aneurysm, AV-fistula, strong pain (Borg 5), hematoma 5 cm and major bleeding, whereas minor pain, hematoma 5 g/dl (with or without an identified site), TIMI "loss no site" as a haemoglobin drop > 4 g/dl but 3 g/dl but 5 (13).

 Demographic and procedural data will be prospectively collected using a standardized procedural data sheet.

 This includes date and type of intervention, sheath size, procedure-related drug doses, and number of previous interventions.

 Major or minor complications, as well as the time of events will be recorded.

 Statistical analysis Randomization will be performed Statistical analyses will be performed with SPSS version 16.

0 (SPSS Inc.

, Chicago, IL, USA).

 Continuous data are expressed as mean values +/- standard deviation.

 For comparisons between paired data the students t-test will be used.

 A p-value s like calcification, peripheral artery disease and tortuosity of the artery.

 Since these devices are already introduced, but not evaluated sufficiently, there is need for a randomized comparison with an established system.

 The risk-benefit ratio is well on the site of benefit, since all devices are regularly used in interventional cardiology and the estimated complication rate is in the range or even lower, than those, reported in the literature.

 Angio-Seal vs.

 Exo-Seal for Closure of Arterial Puncture Sites@highlight

Background: Vascular closure devices (VCD) were developed to reduce access site bleedings, to improve patients comfort, and to accelerate ambulation after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI).

 Despite higher complications rates in earlier studies, current data suggest similar complication rates or better outcomes after the use of VCD as compared to manual compression.

 ExoSeal (Cordis, Warren, NJ, USA) is a new, extravascular polyglycol acid (PGA) plug which occludes the puncture channel.

 Whether the use of this extravascular closure device is as effective as the more widely used plug/anchor mediated devices, has not been evaluated so far.

 We performed a randomized, multicentre, single-blinded trial to compare the efficacy of the extravascular closure device ExoSeal in comparison to the collagen-based plug/anchor mediated AngioSeal system.

 Methods: 304 patients receiving diagnostic angiography and/or PCI will be included in three centers.

 Exclusion criteria are contraindications for any VCD including 1.

 severe calcification of the access vessel, 2.

 severe peripheral artery disease, 3.

 puncture in the origin of the profound femoral artery, 3.

 non-femoral sheath insertion, 4.

 marked tortuosity of the femoral or iliac artery, 5.

 marked obesity or cachexia (BMI >40 or 5), and hematoma 5 cm within 24 hours after insertion of the device.

 Power was 80%, alpha 0.

05.

 Bleeding will be defined according to the TIMI criteria.

 The study is actively enrolling patients, last inclusion will take place in September 2012.

 Results and Conclusions: Outcome data including the primary endpoint (bleeding, need for vascular surgery and device failure) will be presented for the first time.
