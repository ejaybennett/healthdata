(fifthQuint)Role of Perfusion CT in Pancreatic Cancer.

 1.

 Performance of preoperative perfusion CT for preoperative staging is assessed by comparing with operative finding and histologic disease staging 2.

 Estimation of initial or change of pancreas cancer perfusion parameters and whether those can provide cut-off value for predicting response of chemotherapy in patients with pancreas adenocarcinoma.

 Role of Perfusion CT in Pancreatic Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is 1.

 to determine whether the perfusion parameters in the normal pancreas and the pancreas cancer (adenocarcinoma or neuroendocrine tumor) are different on perfusion CT 2.

 to determine whether initial perfusion parameters as well as perfusion parameter change in pancreas adenocarcinoma before and after chemotherapy are different between chemotherapy response group (CR, PR according to RECIST 1.

1) and non response group (SD, PD according to RECIST 1.

1).
