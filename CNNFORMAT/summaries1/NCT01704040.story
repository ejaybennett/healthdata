(secondQuint)A Study of CNTO 3157 in Healthy Normal and Asthmatic Participants Inoculated With Human Rhinovirus Type 16.

 This is a two-part, randomized (participants are assigned to treatment by chance), double-blind (participants and investigators do not know what study agent is being administered), placebo-controlled study.

 A placebo appears identical to a study agent, has no active ingredients, and helps investigators evaluate the effect of a study agent.

 In Part 1, following administration of CNTO 3157 or placebo, the severity of an upper respiratory tract infection, due to inoculation with HRV 16, will be assessed in healthy participants for safety reasons.

 In Part 2, following administration of CNTO 3157 or placebo and inoculation with HRV-16, efficacy and safety will be assessed in asthmatic participants using standard assessments to evaluate asthma treatments.

 The study (Parts 1 and 2) will be completed when the last participant completes the last visit (Week 11) in Part 2.

The main purposes of this study are to evaluate the safety (Parts 1 and 2) and efficacy (Part 2) of pretreatment with CNTO 3157 in healthy adult and asthmatic adult participants before and after intranasal (into the nose) inoculation with human rhinovirus type 16 (HRV-16).
