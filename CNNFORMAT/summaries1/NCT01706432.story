(secondQuint)Hypofractionated Image Guided Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the feasibility of correlating changes in the number of circulating tumor cells in metastatic breast cancer patients with time to progression following hypofractionated image guided radiotherapy to all known sites (=< 5) of disease.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the progression free survival, overall survival, pattern of failure, and toxicity of hypofractionated image guided radiotherapy to all active sites (=< 5) of metastatic disease.

 II.

 To assess the feasibility of the Interferon-Related DNA Damage Resistance Gene Signature (IRDS) for its predictive value in treatment failure, both in and out of the radiation field.

 OUTLINE: Patients with metastases in the lung, liver, abdomen, and extremities undergo 10 fractions or less of hypofractionated radiation therapy and patients with brain metastases undergo a single fraction of stereotactic radiosurgery.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 weeks for 2 months, at 3 months, every 3 months for a year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

 Hypofractionated Image Guided Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies hypofractionated image guided radiation therapy in treating patients with stage IV breast cancer.

 Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells.

 Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells
