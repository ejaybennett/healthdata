(thirdQuint)Motile Sperm Organelle Morphology Examination (MSOME) Influence on Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) Outcomes in Infertile Couples.

 Sperm morphology has been described as one of the major determinants of male in vitro fertility.

 However, the standard morphology evaluation on random stained cells from the ejaculate is of limited value during ICSI.

 Current research is directed towards the dysmorphisms of the sperm head.

A new technique based on the motile sperm organelle morphology examination (MSOME) at a magnification of at least *6000 has been developed.

 The MSOME assesses the nucleus, for both shape and chromatin content, which is the most important sperm organelle in influencing ICSI outcomes.

 The goals for this study are to identify whether there is a connection between morphologic sperm normalcy under high magnification and (i) semen analysis according to the new World Health Organization (WHO) reference values and (ii) ICSI outcomes.
