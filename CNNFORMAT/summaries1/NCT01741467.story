(firstQuint)The Effect of Real Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Subjects With Pre-diabetes.

 The protocol is a prospective, non-blinded, randomized controlled study in persons with newly diagnosed pre-diabetes comparing the effects of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) combined with diet and lifestyle education to those who have diet and lifestyle education alone.

 During a "wash-in" phase both groups will wear a masked CGM for 1 week at baseline and again after 12 weeks.

 Those randomized to the RT-CGM will wear it for 4 cycles of 2 week on/1 week off over the next 12 weeks.

 Both groups will follow-up with their primary care providers as clinically indicated over the next year with quarterly measurements of blood pressure, weight, and BMI.

 At the end of this period, they will wear a masked CGM for 1 week.
