(secondQuint)Light-Scattering Spectroscopy for Detection of Breast Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate whether light-scattering spectroscopy can reliably distinguish between two subject groups: those with clinical stage II or stage III breast cancer and those without breast cancer.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo light-scattering spectroscopy of the breast in addition to standard of care as it relates to screening for breast cancer or treatment of breast cancer.

This pilot clinical trial studies light-scattering spectroscopy in finding disease in patients with stage II-III breast cancer.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as light-scattering spectroscopy, may help find and diagnose breast cancer
