(fifthQuint)Laparoscopic Sacral Colpopexy Versus Modified Total Pelvic Floor Reconstructive Surgery for Apical Prolapse Stage III-IV.

 Pelvic organ prolapse is a common problem.

 The high rate of failure has led to an increasing use of synthetic grafts to augment vaginal repair procedures to obtain more durable results.

 In 2005, the investigators began to perform modified pelvic floor reconstruction surgery with mesh.

 The nation-wide multicenter prospective clinical trial data showed that it was safe, efficient and cost-effective.

 No severe intraoperative complications were recorded and the recurrence rate after 1 year follow-up was 8.

1%.

 Quality of life improved significantly from the baseline, while the sexual function did not change.

 Sacral colpopexy has long been regarded as the gold standard.

 Laparoscopic sacral colpopexy could offer durable result and low morbidity compared with open procedure.

 In clinical practice, many women have symptomatic POP-Q Stage III-IV uterine or vault prolapse, which requires surgical correction.

 The aim of this multicenter, prospective and randomized study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these two procedures in the treatment of symptomatic apical prolapse Stage III-IV in China.

 Laparoscopic Sacral Colpopexy Versus Modified Total Pelvic Floor Reconstructive Surgery for Apical Prolapse Stage III-IV@highlight

Pelvic Organ prolapse (a feeling of bulge in the vagina) may cause some distressing symptoms such as loss of control of the bowel or bladder, and may also cause problems with patient's sex life.

 The primary treatment is surgery.

 Sacral Colpopexy is the gold standard procedure.

 Now it could be done laparoscopically.

 Modified total pelvic floor reconstructive surgery with mesh is developed in China for Asian Women.

 This study is designed to determine the effectiveness and safety of Modified total pelvic floor reconstructive surgery with mesh compared with laparoscopic Sacral Colpopexy for the treatment of uterine or vault prolapse Stage III-IV.

 Patients enrolled into the study will be followed up for up to 3 years after surgery.

 Evaluation will take place during surgery and postoperative visit.

 Stage of prolapse before and after surgery, patient satisfaction through quality of life and sexual function questionnaires before and after surgery, and peri-operative complication rates will be evaluated.
