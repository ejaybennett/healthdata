(thirdQuint)A Phase III Trial on Adjuvant Temozolomide With or Without Interferon-alpha in Newly Diagnosed High-grade Gliomas.

 This study is being conducted to help determine whether the addition of Interferon-alpha(-IFN),which were determined sensitized the activity of Temozolomide(TMZ) in vivo and vitro, when given along with temozolomide during the monthly cycles that follow radiation, is able to delay tumor growth, shrink tumors, or impact how long people with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma.

 Four weeks after radiotherapy, newly diagnosed WHO III-IV glioma patients will be randomised into two groups: TMZ group or TMZ+ -IFN groups.
