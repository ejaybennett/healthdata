 Coping With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Development of a Community-based Patient Education Program@highlight

The aim of the study is to develop, carry out, evaluate and measure the effects of a new patient education program for patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)in primary healthcare.

 In an randomized controlled trial design the effects of the patient education program on coping, physical functioning, fatigue, pain, acceptance, anxiety, depression, quality of life, self- efficacy, and illness perception will be compared with treatment as usual.

 The results of the main project will lead to the elaboration of the final patient education program that can be implemented in primary health care, as well as development of a training program for future program-conductors.
