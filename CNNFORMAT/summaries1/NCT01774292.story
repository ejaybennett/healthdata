(secondQuint)Effect of Intracuff Alkalinized Lidocaine on Coughing Incidence at Extubation.

 The diffusion of nitrous oxide inside the endotracheal cuff leads to increase pressure, pain and coughing.

 Studies have shown benefit of alkalized lidocaine and other mediums within the cuff with nitrous oxide.

 No study has yet evaluated the benefit of alkalized lidocaine in long surgeries without the use of nitrous oxide.

The purpose of the study is to determined whether the administration of alkalized 4% lidocaine (160 mg) in the endotracheal tube cuff is effective in diminishing the incidence of coughing at extubation in surgeries lasting more than 2 hours without the use of nitrous oxide as an anesthetic agent.
