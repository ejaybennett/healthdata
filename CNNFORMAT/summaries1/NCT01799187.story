(thirdQuint)Research of Revascularization in Immature Teeth With Periapical Periodontitis.

 The investigators design to collect a group of patients presenting immature permanent teeth with periapical periodontitis in certain criterion.

 The investigators will divide the patients into two groups randomly.

 One group will get treated with revascularization while the other with apexification.
