(secondQuint)The Effect of a New Supraglottic Airway With Built-in Cuff Pressure Indicator.

 Recent evidence suggests that reduction of LMA intracuff pressure may decrease the incidence of pharyngolaryngeal symptoms.

 Yet, pressure manometers are not widely available limiting the application of a strategy of intracuff pressure reduction.

 The Ultra airway has been designed to provide continuous indication of intracuff pressure and can limit the intracuff pressure to < 60 cm H2O.

 This study compares the incidence of pharyngolaryngeal complications in patients managed with either a pressure-limiting strategy using the Ultra or a standard practice using a LMA, in ambulatory surgery patients.
