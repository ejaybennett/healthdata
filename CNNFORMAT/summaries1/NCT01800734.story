(fifthQuint)Mixed Meal Test in Type 1 Diabetes: Optimization of Artificial Pancreas-Pilot Study.

 The maintenance of close-to-normal blood glucose levels slows the onset and progression of long-term microvascular, and possibly macrovascular, complications in patients with type 1 diabetes.

 Artificial pancreas or integrated CLC [a CLC algorithm which takes into account continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) readings and the effects of previous insulin infusions to continuously compute the amount of insulin dose to be administered] aims to minimize, in real time, glucose variability and prevent extreme glucose excursions (hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia).

 Despite important developments in sensor and pump technology, the artificial pancreas system must cope with anatomical and functional barriers other than the ones encountered by the normally functioning glucose-insulin system in physiology.

 For instance , CGM devices measure glucose concentration in the interstitium, not in the blood compartment, introducing a time lag due to glucose diffusion from plasma to the interstitial fluid.

 Furthermore, insulin (actually, one of current fast insulin analogues) is delivered into the subcutaneous adipose tissue, not in blood, and directly accesses the systemic, not the portal circulation.

 Owing to these hindrances, developing a smart and suitable CLC algorithm still is an ongoing process.

 This research aims to alleviate these shortcomings by carrying out clinical physiology study aiming at improving development and optimization of a suitable control algorithm.

 Twenty adults patients with type 1 diabetes, regularly attending the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases of University of Verona School of Medicine, using continuous subcutaneous fast insulin analogue infusion (CSII) through a permanent pump and on subcutaneous glucose sensing will be enrolled.

 Inclusion criteria (see below for more details) are diagnosis of type 1 diabetes as defined by WHO for at least 12 months or confirmed C-peptide negative.

 Exclusion criteria are recurrent severe hypoglycemia unawareness or clinically significant nephropathy, neuropathy, or proliferative retinopathy.

 Standard clinical parameters will be assessed in all patients.

 Metabolic tests will be carried out at the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases of University of Verona School, starting at 08:00 a.

m.

 on two separate days in random order and after a 10-12-h overnight fast.

 Two metabolic tests will be performed: a euglycemic insulin clamp and a standardized mixed meal test.

 A.

 Euglycemic insulin clamp.

 A standard euglycemic insulin clamp will be carried out to assess insulin sensitivity, as previously described (1).

 Subjects will be instructed to use their usual nocturnal fast insulin analogue basal rate, to be left unchanged for at least five hours before the beginning of the test.

 A CGM device will be inserted two days before the test and calibrated with capillary blood glucose (measured by glucometer) at pre-established hours of the day.

 Human insulin concentration will be raised with an i.

v.

 prime (0.

8 U/m^2 BSA) and maintained constant by an i.

v.

 infusion (40 mU/minm^2 BSA).

 Plasma glucose will be allowed to fall until it reaches the physiologic range (i.

e.

 C.

 Plasma/serum will be collected and stored at -80C.

 Both tests (insulin clamp and mixed meal) will form the biological biobank of this study.

 The combined analysis of insulin clamp and mixed meal test data will allow to build a comprehensive model of the glucose insulin system during a mixed meal test in each subject, thereby resulting into an in silico virtual patient, according to a well established methodology developed in our laboratory.

 The collection of virtual patients with type 1 diabetes undergoing a mixed meal test will form the in silico biobank derived form this study.

 Virtual patients will be used to carry out Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA), i.

e.

 to compute glucose control coefficients (CCs), which quantify the role played by each component (e.

g.

: absorption rate of the fast insulin analogue, carbohydrate absorption through the gut, etc.

) of the system in determining glucose concentration at each time point during the mixed meal in patients with type 1 diabetes, in close parallelism to the analysis previously carried out by us in patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing an intravenous glucose tolerance test (2).

 Furthermore, the incretin hormone, glucagon and substrate response to a mixed meal will be quantified, allowing the putative identification of further modifiers of the glucose-insulin system (one for all: glucagon).

 This database will be instrumental in devising a control algorithm able to guarantee a normal glucose regulation during a mixed meal in patients with type 1 diabetes with CGM on insulin pump therapy.

 Mixed Meal Test in Type 1 Diabetes: Optimization of Artificial Pancreas-Pilot Study@highlight

Physiology studies will be performed in patients with type 1 diabetes to define during a standardized mixed meal test: 1.

 The relationship between fast insulin analogue administration by i.

v.

 infusion or by subcutaneous pumps and plasma insulin concentration and tissue insulin action; 2.

 The relationship between insulin action, glucose fluxes and glucose concentration, the latter one as measured in plasma or estimated by a s.

c.

 glucose-sensor; 3.

 The concentration curves of some potential modifiers of the glucose-insulin system (i.

e.

: glucagon, incretin hormones, free fatty and amino acids).

 On the basis of these data, in silico phenocopies of the patients (virtual patients) will be created to measure the glucose control coefficients, which quantify the role played by each component of the glucose-insulin system on glucose concentration.

 One final purpose of this research is to develop and to optimize an algorithm able to integrate continuous glucose monitoring with continuous subcutaneous fast insulin analogue infusion, known as closed-loop control (CLC) or artificial pancreas.
