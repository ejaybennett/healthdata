(fifthQuint)Combined Cytotoxic and Immune-Stimulatory Therapy for Glioma.

 This is a Phase 1, multiple center open label, dose escalation safety study of Ad-hCMV-TK and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L delivered to the peritumoral region after tumor resection.

 This study will combine direct tumor cell killing (TK) and immune-mediated stimulatory (Flt3L) gene transfer approaches delivered by first generation adenoviral vectors.

 Treatment with HSV1-TK is expected to kill transduced brain cells, thus exposing tumor antigen.

 Treatment with Flt3L, a cytokine known to cause proliferation of dendritic cells, should cause the migration of dendritic cells to the peritumoral brain and remaining tumor.

 There, they will be exposed to tumor antigens released from dying glioma cells through TK + valacyclovir-induced glioma cell death, and thus mediate a specific anti-malignant glioma immune response against remaining malignant glioma cells.

 Combined Cytotoxic and Immune-Stimulatory Therapy for Glioma@highlight

Despite the marginal improvements in survival of patients suffering from malignant glioma treated with gene therapy vectors, the clinical trials conducted so far using viral vectors, in particular adenoviral vectors, have proven that the use of adenoviral vectors is a safe therapeutic approach, even in large, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trials.

 Treatment of malignant glioma using gene transfer modalities typically consists of surgical debulking of the tumor mass followed by the administration of the viral vectors into the brain tissue surrounding the tumor cavity.

 This study will combine direct tumor cell killing (TK) and immune-mediated stimulatory (Flt3L) gene transfer approaches delivered by first generation adenoviral vectors.
