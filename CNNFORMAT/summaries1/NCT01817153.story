(fifthQuint)Effect of Hydrocortison on Post-ischemic Flow-mediated Dilation and on Thenar Oxygen Saturation in Human Septic Shock.

.

 Two primary end points, considered as reflecting vasoreactivity will be assessed : 1.

 Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, measured by ultrasound imaging, expressed in mm or in percentage, will be calculated from artery diameters measured before and after a vascular occlusion test (cuff around arm or forearm).

 2.

 recovery slope of thenar oxygen saturation (StO2), assessed by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), expressed in %/second, will be recorded after the vascular occlusion test.

 The two primary end points (FMD and recovery slope of StO2)will be assessed at the following timepoints : - baseline (before first injection of placebo or hydrocortison) - 2 hours after first injection of placebo or hydrocortison - 2 hours after second injection of placebo or hydrocortison (i.

e.

 8 hours after first injection) - 4 to 6 hours after third injection - 4 to 6 hours after fourth injection (optional).

 Effect of Hydrocortison on Post-ischemic Flow-mediated Dilation and on Thenar Oxygen Saturation in Human Septic Shock.

@highlight

The main objectives of the study are 1)to examine the immediate (2 hours) and delayed (8 hours) effects of intravenous hydrocortison on macro and microvascular post-ischemic vasoreactivity, in septic shock adult patients; 2) to examine possible correlations between post-ischemic flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery (assessed by ultrasound imaging) and post-ischemic recovery slope of the thenar oxygen saturation (StO2) (assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy).
