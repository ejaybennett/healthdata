(secondQuint)Effects of CPAP on Visceral Fat Thickness.

 This proposed randomized control trial (RCT) will compare the effects of therapeutic CPAP versus subtherapeutic CPAP in patients newly diagnosed with OSA with reference to visceral fat especially mesenteric fat thickness, liver fat, carotid artery intima media thickness (IMT), lateral pharyngeal wall (LPW) thickness, plasma lipids and adipokines over a treatment period of 3 months.

 The results of this study will advance our understanding of the relative role of OSA and obesity in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and whether CPAP therapy can improve these metabolic dysregulation.

 Effects of CPAP on Visceral Fat Thickness@highlight

We hypothesize that patients with untreated OSAS will have more visceral fat, fatty liver and increased carotid artery thickness whereas treatment with CPAP may reduce the mesenteric and liver fat, plasma lipids, carotid artery thickness.
