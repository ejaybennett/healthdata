(firstQuint)Phase I Study of Lurbinectedin (PM01183) in Combination With Paclitaxel, With or Without Bevacizumab, in Selected Advanced Solid Tumors.

 Clinical trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD) of PM01183 in combination with weekly paclitaxel, with or without bevacizumab.

 Once a recommended dose is defined for the PM01183 and weekly paclitaxel combination, the feasibility of adding bevacizumab to this combination will be explored in a selected cohort of patients to characterize the safety profile and feasibility of this combination, to obtain preliminary information on antitumor activity, to obtain preliminary information on quality of life (QoL), to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this combination and to detect major drug-drug PK interactions and PK/PD (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) correlation and to conduct an exploratory pharmacogenomic(PGx) analysis in patients with selected advanced solid tumors.
