(fifthQuint)Correlation Between CPAP Compliance and Food Intake Timing.

 OSA is a chronic disorder characterized by frequent reduction and/or cessation of inspiratory airflow during sleep, with resulting hypoxemia and hypercapnia that are terminated by arousals.

 This pattern of repetitive arousals and nocturnal hypoxemia leads to disruption of sleep architecture and daytime hyper-somnolence as well as a multitude of neurobehavioral and cardiopulmonary derangements.

 All patients diagnosed with OSA should be instructed to undergo behavioral changes such as weight loss, avoidance of alcohol and sedatives, sleeping on the side and improvement in sleep hygiene, such as keeping a regular sleep schedule and getting an adequate amount of sleep.

 Continuous Positive Airways Pressure (CPAP) is currently considered to be the cornerstone of therapy for sleep apnea (OSA).

 However compliance with this treatment is frequently poor, which may lead to ongoing symptoms of sleep disruption, daytime sleepiness and poor waking cognitive function.

 Mechanical and psychological/educational interventions have been proposed to try to increase the hours of use of CPAP therapy.

 In older male patients with OSA, compliance with CPAP therapy is associated with attendance at a patient CPAP education and support group.

 Resolution of symptoms with therapy also appears to be associated with enhanced compliance.

 Some studies suggest that there is no direct causal relationship between OSA and gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD).

 The investigators hypothesize that the compliance and tolerance to CPAP is affected with the timing of last meal before bedtime and this may also affect the symptoms of GERD.

 Correlation Between CPAP Compliance and Food Intake Timing@highlight

Despite widespread agreement that continuous positive airway pressure is effective therapy for obstructive sleep apnea, it is estimated that 50% of patients recommended for therapy are noncompliant 1 year later.

 Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most definitive medical therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

 Many patients have difficulty tolerating nasal CPAP due to nasal airway problems, mouth leak, and general discomfort from the mask and headgear.

 Interventions to improve compliance in such patients have not been studied.

 The investigators plan to further evaluate the usage of CPAP and identify if the timing of last meal before bedtime affects the compliance and tolerance of CPAP.
