(fifthQuint)Clinical Evaluation of BD NEXT Pen Needle.

 Using their usual insulin doses, pen and injection routine, subjects will be asked to compare two different pen needles (PNs) of corresponding gauge (GA) and length, one being the investigational (extra thin wall) pen needle and the other being their most often, currently used pen needle.

 Based on their current pen needle gauge and length, subjects will be assigned to the BD NEXT pen needle with the most comparable gauge (G) and length, in millimeters (mm).

 The three possible sizes are BD NEXT 32G x 4mm pen needle, BD NEXT 31G x 5mm pen needle, or BD NEXT 31G x 8 mm pen needle.

 Both study pen needles will be used by the subject on the same pen device/insulin brand.

 If subjects are using two different pens, comparison data will be collected for both pen devices.

 Each subject will participate in three study visits over the course of approximately 3 weeks.

 Study conduct will include two in-home use study periods each lasting approximately (1) one week.

 During Visit 1, after subjects are enrolled and assigned to a pen device group, subjects will be randomly assigned to use the BD NEXT or their usual PN for use during a 1 week home use period (Period 1).

 After approximately 1 week, at Visit 2, subjects will be crossed-over to the other study PN per the randomization schedule.

 After approximately 1 week of home use with the second study PN (Period 2), at Visit 3, subjects will be asked to complete Visual Analog Scales (VAS) and answer questions comparing their injection experiences with the two different PNs.

 The primary and secondary objectives will be assessed for all pen users combined.

 In addition, preference, thumb force, and confidence in full dose delivery will be compared among the subsets of subjects using each of the following pen devices: sanofi-aventis SoloSTAR(R), Lilly KwikPen cent , Novo Nordisk FlexPen(R).

 In order to achieve a minimum of 60 evaluable subjects in each of these pen user groups approximately 210 subjects will be enrolled (70 subjects per pen group).

 Clinical Evaluation of BD NEXT Pen Needle@highlight

This prospective, multi-center, 2 period cross-over study is designed to determine if people who use injection pens for subcutaneous medication delivery prefer the BD NEXT pen needle (PN) in comparison with currently marketed pen needles of the same or similar gauge and length.

 Subjects will use the investigational (BD NEXT) PN and their usual conventional PN each for one week in a randomly assigned sequence, and will be asked to evaluate and compare characteristics of the BD NEXT pen needle versus their usual pen needle when used for all their pen injections performed at home.

 Since injection experience may vary according to the type of pen device used, equal numbers of subjects will be recruited who are users of three of the most commonly used insulin pen injectors.
