(fifthQuint)Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for GATA2 Mutations.

 Background: Genetic and sporadic mutations on one allele of the GATA2 gene lead to a syndrome termed MonoMAC.

 MonoMAC is characterized by: 1) infections with Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) and other opportunistic infections, 2) deficiency of monocytes, Blymphocytes, and Natural Killer (NK) cells in the peripheral blood, and 3) progression to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and 4) mutations on one allele of GATA2 in most patients.

 We propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using different conditioning regimens for different donor sources and post-transplant immunosuppressive regimens in reconstituting normal hematopoiesis and reversing the disease phenotype in patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC.

 Objectives: Primary: (NotEqual) (Cross)To determine whether allogeneic HSCT approach reconstitutes normal hematopoiesis and reverses the disease phenotype by one year in patients with mutations in GATA2 or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC.

 Eligibility: (NotEqual) (Cross)Recipients ages 8-70 years old with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC.

 Clinical history of at least one life-threatening infection.

 (NotEqual) (Cross)Have a 10/10 or a 9/10 matched related or unrelated donor (HLA -A, -B, -C, DRB1, DQB1 by high resolution typing identified through the National Marrow Donor Program), or a haploidentical related donor.

 Design: (NotEqual) (Cross)Patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, with a 10/10 matched related or unrelated donor will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine 40 mg/m2 IV once daily for 4 days on day s -6, -5, -4, and -3, busulfan 3.

2 mg/kg IV once daily on day s -6, -5, -4, and -3, and HSCT on day 0.

 The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan.

 If the patient has normal, favorable, or intermediate cytogenetics, post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to day 180.

 If there is no evidence of GVHD, tacrolimus will be begin tapering at approximately day +180.

 If the patient has unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities prior to transplant, then the posttransplant GVHD prophylaxis will consist of methotrexate 5 mg/m2 IV on day s +1, +3, +6, and +11 and tacrolimus daily from day -3 until day +180.

 If there is no evidence of graftversus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day +180.

 (NotEqual) (Cross)Patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, with a 9/10 matched related or unrelated donor will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 14.

5 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s -6 and -5, busulfan 3.

2 mg/kg IV once daily on day s -4, -3, (if clonal cytogenetic abnormalities are present, then three days of busulfan 3.

2 mg/kg IV once daily on day s -4, -3, and -2 will be given), fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV once daily for 5 days on day s -6 to -2, 200 cGy TBI on day -1, and HSCT on day 0.

 The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan.

 Post-transplant immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis for recipients of 9/10 donors will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to approximately day 180.

 If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day +180.

 (NotEqual) (Cross)Patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, with a haploidentical related donor will receive pre-transplant conditioning with cyclophosphamide 14.

5 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s -6 and -5, busulfan 3.

2 mg/kg IV once daily on day s -4, -3, (if clonal cytogenetic abnormalities are present, then three days of busulfan 3.

2 mg/kg IV once daily on day s -4, -3, and -2) will be given, fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV once daily for 5 days on day s -6 to -2, and 200 cGy TBI on day -1, and HSCT on day 0.

 The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan.

 Post-transplant immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis for recipients of haploidentical donors will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to day 180.

 If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day +180.

 Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for GATA2 Mutations@highlight

Background: - GATA2 deficiency is a disease caused by mutations in the GATA2 gene.

 It can cause different types of leukemia and other diseases.

 Researchers want to see if a stem cell transplant can be used to treat this condition.

 A stem cell transplant will give stem cells from a matching donor (related or unrelated) to a recipient.

 It will allow the donor stem cells to produce healthy bone marrow and blood cells that will attack the recipient s cancer cells.

 Objectives: - To see if stem cell transplants are successful at treating GATA2 mutations and related conditions.

 Eligibility: - Recipients who are between 8 and 70 years of age and have GATA2 deficiency, or the clinical syndrome MonoMac.

 - Donors who are between 6 and 70 years of age and are matched with the recipients.

 - Have a 10/10 or 9/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or a haploidentical related donor.

 Design: - All participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

 Blood samples will be collected.

 Recipients will have imaging studies and other tests.

 - Donor participants will provide stem cells for the treatment.

 In some cases, Filgrastim injections will allow these cells to be collected from the blood.

 Bone marrow donations will be used as stem cells source.

 - Recipients will have chemotherapy or radiation to prepare for the transplant.

 On the day of the transplant, they will receive the donated stem cells.

 - Recipients will stay in the hospital until their condition is stable after transplant.

 - Frequent blood tests and scans will be required for the first 6 months after the transplant, followed by less frequent visits over time.
