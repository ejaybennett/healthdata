(secondQuint)Alteration of Different Immune Parameters in Immune Thrombocytopenia ITP Patients Receiving Eltrombopag Treatment.

 The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of oral eltrombopag as a thrombopoietic agent treating previously treated chronic Chinese ITP patients and investigate the alteration of Different Immune Parameters after eltrombopag therapy.

 Approximately 30 eligible subjects with primary ITP who have not responded to or have relapsed after previous treatment for ITP will be selected.

 The initial dose of eltrombopag administration is 25 mg orally once daily.

 During the 6 weeks follow-up, dose of investigational product will be adjusted according to the weekly subject platelet count, and a battery of immune parameters will be monitored at the end of each week.

 Additionally, the efficacy of oral eltrombopag for ITP will be assessed after 6 weeks administration.
