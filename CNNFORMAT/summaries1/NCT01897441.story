(fifthQuint)Chemotherapy Before Surgery and Tissue Sample Collection in Patients With Stage IIA-IIIC Breast Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the effects of preoperative neoadjuvant paclitaxel and doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride)/cyclophosphamide (AC) on: senescence; invasion/motility (tumor microenvironment of metastasis [TMEM] and 67 kDa laminin receptor [67LR]).

 II.

 To create a biospecimen repository for future studies derived from patients with breast cancer receiving standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

 OUTLINE: Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive disease are assigned to Stratum A, and patients with HER2-negative disease are randomized to Stratum B or C.

 STRATUM A: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes weekly for 12 weeks.

 Beginning 2-3 weeks later, patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 5-10 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes every 2 weeks for 8 weeks STRATUM B: Patients receive paclitaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide as in Stratum A.

 STRATUM C: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 5-10 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes every 2 weeks for 8 weeks.

 Patients then receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for 12 weeks.

 Patients undergo surgery 2-6 weeks after the last chemotherapy dose.

 In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

 Chemotherapy Before Surgery and Tissue Sample Collection in Patients With Stage IIA-IIIC Breast Cancer@highlight

This randomized pilot clinical trial studies chemotherapy before surgery and tissue sample collection in patients with stage IIA-IIIC breast cancer.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells o grow and spread.

 Giving doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel and trastuzumab may kill more tumor cells.

 Collecting and storing samples of tissue from patients with breast cancer to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about how well patients will respond to treatment.
