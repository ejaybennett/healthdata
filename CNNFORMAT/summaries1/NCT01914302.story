(firstQuint)The Characterization of Blood Volumes of Commercially Available Lancing Devices.

 Primary Objective: cent Characterize expressed blood volume 11/2L across representative, commercially available lancing device systems using finger sticks.

 Secondary Objectives: the following characterizations will be performed in the data analysis within each device and across each device: - Correlation of Subject pain response to blood volume collected; - Proportion of Subjects that produce sufficient blood to fill a 1 mu l test strip; - Proportion of Subjects that generate 1 mu l blood volume; - Proportion of Subjects who generate multiple- times the blood volume needed to fill a 1 mu l test strip - Proportion of Subjects who generate multiple- times 1 mu l of blood volume - Proportion of Subjects that produce on average (1 mu l) of blood volume on 1st attempt - Proportion of Subjects that produce on average (1 mu l) of blood volume on their first and second lancing attempt.
