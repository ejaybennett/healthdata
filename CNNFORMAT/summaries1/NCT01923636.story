(fifthQuint)Prognostic Value of Neonatal Markers (Clinical, Imaging and Biological) for the Development of Neurosensorial Sequelae in Children Infected by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in Utero.

 Infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most frequent cause of congenital neurological handicap of infectious origin in industrialized countries.

 Around 10% of infected neonates have symptoms and more than 50% of them will develop long term neurological sequelae and sensorineural hearing loss.

 Among asymptomatic infected neonates 10 to 15% will ultimately develop hearing loss.

 To establish the prognosis of infected neonates remains difficult and the purpose of the study is to better define early prognosis factors.

 The true burden of CMV congenital infection is unknown in France: the prevalence of the infection as well as the description of its epidemiology (proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, rate of long term sequelae, proportion of cases following primary or secondary maternal infections) are unknown.

 Prognostic Value of Neonatal Markers (Clinical, Imaging and Biological) for the Development of Neurosensorial Sequelae in Children Infected by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in Utero@highlight

The main objective of this study is to elaborate, in the neonatal period, a prognostic score for the development of neurological and sensorineural sequelae at 1 year in neonates infected in utero by cytomegalovirus.

 This score will be based on clinical, imaging and biological evaluations.

 The second objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence of this infection in France and to describe its epidemiology through the screening of 10,000 consecutive neonates.
