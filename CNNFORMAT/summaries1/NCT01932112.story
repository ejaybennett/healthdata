(secondQuint)Adenosine Effect on Persistent Pulmonary Vein Isolation Line Evaluation (APPLE Trial).

 Pulmonary vein isolation has emerged as an effective therapy for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

 However, atrial fibrillation recurs in up to 50% of patients, generally because of recovery of pulmonary vein conduction.

 Adenosine given during the initial procedure may reveal dormant pulmonary vein conduction, thereby identifying the need for additional ablation, leading to improved outcomes.
