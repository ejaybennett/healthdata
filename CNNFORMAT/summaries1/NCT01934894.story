(thirdQuint)Cabazitaxel Plus Lapatinib as Therapy for HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With Intracranial Metastases.

 This is an open-label, non-randomized, Phase II study with a lead-in safety cohort.

 Through the safety lead-in portion of this trial we will define the optimal dose of cabazitaxel when given in combination with lapatinib for patients with HER2-positive MBC and CNS metastases.

 The Phase II portion will further assess intracranial response rate in patients with HER2-positive MBC and CNS metastases.

 Toxicity and progression free survival (PFS) will be obtained and evaluated.

 The trial will be conducted at multiple study sites by SCRI Development Innovations.

 Cabazitaxel Plus Lapatinib as Therapy for HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With Intracranial Metastases@highlight

This phase II trial will combine two agents, cabazitaxel and lapatinib, to treat patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which has metastasized to the brain.

 The first portion of the study will determine the optimal dose of the cabazitaxel/lapatinib combination to administer to patients.

 After determining the optimal dose, patients will continue treatment with cabazitaxel and lapatinib to assess response to treatment with these agents.
