 De---identified patient---level data will be collected on patients presenting to a participating intensive care unit or emergency department with severe sepsis or septic shock over a 24 hour period from 00:00 to 24:00 November 07, 2013.

 International Multicentre Prevalence Study on Sepsis@highlight

To mark 10 years of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC), and timed to coincide with World Sepsis Day, on September 13, 2013, the SSC, ESICM and SCCM will be conducting an international point prevalence study of severe sepsis and septic shock.

 The goal of this project is to determine the world wide burden of severe sepsis and define current practices of sepsis care internationally.

 The study is a simple data collection exercise for patients presenting with either severe sepsis or septic shock on World Sepsis Day.
