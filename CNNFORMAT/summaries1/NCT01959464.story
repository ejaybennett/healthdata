(thirdQuint)Sexual Absorption of Vaginal Progesterone.

 The effects of intercourse on the absorption of vaginal progesterone for the female user and her sexual partner have not been studied.

 However, a previous study performed by our group found that intercourse lowered the absorption of vaginal estrogen cream in women, and men absorbed a small but statistically significant amount of estradiol during intercourse.

 Vaginal progesterone gel may be used by women for several clinical indications, and if intercourse alters the absorption and distribution of vaginal progesterone, clinical outcomes may be compromised.

 If intercourse lowers absorption, the efficacy of the treatment could be reduced.

 If intercourse enhances absorption, side effects may be increased.

 Also, if the male sexual partner absorbs vaginal progesterone, undesirable side effects may occur.

 Sexual Absorption of Vaginal Progesterone@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if sexual intercourse lowers serum progesterone in women using vaginal progesterone gel (Crinone(R)), and increases serum progesterone in their male sexual partners.

 We hypothesize, based on previous estrogen studies done by our group, that intercourse will interfere with absorption of vaginal progesterone.
