(fifthQuint)Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Oregovomab Followed by Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Nelfinavir Mesylate in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, (gemcitabine [gemcitabine hydrochloride], leucovorin [leucovorin calcium], fluorouracil [5-FU]) with or without oregovomab, followed by hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) concurrently with nelfinavir (nelfinavir mesylate) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that is cancer antigen (CA)125 positive (>= 10) or CA125 negative (= 10) or CA125 negative (= 10 receive oregovomab IV over 15-30 minutes on day 15.

 Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses (weeks 1, 4, 7) and post- radiation therapy for 1 course (week 14).

 Patients may receive an additional 3 courses concurrently with chemotherapy upon recovery from surgery based on CA125 level.

 Patients also receive nelfinavir mesylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 5 weeks beginning on day 15 of week 9.

 STEREOTACTIC RADIATION THERAPY: Beginning in week 11, patients undergo SBRT in 5 fractions over 5 consecutive days.

 Upon completion of radiation therapy, patients resume nelfinavir mesylate for 14 days (week 12-13).

 Patients without metastasis and with resectable disease undergo surgery in week 17-18.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

 Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Oregovomab Followed by Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Nelfinavir Mesylate in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well combination chemotherapy with or without oregovomab followed by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and nelfinavir mesylate works in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to nearby organs or tissues.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as oregovomab, can block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.

 Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage to normal tissue.

 Drugs, such as nelfinavir mesylate, may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.

 Giving combination chemotherapy with or without oregovomab followed by SBRT and nelfinavir mesylate may kill more tumor cells.
