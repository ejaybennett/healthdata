(fifthQuint)Can Ondansetron Prevent Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) in Babies Born to Narcotic-dependent Women.

 All neonates will have a screening 12-lead EKG prior to their first dose of study medication to determine if QTc prolongation is present.

 A repeat 12-lead EKG will be done after each dose of study medication, approximately 2-5 hours post dose; if a neonate has prolonged QTc the study drug will be stopped.

 Investigators may obtain up to 9 pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples from the neonates over 5 days when standard of care blood samples are drawn.

 These samples will consist of 1 to 2 drops of blood collected on filter paper and sent to Stanford for PK analysis.

 The modified Finnegan scoring system will be used to evaluate neonates for symptoms of NAS at each site and it is considered standard-of-care for babies at risk of NAS.

 Morphine will be the first treatment choice before other treatment medication choices (opioid or non-opioid) for NAS symptoms.

 Each site involved has established guidelines for starting, advancing and weaning treatment for NAS.

 Any medication used to treat NAS will be recorded.

 Interim analysis: will be performed after the first 20 pregnant women and their neonates have been enrolled and dosed with study drug.

 (Interim Analysis was done on first 21 mother/baby pairs in May 2016).

 To protect the confidentiality of the patients (study subjects), the lead site, Stanford University, received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH.

 Can Ondansetron Prevent Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) in Babies Born to Narcotic-dependent Women@highlight

The Investigators hope to learn if they can prevent or lessen the symptoms of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in babies born to narcotic-dependent mothers by using the drug ondansetron in the mothers prior to delivery and their babies after delivery.

 The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with one half the mother-baby pairs to receive ondansetron and the other half of the mother-baby pairs to receive placebo.

 The pregnant narcotic-dependent mothers will receive an intravenous dose of study medication prior to delivery; the neonates, after their birth, will receive the same study medication the mother received every 24 hours for up to 5 days.

 The Investigators will follow up with the mother-baby pairs for 10 days after study drug has stopped and one last follow up, about 30 days after stopping study drug, to learn if the baby had any symptoms of NAS in that time period.
