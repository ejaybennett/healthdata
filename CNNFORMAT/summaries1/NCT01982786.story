(secondQuint)Feasibility Trial Of Image Guided External Beam Radiotherapy With Or Without High Dose Rate Brachytherapy Boost In Men With Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.

 Before a big study is done, a smaller study (called a "feasibility study") is required to make sure that patients and physicians are willing to participate in a study comparing the two kinds of treatments, and to verify how the radiation therapy is given in different centres across Canada.

 The standard or usual treatment for this disease includes treatment with IGRT or IGRT plus HDR brachytherapy boost.

This research is being done because investigators involved in this study would like to compare image guided external beam radiation therapy (IGRT) to IGRT plus HDR brachytherapy boost to see which treatment is better and what the side effects of treatment are.
