(secondQuint)Phase I Study of the Volitinib (HMPL-504) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 The primary endpoint is evaluation of safety and tolerability during all the study of therapy following the initiation of multiple dosing of HMPL-504.

 The safety and tolerability variables to be evaluated in this study are adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs (specifically including blood pressure), clinical laboratory evaluations including serum chemistry, hematology (Maximum Tolerated Dose), and urinalysis (with detailed sediment analysis, proteinuria, and 24-hour urine for collection for protein), and electrocardiograms (ECGs) in triplicate, Incidence and nature of DLTs (Dose-Limiting Toxicity), to determine the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose).
