(fifthQuint)Intensive Diet and Exercise or Standard of Care in Improving Physical Function and Quality of Life in Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To compare the effects of the intensive lifestyle intervention and standard of care treatments on functional limitations (FL), body composition (BC), and quality of life (QOL) in prostate cancer (PC) patients on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

 II.

 To determine the feasibility of delivering an intensive lifestyle exercise and dietary intervention to PC patients undergoing ADT.

 III.

 To identify the intermediate variables that account for the beneficial effect of the lifestyle intervention on functional limitations and QOL.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 ARM I: EXERCISE COMPONENT: Patients undergo 1 hour of intensive exercise comprising 30 minutes of aerobic exercise and 30 minutes of resistance exercise twice weekly during weeks 1-6, once weekly during weeks 7-8, and independently during weeks 7-12.

 BEHAVIORAL ACTIVITY COUNSELING: Patients undergo behavioral activity counseling in small group sessions over 20 minutes once weekly during months 1-2 and individualized activity counseling via telephone calls over 20 minutes every 2 weeks for 3 months.

 DIETARY COMPONENT: Patients undergo nutritional counseling over 30 minutes once weekly during months 1-2 and then every 2 weeks via telephone calls during month 3.

 ARM II: Patients receive standard care and educational literature describing the American Institute of Cancer Research dietary and physical activity guidelines.

 Patients also receive phone calls over 20 minutes every 2 weeks for 3 months focusing on routine prostate cancer self-management.

 After 3 months, patients undergo 2 supervised exercise training and dietary counseling sessions.

 Intensive Diet and Exercise or Standard of Care in Improving Physical Function and Quality of Life in Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy@highlight

This randomized pilot clinical trial studies intensive diet and exercise or standard of care in improving physical function and quality of life in patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.

 Diet and exercise may help improve physical function and quality of life in prostate cancer patients.

 It is not yet known whether intensive diet and exercise is more effective than standard of care in improving physical function and quality of life in patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.
