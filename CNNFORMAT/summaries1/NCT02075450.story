(fifthQuint)Improving the Quality of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) During Pediatric Cardiac Arrest.

 Aim 1 - To evaluate the effectiveness of a CPR visual feedback device to improve compliance with current Heart and Stork Foundation of Canada (HSFC) CPR and resuscitation guidelines during simulated pediatric cardiac arrest for a team of healthcare providers.

 Aim 2 - To evaluate the effectiveness of a "Just in Time" CPR Training Video to improve compliance with current HSFC CPR and resuscitation guidelines during simulated pediatric cardiac arrest for a team of healthcare providers.

 Aim 3 - To determine if there is a synergistic effect when adding Just in Time CPR Training Video with the use of the CPR visual feedback device to improve compliance with current HSFC CPR and resuscitation guidelines during a simulated pediatric cardiac arrest scenario.

 Aim 4 - To determine the degree to which provider's perception of CPR quality matches actual quality of CPR Aim 5 - To describe the task load of healthcare providers in sepsis and cardiac arrest scenarios Participants will be recruited from ten pediatric tertiary care centers in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom using the methodology already piloted and studied in our existing EXPRESS investigators collaborative.

 Participants recruited to participate in the study will be asked to perform as members of a pediatric resuscitation team.

 Each team of healthcare providers will be randomized into one of four study arms.

 In study arm 1, resuscitation teams will participate in a simulated pediatric cardiac arrest scenario, and provide standard CPR without prior JIT training and blinded to any feedback from the CPR card during the scenario.

 Instead, the CPR card will be placed on the chest during compressions to collect real-time data, but the feedback lights on the card will be covered by black tape and thus, not visible to the members of the resuscitation team.

 In study arm 2, resuscitation teams will participate in the same scenario without prior JIT training, but provide chest compressions with the CPR card placed on the chest (and providing visual feedback) during compressions.

 In study arm 3, participants will be given a CPR card and asked to view the JIT training video.

 Following practice, they will be asked to participate in the simulated cardiac arrest scenario, and provide standard CPR without feedback from the CPR card.

 As in study arm 1, the CPR card will still be placed on the chest, but the feedback lights will be covered and not visible to the resuscitation team members.

 Finally, participants in study arm 4 will received JIT training prior to the simulated scenario, and have the CPR card in place during chest compressions to provide immediate visual feedback.

 Improving the Quality of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) During Pediatric Cardiac Arrest@highlight

Our project aims to improve the delivery and assessment of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during pediatric cardiac arrest by introducing 2 novel approaches: 1.

 We will evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, credit card sized, and highly affordable "nano-card" CPR visual feedback device to improve compliance with HSFC CPR guidelines when used during simulated pediatric cardiac arrest; 2.

 We will also develop and study a novel, "Just-in-Time" (JIT) CPR training video, integrating proven educational methods (video-based lecture, expert modeling, practice-while-watching), and use the CPR visual feedback device to provide real-time coaching.

 We hypothesize that: H1: The use of a CPR visual feedback device will improve compliance with current HSFC CPR and resuscitation guidelines during a simulated pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest scenario compared with standard CPR with no visual feedback.

 H2: A JIT CPR Training Video, viewed by healthcare providers 2-4 weeks prior to the resuscitation event, will improve compliance with current HSFC CPR and resuscitation guidelines during simulated pediatric cardiac arrest compared with those healthcare providers with no prior exposure to the JIT CPR Training Video.

 H3: That there is poor correlation between providers' perception of CPR quality and actual measured CPR quality H4: That task load varies depending on provider role and type of clinical scenario
