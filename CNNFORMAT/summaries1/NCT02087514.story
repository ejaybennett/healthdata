(fifthQuint)Duration of Red Blood Cell Storage Prior to Transfusion.

 Recent studies suggest that older stored blood is associated with worse outcomes in certain hospitalized patients.

 Red cells may be stored in a refrigerator prior to transfusion for up to 42 days by current FDA standards.

 Refrigerator storage of red cells is associated with a storage lesion and the survival of transfused red cells decreases with increasing storage time, thus older blood is associated with an increased delivery of hemoglobin-iron to certain parts of the body.

 The investigators have preliminary data in mice and humans suggesting that delivery of a significant iron load from aged red cells leads to the production of a potentially toxic form of circulating iron called non-transferrin-bound iron.

 In this prospective study of healthy volunteers, each subject will be randomized to receive transfusion of one RBC unit after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 weeks of storage.

 The primary outcome will be the 24 hr area under the curve (AUC) of the serum non-transferrin bound iron concentration calculated from samples collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 24 hours after transfusion.

 Duration of Red Blood Cell Storage Prior to Transfusion@highlight

This study will determine the minimal duration of red blood cell (RBC) storage that leads to increases in circulating non-transferrin-bound iron in healthy human volunteers post-transfusion.

 The results from this study will help guide national guidelines for appropriate duration of RBC storage prior to transfusion, which is currently 6 weeks by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria.

 The overall objective of this research is to improve the safety of refrigerated storage of red blood cells before transfusion.
