(secondQuint)A Study to Determine the Effect of a High-Fat Meal on the Rate and Extent of E2006 Absorption in Healthy Subjects.

 The study will have 2 phases: Prerandomization and Randomization.

 The Prerandomization Phase will consist of 2 periods: Screening and Baseline (Baseline Period 1), during which each subject1/4s study eligibility will be determined and baseline assessments will be conducted.
