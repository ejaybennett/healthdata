(firstQuint)Efficacy of Intrathecal Oxytocin in Patients With Neuropathic Pain.

 Rationale: The investigators anticipate that oxytocin will be effective after spinal injection in humans to acutely relieve chronic neuropathic pain.

 Objectives: Determine the effect of intrathecal oxytocin on pain and areas and intensity of hyperalgesia and allodynia in patients with chronic neuropathic pain.

 Interventions: A computer generated randomization will be used to determine the group for each subject.

 Subjects will be randomized to receive an intrathecal injection of saline (placebo) or oxytocin.
