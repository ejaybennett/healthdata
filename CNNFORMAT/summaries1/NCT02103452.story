(firstQuint)Edessy Stem Cell Score (ESS), Endometrium, Endometrioma.

 This study was conducted on 40 women at Al-Azhar University Hospitals.

 They are divided into two equal groups, group 1 with ovarian endometrioma and group 2 with normal ovary.

 Ovarian and endometrial samples were evaluated by hematoxlin & eosin for histopathology (HP) and of oct-4 for immunohistochemistry (IH) for SCE.

 Evaluation of IH parameters revealed that the most important factors for evaluating SC were arranged as score ( Edessy Stem Cell Score=ESS).
