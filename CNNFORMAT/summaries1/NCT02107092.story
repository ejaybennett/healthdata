(fifthQuint)Open-label Safety & Efficacy of ZS (Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate)10g qd to Extend Study ZS-004 in Hyperkalemia.

.

 All subjects with i-STAT potassium values between 3.

5-5.

5 mmol/l, inclusive at the ZS-004 (NCT 02088073) DBRMP Study Day 29 visit, who continue directly into the open-label extension study ZS-004E (NCT 021070920), will enter the Maintenance Phase (MP) and start on open-label ZS at a dose of 10g qd.

 All subjects with i-STAT potassium values > 5.

5 mmol/l at the ZS-004 DBRMP Study Day 29 visit will undergo an acute treatment phase (AP) where they will receive ZS 10g three times a day (tid) for 24 (3 doses) or 48 hours (6 doses).

 If the subject's i-STAT potassium is between 3.

5-5.

0 mmol/l, inclusive after 24 (AP Study Day 2) or 48 hours (AP Study Day 3), the subject will enter the MP at a starting dose of 10g qd.

 For subjects who discontinued during ZS-004 DBRMP due to hypo- or hyperkalemia baseline potassium values will be determined within 1 day of administration of the first dose in the ZS-004E extension study by taking two (2) consecutive i-STAT potassium measurements at 0 and 60 minutes ( 10 minutes).

 If the mean i-STAT value is between 3.

5 - 5.

5 mmol/l, inclusive, the subject will enter directly into the MP and receive 10g ZS qd; if the mean i-STAT potassium value is > 5.

5 mmol/l, the subject will enter the AP.

 If i-STAT potassium values are still >5.

0 mmol/l on the morning of AP Study Day 3, subjects will not enter the MP but will be referred to their normal health care provider for standard of care.

 If the i-STAT potassium value increases above 5.

5 mmol/l during the MP with treatment at 10g qd, the dose can be increased to15g qd.

 Conversely, if S-K decreases to between 3.

0-3.

4 mmol/l, inclusive, the dose of ZS can be decreased in 5g qd, decrements.

 If a subject is on a 5g qd dose and still develops blood potassium i-STAT values between 3.

0 - 3.

4mmol, inclusive the dose can be reduced to 5g every other day.

 Subjects will receive up to 11 months of treatment with open-label ZS.

@highlight

Subjects who completed the Double-blind Randomized Maintenance Phase (DBRMP) Study Day 29 visit in ZS-004 (NCT 02088073) and have an i-STAT potassium value that is 3.

5 to 6.

2 mmol/l inclusive or who discontinued during ZS-004 due to hypo- or hyperkalemia in the DBRMP and have a mean i-STAT potassium value from two consecutive measurements at 0 and 60 minutes on Acute Phase Day 1/Maintenance Phase Day 1 that is 3.

5 to 6.

2 mmol/l inclusive may have the option to participate in ZS-004E (NCT 021070920).

 Subjects who discontinued from study ZS-004 due to any other reasons (e.

g.

 adverse events, poor compliance, investigator decision) will not be entered into study ZS-004E.

 All subjects who continue into the extension study must begin dosing within two (2) days after the last dose of investigational product in ZS-004.
