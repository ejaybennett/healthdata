(secondQuint)Fractionated Carbon Dioxide Laser and Burn Scar Contractures: Evaluation of Post-Treatment Scar Function and Appearance.

 The primary goal of the study will analyze whether the fractionated carbon dioxide laser can improve other subjective and objective qualities of hypertrophic and/or contracted burn scars with or without involvement of nearby mobile joints.

 The investigators hypothesize that fractionated carbon dioxide laser therapy will increase range of motion and improve tissue compliance in all scars overlying a mobile joint that has been limited due to burn scar contracture.

 In addition, the investigators will evaluate the effect of fractionated carbon dioxide laser therapy on common sequelae of hypertrophic and/or contracted burn scars.

 Fractionated Carbon Dioxide Laser and Burn Scar Contractures: Evaluation of Post-Treatment Scar Function and Appearance@highlight

The investigators are studying the appearance and function of burn scars after treatment with fractionated carbon dioxide laser.

 The investigators hypothesize that the cosmetic appearance and range of motion will improve with treatment.
