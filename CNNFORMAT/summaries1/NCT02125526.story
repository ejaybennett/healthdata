(thirdQuint)Intra-aortic Balloon Pump in Extensive Myocardial Infarction With Persistent Ischemia.

 In some patients presenting with large myocardial infarction and poor hemodynamic condition, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is effective in alleviating cardiogenic shock.

 In others, the use of intra-aortic balloon pump has no effect at all.

 The investigators believe this is dependent on the presence of persisting ischemia after successful epicardial reperfusion, known as no-reflow.

 In the presence of persisting ischemia, the investigators believe us of the intra-aortic balloon pump will relieve ischemia and improve outcome.

 Intra-aortic Balloon Pump in Extensive Myocardial Infarction With Persistent Ischemia@highlight

Patients presenting with large myocardial infarction and signs of persistent ischemia after successful percutaneous coronary intervention, have a poor prognosis with respect to outcome and development of heart failure in the future.

 The hypothesis of this study is that in patients in whom persistent ischemia is present, use of intra-aortic balloon pump will be beneficial and improve outcome.
