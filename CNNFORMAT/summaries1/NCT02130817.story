(fifthQuint)Belatacept in Kidney Transplantation of Moderately Sensitized Patients.

 This exploratory single-center, open-label safety and efficacy study will enroll 20 adult kidney transplants candidates, moderately sensitized against their deceased donor and at-risk for delayed graft function (DGF), to receive Belatacept (days 0,5, weeks 2,4,8 and 12 (10 mg/kg), and every 4 weeks thereafter (5 mg/kg)), plasma exchange (once before and twice after transplant) and Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) (100 mg/kg after each plasma exchange), along with Thymoglobulin (ATG) induction and Dexamethasone tapered dosing starting on the day of transplant at 100mg IV, tapered through Day 4, followed by prednisone at 30 mg on Day 5 with tapered dosing to prednisone 10 mg/d by one month, with a total observation period of 1 year.

 Patients will be tapered off tacrolimus by week 8 and will remain on mycophenolic acid and prednisone for the total length of the study.

 Subjects will be followed until 1 year post transplant.

 Belatacept in Kidney Transplantation of Moderately Sensitized Patients@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an immunosuppressive medication, Belatacept, as a replacement for a calcineurin inhibitor, in combination with a standard of care regimen of immunosuppressive medications and plasma exchange (plasmapheresis and immunoglobulin treatment) for kidney transplant patients who are moderately sensitized against their deceased donor and at-risk for delayed graft function.

 The hypothesis is that moderately sensitized patients who receive Belatacept treatment with the standard of care regimen will lead to lower acute rejection rates than historical controls based on assessment of standard of care biopsies and standard Banff criteria.
