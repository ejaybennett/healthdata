(thirdQuint)The Lumen Study: Comparing Devices for Patients With Symptomatic Femoro-popliteal Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO).

 The primary objective of the study is to compare the technical success and in-hospital safety of TruePath device with that of the CROSSER device in patients with symptomatic femoro-popliteal CTO.

 Subjects will be followed clinically while in the hospital and at 1 month following the index procedure.

 All subjects will undergo procedural intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging.

 The study population will consist of up to 75 patients with symptomatic femoro-popliteal CTO and indications for revascularization.

 Subjects must have a previously documented conventional percutaneous procedure or a concurrent failed attempt to cross the CTO using conventional guidewire techniques.

 All subjects must meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria and sign an Informed Consent Form approved by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to enrollment and randomization.
