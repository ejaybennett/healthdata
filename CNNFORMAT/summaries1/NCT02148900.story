(firstQuint)Development of a Blood Test for Marfan Syndrome.

 The primary objective of this study is to determine whether increased quantitites of circulating microfibril fragments, measured with a simple blood test, are associated with aortic root size and increased growth of the aortic root in Marfan syndrome and related disorders.

 The secondary objectives of this study are to: (1) Determine a Marfan "signature" profile of circulating microfibril fragments.

 (2) Determine if high concentrations of fibrillin-1 fragments are associated with large aortic root diameters.

 (3) Determine which fibrillin-1 fragments are good biomarkers for aortic root growth and size in Marfan syndrome.

 (4) Determine the relation between fibrillin-1, aortic root diameter, and medical and lifestyle factors reported on questionnaires.
