(secondQuint)Safety Study to Evaluate the Contact Sensitizing Potential of Topically Applied ZuraPrep and ZuraPrep Without IPA.

 This study is designed to determine if the test product, ZuraPrep cent is a skin sensitizing agent when applied to human skin.

 The study, a modified Draize skin sensitization evaluation, will be conducted in three discrete phases: 1) induction, 2) rest, and 3) challenge.

 During the Induction Phase, skin sites are exposed to the test product repeatedly for 21 consecutive days.

 The Rest Phase, a 14-day period when no treatment is performed, serves to provide adequate time for the immune system to react to ZuraPrep cent , given any of its components serve as antigens.

 During the Challenge Phase, the subjects' skin is re-exposed to the test product (ZuraPrep cent ) to determine if it is likely to be immunosensitizing.

 Safety Study to Evaluate the Contact Sensitizing Potential of Topically Applied ZuraPrep and ZuraPrep Without IPA@highlight

This is a safety study to determine the skin sensitization potential of ZuraPrep cent and ZuraPrep cent without isopropyl alcohol (IPA) after repetitive patch applications to skin of human subjects.

 Indications of both sensitization and skin irritation will be evaluated.
