(fifthQuint)A proSpective Randomized Controlled Trial comParing infliximAb-antimetabolites Combination Therapy to Anti-metabolites monotheRapy and Infliximab monothErapy in Crohn's Disease Patients in Sustained Steroid-free Remission on Combination Therapy.

 3.

 STUDY OBJECTIVES 3.

1.

 Primary objective To assess the effect of two withdrawal strategies over two years in patients with stable remission for more than 6 months on combination therapy with infliximab and antimetabolites, and demonstrate that continued combination of infliximab and antimetabolites or continued monotherapy with infliximab are both superior to antimetabolites alone for maintaining sustained steroid-free clinical remission, while antimetabolites alone are non-inferior with regards to the mean time spent in remission 3.

2.

 Secondary objectives - To identify baseline predictive factors of relapse in the three study groups.

 - To assess the ability of blood CRP and fecal calprotectin to predict short term relapse in the three groups.

 - To assess time spent inclinical remission in the three groups.

 - To assess the rate of treatment failure in the three study groups.

 - To assess the time to treatment failure in the three study groups.

 - To assess progression of bowel damage in the three groups.

 - To assess the safety and efficacy of infliximab retreatment in the antimetabolites group.

 - To assess safety in the three study groups.

 - To assess the health related quality of life in the three study groups.

 - To assess direct and indirect costs in the three study groups.

 - To assess evolution of blood CRP and fecal calprotectin in the three study groups.

 - To assess evolution of infliximab trough levels and ATI in the two infliximab scheduled maintenance groups.

 - To assess genetic association with the various clinical and biological outcomes.

 - To assess the impact of 6TGN levels on the various clinical and biological outcomes in the purine treated patients 4.

 STUDY POPULATION 4.

1.

 Selection of study population Patients to be included are those who have been in steroid free remission for at least 6 months and with scheduled infliximab/antimetabolites combination therapy for at least 8 months, with a scheduled infliximab treatment administrated every 8 weeks for the last 4 months.

 4.

2.

 Source of recruitment Patients are recruited from participating GETAID IBD-centers in France, Belgium and SOIBD IBD-centers in Sweden, and selected centres in UK, Germany, Netherland and Australia 4.

3.

 Inclusion criteria To be eligible all of the following criteria must be met: - Diagnosis of Crohn's disease.

Phase IV Design : Prospective, open-label, randomized three-arms study Main Inclusion criteria Luminal Crohn's disease patients with steroid free remission for at least 6 months and a combination therapy with infliximab and anti-metabolites for at least 8 months Primary objective To demonstrate that Infliximab scheduled maintenance with or without antimetabolites is superior to antimetabolites alone to maintain sustained steroid-free remission over 2 years, while the latter is non inferior with regards to the mean time spent in remission over the same duration Main co-primary end points Clinical relapse rate at 2 years Mean remission duration within 2 years Study treatment Infliximab, Mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate.

 Number of subjects 300 randomized patients (100 per arm) Study duration: 2 + 2 years Enrollment: 2 years + 1 year Follow-up: 2 years
