(secondQuint)Paper Applicator Acceptability Study.

 CAPRISA 070 is designed to enroll rural women who exit from CAPRISA 008 - an ongoing trial assessing implementation, effectiveness and safety of TFV gel in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

 All study participants in CAPRISA 008 have also participated in CAPRISA 004 and thus have several years of experience using TFV gel with the prefilled, plastic applicator.

 CAPRISA 070 will allow us to assess acceptability of the user-filled, paper applicator among women who have had extensive experience with the pre-filled, plastic applicator and are well-positioned to provide feedback and comparisons on a new gel delivery method.
