(thirdQuint)Targeted Chemotherapy Using Focused Ultrasound for Liver Tumours.

 The study is split into two parts.

 Part I will identify optimal FUS exposure parameters for a range of patient BMIs and tumour locations within the liver using real time thermometry data from an implanted thermistor.

 After at least 5 and no more than 14 participants have had the intervention using real-time thermometry, data will be reviewed by the Trial Management Group (TMG) to confirm readiness to proceed without real-time thermometry.

 Part II, which does not require thermistor implantation, is designed to reflect how the therapy would be implemented in clinical practice.

 All evaluable participants from both Part I and Part II will be included in the endpoint analysis.

 To date, purely pharmacological approaches have failed to address what is essentially a threefold challenge: (i) to deliver therapeutically significant concentrations of active agents to the tumour vasculature while minimizing off target effects; (ii) to release the therapeutic agent 'on-demand' at the target site; and, (iii) to improve the distribution and spread of the therapeutic agent against the intra-tumoural pressure gradient in order to achieve a therapeutically relevant concentration throughout the tumour.

 If this study demonstrates successful targeted drug delivery in human subjects using LTSLs released by mild-hyperthermia, this could potentially transform the future of chemotherapy in clinical practice; targeted therapy using LTSLs containing other chemotherapeutic agents triggered non-invasively by mild hyperthermia could be applied to any solid organ cancer.

 This single centre trial is sponsored by the University of Oxford.

 The recruiting study site will be Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust.

 Both have extensive clinical FUS experience.

 The first extracorporeal FUS device in Europe was used for a study performed at Oxford between 2002 and 2004.

 Recent pre-clinical studies performed at Oxford using ThermoDox(R) released using FUS has shown that increased uptake at the target site is achievable.

 Hence there is great promise in using this combination therapy to achieve increased tumour uptake and local dose for the equivalent dose of doxorubicin used in systemic chemotherapy for human subjects, which has a well established and safe toxicity profile.

 Patients receive treatment for 1 day and are followed up for 30 days.

 Targeted Chemotherapy Using Focused Ultrasound for Liver Tumours@highlight

This proof of concept study proposes targeted delivery of a broad-spectrum cytotoxic agent (doxorubicin), via a specially formulated LTSL (ThermoDox(R)) activated by mild hyperthermia, by using focused ultrasound (FUS), to achieve enhanced intra-tumoural doxorubicin concentrations for the same systemic dose.
