(firstQuint)Correlation of In-lab Pleural Fluid Glucose Measurements With a Finger Stick Glucometer and Portable Point of Care Testing Device (i-STAT).

.

 This is a prospective study which will identify patients in VAMC with a diagnosis of pleural effusion and undergoing diagnostic thoracentesis.

The investigators plan to analyze the two bedside point-of-care fluid glucose testing methods (I- STAT device and finger stick glucometer) to measure pleural fluid glucose levels.

 The results obtained from these two methods will be compared to the traditionally in lab measured pleural fluid glucose levels.

@highlight

Pleural fluid glucose levels measured with bed-side point of care methods such as finger stick glucometers and I-STAT device correlate with the traditional in-lab testing methods.
