(fifthQuint)Neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI Chemotherapy Alone for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer.

 Preoperative chemoradiotherapy could improve the local control of locally advanced rectal cancer, but the role was limited, only 5%.

 The adverse event cause by radiotherapy was severe.

 This single phase II trial was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of triplet regimen (FOLFOXIRI) in treating patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

 All patients will receive the study regimen every 2 weeks for 4-6 cycles.

 MRI of the pelvic will be performed after 4 cycles of chemotherapy to assess clinical response.

 If the tumor response over 20% after 4 cycles of treatment, the patient will go to surgery (TME) directly or 2 more cycles of treatment before surgery under the decision of MDT.

 On the contrary, if the tumor show poor response (<20%), radiotherapy will be performed before operation.

 After surgery, 6-8 cycles of mFOLFOX6 will be given as adjuvant chemotherapy.

 Neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI Chemotherapy Alone for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer@highlight

The standard treatment for stage 2/3 rectal cancer is neoadjuvant 5-Fu based chemoradiation.

 However, preoperative radiation cause kinds of adverse events, some were irreversible.

 And the survival benefit was not obvious.

 Whether chemotherapy alone is effective enough in treating rectal cancer is not yet known.

 Here, the investigators chose all the three active cytotoxic agents (5-FU, Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan) as the neoadjuvant treatment regimen (FOLFOXIRI).

 The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of FOLFOXIRI as neoadjuvant regimen in treating patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.
