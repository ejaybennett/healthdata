(fifthQuint)ICU Recovery in Australian Patients.

 The ICU Recovery program will measure psychological, functional and cognitive function and quality of life with health economic outcomes in critically ill patients 6 months after ICU admission.

 The initial pilot study will determine feasibility of the patient outcomes and measurement methods used.

 The study will consist of patients from three (3) Monash Partners ICUs (2 public and 1 private) as well as The Austin Hospital ICU.

 10,000 ICU patients are managed by Monash Partners Academic Health Science Centre (MPAHSC) public and private hospitals each year, of which in the region of 8,500 patients survive.

 These patients add to the community burden and also influence community and rehabilitation costs.

 Ultimately, our goal is to establish a national National Health & Medical Research Council (NHMRC) -funded interventional study, led by Monash Partners.

 Our aim is to improve long-term patient outcomes through: improving sedation practices, delirium prevention, neurocognitive stimulation, early mobilisation, post-ICU follow-up, and functional and psychological rehabilitation.

 This study is required for the evaluation of hospital and post-ICU rehabilitation practice as there is insufficient evidence to alter current clinical practice.

 OBJECTIVES Primary Aim: To determine the feasibility of the multi-centre ICU Recovery study using telephone follow-up to assess quality of life, global, psychological, cognitive and physical outcomes at six months following ICU admission.

 Secondary Aims 1.

 To determine the recovery of ICU patients ventilated >24 hours at 6 months after ICU admission 2.

 To identify risk factors for poor recovery in ICU patients Tertiary Aims 1.

 To establish the likely recruitment rate for future studies of long-term outcomes 2.

 To establish the resource requirements for long term follow-up (including staff, equipment and time taken for survey completion).

 ICU Recovery in Australian Patients@highlight

Increasingly patients with critical illness requiring life support in an intensive care unit are surviving their hospital admission.

 Currently the investigators do not know what effect the ICU admission, and the life support, has on their long-term quality of life and whether they can return to their pre-illness level of function following ICU.

 The investigators aim to test telephone follow-up of ICU survivors in assessing function and quality of life six months after ICU admission.

 Additionally, the investigators will identify if there are factors that lead to poor recovery.

 The investigators hope this can influence and change current ICU practice to improve recovery and long-term outcomes for patients.

 The investigators aim to select a total of 300 patients from ICU, 75 patients from each of the four ICUs.

 If they survive to hospital discharge, patients and their relatives will receive a telephone questionnaire at 6 months after the ICU admission that aims to assess their long-term outcomes, including physical, cognitive and emotional function, quality of life, and whether they have been able to return to work following ICU.
