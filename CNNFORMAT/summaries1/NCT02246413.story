(fifthQuint)Research Aimed at Improving Both Mood and Weight.

 The large numbers of primary care patients affected by coexisting obesity and depression and common risk factors for diabetes and heart disease underscore the urgency of developing effective, accessible, and sustainable interventions that use an integrated, multicondition care management approach.

 The RAINBOW trial will rigorously evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness and potential for "real-world" implementation of an innovative intervention that integrates a behavioral weight loss program and a collaborative stepped care program for depression, incorporates conventional clinic- and home-based modes of care delivery (e.

g.

, office visits plus phone consults and take-home DVD), and leverages low-cost, wide-reach health information technologies (e.

g.

, Web, secure email, and mobile texting).

 Beginning Jan 11, 2016, at least 100 of newly enrolled trial participants will also be consented to undergo additional assays evaluating neurobiological mechanisms of self-regulation, including emotional regulation, cognitive control and self-reflection.

 Given its focus on transforming primary care management of obesity and depression and common cardiometabolic risk factors to evidence-based, patient-centered care, as well as the likely scalability of the proposed intervention, the study has high potential for significant clinical and public health impact.

 Furthermore, elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms of self-regulation will significantly advance precision lifestyle medicine by enabling mechanism-targeted individualization of treatment.

 Research Aimed at Improving Both Mood and Weight@highlight

The RAINBOW study is an NIH R01-funded randomized controlled trial to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness and implementation potential of a primary care integrated multicondition intervention program to help improve mood and weight for obese adults with clinically significant depressive symptoms.

 The ENGAGE study is a mechanistic investigation added to the main trial with funding through the NIH common fund for the Science of Behavior Change roadmap initiative.

 Beginning Jan 11, 2016, at least 100 of newly enrolled trial participants will be consented to undergo additional assays evaluating neurobiological mechanisms of self-regulation.
