(thirdQuint)An Exercise Intervention for Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy.

 This study will assess the feasibility of an exercise intervention to counteract adverse side effects related to ADT in prostate cancer (PCa) patients.

 Specifically, we will use an exercise intervention and assess its impact on bone mass density, Body Mass Index (BMI), hip/waist circumference levels, biomarkers (i.

e.

, glucose, lipids), step count, grip strength, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)).

 In this 8-week two-arm randomized clinical trial, 40 PCa patients receiving ADT will be randomly assigned to an exercise (n=20) or a stretching control group (n=20) with a follow-up at 8-weeks.

This main purpose of this study is to examine the effects of an exercise intervention to counteract adverse side effects related to Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) in prostate cancer patients.

 Specifically, a supervised and home-based exercise program will be used to assess its impact on clinical and behavioral variables related to ADT in prostate cancer patients.
