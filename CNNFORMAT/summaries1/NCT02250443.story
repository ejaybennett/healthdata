(thirdQuint)Study of Long-term Safety, Efficacy Tolerability of BYM338 in Patients With Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis.

 This is a non-confirmatory, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized trial which will extend active treatment to those patients that participated in the preceding proof-of-concept study (CBYM338X2205) in order to collect long-term safety and tolerability data.

 Up to 14 patients with sIBM will be invited to enroll into the study to receive BYM338 open-label for a period of approximately 3 years or until BYM338 is commercially available, whichever comes first.

 The study consists of a maximum 28-day screening period, a 5-day baseline period, and a treatment period consisting of the site visits at 4-week intervals for treatment administration, safety and pharmacokinetic follow-up.

 All patients will be administered a medium level i.

 Study of Long-term Safety, Efficacy Tolerability of BYM338 in Patients With Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis@highlight

This study is an open-label, long-term study for those patients who participated in the prior proof-of-concept protocol, in which the preliminary efficacy for BYM338 in patients with sIBM was demonstrated after a single 30 mg/kg i.

 dose of BYM338.

 This study is designed to confirm the efficacy, safety and tolerability of BYM338 in sIBM with long-term dosing.

 However due to lack of efficacy in patients with sIBM, the study was terminated early.
