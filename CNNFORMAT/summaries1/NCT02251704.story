(thirdQuint)An Epidemiology Study of Malaria Transmission Intensity in Children in Sub-Saharan Africa.

 Nine annual cross sectional surveys at peak transmission will provide point estimates of parasite prevalence and subsequently a longitudinal assessment of the level of endemicity in each area covered by EPI-MAL-002 and EPI-MAL-003.

 This study will be conducted in parallel to EPI-MAL-002 and EPI-MAL-003 in order to assess parasite prevalence and malaria control measures before (EPI-MAL-002) and after (EPI-MAL-003) vaccine introduction.

 By taking into account variations in MTI (malaria transmission intensity) and malaria control intervention coverage, it will be possible to estimate more accurately the vaccine impact on clinical disease during EPI-MAL-003.

 An Epidemiology Study of Malaria Transmission Intensity in Children in Sub-Saharan Africa@highlight

This epidemiology study is planned to run in parallel with the EPI-MAL-002 and EPI-MAL-003 studies, enrolling from the same HDSS (health and demographic surveillance system) (or equivalent system) populations.

 The primary objectives are to produce longitudinal estimates of parasite prevalence in humans, and record malaria control measure usage in areas where EPI-MAL-002 and EPI-MAL-003 studies will take place.
