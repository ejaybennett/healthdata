(thirdQuint)Adaptated Physical Activity in Cancerology.

 This is an open monocentric study, randomized in two parallel arms with a waiting list.

 The duration of the physical activty will vary according to the duration of the treatment: from 2 to 6 months.

 Several questionnaries (fatigue, quality of life, .

.

.

) will be given to patients at the inclusion, at the end of the period of treatment and 3 to 6 months after the end of treatment.

 One hundred patients are necessary in this study (fifty in each arm).

 We expect to a stability of the fatigue in Arm A compared to an increase of the fatigue in arm B.

 Adaptated Physical Activity in Cancerology@highlight

This trial will measure the fatigue in breast cancer patients.

 Two groups of patients will be realised: - Arm A: Physical activity during treatment - Arm B: No physical activity during treatment but after The aim of the study is to decrease fatigue, with adequate physical activity, in primary breast cancer patients who receive a treatment for their pathology.
