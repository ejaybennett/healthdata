(firstQuint)The Regulation of Pulmonary Vascular Resistance in Patients With Heart Failure.

 It is well known that left sided heart disease can lead to pulmonary hypertension via a number of proposed mechanisms.

 The purpose in this study is to identify biomarkers in pulmonary hypertension to further understand the pathophysiology of this disease in patients with heart disease.

Patients are recruited in the cardiac catheterization lab, which are undergoing right heart catheterization as per their plan of care established by their primary cardiologist.

 During the procedure, we will ask the performing cardiologist to obtain a blood sample of 40-50 milliliters from the catheter that they are using during the procedure.

 These blood samples will be sent for analysis of biomarkers.

 The patient will then have an echocardiogram done 1 year from their heart catheterization.

Peripheral blood and blood following a pulmonary wedge pressure will be obtained from patients undergoing right heart catheterizations.
