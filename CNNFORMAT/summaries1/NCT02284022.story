(fifthQuint)Clinical Validation Protocol for BCI for the Communication of Patients Suffering From Neuromuscular Disorders.

.

 This is a pilot study for which 15 patients with myopathies will be included.

 The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerance of a system for communication named P300 speller.

 The P3Speller is a brain computer interface (BCI) that records the brain electric activity with the use of electroencephalography (EEG) and analyzes it in real time in order to identify slight changes generated in relation to a visual stimulation (evoked potentials).

 The identification of such brain potentials is translated into a digital command for a spelling device.

 The secondary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of this spelling device with a more traditional assisitve technology called scanner interface.

 A scanner interface uses single clicks that can be obtaines with an adequate interface which exploits the remaining muscular activity from a patients.

 Every patient will use each interface (P300 sepller and Scanning) with a randomized order.

 Results will bec o,pared in terms of information flow from the patient to the computer expressed in bit rate per minute.

 Clinical Validation Protocol for BCI for the Communication of Patients Suffering From Neuromuscular Disorders.

@highlight

the objective of this protocol is evaluate the safety and tolerance of a communication system for severely disable patients with myopathies.

 The system analyses the brain electric activity in real time and converts it into digital commands for a spelling device, which is refered to as the P300 speller in the scientific literature.

 The secondary objective is to compare the performance of such tool with a more traditional assistive technology for the communication of severely disabled patients : scanner systems.
