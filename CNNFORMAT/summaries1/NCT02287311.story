(fifthQuint)Most Closely Matched 3rd Party Rapidly Generated LMP, BARF1 And EBNA1 Specific CTL, EBV-Positive Lymphoma (MABEL).

 A healthy donor has given blood to make LMP/BARF1/EBNA-1 MABEL CTLs in the lab.

 We made the cells by first growing a special type of cells called activated T cells to stimulate the T cells.

 We then added specially produced mixtures of proteins that include the LMP, EBNA1 and BARF proteins.

 These were used to stimulate T cells.

 As the T cells grew, we added some of the healthy donor cells expressing these proteins to stimulate them.

 We also added a cell called K562 that has had new genes put inside it so it expresses proteins that stimulate the immune system to encourage the T cells to grow.

 K562 cells are cancer cells that have been treated with radiation so they cannot grow.

 This stimulation trains the MABEL CTLs to kill cells with EBV proteins on their surface.

 These cells were grown and frozen.

 For the subject's treatment, the MABEL CTLs will be thawed and infused into the subject over 1-10 minutes.

 Initially, two doses of MABEL CTLs will be given two weeks apart.

 Subjects may be eligible to receive additional doses of the MABEL CTLs up to 6 times.

 All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.

 Medical tests before treatment: Before being treated, the subject will receive a series of standard medical tests: Physical exam; Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function; Tumor measurements by routine imaging studies: Computer Tomogram (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT); Pregnancy test for females who are able to have children.

 Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to proliferate and accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in circulation.

 Because of that, if the patient's level of circulating T cells is relatively high, s/he may require treatment with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and fludarabine before s/he receives MABEL CTLs.

 Medical tests during and after treatment: Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function; Imaging study 8 weeks after the 1st CTL infusion.

 If the subject receives additional doses they will also have an imaging study at 1 to 3 months after their final dose.

 Subjects will either be seen in the clinic or will be contacted by research staff yearly for 5 years.

 Most Closely Matched 3rd Party Rapidly Generated LMP, BARF1 And EBNA1 Specific CTL, EBV-Positive Lymphoma (MABEL)@highlight

The subject has a type of lymph gland disease called Hodgkin Disease (HD) or non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease or severe chronic active Epstein Barr Virus (CAEBV) which has come back, is at risk of coming back, or has not gone away after treatment, including the best treatment we know for these diseases.

 This research study uses special immune system cells called LMP, BARF-1 and EBNA1- specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (MABEL CTLs).

 Some patients with Lymphoma, T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease, or CAEBV show signs of a virus called Epstein Barr virus (EBV) that causes mononucleosis or glandular fever ("mono" or the "kissing disease") before or at the time of their diagnosis.

 EBV is found in cancer cells of up to half the patients with HD and NHL, suggesting that it may play a role in causing Lymphoma.

 The cancer cells (in lymphoma) and some immune system cells (in CAEBV) infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction.

 We want to see if special white blood cells (MABEL CTLs) that have been trained to kill EBV infected cells can survive in your blood and affect the tumor.

 In previous studies, EBV CTLs were generated from the blood of the patient, which was often difficult if the patient had recently received chemotherapy.

 Also, it took up to 1-2 months to make the cells, which is not practical when a patient needs treatment more urgently.

 To address these issues, the T cells in the current study were made in the laboratory in a simpler, faster, and safer way.

 The T cells we have made will still see LMP proteins but also two other EBV proteins called EBNA-1 and BARF.

 These cells are called MABEL CTLs.

 In order to ensure these cells are available for use in patients in urgent clinical need, we have generated MABEL CTLs from the blood of healthy donors and created a bank of these cells, which are frozen until ready for use.

 We have previously successfully used frozen T cells from healthy donors to treat EBV lymphoma and virus infections and we now have improved our production method to make it faster.

 In this study, we want to find out if we can use banked MABEL CTLs to treat HD or NHL, T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease and severe chronic active Epstein Barr Virus (CAEBV).

 We will search the bank to find a MABEL CTL line that is a partial match with the subject.
