(thirdQuint)Excimer Laser Phototherapy Outcomes in the Treatment of Psoriasis.

 This is a randomized, assessor-blinded clinical trial to determine whether a novel plaque-based dosimetry strategy can improve the speed of response to excimer laser treatment in patients with plaque psoriasis.

 Each patient will receive plaque-based dosing on one side of the body and conventional dosing on the contralateral side.

 This design is based on the assumption that psoriasis usually affects patients in a symmetric distribution (e.

g.

, knees and elbows) and the effect of excimer laser phototherapy is limited to the treated plaque.

 The side of the body treated with plaque-based dosimetry will be assigned using a table of random numbers.

 The assessor will be blinded to the treatment group.

 Each patient will be treated 1-2 times per week at the discretion of the investigator for a maximum of 10 treatments.

 Excimer Laser Phototherapy Outcomes in the Treatment of Psoriasis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the best dosing strategy when using Excimer Laser to treat plaque-type psoriasis.

 In this study, half of the body's psoriasis will be treated with a new dosing strategy, and the other half will be treated with the conventional method.

 We hope to show that the new dosing strategy will result in faster improvement of psoriasis.
