(secondQuint)Optimal Timing of Double-Wire Technique For Biliary Cannulation at ERCP.

 Sometimes, in the course of a regular ERCP procedure, techniques used by the doctor to pass a wire into the bile duct can result in the pancreas duct being entered instead.

 When this happens, the doctor may either remove the wire (known as "single wire" technique) or leave it in and use a second wire ("double wire") to enter the bile duct.

 This study will try to determine whether the "double wire" technique or the "single wire" technique removing the wire is the safest and most efficient.

The purpose of this study is to give doctors who perform Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures a better idea as to the best techniques to use in order to examine the bile duct as quickly and safely as possible.
