(firstQuint)Ultrasound Beams as an Adjunct to Reperfusion Therapy in STEMI.

 Patients who had acute STEMI and successfully reperfused by either thrombolytic therapy or primary angioplasty and stenting will be included this study.

 A basal routine echocardiography will be obtained in all patients after reperfusion therapy.

 Thereafter, patients will be divided into two groups: 1.

Treatment group will receive transthoracic echocardiography using Philips HD11 XE (R) for 30 minutes qid for 4 days.

 2.

 Placebo group will have the same Philips HD11 XE (R) echo transducer applied for the same time and duration on their chest but with the ultrasound turned-off.

 Detailed left and right ventricle function as well as performance index and stress-strain imaging will be obtained and analyzed at 3 and 6 months.

Successfully perfused STEMI patients will receive routine transthoracic echocardiography qid for 4 days or placebo.

 Myocardial function and infarct size will be evaluated at 3 and 6 months.
