(fifthQuint)The Effect of Soft Tissue Mobilization in Myofascial Neck Pain.

 According to Janda, postural muscles have tendency to get shorten, in both normal and pathological conditions.

 Upper trapezius, levator scalpulae and scalene are most common postural muscles.

 Additionally, longus colli and longus capitis (DNF) have important role in postural support and their impaired activation leads to neck pain.

 More recently, muscle based treatments approaches for MNP evolved from a passive treatment technique such as myofascial release towards more active treatment technique such as MET and DNF training.

 Group A (N=11) received conventional treatment for 5 days per week for 2 weeks such as MHP (Moist Heat Pack) for 20 minutes, Static Stretching exercises for upper trapezius, levator scapulae and scalene muscle which is held for 10-30 seconds- repeated 3-5 times, Cervical spine non-thrust mobilization (Grade 3) was given to each segment from C2-C7 was oscillated for 10 repetitions, followed by a 10 seconds rest between segments, Cervical spine active ROM (Range of Motion) exercises with 10 repetitions- 2-3 times a day and Postural exercises were given as home programme.

 Group B (N=11) received DNF training along with conventional treatment.

 In this programme, emphasis was placed on first attaining the correct craniocervical flexion action, with minimal activity of the superficial cervical flexor muscles.

 The craniocervical flexion action involves a specific craniocervical movement (nodding - "yes" movement) of head such that it remains in contact with the supporting surface.

 Once the correct action had been achieved, participants were instructed in the use of the sphygmomanometer to guide the training of the Craniocervical Flexors muscle contraction at the various incremental levels of pressure (22 to 30 mmHg, progressively inner range positions).

 Group C (N=11) received MET in additional to conventional treatment.

 MET was applied to Upper trapezius, Levator scapulae and Scalene Following the 7-10 seconds isometric contraction and complete relaxation of all elements, the stretch is maintained for 30 seconds.

 The effort and the counter-pressure should be modest (20% of available strength) and painless.

 The process is repeated 3-5 times.

 The Effect of Soft Tissue Mobilization in Myofascial Neck Pain@highlight

A long term habitual posture with abnormal loading of ligaments and muscles, leads to development of neck pain.

 33 patients including 18 males and 15 females were selected and randomly allocated into three groups using sealed opaque envelope containing treatment allocation.

 Group A (n=11) received conventional treatment such as MHP (Moist Heat Pack), Static Stretching exercises, Cervical spine non-thrust mobilization, Cervical spine active ROM (Range of Motion) exercises and Postural exercises.

 Group B (n=11) received DNF training with conventional treatment.

 Group C (n=11) received Muscle Energy Technique (MET) in additional to conventional treatment.

 Primary outcome measure functional disabilities and secondary measure pain and ROM were recorded at baseline, 7th day and 14th day.

One-way ANOVA was used for within group analysis.

 Repeated measure ANOVA followed by post hoc analysis was employed for between group comparisons.

 The results suggest that there was a significant improvement in mean change scores of Neck Disability Index (NDI), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Range of Motion (ROM) .

Both DNF training and MET have additional therapeutic effects over a standard care by reducing functional disabilities, pain and in improving ROM in mechanical neck pain patients.
