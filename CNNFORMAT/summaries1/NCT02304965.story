(fifthQuint)Activity at Pulse Pressure Above an Individual Threshold in Patients With LVAD.

 The investigators will study 3 cfLVAD patients with low pulse pressure during work package 1 using two different exercises, treadmill and bicycle.

 Walking and cycling present the most commonly used physical activities which are applicable to most individuals on a daily basis.

 The investigators aim to demonstrate that individual changes of pulse pressure during these types of exercise can be assessed in cfLVAD patients.

 In a feasibility study (work package 2) the investigator will enroll 6 cfLVAD patients to perform home-based physical activity programs including walking a defined number of steps per day with a predefined speed and cycling with a predefined power [watt] on a bicycle ergometer.

 The performance of the patients will be monitored over seven days using a wearable activity device.

 Activity at Pulse Pressure Above an Individual Threshold in Patients With LVAD@highlight

Pilot study in patients with continuous flow left ventricular assist device (cfLVAD) to proof the feasibility of a specific individual training at home aimed to increase pulse pressure above a predefined threshold which might attenuate the loss of arterial wall thickness.

 Hypothesis: Increasing daily physical activity near to normal (> 10.

000 steps per day) with a pre-defined level of pulse pressure (intensity) is a realizable and feasible approach to investigate changes in arterial wall thickness and cardio-respiratory capacity in cfLVAD patients.
