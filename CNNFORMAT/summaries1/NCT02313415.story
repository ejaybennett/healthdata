(secondQuint)Treatment of Infertility by Collagen Scaffold Loaded With Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchyma Stem Cells.

 Infertility is defined as a women fails to become pregnant after having a normal sex life for two years without contraception.

 There is limited treatment to the infertility caused by severe IUA especially recurrent IUA after adhesiolysis which hinders embryos implantation.

 The existing drugs, physical or surgical treatments had no significant effects to severe recurrent intrauterine adhesions.

 Collagen is the main component of the extracellular matrix with good biocompatibility, UC-MSCs have been used in the clinical treatment of diseases, and achieved good results.

 In this study, collagen scaffold and umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells are combined, and they showed good biological safety.
