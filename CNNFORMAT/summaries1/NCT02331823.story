(secondQuint)Research on New Regimens for Retreatment Pulmonary Tuberculosis.

 China is the country with the second highest Tuberculosis (TB) burden in the world.

 Most of the retreatment TB patients may develop multi-drug resistant.

 The resistant rate of any of the anti-TB drug is 35.

9%, and the multi-drug resistant rate is 15.

4%.

 Retreatment TB becomes one of the factors which inhibit the decrease of morbidity and mortality of TB.

 It is also a tuff work in TB control.

 At present the standardized regimen for retreatment TB is 2SHREZ/6HRE or 3HREZ/6HRE.

 The drugs in the regimen are all first-line anti-TB drugs which are unsuitable for the high drug resistance prevalence, because the cure rate of this regimen is low and the adverse reaction is severe.

 Our study is a national multi-center, prospective trail to investigate the efficacy of a new super-short regimen for retreatment TB patients.

 The new regimen consists of 5 drugs lasting 5 months.

 The cure rate and success rate of the new regimen is compared with standardized regimen usually 8-9 months in order to obtain the optimized regimen.
