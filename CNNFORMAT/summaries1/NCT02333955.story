(firstQuint)A Phase 2 Extension of Study GCS-100-CS-4003.

 Galectin-3 contributes to fibrosis, is elevated in patients with ESRD, and correlates with adverse outcomes (de Boer et.

 al.

, 2011, Dang et.

 al.

, 2012, Fernandes Bertocchi et.

 al.

, 2008, Henderson et.

 al.

, 2008).

 Animal models with genetic knockout of galectin-3 demonstrate a reduction in structural and functional deficits in the kidney (Dang et.

 al.

, 2012, Fernandes Bertocchi et.

 al.

, 2008, Henderson et.

 al.

, 2008).

 GCS-100 is a galectin-3 antagonist that has been shown to reduce fibrosis pre-clinically.

 Based on the role of galectin-3 and fibrosis in kidney disease, the Sponsor believes GCS-100 may be effective at treating patients with CKD.

 This study will consist of a fixed dose of GCS-100 3mg IV push at least every 30 days for a total of 1 year with a follow-up 4 weeks after the last dose is administered.

 A Phase 2 Extension of Study GCS-100-CS-4003@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of extended dosing with a fixed dose of GCS-100 3 mg IV push in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
