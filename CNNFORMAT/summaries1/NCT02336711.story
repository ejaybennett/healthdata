(firstQuint)Molecular Imaging-based Dose Escalation in HPV Negative Patients With Locally Advanced SCC of the Oropharynx.

 The objective is to assess the feasibility (i.

e.

 early toxicity) of an adaptive dose escalation through 18F-FDG-PET-based dose painting by numbers in 10 HPV negative patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx.

 Treatment will be delivered with Helical Tomotherapy(R) or volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT).

 Dose adaptation will be performed at 2 time-points with per-treatment 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans.
