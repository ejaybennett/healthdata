(fifthQuint)Individual PE vs Couples' CBT for Combat-Related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

 The purpose of the proposed study is to examine the effects of Cognitive-Behavioral treatments for PTSD on PTSD symptoms and relationship functioning in active duty military personnel who have recently returned from combat deployment to Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), or Operation New Dawn (OND) and their partners.

 Research indicates that PTSD is associated with high levels of relationship distress [8-12].

 We will compare a treatment specifically designed to incorporate partners, Cognitive-Behavioral Couples Therapy (CBCT), with an established therapy that focuses on treatment of the individual, Prolonged Exposure (PE).

 CBCT includes techniques designed both to promote support for the traumatized individual and reduce relationship distress; whereas, PE focuses solely on PTSD symptoms and treats only the patient with PTSD.

 Therefore, we expect to see greater improvement in intimate relationship functioning with CBCT than with PE, while remaining equally effective in reducing PTSD symptomatology.

 Our specific hypotheses are as follows: 1.

 Cognitive-Behavioral Couples Therapy (CBCT) and Prolonged Exposure (PE) will be equally effective in reducing PTSD symptoms in a sample of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans, as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the PTSD Checklist - Stressor Specific Version (PCL-S).

 2.

 CBCT for PTSD will be more effective than PE in improving relationship distress in a sample of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans and their partners, as measured by the Couples Satisfaction Index.

 3.

 CBCT for PTSD will have significantly greater impact than PE on measures of relationship functioning (e.

g.

, intimacy, conflict, aggression) in a sample of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans and their partners.

 Individual PE vs Couples' CBT for Combat-Related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder@highlight

This study seeks to enroll 76 couples in which one of the members is a combat-veteran with PTSD.

 Each couple will be randomized into one of two cognitive-behavioral therapies developed specifically as a treatment for PTSD-either Prolonged Exposure (PE) [1-4] or Cognitive-Behavioral Couples Therapy (CBCT) [5-7].

 Whereas, PE was developed as a one-on-one therapy that focuses on treating the individual, CBCT for PTSD incorporates the partners into therapy and seeks to directly address relationship functioning while treating the PTSD symptomatology.

 Both partners in each couple will complete a battery of several assessments measuring various aspects of psychological distress (e.

g.

, depression, PTSD) and relationship functioning at five time-points throughout the study.

 But, only the partners assigned to the CBCT group will be involved in the actual therapy sessions.

 Analysis will be carried out to identify whether any significant differences exist between PE and CBCT in treating PTSD and improving relationship functioning.
