(fifthQuint)Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibition and Narrow-band Ultraviolet-B Light in Psoriasis (DINUP).

 Background: Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease affecting approximately 2% of the world's population.

 It is characterised by keratinocyte hyperproliferation, by aberrant keratinocyte differentiation and by cutaneous inflammation.

 Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is expressed on keratinocytes and its activity is upregulated in psoriasis.

 DPP-4 inhibition suppresses keratinocyte proliferation and restores partially keratinocyte differentiation.

 The main site of DPP-4 activity is cluster of differentiation antigen 26 (CD26).

 CD26 is a marker of T cell activation and is a key molecule in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.

 One case of DPP-4 inhibitor therapy improving psoriasis severity has been reported.

 Agents used to treat psoriasis target commonly the underlying inflammation.

 C-reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive, systemic marker of inflammation.

 In people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) DPP-4 inhibitor therapy decreases CRP concentrations.

 Serum CRP concentrations correlate with psoriasis severity and interventions that decrease the CRP concentration may decrease also psoriasis severity.

 Medications that improve insulin resistance may decrease also systemic inflammation and improve psoriasis.

 We have shown previously, in psoriasis patients without T2DM (both lean and obese), that the fasting insulin concentration and the homeostatic model of insulin resistance (measures of insulin resistance) correlate strongly with the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI, a measure of psoriasis severity: r=0.

48, p 38mmol/mol), BMI level (BMI 30 kg/m2) and previous response to NB-UVB (achieved remission within 25 exposures during most recent course of NBUVB or not) either to Arm A or to Arm B.

 Those who have not been exposed previously to NBUVB will be placed in the "did not achieve remission within 25 exposures" group.

 Research participants allocated to Arm A will receive a twenty six week supply of Januvia(R) tablets (DPP-4 Inhibitor) and will be instructed to ingest orally one 100mg tablet once daily (or 50mg once daily for participants with moderate kidney disease) for twenty four weeks.

 Research participants allocated to Arm B will receive no treatment (aside from usual medications and phototherapy).

 Both the research participants and the investigators will be aware of the trial arm to which the research participant has been allocated randomly (open-label study).

 Research participants will be prohibited from making any changes to the dose of medications used to treat psoriasis.

 Any other medications that are considered necessary for the participant's welfare and will not interfere with the study medication may be given at the discretion of the Investigator.

 Januvia(R) is licensed to improve glycaemic control for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

 The Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) states that the dose of Januvia(R) is 100mg once daily (using tablets for oral ingestion).

 For research participants with moderate kidney disease (CrCl C in secure, dedicated freezers in the Research Laboratories in the Education and Research Centre in St Vincent's University Hospital.

 The blood will be stored within 12 hours of blood collection.

 Blood that has been stored for future DNA extraction will be destroyed once the DNA analyses are complete.

 Disposal of this material will be in accordance with current practice in this unit and with the written protocols in place in this unit.

 Disposal will involve the use of solid plastic waste containers which will be sent for incineration.

 To protect the research participant's identity, a unique identification code will be assigned by the Investigator, or authorised designee, to each participant's genetic sample and used in lieu of the participant's name.

 This coded form of identification, instead of the participant's name, will appear on all documents/databases.

 Statistical Analysis Plan: Demographic and baseline clinical data will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group.

 Similarly, the primary and secondary efficacy variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group.

 Data from research participants who are not allocated to either arm of the study and who do not receive a supply of the investigational medicinal product will be excluded from statistical analyses.

 T tests (or the appropriate alternative for non-parametric data), using two-sided tests, will be used to test for significant differences between the sets of data obtained.

 The independent samples T test will be used to assess for differences between the effects of the test product (Januvia(R)) compared to the effects of no additional treatment.

 Chi square analyses will be used to test for significant differences in categorical variables between the sets of data obtained.

 Subgroup analyses will be performed on those research participants who: complete the visit 6 assessment; have severe psoriasis; have non-severe psoriasis; are male; are female; are obese; and are older than 45 years.

 Packaging and Labelling: All study medication will be labelled and stored in accordance with Annex 13 of the EU guidelines of good manufacturing practice in respect of investigational medicinal products for human use, the SPC and hospital procedures.

 Screening visit (Visit 1, Week -3) Before any screening examinations take place potentially eligible research participants will be given a full explanation as to what participation in the study would involve - this will be done both verbally and in writing in the form of a written participant information leaflet.

 Potential research participants will be given sufficient time to consider their participation in the study and to ask any questions concerning the study.

 Potential research participants who are willing to take part in the study will be asked then to sign an informed consent form.

 No study related procedures will take place for any research participant before the informed consent form has been signed.

 The following assessments will then be performed: 1.

 Checking against inclusion and exclusion criteria; 2.

 Obtaining demographic information; 3.

 Obtaining a detailed medical history (previously diagnosed illnesses etc); 4.

 Obtaining a detailed medication history for the previous month; 5.

 Measurement of weight, blood pressure and heart rate; 6.

 Performing a urine based pregnancy test (women of child bearing potential only); 7.

 Assessment of PASI; and 8.

 Blood sampling for laboratory examination.

 An identification number will be allocated to the potential research participant following informed consent and provided that he or she meets the inclusion criteria and does not have an exclusion criterion to study entry.

 This identification number, together with the participant's initials, will act as a unique identifier for that participant.

 Baseline (Visit 2, Day 0) The potential research participant will return for the baseline visit within three weeks of the screening visit.

 The following assessments will be performed: 1.

 Completion of quality of life questionnaires by the research participant (Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI); EuroQol five item questionnaire (EQ-5D); Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); and Stanford HAQ 8-Item Disability Scale (HAQ-8) ; 2.

 Recording of adverse events; 3.

 Recording of changes in concomitant medication; 4.

 Measurement of height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate; 5.

 Performing a urine based pregnancy test (women of child bearing potential only); 6.

 Assessment of PASI; and 7.

 Blood sampling for laboratory examination.

 If the participant is willing a skin biopsy will be performed, using a sterile technique by an experienced physician, to determine skin immune cell number and skin pro-inflammatory protein level.

 If a participant is noted to score greater than 8 (out of 21) on either the anxiety or the depression components of the HADS, at this or any subsequent study visits, their General Practitioner (GP) will be advised of this and of the high likelihood of depressive/affective mental illness which may require treatment.

 The investigator, or authorised designee, will allocate then the research participant to a trial treatment arm using one of sixteen (8 per centre) prepared randomisation lists.

 The investigator, or authorised designee, will chose the appropriate list based on the participant's centre, HbA1c level (HbA1c 38mmol/mol), BMI level (BMI 30kg/m2) and previous response to NB-UVB (achieved remission within 25 exposures during most recent course of NBUVB or not).

 Those who have not been exposed previously to NBUVB will be placed in the "did not achieve remission within 25 exposures" group.

 For research participants allocated randomly to treatment arm A the investigator, or authorised designee, will ask the participant to bring back all used and unused Januvia(R) tablet packages at each study visit to enable a pill compliance check to be performed.

 The research participant's involvement in this study will end following the completion of the End of Study Visit (or Early Withdrawal visit if applicable).

 Once participants have completed their involvement in this study they will be provided with standard treatment by their usual healthcare providers.

 Adverse Events: Comprehensive assessments of any apparent toxicity experienced by the research participant will be performed throughout the course of the study from the time of participant's signature of informed consent.

 Adverse events (AEs) considered related to Study Drug at the End of Study Visit (or Early Withdrawal Visit, if applicable) will be followed until the participant is stable or the AE is resolved or the participant is lost to follow-up.

 Any medical condition, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the Baseline Visit and not related to a protocol-associated procedure, is not an AE.

 It will be considered to be pre-existing.

 Complete and appropriate data on all Adverse Events experienced (observed, volunteered or elicited) during the reporting period will be reported on an ongoing basis in the Adverse Event Form pages of the Case Report Form.

 The investigator will classify the severity of an adverse event.

 The investigator will systematically assess the relationship of the adverse event to the investigational medicinal product.

 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Information about all SAEs will be collected and recorded on the SAE Report Form.

 Each SAE must be reported by the Investigator, or an authorised designee, to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.

 Medical and scientific judgement will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation, but may jeopardise the research participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.

 These will be considered also serious.

 Justification of Population and Method of Estimation: We plan to enrol 120 research participants in total in the two sites.

 The primary objective of the research project is to determine the change in the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) during twenty four weeks of treatment with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (Januvia(R), 100mg daily or 50mg daily for participants with moderate kidney disease) in psoriasis patients undergoing narrow-band ultraviolet-B (NB-UVB) light therapy.

 This will be compared to the PASI of psoriasis patients undergoing NB-UVB light therapy who are allocated randomly to not receive any additional treatment.

 Kleinpenning et al have determined previously the effect of two different NB-UVB light therapy regimens on the decrease in PASI three months after completion of a course of NB-UVB light therapy.

 Three months after cessation of NB-UVB light therapy the decrease in the PASI in those receiving an high-dose regimen was 5.

 This decrease in PASI was significantly less in the group receiving a low-dose regimen (4.

96, pPASI with 80% power and a 5% significance level.

 Method of Randomisation: The unit of randomisation will be the individual research participant.

 After stratification by centre, by HbA1c level (HbA1c 38mmol/mol), BMI level (BMI 30 kg/m2) and previous response to NB-UVB (achieved remission within 25 exposures during most recent course of NBUVB or not) 120 research participants will be assigned randomly, in a ratio of 1:1 using blocks of 2, to receive either: Januvia(R) tablets; OR No additional treatment.

 In order to achieve this we have prepared 8 randomisation lists using a web-based random generator programme.

 One copy of this document will be used for each centre.

 For each participant the investigator, or authorised designee, will chose the appropriate list and will add the participant's identifier to the list in chronological order.

 This list will be thereby used to determine the study treatment which the participant will receive.

 Random allocation will occur at visit 2 (baseline visit) once all screening procedures required at visit 1 (screening visit) have been completed, once it has been confirmed that the participant satisfies all inclusion and exclusion criteria and once the participant completes the three week run-in period.

 Identification numbers will be assigned chronologically in consecutive, ascending order.

 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval: Before initiating this study the Study Protocol, Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), Patient Information Leaflet and Informed Consent Form, applicable advertising, and any other written information to be given to participants will be reviewed and approved by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC/IRB).

 A signed and dated statement that all documents submitted for review have been approved by the IEC/IRB will be given to the Sponsor or designee before the study can commence at a site.

 The membership and the constitution of the IEC/IRB who approved the documents will be also supplied to the Sponsor or designee.

 Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibition and Narrow-band Ultraviolet-B Light in Psoriasis (DINUP)@highlight

The primary purpose of this study is to determine if sitagliptin (Januvia(R)) improves psoriasis severity after 24 weeks of treatment in 60 participants with psoriasis who do not have type 2 diabetes mellitus, and who are due to receive a course of narrowband ultraviolet-B phototherapy (NB-UVB).

 The investigators will compare the change in psoriasis severity in 60 participants treated with both sitagliptin and NB-UVB to 60 participants treated with NB-UVB alone.

 Participants will be recruited from two centres and after a 3 week run-in period will be followed prospectively for 36 weeks.

 Participants will be stratified by centre, plasma glycated haemoglobin level (HbA1c), obesity status and previous response to NB-UVB, after which they will be randomly allocated to Arm A or Arm B.

 Participants will be treated with either sitagliptin for 24 weeks and NB-UVB (Arm A), or NB-UVB alone (Arm B).

 Both the research participants and the investigators will be aware of the trial arm to which the research participant has been allocated randomly (open-label study).

 Research participants are prohibited from using systemic psoriasis therapy for the duration of their trial involvement.

 Participants will be assessed at 8 study visits over 39 weeks.

 Participants will complete questionnaires, have a medical history recorded and physical examination, blood sampling and skin biopsies taken (in a small number of willing participants at 2 visits).

 The following endpoints will be analysed: Changes in psoriasis severity at 24 and 36 weeks; changes in validated quality of life scores; incidence of adverse events; incidence of discontinuation of one of the study IMPs, time to relapse of psoriasis; changes in cardiovascular disease risk factor profiles; changes in cytokines, hormones, expression of immune proteins in blood and skin biopsies; and genetic profiles that predicts best response to sitagliptin therapy.

 The investigators hypothesize that sitagliptin therapy decreases psoriasis severity.
