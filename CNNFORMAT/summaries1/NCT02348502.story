(fifthQuint)Sustained Viral Response in Patients Achieved HBsAg Level100 IU/ml After Completed Interferon Treatment.

 The patients with chronic hepatitis B and achieved HBsAg level100 IU/ml after completed interferon treatment will be enrolled and observed for 96 weeks.

 Serum HBV DNA, HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe will be measured every 3 months during the observation period, liver function tests were performed every 3 months also.

 The liver ultrasonic examination would be taken every 3-6 months.

 The primary endpoint is HBV DNA reaction.

 The secondary endpoints is HBsAg loss.

 Sustained Viral Response in Patients Achieved HBsAg Level100 IU/ml After Completed Interferon Treatment@highlight

Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a serious liver disease worldwide, and the leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

 HBsAg loss/seroconversion is considered to be the ideal endpoint of antiviral therapy in both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients, and the ultimate treatment goal in CHB, However HBsAg loss occurred rarely by interferon treatment.

 Although It was reported that in nature history HBsAg level100 IU/ml can bring good long term outcomes in patients with chronic hepatitis B.

 it was not clear whether patients who achieved HBsAg level100 IU/ml by interferon treatment could maintain sustained viral response and the state of HBsAg level100 IU/ml.
