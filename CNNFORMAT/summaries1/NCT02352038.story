(fifthQuint)Randomized Controlled Trial of a Novel Laser-aided Orthodontic-periodontal Treatment Strategy.

 On the basis of the investigators' pilot study results, 35 patients with chronic periodontitis will be recruited and initially treated for inflammation.

 Using a randomized split-mouth design,the teeth in experimental (laser) group will receive LLLT while the teeth in the control (placebo) group will receive no laser treatment.

 The effects of LLLT in orthodontic-periodontal treatment on periodontal inflammation control, jawbone remodeling, reduction of tooth sensitivity, pain relief and quality of life will be investigated.

The aim of the study is to assess the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in patients with periodontitis during orthodontic-periodontal treatment for 12 months on the following aspects: (1) Effects on periodontal status; (2) Effects on alveolar bone remodeling; (3) Effects on cervical dentin sensitivity; (4) Effects on pain and quality of life.

 To eliminate any bias, the investigators will initially hypothesize that there is no difference in periodontal status, jawbone remodeling, tooth sensitivity, pain and quality of life in patients having teeth with chronic periodontitis and receiving LLLT with orthodontic treatment versus teeth undergoing orthodontic treatment without incorporation of LLLT.
