(fifthQuint)Improve the Quality of Care in Patients With Orthopaedic Disorders.

 The investigators will recruit patients with orthopedic disorders on voluntary basis through department in St Luc Hospital in Brussels, old of 0 to 90 years, men and women with muscular-skeletal impairments (arthrosis, bone or muscle injury, .

.

.

.

).

 The investigators will exclude patients with multiple pathologies or not able to understand the instructions.

 They thus impropre the effectiveness of the treatment in Orthopaedics by better defining the route of most effective surgical first for the patient in arthroplasty (mini invasive, posterior, anterior), the most appropriate knee prosthesis type (design of prothesis), the conservative treatment properly to improve the quality of life of patients with orthopedic disorders (plaster, brace, physiotherapy.

.

.

).

 They will evaluate the impact of treatments at the structural level (bone structure, muscle, etc.

), at the functional level (mobility, strength, stiffness.

.

.

), on the restriction of activities of patients (walking, make its care daily.

.

) and on the limitation of participation in the life of every day (sport, work, social life, cultural.

.

.

) following the ICF-WHO model.

 In addition, they will dispose of data necessary to better define the surgical precision (international organization for standardization ISO Norm), the quality of surgical care by analyzing data collected by high-precision tools at the surgical treatments.

 Patients will be subject to different clinical assessments, fill out questionnaires or come to the laboratory for analysis of the movement depending on the goal defined for each patient.

 Patients will have their current clinical follow-up (RX, scanner, mobility, force measurement, stiffness.

.

.

) which the investigators be able to join a quantified analysis of the movement in the laboratory, satisfaction questionnaires, questionnaires measuring the impact of treatment on quality of life and their restriction of activities.

 It is a broad-spectrum study to try to improve the quality of care within a service target of orthopedics.

 Improve the Quality of Care in Patients With Orthopaedic Disorders@highlight

The main objective of the investigators is to improve the quality of care in patients with orthopedic disorders followed in St Luc hospital (Brussels Belgium).

 To do this, the investigators want to assess the impact of Orthopedic treatments at the structural level (bone structure, muscle, etc.

), at the functional level (mobility, strength, stiffness.

.

.

), on the restriction of activities of patients (walking, make its care daily.

.

) and on the limitation of participation in the life of every day (sport, work, social life, cultural.

.

.

).

 This functional evaluation of patients with orthopedic disorders by the ICF model is an original approach rarely used in muscular-skeletal impairments that can very improve the management of these patients and their quality of life.

 In addition, the investigators associate the harvesting of all medical and computer data collected by high-precision tools in the surgical treatments, to better define the surgical precision and improve the quality of surgical care.
