 ASART-1 study is the first step of clinical evaluation of infliximab biosimilar manufactured by JSC BIOCAD, Russia.

The aim of this study is to establish that BCD-055 is equivalent to Remicade in terms of pharmacokinetics and safety when used by the standard regimen in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

 The study will enroll 90 patients with active AS, who will be randomized into 2 groups (1:1 ratio): patients from the first group will receive BCD-055 IV at a dose 5 mg/kg on week 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22; patients from the second group will receive Remicade at the same regimen.
