(thirdQuint)Normal Quantitative EEG (qEEG) Dataset.

 This is a pilot, prospective, non-comparative, non-invasive, minimal risk research study to obtain qEEG data on normal, healthy individuals to include in a normal control database for use in comparison with patients with CO poisoning and other types of brain injury.

 The use of anti-depressant medication use is relatively common in the general adult population.

 There is varying opinion whether anti-depressant medication alters an otherwise normal clinical EEG.

 We have included healthy individuals taking anti-depressant medication to determine if those medications influence the EEG.

 The EEG data will be collected, analyzed, and stored for use in future research studies and for clinical care.

 Evaluating patients with qEEG methodology may assist in diagnosis and treatment.

 Normal Quantitative EEG (qEEG) Dataset@highlight

In this study, the investigators will collect EEG data in normal, healthy volunteers without a history of prior brain injury.

 This data will be analyzed by computer (quantitative, or qEEG) and stored in a normative database so that, in the future, the investigators can better understand and characterize the brain damage that can result from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and other types of brain injury.
