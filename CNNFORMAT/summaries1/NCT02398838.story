(secondQuint)Acceptability and Feasibility of a Simplified Medical Abortion Regimen in Georgia.

 The study recruited women with pregnancies up to 63 days gestation.

 Eligible women took 200 mg mifepristone.

 Two days later they took 400 mcg buccal misoprostol, with the option of doing so in the clinic or at home.

 They underwent clinic follow-up 12-15 days after taking mifepristone to determine if their medical abortions were complete.

 The study assessed the regimen's efficacy, women's preferences regarding where to administer the medications, and the acceptability of buccal misoprostol and of side effects that accompanied women's medical abortions.
