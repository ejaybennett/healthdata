(secondQuint)Normal Values for Esophageal High Resolution Manometry in an Advanced Protocol Including Liquid Swallows and a Solid Test Meal.

 The investigators will recruit healthy volunteers and ask for study participation.

 After providing informed consent, participants will be questioned using standardized questionnaires assessing symptoms of reflux, dysphagia, gastrointestinal symptom burden and depression.

 Participants will be tested using our advanced protocol for high resolution esophageal manometry.

 This protocol includes individual liquid swallows, free drinking of water, a standardized test meal (200g rice) and a postprandial observational period.

 Normal values for liquid and solid swallows will be determined.

 Normal Values for Esophageal High Resolution Manometry in an Advanced Protocol Including Liquid Swallows and a Solid Test Meal@highlight

Normal values for measurements of high resolution manometry in a protocol which includes isolated liquid swallows in upright and recumbent position, free drinking of water, a solid test meal and a postprandial observational period will be determined.
