(firstQuint)Tooth Bleaching for Young Patients Using a Hydrogen Peroxide-based Gel.

 A randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted with 53 patients aged 11 to 24 years who were allocated to groups based on the use of the following commercial products: Whiteness HP - FGM(R) (35% hydrogen peroxide); Whiteness HP Blue Calcium - FGM(R) (35% hydrogen peroxide); and Whiteness HP Blue Calcium - FGM(R) (20% hydrogen peroxide).

 After the bleaching procedure, the visual analog scale was used to measure tooth sensitivity and the classic Vita(R) scale was used to determine changes in tooth color.

 Statistical analysis involved the Friedman, Kruskal-Wallis and Student-Newman-Keuls tests, with p-value 0.

05 or 0.

0001 considered indicative of statistical significance.
