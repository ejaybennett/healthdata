(firstQuint)CAR-T Hepatic Artery Infusions and Sir-Spheres for Liver Metastases.

 Patients undergo leukapheresis from which peripheral blood mononuclear cells are purified.

 T cells are activated and then re-engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) specific for CEA.

 Cells are expanded in culture and returned to the patient by percutaneous hepatic artery infusion at specific cell doses.

 Prior to the first dose, each patient will undergo diagnostic angiography to verify suitable arterial anatomy.

 Three anti-CEA CAR-T doses and one SIR-Sphere dose per patient are planned at 2-week intervals.

 Low dose interleukin-2 will be given via an ambulatory infusion pump for 6 weeks.

Normal liver and tumor biopsies will be obtained at the time of the initial diagnostic angiogram and during the final infusion session.
