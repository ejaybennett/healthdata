(secondQuint)Evaluation of Intraarticular Tranexamic Acid to Reduction of Total Blood Loss Following Knee-Arthroplasty.

 Intravenous (IV) Tranexamic acid is already well-established and well-documented regarding significant effect on reducing blood loss following knee replacement.

 A few studies more shown a similar effect of intraarticular (IA) injected Tranexamic acid into the knee joint at the end of surgery for knee replacement.

 In this study investigators therefore investigate the possible combined effect of added intraarticular tranexamic acid to conventional intravenous Tranexamic acid.
