(thirdQuint)VR-treadmill Combined Intervention for Enhancing Mobility and Cognitive Function in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis.

 A prospective, single blinded,randomized controlled trial with 6 month follow-up will be employed to investigate the effects of treadmill training augmented with virtual reality on patients with MS.

 The study will include 200 participants.

 Participants will be randomized to either the intervention or active comparator.

 The intervention group will receive 18 sessions of Treadmill Training with Virtual Reality (TT+VR) and the active control comparison will receive 18 training sessions of treadmill training alone (TT) without the VR simulation All interventions will be delivered by therapists trained in the standard protocols.

 All subjects will be trained 3 times a week for 6 weeks, each session will last approximately 45 minutes.

Training progression will be based on increasing both motor and cognitive challenges, individualized to the participant's level of performance.

 VR-treadmill Combined Intervention for Enhancing Mobility and Cognitive Function in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis@highlight

A prospective, randomized controlled single-blind trial will test the hypotheses that a 6- week intervention that combines treadmill training (TT) with virtual reality (VR) significantly improves real-life, functional mobility and cognitive abilities, keys to health-related quality of life in patients with MS.
