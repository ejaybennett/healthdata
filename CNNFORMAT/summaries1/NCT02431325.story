(fifthQuint)A Study of the Gut Barrier and Blood Vessel Inflammation in Individuals With and Without HIV.

 As more people with HIV gain access to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent and a significant cause of mortality.

 Activation of the innate immune system may stimulate inflammatory mechanisms of atherosclerosis development.

 Loss of gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal epithelial integrity and loss of CD4+ T-lymphocytes in the intestinal lamina propria occur in HIV-infected patients and are not fully restored by cART.

 Translocation of microbial products from the intestinal lumen into the systemic circulation has been demonstrated to be increased in HIV-infected patients and the investigators hypothesize that it is a key driver of monocyte and macrophage activation.

 In turn, these pro-inflammatory monocytes and macrophages can induce atherosclerotic disease development.

 The purpose of the research study is to determine the effects of a glucagon-like peptide-2 analog, teduglutide, on intestinal epithelial integrity, microbial translocation across the gut lumen, markers of innate immune system activation including the monocyte transcriptome, bone, arterial inflammation, and atherosclerosis in a 6-month randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled proof of concept trial in HIV-infected individuals.

 A Study of the Gut Barrier and Blood Vessel Inflammation in Individuals With and Without HIV@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to determine whether teduglutide can repair a "leaky" gut, decrease inflammation, and prevent or treat plaque, a build-up of fat and other materials in the blood vessels of the heart, in people with HIV.

 HIV disease is linked to inflammatory changes and leakiness of the gut.

 These changes or conditions may increase the risk of developing heart and blood vessel disease.

 The investigators believe teduglutide can help repair the gut barrier in people with HIV, leading to a decrease in inflammation and plaque in the blood vessels of the heart.
