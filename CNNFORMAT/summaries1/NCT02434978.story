(firstQuint)Doppler-guided Endoscopic Treatment in Peptic Ulcer Bleeding.

 This study evaluates if performance of a control endoscopy with doppler-guided endoscopic treatment is associated with an improved outcome in term of lower rate of rebleeding and lower rate of bleeding-related mortality.

 A potential risk of increased risk of complications (in particular perforation) among patients treated with control endoscopy is also evaluated.

 Outcomes are prospectively registered based on patient records.
