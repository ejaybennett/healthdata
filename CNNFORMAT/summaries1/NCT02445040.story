(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of the Draeger Babylog VN500 Device in HFOV Mode in VLBW Neonates.

 Results from this single-arm, multi-center clinical study are intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Babylog VN500 device in high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) mode in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates of 23 to 30 weeks' gestational age (400 g to 1200 g, inclusive) with documented respiratory distress requiring invasive respiratory support.

 The safety will be determined by evaluating the rate of subjects alive at Day 32 and free of Grade III/IV intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or cystic periventricular leukomalacia.

 Evaluation of the Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient 12 hours after start of ventilation will account for the effectiveness.
