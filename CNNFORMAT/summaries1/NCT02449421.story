(fifthQuint)Sustaining and Improving Clinicians' Use of Evidence-Based Psychotherapy (EBP) for PTSD.

 This project will compare two different methods of post-training support to promote sustained and improved CPT delivery: Fidelity-oriented learning community (FID-LC) and Continuous Quality Improvement Learning Community (CQI-LC).

 Clinics in which clinicians have previously received CPT training will be randomly assigned to one of these conditions.

 Outcomes will be observed changes in patient symptoms during and following treatment, independent expert assessment of clinician fidelity and adaptations in delivering the psychotherapy (via audio-recordings), proportion of eligible caseloads that receive CPT, and capacity to deliver CPT.

 Data will also be collected to assess clinician and setting characteristics that may contribute to the success of each strategy.

 The study results will help inform how best to support the ongoing implementation and benefits of evidence-based psychotherapy (e.

g.

, CPT) in routine clinical settings.

 This is a knowledge translation project in partnership with 3 systems; VA Canada, U.

 Veterans Health Care System and the National Centre for PTSD.

 Sustaining and Improving Clinicians' Use of Evidence-Based Psychotherapy (EBP) for PTSD@highlight

The purpose of the study is to compare the impact of two strategies to sustain and improve the delivery of an evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) in three different mental health systems.

 These approaches are based on two different theories of what is necessary to promote successful implementation.

 We will examine whether these strategies lead to improved patient outcomes, clinician skill, proportion of clients who receive CPT, and other outcomes that are relevant to the implementation of evidence-based psychosocial treatments.

 By examining these questions in 3 different mental health systems, we will also examine whether the implementation strategies yield different results in different systems.
