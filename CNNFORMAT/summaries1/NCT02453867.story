(firstQuint)Efficacy and Safety of a Reduced Immunosuppression vs.

 Standard Triple Therapy in Senior Renal Transplant Recipients.

 Study outline Stable senior transplant recipients (>65 years of age) participating in the European SENIOR transplant registry may enter the trial at month 3 post-transplant, if they fulfil all of the in- and none of the exclusion criteria.

 At this time patients will be randomized 1:1 either to continue Reference therapy: Tacrolimus once daily (Advagraf(R)) Mycophenolate (either MMF 1g/d or EC-MPS 720g/d) Steroids (5mg prednisolone or equivalent) or to Investigational therapy: Tacrolimus once daily (Advagraf(R)) Steroid stop at month 3 (tapering within 2 weeks) Mycophenolate stop at month 6.
