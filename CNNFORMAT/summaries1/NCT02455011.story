(thirdQuint)Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of REMD-477 in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

 The study will consist of three parts: Part A - Dose Escalation, Part B - Adaptive Dose Cohort, and Part C - REMD-477 in Combination with Metformin.

 Part A includes 5 cohorts that will be enrolled and dosed sequentially at escalating doses.

 Each cohort will consist of 12 subjects randomized in a 3:1 (active: placebo) fashion.

 Part B includes a single dose cohort that will enroll 12 subjects (9 on active treatment and 3 on placebo) with dose level and frequency determined by a Dose Level Review Meeting (DLRM)Committee.

 Part C includes 2 cohorts of T2DM patients currently treated with metformin alone, and each cohort will consist of 15 subjects (10 on active treatment and 3 on placebo).
