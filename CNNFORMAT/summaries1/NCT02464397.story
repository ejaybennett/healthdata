(fifthQuint)Comparison of Strut Coverage With OPTIMAX Versus SYNERGY Stents.

 OPTIMAX-OCT is a prospective, randomized (1:1), study that will be conducted at 2-3 sites (Finland, Belgium) to evaluate OPTIMAX-BAS vascular healing patterns and thrombus formation with OCT at one (Study A) and six (Study B) month after stent implantation in comparison with SYNERGY-EES.

 Patients receiving BAS will receive dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT) for at least four weeks followed by aspirin, while patients implanted with EES, will receive DAPT for at least 6 months followed by aspirin.

 Patients will be randomized to study A and B as follow: Study A: OPTIMAX-BAS (n=25) versus SYNERGY-EES (n=25).

 First 50 patients will be randomized to study A.

 OCT at 1 month follow up.

 Study B: OPTIMAX-BAS (n=30) versus SYNERGY-EES (n=30) Following 60 patients will be randomized to study B.

 OCT at 6 months follow up.

 Randomization is used at the time of recruitment with sealed envelopes.

 Patients will be randomized in 1:1 fashion.

 First 50 patients are randomized in study A and following 60 patients in study B.

 Patients in study A will have OCT follow up at 1 month after index procedure and patients in study B will have OCT at 6 months.

 OCT analyses will be performed blinded to patient's characteristics as well as the type of the stent used.

 Two (2-3) investigational sites: - Cardiovascular Center Aalst, Aalst, Belgium - Heart Center, Satakunta Central Hospital, Pori, Finland.

 Comparison of Strut Coverage With OPTIMAX Versus SYNERGY Stents@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare vascular healing of the stented segment after deployment of titanium-nitride-oxide coated cobalt-chromium OPTIMAX cent bio-active stent (BAS) and SYNERGY cent everolimus-eluting stent (EES) in patients with acute coronary syndromes requiring percutaneous coronary intervention.

 Patients treated with BAS will be treated with DAPT for at least 4 weeks after the procedure followed by aspirin alone, while patients in the EES group will be treated with DAPT, at least for 6 months post procedure.

 In addition, this study will collect initial information about the safety and effectiveness of the BAS in comparison with EES group at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months.
