(thirdQuint)Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of Asimadoline in Pruritus Associated With Atopic Dermatitis.

 Asimadoline has been administered to over 1900 human subjects or patients in clinical trials and exhibits an acceptable safety profile.

 Due to its high selectivity for the kappa-opioid receptor, asimadoline does not produce mu-opioid like side-effects.

 Results from preclinical models indicate asimadoline significantly reduces the frequency of scratching induced by pruritic agents.

 This double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of asimadoline in patients with pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis.

 Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of Asimadoline in Pruritus Associated With Atopic Dermatitis@highlight

Kappa-opioid receptors mediate the sensation of itch in animals and humans.

 Asimadoline is an orally active, selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist and has demonstrated efficacy in several preclinical pruritus models.

 The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of asimadoline in patients with pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis.
