(thirdQuint)Effectiveness of Video Messaging About Diet, Exercise and Weight Gain in Pregnancy in Regional and National Samples.

 Many women engage in suboptimal lifestyle behaviors during pregnancy.

 Many women do not realize that unhealthy diet, exercise and weight gain behaviors can be dangerous for their pregnancy and have harmful long-term consequences for their baby.

 There is great need for strategies to promote accurate knowledge about healthy behaviors during pregnancy.

 The purpose of this study is to assess responses to a brief (<1minute) video about healthy behaviors during pregnancy.

 The study sample will include pregnant women and members of their social network.

 Participants will be asked to watch a brief video and complete an anonymous online survey measuring their response to the video, and their basic demographics.

 The surveys will also assess how family and friends impact pregnant women's health behaviors.

 Online surveys are entirely anonymous.

 We will recruit pregnant participants from two sources: the University of Michigan Health System's prenatal clinics and a social media website (Facebook).
