(fifthQuint)Reducing Emotional Distress, Enhancing Function and Improving Network Engagement in Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology.

 Primary Objective Examine the feasibility and acceptability of MBSR with YACs.

 We hypothesize that MBSR will be feasible and acceptable with this population, which will be assessed through a semi-structured debriefing survey at the end of the study and examination of response rate and study attrition variables.

 Secondary Objectives 1.

 Evaluate the effects of MBSR on outcomes of health related quality of life and disease symptoms among YACs.

 2.

 Explore the impact of different forms of eHealth maintenance support following the MBSR intervention (instructor-delivered, peer-delivered, no message) to help uphold intervention effects over time.

 3.

 Compare intervention and control groups on changes in biologic measures of stress (blood pressure, pulse, salivary cortisol, CRP, IL-6, and IL-1b biomarkers) over a 32-week period.

 Reducing Emotional Distress, Enhancing Function and Improving Network Engagement in Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology@highlight

We propose to examine the effects of mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) on outcomes of health related quality of life, disease symptoms, and biological correlates of stress in a sample of young adults with cancer.

 The proposed work will serve as an essential foundation for launching a program of clinical stress reduction research with this traditionally underserved population and has the potential to lead to the discovery of specific, modifiable psychosocial, behavioral, and biological mechanisms from which to address the problem of health disparities with this group.
