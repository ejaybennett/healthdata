(fifthQuint)Study of Statin for Reduction of Postoperative Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation.

 This study is a randomized, open-label, multi-centers, parallel-control study to explore whether rosuvastatin 20mg/d could decrease early AF recurrence in patients with paroxysmal AF after radiofrequency catheter ablation.

 346 patients with paroxysmal AF are planned to be enrolled.

 The patients are randomized to receive oral rosuvastatin 20mg/d or control therapy from 7 days before operation and last for 3 months.

 The early AF recurrence within 90 days after ablation and the changes of 4 inflammatory markers including white blood cell count, hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF- and safety indicators will be observed.

 The study is aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin on decreasing early recurrence in patients with paroxysmal AF and discuss its mechanisms of action.

 Study of Statin for Reduction of Postoperative Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation@highlight

The study will select all recruited patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation will be randomly allocated to receive oral rosuvastatin 20mg/day or blank control from 7 days before ablation and last for 3 months.

 To observe the early relapse of atrial fibrillation and the changes of white blood cell count, hs-C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and the changes of safety indicators .

 This study assumes that the early atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence will be decreased in patients with paroxysmal AF if rosuvastatin 20mg/d is received from 7 days before surgery in these patients who plan to undergo radiofrequency catheter ablation for consecutive 3 months.
