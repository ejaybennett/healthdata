(secondQuint)Family Meeting Study for End Stage Renal Disease.

 Patients hospitalized at Henry For Hospital who have end stage renal disease will complete baseline questionnaires and be randomized into the experimental or control condition.

 Patients randomized into the experimental condition will have a single family consultation session before the patient is discharged.

 A trained, master's level therapist will conduct the family consultation, which will use education, motivational interviewing, and other techniques to help the family engage and support the patient's health needs.

 Patients in both the experimental and control conditions will complete follow up questionnaires 1 month after discharge.

 Investigators will conduct chart reviews of outcome data, including readmissions, at 1, 3, and 6 months post-discharge.
