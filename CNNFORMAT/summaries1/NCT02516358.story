(thirdQuint)Glycaemic Alterations in ICU.

 The aim of this study is to determine the local prevalence of critical illness-associated hyperglycaemia (CIAH) and recognised and unrecognised diabetes, as well as to evaluate how premorbid glycaemia impacts the relationship between three glycaemic domains and mortality.

 The investigators will calculate the Time In Range (TIR, 70-180 mg/dl) and evaluate distribution of percentage time in range for non-diabetics and diabetics patients, in order to understand the association between TIR and survival in both groups of patients (patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes).

 In view of the potential adverse effects of hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia and glycaemic variability on the brain, the investigators will dose Neuron Specific Enolase in critically ill patients.

 The aim is to define if a biochemical correlation does exist between critically ill dysglycaemia and NSE plasma concentration.

 Glycaemic Alterations in ICU@highlight

To quantify the local prevalence of diabetes mellitus in critically ill patients.

 To understand whether a correlation does exist between premorbid glycaemic control and glycaemic status in ICU.

 A subgroup analysis will be conducted to investigate whether a relationship does exist between Neuron Specific Enolase levels and glycaemic disorders.
