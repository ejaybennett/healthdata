(firstQuint)A New Track Ablation Device for Liver Biopsy: A Feasibility Study.

 Background: - Percutaneous biopsy for hepatic masses has a potential risk of bleeding and peritoneal tumor seeding.

 - A new device for biopsy track ablation has been invented to reduce the risk of bleeding and peritoneal tumor seeding.

 Method: - Routine percutaneous biopsy for hepatic masses is performed.

 - Immediate after obtaining tissue, biopsy needle track is ablated with a new biopsy tract ablator.

 - Immediate (with ultrasound) and 24 hours (with CT scan) after procedure, occurrence of complications is evaluated.
