(fifthQuint)Metformine and CC Compared With Placebo and CC for Induction Ovulation in PCOS Patients With Insulin Resistant.

 Introduction: PCOS is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility which affects 12-21% of the population.

 This percentage may vary according to the criteria used and population studied.

Hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and occasionally obesity are the characteristics of this syndrome.

 Currently, CC is the first-line infertility treatment in women with the PCOS .

However, 20-25% of PCOS women fail to ovulate with incremental doses of CC and and do not respond due to resistance to CC .

IR and hyperinsulinemia are considered as important factors in the pathogenesis of PCOS .

Hence, lean and obese women with PCOS may have IR.

Hyperinsulinism has been shown to play a part in ovarian hyperandrogenism and may directly influence and even prevent ovulation.

Metformin, an insulin sensitizing agent, reduces levels of luteinizing hormone, hyperinsulinemia and also decreases ovarian production of androgens .

For this reason a number of studies have been performed and evaluated the possible beneficial role of metformin in managing women with PCOS.

 However, the studies performed evaluate the possible benefit of metformin alone or in combination with CC as first-line treatment for infertility in women with PCOS have reported conflicting results .

Recently a meta-analysis concluded that metformin was more burdensome than placebo, hence CC alone and not CC plus metformin should be the drug of choice in these patients.

A high-quality Cochrane systematic review has reported on randomized controlled trials(RCTs) comparing metformin with CC in women with PCOS and demonstrated that CC had a significantly higher pregnancy and live birth rate in women with a BMI >30 kg/m2 whereas metformin had better results in women with a BMI C until assayed together.

 Serum levels of FSH, LH, TSH and PRL will be measured using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA,Wernecce,3200) (Ideal, Tehran, Iran).

 Total T, FreeT, DHEAS and insulin will be also measured using ELISA assay (Monobind,Inc,USA) .

 FBG will be measured using an enzymatic colorimetric method with Glucose Oxidase.

Women with hypothyroidism included in this study after treatment and normal TSH(because in women with PCOS, a significant association between thyroid function, as reflected by TSH >2 mIU/l, and IR was found and the association appeared to be independent of age and BMI).

 IR is determined with homeostatic model assessment( HOMA) method calculated by fasting insulin (mU/L) * fasting glucose (mmol/L)/ 22.

 The value of HOMA-IR 2.

3 will be assumed as IR according to the Hosseinpanah et al studies in iranian women .

After baseline studies are completed, the patients will be divided into two groups.

 In group1 metformin (Metformine, Chemidaro, Tehran, Iran) will be given at a dose of 500 mg three times a day for 8weeks.

 The dose will be increased from one to three tablets a day over a period of seven days to minimize side effects.

 The patients in group two will be receiving placebo (identical in appearance to metformin from the same factory).

 The P levels in all subjects will be measured every other week in order to document ovulation.

 A P level > 5 ng/ml (16 nmol per liter) will considered as confirmatory of ovulation.

 If pregnancy occurred, metformin will be continued for another 12 weeks.

 In case of failure of ovulation after the end of this period, metformin and placebo were continued and patients were given 100 mg CC (Clomid, Iran Hormone, Iran) for 5 days starting from day 3 of their spontaneous menses or withdrawal bleeding induced by Provera.

Ovarian follicular response will be monitored by transvaginal sonography every other day from day 10 of the cycle by a single sonographist.

 When at least one follicle reached 18 mm in diameter, 5000 IU of HCG (Pregnyl; N.

V.

 Organon, OSS, Netherlands) will be given intramuscularly and timed intercourse will advised (every other day for one week starting after receiving HCG).

 If there is no follicle 12mm by day 16 in CC cycle, the cycle will be presumed to be anovulatory and monitoring will be discontinued.

 In cases of ovulation with CC without pregnancy, the patients will be advised to participate in other two similar cycles of therapy with 100 mg CC (group1 and 2).

 When ovulation will not occur with 100 mg CC, its dose will be increased to 150 mg and the same treatment protocol will be used for this dose.

 In group 1 metformine and in group 2 placebo will be continued through CC cycles.

 Clinical pregnancy will be defined as the detection of at least one gestational sac on transvaginal ultrasound examination starting one week after the missed period.

Ongoing pregnancy will be defined as the detection of fetal heart activity after 12 weeks of gestations.

 Statistical analysis: All the data will be entered to the SPSS software (Version 11.

 Metformine and CC Compared With Placebo and CC for Induction Ovulation in PCOS Patients With Insulin Resistant@highlight

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility which affects 12-21% of the population.

Several studies performed evaluate the possible benefit of metformin alone or in combination with clomiphene (CC)as first-line treatment for infertility in women with PCOS have reported conflicting results.

 These conflicting results may be due to the presence or absence of insulin resistance(IR).

Metformin decreases IR .

However there is not a single randomized clinical trial with metformin in IR PCOS patients.

 Therefore, the aim of current study is to compare CC with coadministration of metformin and with CC with coadministration of placebo in IR PCOS patients to induce ovulation.
