(firstQuint)Blood Glucose and Body Fat Regulatory Effect of Peanut Skin Extract.

 Peanut skins, a by-product of peanut processing industry, is usually discarded as a waste in despite of the high content of phenolic compounds.

 Polyphenol extract from peanut skins has been demonstrated to inhibit -amylase activity in vitro.

 Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the regulatory effects of the peanut skin extract on blood glucose and body fat by a double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study.

 Subjects with simple obesity (body mass index [BMI] 27 or body fat 30%) ingested 4 Sugarlock(R) (n = 16) capsules or placebo (n = 14) a day for a total of 6 weeks.

 Anthropometric measurements (body weight, body fat, blood pressure) and blood biochemical markers including fasting blood glucose (FBG), albumin, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), HDL-C, LDL-C, creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), AST, ALT were examined every three weeks.

 Also, 5 subjects were randomly selected for MRI scans to examine the distribution and thickness of abdominal fat layers before and after the trial.
