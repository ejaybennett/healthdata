(fifthQuint)Population Pharmacokinetics of Anti-infectives in Critically Ill Children.

 Background and aims of the study: Recent studies have suggested a risk of under-exposure to anti-infectives in critically ill adults.

 This under-exposure may be associated with poor clinical outcomes as well as a delay or incomplete clinical resolution of infection; The dosing regimen of anti-infectives in critically ill children is usually based on weight (i.

e.

 mg per Kg).

 However, between-subject variability is known to be substantial in children and even more so in critical illness; As a result, concentrations and effects of anti-infectives are unpredictable and the risk of under- or over-exposure is thus genuine and considerable.

 Rationalisation of anti-infectives in children is therefore desirable.

 The purpose of the present study is to investigate, using a population approach, the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of intravenous anti-infectives including usual PK/PD targets (fT(%) > minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)) and PD endpoints (clinical outcomes) in critically ill children.

 The effects of developmental and other factors related to critical illness on anti-infectives PK and PK/PDs are investigated in order to better explain the observed between-subject variabilities and to ultimately suggest individualized dosage regimens.

 This prospective study will be conducted in six paediatric services of Public Hospitals in Paris, France Intervention: Patient selection will take place in the 6 paediatric services.

 The senior physician proposes the study to holders of parental authority whose child receives or will receive anti-infectives during its follow-up or hospitalization.

 The senior physician will give a briefing note to the holders of parental authority, and if the child is able to understand the information.

 The non-oral opposition for the retrieval and analysis of data will be collected.

 No intervention or no charge will be made for this study.

Concentrations and effects of anti-infectives in critically ill children are unpredictable and the risk of under-exposure may be associated with poor clinical outcomes.

 In addition, between-subject variability (BSV) is known to be substantial in critically ill children.

 Rationalisation of anti-infectives in children is therefore desirable.

 The investigators aim to investigate, using a population approach, the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of anti-infectives including PK/PD targets (fT(%) > minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)) and PD endpoints (clinical outcomes) in critically ill children.

 Covariates The effects of covariates on anti-infectives PK and PK/PDs are investigated in order to better explain the BSV and to ultimately suggest individualized dosage regimens.

 It will be a prospective PK study including 11 anti-infectives antibiotics.

 Six blood samples were taken from each patient during dosing interval.

 The primary PK/ PD targets were anti-infectives concentrations above the MIC of the pathogen at both 50% (50% f T>MIC) and 100% (100% f T>MIC) of the dosing interval.

 The investigators used skewed logistic regression to describe the effect of anti-infectives exposure on patient outcome.
