(fifthQuint)Gastric Microbiota and Helicobacter Pylori Test Findings.

 Molecular methods have been increasingly used for diagnosing different aspects of microbiota.

 PCR is a DNA amplification procedure resulting in rapid production of multiple copies of a DNA "target" sequence.

 The technique may be applied on material from gastric biopsies or any organic fluids (stools, saliva and gastric juice).

 Its extreme sensitivity and specificity enable a single DNA copy of the microorganism in the examined material to be identified.

 This property, on the other hand, also increases the odds of false-positives occurring, either because of the presence of residues of the microorganism in the material or their presence in the set of instruments used in the endoscopy and their occasionally not being properly sterilized and cleaned.

 Very contaminated materials, with mixed flora, may also contain bacteria with a gene sequence similar to those of H.

 pylori and also lead to false-positive results.

 Nevertheless, the PCR sensitivity and specificity for the H.

 pylori infection range from 90 to 100%.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate how the composition of gastric microbiota differ according to the H.

 pylori test findings using 16S rRNA pyrosequencing analysis based on multiplex PCR method.

Diagnostic tests for Helicobacter pylori infection consist of noninvasive tests (i.

e.

, urea breath test, serum antibody, stool antigen, urine antibody) and invasive tests (i.

e.

, histology, Giemsa stain, Warthin-Starry stain, Gram stain, culture, rapid urease test).

 Discrepancies between the tests may occur, and further induce problems for the diagnosis and treatment for H.

 pylori infection.

 Various types of microbiota can live together in a human stomach, and can be diagnosed using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) pyrosequencing analysis based on multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.

 With the progress of gastric atrophy, the numbers of gastric microbiota may increase due to the low acidity of the intragastric condition.

 As a consequence, H.

 pylori are derived out the stomach, and may show a negative findings on the H.

 pylori assays.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate how the composition of gastric microbiota differ according to the H.

 pylori test findings.
