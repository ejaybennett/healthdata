(secondQuint)The Fusion Versus The Affinity Oxygenation Systems.

 In order to assess the efficacy and safety of fusion Oxygenation System in patients undergoing isolated CABG, a prospective one-to-one randomized trial comparing the fusion oxygenation to the currently used affinity oxygenation system will be conducted.

 Forty patients intending to undergo CABG will be divided into 2 groups according to the oxygenation system which will be used during surgery.

 Distribution into groups will be done randomly.

 Ten patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgical procedures under general anesthesia and 10 patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention will serve as control groups for the neurological outcomes.

 Clinical status, inflammatory and hematological response as well as Neurological outcome will be assessed.
