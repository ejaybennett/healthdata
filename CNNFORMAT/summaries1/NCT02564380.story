(secondQuint)Study of Pembrolizumab Maintenance Following First-Line Platinum Based Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Squamous - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (sNSCLC).

 Patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer and an ECOG of 0-1 who received a first-line therapy with Cis-/Carboplatin for at least 2 cycles that had at least Complete Response (CR) / Partial Response (PR) / Stable Disease (SD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.

1 will be randomized either to Arm A Pembrolizumab or to Arm B Placebo for a maximum of 2 years or until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

 The aim is to investigate the efficacy of Pembrolizumab vs.

 placebo in terms of progression-free survival in patients with metastatic squamous, non-small cell lung cancer.

 Furthermore to evaluate tumor response, survival, tolerability and safety as well as quality of life of patients receiving Pembrolizumab.
