(fifthQuint)Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Temsirolimus in Treating Patients With Intermediate Risk Rhabdomyosarcoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To compare the event-free survival (EFS) of patients with intermediate-risk (IR) rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) treated with surgery, radiotherapy, and vincristine (vincristine sulfate), dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) alternating with vincristine and irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) (VI) (VAC/VI) to that of patients treated with surgery, radiotherapy and VAC/VI plus temsirolimus.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To compare the overall survival (OS) of patients with IR RMS treated with surgery, radiotherapy, and VAC alternating with VI to that of patients treated with surgery, radiotherapy and VAC/VI plus temsirolimus.

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To compare the outcome of patients based on their forkhead box O1 protein (FOXO1) fusion gene partner, by evaluating paired box (PAX) 3 versus (vs) PAX7 in all patients found to be FOXO1 fusion positive.

 II.

 To compare the outcome of patients based on their [F18]-fluorodeoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) response at week 9 (positive or negative), as assessed by Deauville criteria (5-point).

 III.

 To estimate the frequency of patients with circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) at diagnosis and subsequent time-points.

 OUTLINE: FEASIBILITY PHASE (THE FEASIBILITY PHASE IS COMPLETE, EFFECTIVE WITH AMENDMENT #1A): (< 21 years old): This is a dose-escalation study of temsirolimus.

 Patients receive vincristine sulfate intravenously (IV) over 1 minute on day 1 of weeks 1-13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22-26, 28, 31-34, 37, 38, and 40, dactinomycin IV over 1-5 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1, 7, 13, 22, 28, 34, and 40, cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1, 7, 13, 22, 28, 34, and 40, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on days 1-5 of weeks 4, 10, 16, 19, 25, 31, and 37, and temsirolimus IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.

 Patients also undergo radiation therapy (RT) beginning week 13 for 6 weeks.

 Courses with temsirolimus repeat every 21 days for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 EFFICACY PHASE: Patients are randomized to Regimen A or B.

 Patients with disease that is ARMS FOXO1 fusion negative (stage I, group I/II, stage 1, group III [orbit] or stage II, group I/II) are assigned to Regimen C.

 REGIMEN A (VAC/VI): Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on day 1 of weeks 1-13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22-26, 28, 31-34, 37, 38, and 40, dactinomycin IV over 1-5 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1, 7, 13, 22, 28, 34, and 40, cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1, 7, 13, 22, 28, 34, and 40, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on days 1-5 of weeks 4, 10, 16, 19, 25, 31, and 37.

 Patients also undergo RT beginning at week 13 for 6 weeks.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 REGIMEN B (VAC/VI TEMSIROLIMUS): Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on day 1 of weeks 1-13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22-26, 28, 31-34, 37, 38, and 40, dactinomycin IV over 1-5 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1, 7, 13, 22, 28, 34, and 40, cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1, 7, 13, 22, 28, 34, and 40, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on days 1-5 of weeks 4, 10, 16, 19, 25, 31, and 37 and temsirolimus IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1-12 and 21-42.

 Patients also undergo RT as in Regimen I.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 REGIMEN C (FOXO1 FUSION NEGATIVE): Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on day 1 of weeks 1-10 and 13-22, dactinomycin IV over 1-5 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22, cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10.

 Patients undergo RT beginning at week 13 for 6 weeks.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for up to 10 years.

 Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Temsirolimus in Treating Patients With Intermediate Risk Rhabdomyosarcoma@highlight

This randomized phase III trial studies how well combination chemotherapy (vincristine sulfate, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide alternated with vincristine sulfate and irinotecan hydrochloride) works compared to combination chemotherapy plus temsirolimus in treating patients with rhabdomyosarcoma (cancer that forms in the soft tissues, such as muscle), and has an intermediate chance of coming back after treatment (intermediate risk).

 Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Combination chemotherapy and temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy plus temsirolimus is more effective in treating patients with intermediate-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.
