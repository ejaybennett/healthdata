(firstQuint)Swiss Army Physical Fitness Training.

 The physical and psychological demands in the Swiss Army basic military service are high.

 Injury incidences in Swiss Army training schools are higher than in armed forces of other countries.

There is evidence that progressive loading of physical demands at the beginning of basic military service and specific physical training can reduce injury incidences and attrition rates.

 A new sport concept by the Swiss Army takes into account these results of previous studies.

 Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the influences of this new sport concept on the physical and psychological fitness as well as on the injury and attrition rates of the recruits.
