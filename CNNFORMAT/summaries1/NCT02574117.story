(fifthQuint)Cone Beam Computed Tomography for Evaluating Corticotomy-assisted Maxillary Expansion.

 Maxillary expansion was performed for adult female patients suffering from maxillary constriction with bilateral posterior cross-bite & dental arch discrepancy average 12 mm using fixed Quad-helix appliance, for about 8 months.

 The appliance was delivered and activated at the day of corticotomy and bone graft (demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft).

 The activation was made half-molar unit each side.

 The patient was scheduled each month to activate the appliance or reactivate if needed.

 Corticotomy was performed at area of maxillary 1st premolar, 2nd premolar and first molar.

 Cone beam computed tomography was performed at three stages.

 T1 (baseline) Before appliance activation and corticotomy.

 T2 At the end of expansion.

 (about 8 months of expansion).

 T3 At the finishing stage of orthodontic treatment (average 2.

5 years from start of treatment).
