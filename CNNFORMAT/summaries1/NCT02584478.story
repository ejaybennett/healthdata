(secondQuint)Phase 1/2a Evaluation of Adding AL3818 to Standard Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Subjects With Recurrent or Metastatic Endometrial, Ovarian, Fallopian, Primary Peritoneal or Cervical Carcinoma (AL3818-US-002).

 This trial is a Phase 1b/2a trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding oral AL3818 to standard platinum-based chemotherapy such as carboplatin plus paclitaxel, concurrently and continued as a maintenance therapy for up to 12 months, in subjects with recurrent or metastatic endometrial, ovarian, fallopian, primary peritoneal, or cervical carcinoma.

 AL3818 is a novel small molecule dual receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which shows highly selective inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFr) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR).

 Preclinical studies of this agent in mouse models, including various cancer xenografts, have demonstrated that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with AL3818 induces tumor reductions.

 This study will be divided into two parts.

 The objective of Part 1 is the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of adding oral AL3818 to standard carboplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy for a cycle of 21 days to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D).

 The objective of Part 2 is evaluation of preliminary efficacy and the safety of adding oral AL3818 at the RP2D determined in Part 1 to carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy for 6 cycles.

 Continuous maintenance mono therapy with 14 days on and 7 days off regimen at the RP2D will be conducted up to 12 months and is extendable beyond until disease progression.
