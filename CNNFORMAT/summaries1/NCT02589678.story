(secondQuint)Zambia SiVET MMR Tdap-IPV.

 This study will evaluate if women at high risk for HIV infection residing in Lusaka, Zambia and Ndola, Zambia are willing to participate and can be retained in future HIV vaccine trials.

 150 women will be enrolled that are either sex workers or single women that were identified at infant vaccination clinics (at risk due to a recent pregnancy indicating unprotected sexual contact outside of marriage or cohabitation).

 Two licensed vaccines will be administered as proxies for HIV vaccine administration.

 The clinic and laboratory procedures will simulate HIV vaccine trial procedures and will therefore inform recruitment and retention strategies and HIV incidence among high risk women in future HIV vaccine trials.

Participants will receive vaccination for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and inactivated polio (Tdap-IPV).

 The study schedule design is to simulate a vaccine efficacy trial to see if single women can participate in studies that mimic actual HIV vaccine studies.
