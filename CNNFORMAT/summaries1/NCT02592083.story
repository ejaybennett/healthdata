(fifthQuint)Neoadjuvant Response-guided Treatment of Slowly Proliferating Hormone Receptor Positive Tumors.

 Pre- or perimenopausal women are treated with tamoxifen, alternatively with an LHRH analogue in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (only women).

 Postmenopausal women receive an aromatase inhibitor.

This treatment is given for 4 weeks.

 In cases with uncertain menopausal status (previous hysterectomy and equivocal gonadotropins), postmenopause age limit is defined as 55 years or older.

 Ki67 is determined by FNA or core biopsy before start and after 2 weeks of treatment.

 After the initial 4-week period, patients with signs of response in terms of decrease of Ki67 by 20% are randomized to endocrine treatment either alone or in combination with the cdk 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (arm A and B).

 Patients with tumors with stable disease, defined as 2mm (macro metastases) or primary tumor size >30mm in combination with Ki67>15%.

 Adjuvant endocrine treatment and radiotherapy is offered according to standard guidelines.

 Structured follow-up visits yearly for five years include reporting of persistent treatment-related toxicity, HRQoL, recurrence and death.

 All patients are recommended adjuvant endocrine treatment for at least 5 years.

 The trial contains also a translational subprotocol: 1.

 PET-CT using FDG, confined to the chest, is performed before start of the first treatment period and after 10 weeks, i.

e.

 6 weeks after treatment allocation (functional imaging, optional).

 2.

 Core biopsies from the tumor are collected before start of the first treatment period and after 10 weeks, i.

e.

 6 weeks after treatment allocation.

 Further tissue samples are collected from the surgical specimen.

 3.

 Blood samples are collected repeatedly during the ongoing treatment and yearly follow-up.

 4.

 FNAs from metastases in case of recurrence during follow-up.

 Neoadjuvant Response-guided Treatment of Slowly Proliferating Hormone Receptor Positive Tumors@highlight

The purpose of this neoadjuvant trial is to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of the cdk 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib when added to standard endocrine treatment.

 Initially, patients receive endocrine treatment for 4 weeks.

 In case of decrease of proliferation (Ki67) patients are then randomized between either continuous endocrine therapy (arm A) or the same treatment with addition of palbociclib (arm B).

 Patients with no change of proliferation are allocated to endocrine treatment + palbociclib without randomization (arm C).

 During the 12-weekly treatment period, clinical and radiological evaluations are performed repeatedly.

 Switch between the treatment arms A and B is allowed in case of lack of response or due to toxicity.

 A translational subprotocol is a mandatory part of the study protocol, except for use of PET-CT evaluations.
