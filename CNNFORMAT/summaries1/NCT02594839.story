(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Patients With Rapidly Progressive Interstitial Lung Disease.

 Despite significant progress in the treatment of interstitial lung disease, achieved thanks to new drugs, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib, there are many patients for whom these drugs are not available or poorly tolerated.

 In addition significant evidence of their effectiveness and safety is valid only for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

 The transplantation of allogeneic stem cells is a promising direction in the modern medicine with the proven safety for different diseases.

 But the effectiveness of this therapy is still under research.

 We believe that in most severe cases of a rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells may be an effective technology due to their immunomodulatory properties.

 Safety and Efficacy of Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Patients With Rapidly Progressive Interstitial Lung Disease@highlight

The study evaluates the safety and the efficacy of the addition of intravenous transplantation of donor bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia or connective tissue disease associated with interstitial lung disease, which have actively progressing disease with rapid loss of pulmonary function on the background of routine treatment.
