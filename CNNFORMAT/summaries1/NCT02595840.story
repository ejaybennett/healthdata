(secondQuint)A Prospective, Multiparametric Biomarker Study to Identify Predictors of Treatment Response and Resistance in Patients With EGFR-mutated Non-small-cell Lung Cancer Receiving Maintenance Therapy With Either Afatinib or Pemetrexed With the AIO-TRK-0114 Study (MARBLE).

 Patients with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer who have progressed after first-line therapy with afatinib and participate in the AIO-TRK-0114 (MARBLE) study (EudraCT-No.

 2014-001983-36) are offered participation in Trans-MARBLE.

 If written informed consent is granted, archival surplus diagnostic tumor samples, blood samples and fresh tumor samples are acquired during medically indicated diagnostic procedures.

 All samples will be pseudonymized and shipped to the Coordinating Study Laboratory and Biobank (WBE) in Essen or to the Central ctDNA Sequencing Laboratory in Cologne.

 Biomaterials including DNA, RNA and proteins will be extracted and subjected to genomic, epigenetic and proteomic analyses.

 Assay results will be reported to the central study data base for scientific analyses.

 In addition, biomarker results obtained by NGS-based panel sequencing of tumor- and plasma-derived DNA will be reported back to the clinical investigators of the AIO-TRK-0114 (MARBLE) study, and can be shared with the study patients.

The aim of Trans-MARBLE is to identify and validate novel biomarkers of response and resistance to maintenance therapy with afatinib or pemetrexed in patients with EGFRmutated non-small-cell lung cancer who have progressed after first-line therapy with afatinib.
