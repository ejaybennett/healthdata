(fifthQuint)IVF Outcome Following Treatment With Ulipristal Acetate for Myomatous Uterus After at Least One IVF Failure.

 Ulipristal Acetate - Study design Introduction: Leiomyomas are well established factors to affect fertility.

 The key factor for fertility disturbance is the fibroid location and not its size.

 The presence of submucosal fibroids has long been known to reduce fertility as opposed to subserosal fibroids which do not alter fertility.

 The effect of intramural fibroids on fertility is still a mystery.

 These findings were best described in a meta-analysis of 23 studies: - With no respect to location, women with fibroids have a lower chance for ongoing pregnancy or live birth (RR 0.

7, 95% CI 0.

59-0.

83) and a greater chance for spontaneous abortion (RR 1.

68, 95% CI 1.

37-2.

05).

 - Women with fibroids that were submucosal or intramural with an intracavitary component were less likely to become pregnant (RR 0.

36, 95% CI 0.

18-0.

74) and more likely to have a spontaneous abortion (RR 1.

7, 95% CI 1.

4-2.

1).

 - The picture is less clear for women with intramural fibroids.

 Overall, studies of women with fibroids that did not distort the uterine cavity were less likely to become pregnant (RR 0.

81, 95% CI 0.

70-0.

94), less likely to have an ongoing pregnancy or to deliver a live newborn (RR 0.

7, 95% CI 0.

58-0.

85) and more likely to have a spontaneous abortion (RR 1.

7, 95% CI 1.

2-2.

5).

 - In addition to these findings, women with cavity-distorting fibroids who undergone myomectomy had a significant increase in conception rate (RR 2.

03, 95% CI 1.

08-3.

83).

 - There were no significant differences between women who had myomectomy for intramural fibroids and those who did not go through surgical treatment, although the data for this issue is quite lame.

 Another strong evidence for the relevance of intramural fibroids for fertility can be found in a meta-analysis that evaluated the association between non-cavity-distorting intramural fibroids and IVF outcome, this study shows a significant decrease in the live birth (RR 0.

79, 95% CI 0.

70 -0.

88) and clinical pregnancy rate (RR 0.

85, 95% CI 0.

77 - 0.

94) in women with non-cavity-distorting intramural fibroids compared with those without fibroids, following IVF treatment.

 Ulipristal: Ulipristal acetate (UPA) is a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) prescribed for women with symptomatic leiomyomas.

 Few phase 3 studies were conducted in order to prove its clinical use and efficacy in treating women suffering from fibroids.

 - PEARL (PGL4001 Efficacy Assessment in Reduction of Symptoms Due to Uterine Leiomyomas) I was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial (48 patients in the placebo arm, 95 treated with daily dosage of 5 mg & 94 with 10 mg of UPA) proving that treatment with UPA 5 mg or 10 mg once daily for a 13 weeks course is efficient in controlling uterine bleeding (91% & 92% respectively) in comparison to placebo (19%), P4 cm confirmed by TVUS and diagnostic hysteroscopy.

 After US examination and diagnostic hysteroscopy to ascertain suitability for our study, we will offer a course of 13 weeks treatment with UPA 5 mg per day.

 One month after cessation of treatment the investigators will perform another TVUS examination & diagnostic hysteroscopy plus endometrial biopsy in order to assess the endometrial & uterine status and will conduct an additional IVF cycle, using the same stimulation protocol undertaken during the immediate cycle previous to the UPA treatment course.

 The data: Demographic data - Age, BMI.

 Obstetrical data - Gravida, para.

 Gynecological data - Hormonal profile, uterus size, fibroids features (location, size), infertility features (duration, cause), past stimulation and IVF treatment variables.

 IVF Outcome Following Treatment With Ulipristal Acetate for Myomatous Uterus After at Least One IVF Failure@highlight

Hypothesis: After reviewing the relevant medical data the investigators assume that treating a woman with intramural fibroid not distorting the uterine cavity or mostly intramural with less than 50% submucosal component with Ulipristal Acetate (UPA) for a 13 weeks course would reduce the fibroid size and improve her chance for conceiving by IVF treatment.

 Materials & Methods: Study design: A proof of concept prospective not randomized study.

 The patients: About 20 women treated in the fertility and IVF unit after at least one IVF failure, with mostly intramural (IM) fibroid [class 2-5 by FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) classification system] in the size of >4 cm confirmed by Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and diagnostic hysteroscopy.

 After US examination and diagnostic hysteroscopy to ascertain suitability for this study, the investigators will offer a course of 13 weeks treatment with UPA 5 mg per day.

 One month after cessation of treatment the investigators will perform another TVUS examination & diagnostic hysteroscopy plus endometrial biopsy in order to assess the endometrial & uterine status and will conduct an additional IVF cycle, using the same stimulation protocol undertaken during the immediate cycle previous to the UPA treatment course.
