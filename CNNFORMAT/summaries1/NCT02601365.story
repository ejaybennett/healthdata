(firstQuint)Inhaled GM-CSF for Respiratory Virus-Associated Severe Pneumonia.

 Acute respiratory failure from respiratory viruses including influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus are a common cause of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions and the requirement of initiation of mechanical ventilation.

 In a subset of subjects who are difficult to identify based on patient characteristics, worsening lung disease, or pneumonia, develops and these subjects progress to pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS).

 This can result in prolonged PICU stay, significant morbidity, and in some cases, mortality.

 The overarching goal of this project is to improve the outcomes for these patients with PARDS secondary to respiratory virus infections.

 Research suggests that granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a cytokine produced by many cell types in the body, has added significance in the lung and may be an important factor in the resolution of lung inflammation, and may be suppressed by respiratory viruses.

 This GM-CSF-deficient environment may be an important trigger of lung dysfunction; therefore, replenishment of the lung with exogenous GM-CSF has the potential to be extremely beneficial.

 In this phase I dose escalation clinical study we propose to investigate the safety and efficacy of the administration of inhaled GM-CSF (iGM-CSF) to children with respiratory virus-associated PARDS.
