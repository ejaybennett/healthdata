(firstQuint)Increasing Community-acquired Pneumonia Protocol Adherence by Antibiotic Stewardship.

 The purpose of the study is to show a decrease in broad-spectrum antibiotics with a non-inferiority in 90-day mortality.

 Hospitals with a pre-intervention protocol adherence of >70% are excluded from the primary analysis.

 Primary analysis will be done with a mixed effects model with a random effects for clusters and time.

 Crude outcomes and outcomes adjusted for potential confounders will be reported.
