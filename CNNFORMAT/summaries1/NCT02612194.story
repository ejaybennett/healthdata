(fifthQuint)LCI-GU-URO-CRI-001: Crizotinib in Patients With c-MET or RON-Positive Metastatic Urothelial Cancer.

 This is a single arm two-stage phase II study designed to evaluate the overall response rate in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer demonstrating c-MET or RON overexpression who have failed prior therapy with a cisplatin or carboplatin containing regimen.

 Immunohistochemistry will be utilized to define tumor sample c-MET and RON protein expression patterns for assignment into molecular cohorts.

 In the first stage of this study, seven patients will be enrolled in parallel to three molecularly defined cohorts as follows: 1.

 c-MET high (>50%), RON null (0-9%) 2.

 c-MET-positive (10-100%), RON-positive (10-100%) 3.

 c-MET null (0-9%), RON-positive (10-100%) All enrolled subjects will continue with study treatment until radiographic progression based on RECIST version 1.

1, unacceptable toxicity, investigator discretion, or consent withdrawal.

 If a response is observed in a cohort in Stage 1, the cohort may be considered for expansion, and an additional 25 patients may then be enrolled into that cohort in Stage 2.

 An expansion cohort will be defined by the Sponsor- Investigators following review of all available trial data by the sponsor and LCI Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) which will be conducted after the first Stage 1 cohort has completed accrual and at least every six months thereafter until all Stage 1 cohorts have completed accrual.

 If more than one cohort has at least one Stage 1 responder, then the cohort showing the highest response rate will be given highest consideration for expansion.

 It is possible that the cohort with the highest response rate can be determined prior to completion of Stage 1 enrollment in all cohorts.

 If there is a lag in enrollment in Stage 1 cohorts, an expansion decision may be made without regard to the lagging cohorts.

Following informed consent and registration, subjects will undergo tissue pre-screen eligibility screening.

 Tumor specimens from potential subjects will then undergo c-MET and RON expression characterization.

 Eligible subjects will then undergo treatment eligibility screening and then be enrolled into available open molecularly defined cohorts.

 If at least one response is observed within a cohort, it will be considered for expansion with additional subjects enrolled.

 The cohort showing the highest response rate will be given highest consideration, as determined by the Sponsor-Investigator.

 Trial accrual is anticipated to occur over two years with 21 subjects enrolled during the first stage (7 in each cohort) with the opportunity for an additional 25 to be enrolled if a cohort is expanded.

 Subjects enrolled will follow the same procedure and treatment schedule, regardless of cohort assignment.
