(thirdQuint)Phase 2 Trial of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (MiSLE).

 A phase 2 multicenter (several medical research centers participating), placebo controlled, randomized (assigned by chance), double blind (neither the participant nor the investigator will know if active drug or placebo is assigned) trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in adults.

 The MSCs will be obtained from healthy donor umbilical cords and two doses of MSCs will be tested.

 The cells will be produced at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and will be shipped to other participating centers for patients with SLE.

 Participants will receive either active drug or placebo through a single IV infusion.

 All participants will receive standard of care and their safety will be monitored throughout the study.

 Phase 2 Trial of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (MiSLE)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from umbilical cords for the treatment of adults with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

 The goal of this study is to determine if patients receiving an MSC infusion plus standard of care respond better than patients receiving placebo infusion plus standard of care.
