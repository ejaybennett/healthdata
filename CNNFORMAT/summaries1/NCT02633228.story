 Bifocal multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOL) are effective in achieving good uncorrected visual acuities in the distance and the near.

 However, the intermediate vision is of increasing relevance for everyday's life.

 Several multifocal intraocular lenses have been developed to improvement intermediate vision.

 Nonetheless, those systems still possess adverse photic effects and do not garantuee spectacle independence.

 Therefore, the combination of a lower-addition bifocal intraocular lense in the distance-dominant eye with a higher-addition bifocal intraocular lense in the fellow-eye might be a promising approach to address these drawbacks of current binocular and trifocal intraocular lenses.
