(secondQuint)Pasireotide LAR and Pegvisomant Study in Acromegaly.

 Pasireotide Long Acting Release (Signifor (R)), a novel long-acting multi-receptor ligand somatostatin analogue, has been shown to be more effective for the treatment of GH-secreting pituitary adenomas than currently used long-acting somatostatin analogues (LA-SSAs).

 The long-term efficacy of acromegaly patients using LA-SSAs in combination with PEGV was over 90% in terms of normalization of IGF-I.

 The combination of PEGV with pasireotide LAR has not been studied yet.

 Combining PEGV with pasireotide LAR could result in a lower dose and less injections of pegvisomant.

 This may ultimately lead to a more cost-effective treatment and improved quality of life.

 Pasireotide LAR and Pegvisomant Study in Acromegaly@highlight

The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Pasireotide Long Acting Release (LAR) alone and in combination with weekly Pegvisomant (PEGV) in acromegaIy patients previously controlled with combination treatment of long-acting Somatostatin analogs (LA-SSAs) and PEGV.
