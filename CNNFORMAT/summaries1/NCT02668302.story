(secondQuint)The PIO II Study of In-office Placement of a Steroid-eluting Sinus Implant.

 This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial aims to assess the efficacy of a drug-eluting sinus implant placement following ethmoidectomy in addition to post-op standard of care (i.

e.

 debridement, irrigation, and topical steroids) compared to the same standard care alone (control).

 A total of 40 patients will be enrolled at one site and randomized in 1:1 ratio to either the treatment or control group.

 Patients will return for follow-up examination at 2 weeks and again at 1, 3 and 6 months after placement.

 Follow-up examination will consist of patient-reported outcomes and endoscopic grading by clinical investigators and an independent blinded reviewer based on video-endoscopy review.
