(fifthQuint)Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) to Treat Acute-on-chronic Liver Failure.

 The acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterised by a severe deterioration of liver function due to a precipitating event on top of an underlying chronic liver disease.

 As therapeutic options are limited the mortality rate lies between 40 and 80% at 3 months.

 The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized stem- as well as immune cells and improved liver function in preclinical trials.

 G-CSF treatment reduced the rate of infectious complications and significantly improved patients survival in acute on chronic liver failure, shown recently in small randomised studies.

 Thus, G-CSF is a promising treatment option that needs to be evaluated in a multi-centre controlled trial.

 The GRAFT trial will randomise patients with ACLF between standard of care with and without G-CSF.

 All participants will be followed for 12 months in order to evaluate safety and efficacy of G-CSF.

 If successful, the GRAFT trial has the potential to change clinical practice in acute on chronic liver failure.

 Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) to Treat Acute-on-chronic Liver Failure@highlight

Multicentre, open, randomised, and controlled trial conducted in patients diagnosed with acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria.

The objective of GRAFT-trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in patients with ACLF.

 All patients will receive standard medical care for ACLF according to the guidelines.

 Patients in the experimental arm additional receive subcutaneous injections of G-CSF.
