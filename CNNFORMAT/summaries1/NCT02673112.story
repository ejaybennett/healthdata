(secondQuint)Study of an Exercise Program (STEP) for Youth With Concussion.

 This is a minimal risk randomized controlled trial whose aim is to test the efficacy of an exercise intervention (STEP) for youth 11-18 yo with persistent concussive symptoms (1-6 months inclusive).

 The investigators are utilizing an active control (light stretching).

 The primary outcome will be concussion symptoms measured with the Health-Behavior Inventory (HBI) in the first month after randomization.

 Long-term efficacy will be examined using standardized measures of quality of life and function over 6 months, and potential mediators will be explored including brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), fear-avoidance and physical fitness.

 Physical activity will be measured with accelerometry to evaluate fidelity.

To compare the efficacy of a sub-threshold aerobic exercise intervention provided with mobile health coaching (STEP-mhc) and a light stretching program (LS) to LS alone for 11-18 yo youth with persistent concussion symptoms.
