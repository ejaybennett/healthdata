(secondQuint)Treatment Engagement With Technology-assisted Treatment.

 TES has been shown to be helpful as substance abuse treatment in certain groups of people, mainly in the outpatient setting by using interactive modules for education.

 This study will expose some participants to this program while they are hospitalized on an inpatient unit, and give them access to it after they are discharged from the hospital.

 Those participants will still receive treatment as usual, as will the control group.
