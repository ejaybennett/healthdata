(secondQuint)CO2-Laser Treatment in Patients With Diabetic Infected Foot Ulcers.

 The present study is designed to assess the antimicrobial effect of a single CO2 laser beam (DEKA SmartXide2 c80-El.

En, Florence Italy) in the treatment of diabetic infected foot ulcers.

 CO2 laser debridement will be compared with standard surgical care.

 The primary efficacy endpoint will be the reduction of bacterial load between pre- and immediately after debridement.

 Secondary endpoints will be adverse events and pain during treatment.

 Two bacterial sample with a flocked nylon swab will be collected before and after debridement.
