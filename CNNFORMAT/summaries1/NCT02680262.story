(secondQuint)Self-sampling for Non-participants in an Organised Cervical Cancer Screening Programme.

 The CHOice trial is a parallel randomised controlled, open label trial.

 Participants will be equally randomised into three arms: 1) Directly mailed a second reminder including a HPV self-sampling kit; 2) Mailed a second reminder offering a HPV self-sampling kit, to be ordered by e-mail, by text message, by phone, or by website; and 3) Mailed a second reminder for a conventional practitioner-collected sample (control group).
