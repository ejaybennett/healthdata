(fifthQuint)Check Point Inhibition After Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients at High Risk of Post Transplant Recurrence.

 This is a phase Ib-IIA study of post-transplant combined check point inhibitors for patients with a high risk of relapse (>50%) after an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

 Patients will accrue to study by disease groups and followed separately by group for incidence and severity of toxicity, ability to receive intended schedule of combined check point inhibitors and for complete response and progression free survival (PFS) rates.

 Complete response and progression free survival rates will be compared to published standards for each disease group.

 Expected PFS at 18 months for all post-transplant groups without check point inhibitors is less than 50%.

 Each group with PFS at 18 months in 4 or more patients (57%) will be considered for eligibility in a successor phase IIB expansion trial.

 Check Point Inhibition After Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients at High Risk of Post Transplant Recurrence@highlight

The goal of this study is to determine the safety and clinical effect of combined checkpoint inhibition administered after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in each of six clinical cohorts of high risk and recurrent disease.

 In addition to assessing the incidence and severity of adverse events and rates of complete response and progression free survival, investigators intend to monitor immune reconstitution, phenotype and TCR repertoire throughout treatment and at the time of disease progression.

 Investigators will also analyze the gut microbiome prior to conditioning, throughout treatment, post-transplant and at time of relapse.
