(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Activity of KD025 in Subjects With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.

 Thirty-six (36) male or postmenopausal/surgically sterilized female subjects with IPF who are eligible, will be randomly enrolled in a 2:1 ratio (KD025 to SOC) to one of two treatment groups.

 Subjects randomized to Treatment Group 1 will receive KD025 400 mg QD orally for 24 weeks.

 Subjects randomized to Treatment Group 2 will receive SOC (as deemed appropriate by the investigator).

 Subjects randomized to SOC will be treated exactly the same as subjects on KD025 and undergo all tests in similar fashion.
