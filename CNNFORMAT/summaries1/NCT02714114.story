(secondQuint)Standard Operating Procedures for Anti-HPV (Human Papillomavirus) Antibody Detection in First-void Urine (AB-SOP Study).

 In total 57 women will be included in this trial: 38 vaccinated with an prophylactic HPV vaccine and 19 not vaccinated with a prophylactic HPV vaccine.

 These women are asked to collect a first-void urine sample with the Colli-PeeTM device (Novosanis).

 Hereafter, a blood sample of 5-10 cc is collected.

 The collected urine and blood samples will be used for the development and optimisation of robust analytical protocols for sample preparation and antibody assays.
