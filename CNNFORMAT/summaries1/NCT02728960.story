(thirdQuint)Traumatic Brain Injury Biological Diagnosis Via High Definition Tractography Asymmetry Screening.

 This descriptive study sponsored by the United States Department of Defense involves the examination of TBI participants and normal control participants through MRI (Without Contrast) scanning.

 Normal controls are essential to develop a statistically sound range for the metrics derived from High Definition Fiber Tracking (HDFT).

 TBI subjects will undergo 1 MRI scan and normal controls will be asked to undergo 1 MRI scan.

 The study will involve blinded evaluations of results to determine the ability of HDFT imaging methods to evaluate TBI.

 In addition to the TBI and normal controls evaluated in this research study, investigators will be running 30 pilot participants.

 These participants will be undergoing MRI in order to streamline our pulse sequence and calibrate the MRIs.

 This is part of the technical development for the project and will occur before the recruitment of TBI subjects and normal controls for comparison.

 Data from the pilot subjects will not serve as control data for the TBI subjects.

 Traumatic Brain Injury Biological Diagnosis Via High Definition Tractography Asymmetry Screening@highlight

The primary purpose of this study is to validate the High Definition Fiber Tracking (HDFT/HDFTAS) technology, so that faster, more reliable diagnosis can be implemented in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).

 This study will involve Traumatic Brain Injury Patients and normal controls, in addition to 30 pilot participants who will be undergoing MRI in order to develop a statistically sound range for the metrics derived from HDFT.
