(fifthQuint)Emotional Disorders and Outcomes in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus at Primary Care.

 Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been shown to experience psychological burden and distorted illness perception.

 These psychological burden include feeling of burned-out, fatigue, distress and depression, and in addition of distorted illness perception often lead to difficulty in coping with the demands of life-style changes and adherence to medication.

 Diabetes-related distress (DRD) and depressive symptoms (DS) were associated with glycaemic control and medication adherence, and life-styles behaviors, respectively.

 However, evidence on the relationships between DRD, DS and clinically significant outcomes are scarce in Asian adults with T2DM.

 Primary care patients who participated before will be re-invited.

 This is a repeated cross-sectional study of a cohorts of 700 patients who were first studied in 2013 (Emotional Distress in adults with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus & Quality of Life [EDDMQoL] study with the National Medical Research Register (NMRR) identification number: NMRR-12-1167-14158).

 Demographic data (age, gender, ethnicity, religion, educational level, occupation and monthly income), smoking status, self-perceive social support and health literacy will be collected by questionnaires.
