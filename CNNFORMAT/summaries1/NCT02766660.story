(secondQuint)Optic Disc, Macula, and Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Measurements Obtained by OCT in Thyroid Associated Ophthalmopathy.

 One hundred and thirty two eyes of 66 patients with TAO and 72 eyes of 36 healthy controls were included in the study.

 Proptosis level was determined by Hertel exophthalmometer.

 Optic disc, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and macula parameters were measured by OCT.

 All measurements were compared between the patients and age and sex-matched healthy controls.

The aim of the study is to compare the measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), macula and optical disc parameters obtained by optical coherence tomography (OCT), and intraocular pressure (IOP) between the patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) and healthy controls.
