(firstQuint)Cerebral Oximetry With Near-infrared Spectroscopy and Negative Postoperative Behavioral Changes in Pediatric Surgery.

 This prospective and observational study involved consecutive patients aged between 2 and 12 years undergoing a major surgery using general anesthesia.

 Cerebral oxygen saturation, non-invasive arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, and heart rate were recorded at the following stages of the surgical intervention: baseline, induction, intubation, surgical incision, end of surgery, and extubation.

 Preoperative anxiety was evaluated by using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale, and NPOBC was determined by using the Post-Hospital Behaviour Questionnaire on 7th and 28th postoperative days.

 A logistic regression was created to identify factors associated with the development of NPOBC.

The main objective of the present study was to evaluate whether cerebral oxygen saturation is associated with an increase of NPOBC in pediatric patients undergoing major surgery.
