(fifthQuint)Timolol for the Treatment of Acne and Rosacea.

 Rosacea affects roughly 16 million Americans who desire better treatments than those currently available.

 Acne vulgaris, another chronic inflammatory skin disorder, mainly affects teenagers but also affects 20-40% of adults.

 Investigating potential new treatments will not only satisfy a clinical need, but also offers the opportunity to learn about the pathogenesis of the disease and skin biology.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible role of timolol as a therapy for the erythema and papules associated with acne and rosacea.

 It has been shown that timolol is beneficial and safe to treat infantile hemangiomas.

 The investigators hypothesize that it may also be safe and effective in the treatment of acne and rosacea.

 In a single experiment where the test case was the PI (a practicing physician), the investigators treated his rosacea with timolol for this off-label indication and have noticed an improvement in flushing and an unexpected improvement in acneiform eruptions associated with the rosacea.

 After 30 days, less flushing and acneiform lesions were noted on the treated right side compared to the left side .

 Similarly, at 60 days after treatment, as visualized by infrared imaging, significantly less inflammation and flushing was noted on the treated right side even outside of episodes of flushing.

 The improvement was durable, such that after a 60 day washout, improvements were still noted.

 In summary, during testing of the PI as a case subject, timolol appeared effective, safe, and with some disease-remissive effects.

 Our aim is to conduct a 16 week split-face pilot study with up to 30 patients who have a diagnosis of either inflammatory acne or rosacea to assess whether timolol maleate effectively reduces erythema, flushing, telangiectasias, and/or papules.

 The investigators also propose to biopsy a subset of our study patients to examine the biological activity in the skin before and after treatment.

 The investigators are particularly interested in studying epigenetic DNA methylation abnormalities in these conditions at baseline to compare to normal subjects and as a result of therapy.

 Timolol for the Treatment of Acne and Rosacea@highlight

This research is being done to determine the safety and tolerability of timolol in the treatment of acne and rosacea.

 The investigators will also look for specific biomolecular changes in acne or rosacea skin when it is exposed to timolol.

 Timolol is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of glaucoma.

 In dermatology, it has been used as a treatment to decrease the size of vascular (blood vessel) malformations in infant skin.

 Timolol is not approved for use in acne or rosacea and its use in this study is investigational.

 Many people with rosacea have telangiectasias which are small, red dilated blood vessels on the skin.

 They also suffer from flushing and acne-like lesions.

 Better treatments than those currently available are desired.

 Acne vulgaris, or acne, is another chronic inflammatory and very common skin disease that affects about 8 out of 10 young adults and adolescents.

 Signs of acne include papules and blackheads that are often called primary lesions because they represent an active form of the disease.

 There are also secondary lesions that can form later; they are known as acne scars
