(fifthQuint)Metabolic Therapy for Traumatic Brain Injury.

 Metabolic crisis is a state of energy insufficiency due to impaired mitochondrial function as indicated by cerebral microdialysis lactate/pyruvate ratio (LPR).

 We have performed safety analysis of glucose and sodium lactate infusions in humans and have demonstrated proof of concept that these fuels alter brain metabolism.

 Animal TBI studies have demonstrated proof of concept for all three candidate fuels.

 We will conduct a multicenter, adaptive design-based, proof of concept unblinded phase 2 study of up to 3 candidate supplemental fuels infused over 3 hours in patients with severe TBI undergoing standard of care multimodality monitoring with cerebral microdialysis.

 The three candidate fuels are be glucose, sodium lactate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate, with doses to be established in animal models.

 Infusions will be guided by point of care testing to achieve the ideal blood concentration during the infusion during the infusion.

 This is a 5-year safety study using a parallel intervention model with 4 arms, open-label, non-randomized.
