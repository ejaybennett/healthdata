(firstQuint)Simulation-based Arthroscopic Surgery Study.

 This single blinded randomised controlled study of junior orthopaedic trainees aims to assess whether the addition of simulation training improves arthroscopic technical skills performance of junior orthopaedic trainees during knee arthroscopy in the operating theatre compared to their usual clinical training programme.

 This will be assessed using objective motion analysis parameters recorded from wireless elbow-mounted motion sensors during surgery.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether simulation training improves the performance during arthroscopic surgery ('keyhole' surgery into a joint).
