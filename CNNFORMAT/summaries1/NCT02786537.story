 Study of Oral Treatments for Hepatitis C@highlight

Phase 1 of this study will compare the effectiveness of 3 approved HCV treatment regimens to learn whether they work equally well under real-world conditions.

 Phase 2 of this study will begin early 2017 and will compare the effectiveness of 2 FDA approved HCV treatments.

 Patients receiving HCV therapy in community and academic clinics will be offered the opportunity to consent to be randomly assigned to one of three regimens and then observed for outcomes.

 Once randomized, all medical care, laboratory testing, and any disease or side effect management will be assumed by usual care conditions, and patient-reported outcomes will be collected outside clinic in keeping with pragmatic design principles.
