(fifthQuint)Evaluation of hsTnI in the Management of Patients With Chest Pain in the Emergency Department.

 Purpose Current standard of care algorithm using high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) requires up to 6.

5 hours to diagnose an ACS.

 Data will be stratified based upon time of symptom onset and gender.

 A health economics and outcome model will be applied using the optimal high sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) cut-off values and draw times to determine the cost and outcome benefits predicted from optimal utilization of hsTnI.

 A chest pain registry will be set up to compare high sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) versus high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) for all patients who present to the emergency department and require a blood draw.

 The outcomes of these patients will be tracked over the study period.

 The purpose of conducting this study evaluation is: 1.

 To shorten the chest pain protocol for suitable patients to -80C.

 The frozen serum samples will be used to perform the hsTnI assays on the Abbott ARCHITECT i2000 analyzer in NHCS and the ACCESS AccuTnI+3 assays on the Beckman Coulter UniCel Dxl 800 analyzer in SGH Pathology by the study coordinator and SGH Pathology lab staff respectively.

 The screening Case Report Form is required for completion and will gather information on 3 key elements: 1) chest pain onset/characteristics; 2) comprehensive demographics to describe the study population; and 3) data for TIMI risk score generation (Appendix I).

 To assess the use of 3D-Vector ECG, a target of 1000 12-lead ECGs are to be retrieved from the electrocardiographs at SGH Emergency Department triage, with the post-analysis to be done at NHCS.

 The retrieved ECGs will be converted to 3D-vector ECG and analysed to extract discriminating parameters which can be reliably used to diagnose and localise the presence of ischaemia.

 Accuracy of the diagnoses will be counter checked with the results of further diagnostic tests performed on the patient in the normal course of treatment.

 From the analysis of these 1000 records, the sensitivity and specificity of the 3D-Vector ECG to localise acute coronary syndrome will be computed.

 4.

0 Lab Test Orders, Blood Draws, and Analysis After clinical assessment of the patient by an ER physician, an add-on troponin may be ordered for clinical purposes by the physician that will be applied to the time zero "presentation" blood draw.

 Likewise, a 2-hour troponin may be ordered for clinical purposes.

 Analysis of Beckman Coulter ACCESS AccuTnI+3 assays will take place on UniCel DxI 800 immunoassay system in the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Pathology.

 Analysis of ARCHITECT hsTnI assay will take place on Abbott ARCHITECT i2000 analyzer in the National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS) Laboratory.

 Calibration, Calibration verification, cross-over validation, and daily Quality Control for the hsTnI assay will be performed by medical technologists in conjunction with normal laboratory operations.

 6.

0 Study Duration 4,000 patients are expected to have been included in the study in a period of 5 years from the day of recruitment.

 Recruitment of new patients will end after 4,000 patients are enrolled.

 7.

0 Data Retrieval Laboratory data will be stored in the SingHealth Information System.

 Extraction of the data will be accomplished by export to an Excel spreadsheet.

 Clinical data will be printed out and entered into a computer database using a standardized case report form.

 8.

0 Telephone/ Medical records Follow-up Study patients will be contacted by telephone/ medical records on Day 30, Year 1, Year 2 and Year 5 after recruitment for any clinical events or symptoms that will be relevant to adjudication.

 The outcomes of these patients will be tracked over the study period.

 The purpose of conducting this study evaluation is: 1.

 To shorten the chest pain protocol for suitable patients to < 3 hours compared to the current 6 hours protocol with the latest high sensitivity Troponin I assays.

 2.

 To determine the validity of Abbott ARCHITECT i2000 and Beckman Coulter ACCESS AccuTnI+3 with an accelerated algorithm in comparison to the standard of care acute coronary syndrome (ACS) algorithm and high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) assay, to rule-out or rule-in for an ACS within 3 hours of presentation to the emergency room (ER) with isolated suspected ACS.

 3.

 To establish the local reference norms for hsTnI assays.
