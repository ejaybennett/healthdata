(thirdQuint)Comparing the "snifng Position" With "Simple Head Extension".

 The study included sixty obese patients with anticipated difficult airways.

The sniffing position was obtained by placement of a 7-cm cushion under the head of the patient.

 The extension position was obtained by simple head extension.

 The head position was randomized as follows: group A was in the sniffing position ;group B was in the extension position .

 Glottic exposure was assessed by the Cormack scale.

 Randomization was performed by placing index cards with the letter A or B into100 sealed envelopes (more than the number of study patients), which were then placed in random order.

 At the time of a patient's enrollment, the next available envelope was placed with the patient's chart.

 At the time of intubation, the envelope was opened and the sequence was thus determined.

 Comparing the "snifng Position" With "Simple Head Extension"@highlight

The simple head extension is recommended for optimization of glottic visualization during awake orotracheal intubation whith fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) .

 However, no study to date has confirmed its superiority over "sniffing position" .

 In a prospective, randomized study, the authors compared the sniffing position with simple head extension in awake orotracheal Intubation
