(fifthQuint)Exercise, Arterial Cross-Talk Modulation and Inflammation in an Ageing Population.

 In the cross-sectional part the investigators analyze physical fitness, vascular health and further outcomes in a healthy older active, a healthy older sedentary and a obese sedentary group with increased cardiovascular risk.

 The investigators will analyze large and small artery function, physical fitness and activity as well as inflammatory parameters in these three groups.

 Here the investigators will investigate the influence of physical activity and inflammatory parameters on the vascular health in different beds.

 In the intervention part the older sedentary group with increasing cardiovascular risk (OSR) will be randomized in a control and an intervention group.

 The intervention group will get a high intensity interval training which is walking based and individual adjusted.

 The control group will get general lifestyle recommendations.

 After 12 weeks of training OSR group will be tasted again.

 The aim of the second part is to assess the effect of high intensity interval training on vascular health and inflammatory parameters.

The aims of the study are twofold.

 In the cross-sectional approach (Part I), the study will be conducted in an older population to assess the association of physical fitness on different parts of the human vascular bed.

 In the interventional approach (Part II), it aims to investigate whether and to what extent advanced vascular ageing (AVA) in older subjects with increased cardiovascular risk can be reversed by regular walking- based high intensity interval training.
