(fifthQuint)A Patient Portal Tool, E-assist, for Supporting CRC Screening.

 During initial project period, the content was developed for the online e-assist tool using messages and tools developed under prior NCI-funded applications combined with newly developed messaging specific to this application.

 Throughout development, the principal investigator will seek input and guidance from a quality improvement team at the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) (i.

e.

, the local performance site) that is tasked with patient portal innovation for Meaningful Use.

 Once finalized, the effectiveness of e-assist will be evaluated using a three-arm, practical randomized trial.

 Trial participants will be randomized to one of the following three groups: 1.

 e-assist: Colon Health (treatment arm) [n = 900] 2.

 Healthwise Educational Program (active control) [n = 900] 3.

 Usual care control (observational only) [n = 900] For the evaluation, the investigators employ an intent-to-treat design with primary effectiveness measured by electronic health record (EHR)-documented CRC screening use.

 Secondary outcomes of interest include patient-reported CRC screening intent, perceived barriers to and support for CRC screening as well as perceived susceptibility and screening benefits.

 Results from all analyses will be used to develop an implementation guide for the dissemination and implementation of e-assist among diverse primary care practices.

 A Patient Portal Tool, E-assist, for Supporting CRC Screening@highlight

To compare patient perceptions, intent to screen, and screening use among those using a patient portal with and without a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening decision support tool, e-assist.

 To evaluate whether the effectiveness of e-assist is moderated by multi-level factors, including patient health literacy, decision-making preference, and CRC screening decision stage.

 To assess program impact and create an implementation guide for e-assist by combining results from Aims 1 & 2, a program implementation analysis/process evaluation and the perspectives of staff from future diverse implementation sites including small primary care practices, University-based primary practices and federally-qualified health centers.
