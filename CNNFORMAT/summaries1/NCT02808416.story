(fifthQuint)Personalized Cellular Vaccine for Brain Metastases (PERCELLVAC3).

 This is an open label, single-arm, single-institution, Phase I/II study designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of personalized cellular tumor vaccines for cancer patients with brain metastases (BM).

 BM patients will undergo tumor resection or biopsy and the tumor tissues will be analyzed for the expression of tumor antigens and immune-related genes.

 Tumor cells will be irradiated and used as vaccines.

 The patients will be immunized with DCs and PBMCs pulsed with mRNA encoded tumor antigens.

 Patients will be immunized with a total of twelve tumor vaccines.

 Safety and efficacy will be monitored.

 The primary objective is to assess the safety of the personalized cellular vaccines.

 The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of the vaccines using RANO-BM criteria, progression-free survival and overall survival.

 In addition, the antitumor specific T cell responses will be measured.

 Personalized Cellular Vaccine for Brain Metastases (PERCELLVAC3)@highlight

Cancer patients with brain metastases (BM) have poor prognosis.

 Current treatments produce limited efficacy.

 Recent advance in cancer immunotherapy has provided important new means to treat cancer patients at advanced stages.

 This study is designed to perform a clinical trial to treat advanced caner patients with brain metastases with personalized cellular vaccines.

 The patients will receive vaccines consisting of autologous tumor cells, tumor antigen pulsed DCs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

 Safety and efficacy will be observed in this study.
