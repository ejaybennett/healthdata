(thirdQuint)Remote Ischemic Preconditioning for Carotid Endarterectomy.

 Multiple large, high quality randomized trials have shown carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is effective in decreasing future risk of stroke in patients with carotid artery stenosis.

 Outcomes after carotid endarterectomy have improved over time.

 The major risks including stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) are rare ( 185mmHg or until the radial pulse is obliterated.

 This can occur during anesthesia induction and incision/dissection prior to manipulation or clamping of the carotid.

 Remote Ischemic Preconditioning for Carotid Endarterectomy@highlight

This is a randomized controlled trial designed to test an intervention (Remote ischemic preconditioning) in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for carotid artery stenosis (CAS).

 The outcomes of interest include neurocognitive function, cardiac complications, and biomarkers of brain ischemia.
