(thirdQuint)Registry Type Study to Monitor for Adverse Drug Reactions to Fedoruk Manufactured [F-18]-Fludeoxyglucose.

 This study will document the use of Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection (citrate formulation) in patients referred for [F-18]-FDG PET or PET/CT imaging at Royal University Hospital (RUH) in Saskatoon, SK.

 This investigational agent is produced using procedures, raw materials, equipment and quality standards that are equivalent to commercially-approved [F-18]-FDG Injection (Glucovision(R), manufactured by the CPDC in Hamilton ON).

 This is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomized study to monitor for adverse drug reactions among subjects administered Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection.

 Eligible subjects are those who would normally be referred by their physician for [F-18]-FDG PET or PET/CT imaging at RUH in Saskatoon, SK.

 The primary goal of this study is to permit immediate access, with appropriate regulatory and REB oversight, to Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection pending commercial approval.

 Monitoring for adverse drug reactions, during and after subjects are administered Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection, will support the primary objective of this study.

 Based on the well-established safety profile of [F-18]-FDG and the comparability of Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection to commercially-approved [F-18]-FDG Injection (Glucovision(R)), it is not expected that any ADRs will be observed.

 Registry Type Study to Monitor for Adverse Drug Reactions to Fedoruk Manufactured [F-18]-Fludeoxyglucose@highlight

This is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomized clinical trial designed to monitor the occurrence of adverse events associated with [F-18]-FDG Injection manufactured by the Fedoruk Centre.

 [F-18]-FDG Injection used in this clinical trial will be identical to commercial [F-18]-FDG that is already used at Royal University Hospital (RUH).
