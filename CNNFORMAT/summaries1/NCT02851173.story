(secondQuint)Cognitive Enhancement Through Transcranial Laser Therapy.

 The goal of this project is to test the efficacy of LLLT to enhance neurocognitive function in middle-aged adults and examine the modulating influences of carotid atherosclerosis.

 The specific aims will be accomplished in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) by examining cognitive test performance and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to a working memory task in middle-aged and older adults and participants with Mild Cognitive Impairment pre- and post- six-week long intervention of LLLT or placebo.

 In addition, the investigators will examine if carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) moderates the therapeutic effects of LLLT.

This is a mechanism-driven translational project to test the efficacy of transcranial low-level light/laser therapy (LLLT), for enhancing cognitive function in middle-aged and older adults and participants with Mild Cognitive Impairment.
