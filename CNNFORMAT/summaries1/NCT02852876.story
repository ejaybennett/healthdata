(secondQuint)Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Single Doses of ASP2151 in Healthy Male Subjects and the Effects of Food.

 Study will be divided into two parts.

 Part 1 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP2151 single rising doses in groups A-H in fasted condition and to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) if possible.

 Part 2 will evaluate the effect of fasted versus fed conditions on the safety, tolerability and PK of a single dose of ASP2151 in two treatment cycles.

 The wash-out period between the two treatment cycles will be at least 5 days and not shorter than five times the average elimination half-life of ASP2151, as determined in part 1 of the study.

 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Single Doses of ASP2151 in Healthy Male Subjects and the Effects of Food@highlight

The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single rising doses of ASP2151 under fasted condition in healthy male subjects.

 The study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of ASP2151 under fasted versus fed conditions in healthy male subjects.
