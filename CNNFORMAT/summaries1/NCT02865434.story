(secondQuint)Evaluating Safety of Escalating Doses of Tilmanocept by IV Injection and SPECT Imaging in Subjects With and Without RA.

 Prospective, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation, safety with PK and dosimetry study of injected Tc 99m tilmanocept in the detection of and assessment of localization to skeletal joints in subjects with and without active RA by SPECT imaging.

 All subjects will receive IV administration at one of 3 mass doses: 50 mu g, 200 mu g, or 400 mu g.

 Within each mass dose group, subjects will receive Tc 99m tilmanocept labeled with one of 3 radiolabel doses: 1 mCi, 5 mCi, or 10 mCi.

 All subjects will have a whole body planar SPECT scan.

 Subjects enrolled in Groups 1-9 will receive a whole body planar SPECT scan followed by a 3D SPECT or SPECT/CT scan on areas of interest at two specified time points post injection: 60 minutes 15 minutes and 180 minutes 15 minutes.

 Subjects enrolled in Groups 10-11 will receive a whole body planar SPECT scan performed at 4 specified time points post injection: 15 5 minutes, 60 15 minutes, 180 15 minutes and 18-20 hours.

 PK tests will be performed before injection (within 15 minutes), immediately following injection and at each scanning timepoint.

 Dosimetry tests will be performed at each scanning timepoint.
