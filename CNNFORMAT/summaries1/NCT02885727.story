(fifthQuint)Durvalumab Plus "Booster" RT for Metastatic Adenocarcinoma Pancreas Cancer Post Chemotherapy (GCC 1598).

 This clinical trial will use the combination of ionizing radiation and immunotherapy durvalumab (MEDI4736).

 It is the investigators hypothesis that this combination of ionizing radiation and immunotherapy is well tolerated and stimulates a clinically significant pancreas-cancer specific immune response.

 This trial's primary objective will be to evaluate whether the combination of RT and durvalumab can improve median PFS compared to chemotherapy historical control data in metastatic pancreas cancer patients who have progressed through first-line chemotherapy.

 The study population includes the metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients who have progressed through first-line chemotherapy.

 The number of subjects proposed to complete this study is 55.
