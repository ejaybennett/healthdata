(firstQuint)Effect of Hyperbaric Oxygen on Functional Connectivity in Patients With Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.

 Functional MRI studies will be done before and 4-6 weeks after Hyperbaric Oxygen treatment to assess changes in connectivity of resting state neural networks.

 10 hyperbaric treatments at 2 atmospheres absolute for 1 hour at pressure will be administered.

 A review of symptoms and and thorough clinical neurological examination by an experienced neurologist familiar with these studies will be done before and 4-6 weeks after the hyperbaric treatments.
