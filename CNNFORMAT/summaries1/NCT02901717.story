(fifthQuint)Mino-Lok Therapy (MLT) for the Treatment of CRBSI/CLABSI.

 This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind study to determine the efficacy and safety of MLT, a novel antibiotic lock therapy that combines minocycline with edetate disodium in 25% ethanol solution.

 Mino-Lok Therapy is being developed as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of catheter-related or central line associated bloodstream infection (CRBSI/CLABSI) in combination with appropriate systemic antibiotic(s), to preserve central venous access and to avoid the complications and morbidities associated with catheter removal and reinsertion.

 Approximately 700 subjects who have been diagnosed with CRBSI/CLABSI and who meet all necessary criteria for the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms: - MLT Arm: MLT + SOC intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy; or - Control Arm (subjects randomized to the Control Arm will receive treatment based on the type and virulence of the infecting organism as documented by the Investigator prior to randomization): 1.

 Saline-heparin (placebo) lock + SOC IV antibiotics.

 (NOTE: The saline lock arm is reserved for coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, or other organisms deemed to be of low virulence per the Investigator); or 2.

 Antibiotic lock + SOC IV antibiotics.

 The antibiotic lock will be comprised of heparin and the same antibiotic delivered systemically.

 (NOTE: The antibiotic lock arm may include subjects with S.

 aureus, including methicillin-resistant S.

 aureus, vancomycin intermediate S.

 aureus, or vancomycin-resistant S.

 aureus; vancomycin resistant enterococci; Candida, Pseudomonas; other Gram negative organisms; or other organisms deemed to be of high virulence per the Investigator).

 At least 50 subjects will be randomized to this arm.

 In the event that more than 1 organism is isolated, the Investigator will specify which single antibiotic should be used for the lock.

 Randomization will be stratified by type of CVC, presence of neutropenia, and by type and virulence of the infecting organism.

 The first 5 doses of lock therapy should be administered within the first 7 days following randomization (Visit T1 through Visit T5), with the first 3 doses administered consecutively once daily (QD) for the first 3 days following randomization (Visit T1 through Visit T3).

 The next 2 doses should be administered within the next 4 days.

 Subsequent doses will occur once weekly over the following 2 weeks (Visit T6 and Visit T7 [EOT]) for a total of 7 doses.

 All lock treatments will be administered for a dwell time of 2 hours QD on each day of treatment.

 All efforts will be made to ensure that lock therapy is performed between antibiotic doses and is scheduled to maximize the time between the lock therapy and administration of IV antibiotics.

 The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects in the ITT Population who have Overall Success at TOC (Week 8).

 Success is defined as any subject who demonstrates eradication of the pathogen, stabilization or improvement in signs and symptoms of the infection, catheter salvage, AND survival at termination of the study.

 Analysis for the primary endpoint will compare the overall success rate between the MLT Arm and the Control Arm.
