(fifthQuint)Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of FAB117-HC in Patients With Acute Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury.

 FAB117-HC is an investigational medicinal product whose active substance is HC016, allogeneic adipose-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells expanded and pulsed with H2O2.

 The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single administration of FAB117-HC using: a) two sequential escalating doses administered between 72 and 120 hours post-injury, to patients with acute traumatic SCI with AIS grade A; and b) the determined maximum tolerated dose administered between 48 and 72 h post-injury to patients with ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) grading of A or B.

 The study includes also initial exploration of efficacy.

 Treatment is administered by intramedullary injection into the injured spinal cord, during the decompression and stabilization surgery (DSS) of the fracture.

 DSS is routinely performed on almost all SCI patients.

 The study has been divided into two phases: Phase 1 (open label): 6 AIS A patients with lesion located between D5 and D10 will be included in 2 sequential cohorts.

 Phase 2 (randomized, controlled, double-blind): 40 AIS A or B patients with lesion located between D1 and D12, will be randomly divided into two groups (control and treated) that will be balanced in AIS grade.

The main objective of the study is the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of FAB117-HC (a medicinal product containing human allogeneic adipose derived adult mesenchymal stem cells expanded and pulsed with H2O2, HC016 cells) administered at a single-time point to patients with acute thoracic traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).

 The study will also include initial exploration of potential clinical efficacy.

 Dose levels of 20 million and 40 million cells will be administered.
