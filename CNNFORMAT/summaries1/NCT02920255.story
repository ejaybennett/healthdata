(thirdQuint)Comparison of Electronic Calipers to Conventional Calipers and X-ray Measurement of Spinal Tilt.

 Participants will have 2 spinal measurements, one at the shoulder and one at the hip, taken by electronic calipers and conventional calipers with different individual research staff.

 Up to 5 individual research staff will take the 2 spinal measurements on each participant.

 This will be done to compare variation of measurements between individual operators.

 The accuracy of the spinal measurements, obtained with electronic and conventional calipers will be compared to the results obtained from x-rays taken of shoulder and hip areas.

 Only one x-ray of the shoulder and one x-ray of the hip will be taken of each participant.

 X-rays represent the clinically accepted standard of obtaining spinal measurements.

 The data will analyzed statistically to determine sources of variation among the methods of spinal measurement described above.

 Comparison of Electronic Calipers to Conventional Calipers and X-ray Measurement of Spinal Tilt@highlight

The objective is to compare the accuracy and reproducibility of measurements taken with electronic calipers and conventional calipers.

 Using both calipers, reproducibility will be determined by comparing results from a number of practitioners and accuracy will be determined by comparing results with those obtained from X-rays.
