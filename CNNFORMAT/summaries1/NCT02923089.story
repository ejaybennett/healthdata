(thirdQuint)Postprandial Blood Glucose and Insulin Levels Following Consumption of Lentil-containing Food Products.

 The purpose of the current study is to determine the effects of lentil-containing food products on postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels in healthy premenopausal women and men aged 18-40 years old.

This study will use a randomized crossover design.

 Participants will complete a series of 9 study visits during which participants will consume 9 study treatment meals consisting of muffins, soup and chilli, with and without lentils.

 Participants will then have their blood sampled for the following 2 hours by finger prick.

 Participants will remain seated during the test period.

 All study visits will occur at the Human Nutraceutical Research Unit and be separated by a washout period of 3-7 days.

 Throughout the study, it will be asked that participants' lifestyle and physical activity remain unchanged.

 Participants will be instructed to not start any new dietary approaches, and to not start any new natural health products (unless instructed by a physician).
