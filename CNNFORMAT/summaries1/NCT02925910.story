(secondQuint)Comparison of User Experience With Wheelsoft Wheels Intalled on a Wheelchair Compared With Normal Wheels.

.

 The patients who are received to the rehabilitation ward and are confined to the use of a wheelchair are randomized to two groups.

 The first are given a wheelchair with wheelsoft wheels and the second group with regular wheels.

 The wheels of the chair are all covered to look similar to regular wheels (the regular wheels are also covered).

 All the patients will be taken once a day to a 10 minute trip with the wheelchair.

 After two days a questionnaire regarding their experience with the chair will be passed.

 On the third day the groups will change their wheels to the other kind.

 And again taken to daily trips and a final questionnaire on day four.

 We will collect additional data from the patients: age, sex, medical record, weight, height, ethnic background, marital status, working status.
