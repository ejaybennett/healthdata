(firstQuint)Regorafenib in Relapsed Glioblastoma.

 The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the overall survival (OS) in the intention to treat (ITT) population.

 Secondary aims are to evaluate the progression free survival (PFS), safety, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) in the ITT population, and the evaluation of quality of life (QoL).

 Additional exploratory objectives include the analysis of antiangiogenic and metabolic biomarkers in tissue at first and second surgery (if performed) by the evaluation of certain metabolic features of tumors that could be involved in tumor responses to antiangiogenic drugs.
