(secondQuint)Autonomic Cardiovascular Neuropathy in Recently Diagnosed DM2 Patients (ACNDM2).

 Until now the autonomic dysfunction in Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM2)has been broadly studied in long term patients.

 Thus, clinical features as cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and the lack of the baroreceptor reflex were widely described in patients with a long standing Diabetes.

 However, there hasnt been a description of the initial autonomic imbalance in both Pre-Diabetes and recently diagnosed DM2 patients.

 This is the goal of the present research study, to assess the autonomic dysfunction among these sets of patients.

 Yet CAN is finding mostly happening in late stages of DM2 and so the lack of Baroreceptor reflex sensitivity there are other subtle indicators of dysautonomia which hasn't been extensively analyzed.

 In fact, rest tachycardia and orthostatic intolerance may point to an early dysautonomia.

 A description of the impairment of the cardiovascular autonomic regulation is still missing.

 Therefore, the investigators intend to evaluate this regulation through the means of a Task Force System.

The investigators are studying the initial autonomic alterations in participants recently diagnosed with DM2 and in those patients classified as Pre-Diabetes, mainly focused on the baroreceptor sensitivity and on the peripheral sympathetic innervation.
