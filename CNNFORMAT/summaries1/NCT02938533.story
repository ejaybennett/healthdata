(thirdQuint)Social Norms and Priming to Improve Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy and Retention in Care.

 The investigators conducted a quasi-experimental pilot study of a combination behavioral intervention based on the concepts of social norms and priming.

 The intervention included visual feedback about clinic-level retention in care, a self-relevant prime, and useful take-home items with the priming image.

 The intervention was developed using tools from marketing research and patient-centered design.

 The hypothesis was that the intervention would improve retention in care and adherence to ART among patients living with HIV infection (PLHIV).

 The intervention was implemented at two HIV primary clinics in Shinyanga, Tanzania in 2-week intervals for six months.

 The investigators reviewed medical records of a random sample of exposed and unexposed adult PLHIV to compare retention and the proportion of patients with medication possession ratio (MPR) 95% after six months.

 Social Norms and Priming to Improve Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy and Retention in Care@highlight

Interventions incorporating constructs from behavioral economics and psychology have the potential to enhance HIV 'treatment as prevention' (TasP) strategies.

 To test this hypothesis, the investigators evaluated a combination intervention to improve antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence based on the concepts of social norms and priming.
