(fifthQuint)Motivating Our Mothers 2.

 Depression in mothers parenting young children is common and undertreated.

 Depression is debilitating for mothers, negatively affects their parenting, and is associated with mental, behavioral, and physical health problems in their children.

 Identifying and treating mothers with depression improves both the mothers' well-being and their children's mental and overall health.

 Pediatric visits offer a potential significant opportunity to intervene.

 Mothers may see their child's pediatric provider more often than their own, and these providers could motivate mothers to seek effective, underutilized, formal depression care, by communicating how recovery from depression is linked to child well-being.

 Therefore, in recent pilot work, the investigators developed a pediatric setting-based intervention that includes a validated maternal depression screen, and subsequent depression education and care-seeking motivational messages that emphasize the benefits of maternal depression care for children.

 Initial testing demonstrated that depression screen-positive mothers receiving the intervention had greater intention and attempts to seek depression care compared to mothers receiving usual care.

 The investigators then professionally translated the intervention into Spanish as a first step in increasing the generalizability of the intervention through refinement in future studies.

 As is often the case with interventions tested as a package, the investigators lack empirical evidence on which components of the pilot intervention deliver the greatest effects.

 Therefore, the investigators propose to adopt a rapid-cycle intervention improvement approach.

 In this trial, the investigators will assess the effects intervention refinements on depression screen-positive mothers' depression care-seeking, using a factorial randomized design.

 The resulting intervention will be provisionally optimized by including only those refined components found to be most experimentally efficacious.

 This provisionally optimized intervention will have a higher probability of demonstrating reproducible effectiveness, potentially speeding the way to implementation.

 The ultimate optimized intervention will improve maternal depression care by being an essential link in future integrated systems between pediatric-based maternal depression screening and effective community-based programs for maternal mental health care.

 The investigators modified the initial anticipated sample size reported from 312 to 80.

 During the course of recruiting and enrollment investigators found the need to reorient the trial to one of feasibility and reduced the sample size accordingly.

 The investigators' goal is to obtain an analytic sample size that will allow for balanced numbers of participants in each cell across sites, with a minimum of 5 observations per intervention type.

 Given variable recruiting and retention rates, this could be a recruited sample size between 48 and 80 individuals.

 In addition, investigators extended the initial recruiting time frame.

 Motivating Our Mothers 2@highlight

Mothers with symptoms suggesting clinical depression can be identified and potentially motivated to seek further care during pediatric visits for their young children.

 The best ways for pediatric providers to encourage mothers to seek further evaluation and treatment for their depressive symptoms are not known.

 The investigators plan to provisionally optimize a pediatric office-based intervention that the investigators developed to motivate mothers who may be depressed to seek further care and, thereby to improve the well-being of women from diverse backgrounds and their children.
