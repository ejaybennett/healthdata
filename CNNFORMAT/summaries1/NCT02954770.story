(secondQuint)Long-term Usage of the Fitbit Among Medical Residents.

 Medical training is notoriously stressful.

 The combination of long work hours, sleep deprivation, clinical responsibilities, and academics leaves little time for residents and fellows to consider their own health maintenance, particularly with regards to physical activity.

 This is problematic for both the physician and the physician's patients.

 Numerous studies have shown that physicians who exercise regularly and maintain normal body mass are more likely to counsel their patients on these issues.

 Additionally, they are more experienced in the benefits of exercise and can counsel their patients on how to incorporate exercise into a busy schedule.

 This is a one year follow up survey study after a Fitbit(R) challenge study among TriHealth residents.

 The purpose of the initial Fitbit(R) challenge study was to to determine if wearing a Fitbit(R) motivates residents to increase their physical activity.

 This study seeks to determine the long-term usage of the Fitbit(R).
