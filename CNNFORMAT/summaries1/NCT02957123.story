(fifthQuint)Intranasal Inhalations of Bioactive Factors Produced by M2 Macrophages in Patients With Organic Brain Syndrome.

 Following injury to the central nervous system (CNS), immune-mediated inflammation profoundly affects the ability of neural cells to survive and to regenerate.

 The role of inflammation comprises mostly of macrophages, is controversial, since macrophages can both induce neuronal and glial toxicity and promote tissue repair.

 The opposite effects of macrophages may be conditioned by their functional heterogeneity.

 Thus, classical pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) are tissue-destructive, while anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages mediate tissue repair.

 In addition, M2 macrophages predominantly induce the Th2 response, which is particularly beneficial in CNS repair.

 Using low serum conditions the investigators have generated M2-like macrophages and evaluated their phenotypic and functional features [1, 2].

 Our data indicate that M2 macrophages, in contrast to pro-inflammatory M1 cells, produced significantly lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-, IL-6, IL-18, IL-12), chemokines (IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1-1) and Th1/Th2-cytokines (interferon-, IL-2, IL-4) coupled with a higher IL-10 level.

 M2 macrophages were capable of producing neurotrophic- (brain-derived neurotrophic factor,insulin-like growth factor-1), angiogenic- (vascular endothelial growth factor), and other growth factors (erythropoietin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor , basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor) with neuroprotective and regenerative activity.

 Our pilot clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and clinical efficacy of intrathecal administration of M2 macrophages in children with severe cerebral palsy [3] and in non-acute stroke patients [4].

 Since cell-free culture medium of M2 macrophages contains a wide variety of neurotrophic, immunoregulatory and pro-angiogenic factors, the investigators expect that intranasal administration of these auto-M2-BFs will improve the treatment/rehabilitation efficacy and functional outcome of patients with organic brain syndrome.

 Of note, intranasal administration of M2-macrophage soluble factors allow to delivery bioactive agents to brain through the olfactory and trigeminal ways across brain-blood barrier.

 Intranasal Inhalations of Bioactive Factors Produced by M2 Macrophages in Patients With Organic Brain Syndrome@highlight

The investigators have designed an innovative proof-of-concept trial designed to provide data as to whether the treatment/rehabilitation efficacy and functional outcome of patients with organic brain syndrome are improved with intranasal inhalations of bioactive factors (BF), produced by autologous M2 macrophages (auto-M2-BFs).

 The rationale for this approach is the ability of central nervous system to repair and the important role of macrophages in the regulation of this process.

 It was found that type 2 macrophages have anti-inflammatory and reparative potential, whereas M1 cells possess pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic effects.

 Action of M2 macrophages is largely realized through the production a wide variety of bioactive factors (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, neuropeptides, microvesicles etc) that inhibit inflammation, protect neurons from apoptosis, stimulate neurogenesis, the growth and remyelination of axons, the formation of new synapses and activate angiogenesis.

 This study uses auto-M2-BFs, as therapeutic agents and intranasal administration focusing on nose to brain transport, as a mode of delivery.

 Expected clinical effects in treated subjects: improvement of cognitive functions (memory, language, attention); correction of focal neurological deficit (paresis, spasticity, sensory disorders); reduction vestibular/ataxic disorders (vertigo, unsteadiness when walking); reduction of headaches; reduction of asthenia (weakness, fatigue); correction of emotional disorders (anxiety, depression).
