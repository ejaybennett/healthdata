(firstQuint)Clinical Efficacy and Safety of Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery on Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma.

 A randomized, single blind, positive parallel control study method was used.

This prospective case series will recruit 246 Chinese POAG, 123 cases in the experimental group will receive AIT treatment and 123 cases in the control group will receive trabeculectomy(Trab) surgery.

Measurements of intraocular pressure(IOP) , visual acuity, refraction, slit lamp examination of the anterior segment and fundus, optical coherence tomography(OCT) to detect retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, macular thickness, visual field, gonioscopy and ultrasonic biological microscopy (UBM) will be recorded.

They will be followed up for 12 months.

 The main outcome is success rate of IOP reduction and the other outcome are the number of antiglaucoma medication and complications .
