(fifthQuint)Folate Receptor Alpha Peptide Vaccine With GM-CSF Versus GM-CSF Alone in Patients With Platinum Sensitive Ovarian Cancer.

 This is a multicenter double-blind controlled randomized Phase II study to evaluate the activity of folate receptor alpha (FR) peptide vaccine as a consolidation treatment following completion of no less than 4 cycles of a platinum containing regimen in patients with platinum-sensitive, non-mucinous ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

 The patients will have demonstrated a tumor response or stable disease upon their last regimen (per RECIST v1.

1 and/or CA125 GCIG criteria) prior to enrolment in this study.

 Following randomization, patients will be administered TPIV200 with GM-CSF adjuvant or GM-CSF control alone.

 Patients will have booster doses and tumor assessments done every 12 weeks 1 week for up to 1.

5 years, until objective disease progression or the patient withdraws consent.

 Tumor responses will be assessed at the study sites by evaluating tumor images/scans according to RECIST v1.

 Folate Receptor Alpha Peptide Vaccine With GM-CSF Versus GM-CSF Alone in Patients With Platinum Sensitive Ovarian Cancer@highlight

This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel groups Phase II trial.

 Patients with platinum-sensitive advanced ovarian cancer, defined as a lack of progression by RECIST v1.

1 criteria following completion of standard-of-care chemotherapy, including a minimum of 4 cycles of a platinum-containing regimen.

 Patients will be randomized to either the vaccine regimen with GM-CSF adjuvant or GM-CSF adjuvant alone as a control group.

 Treatment will be administered as a consolidation therapy within one year of the last administration of platinum, targeting the first remission.
