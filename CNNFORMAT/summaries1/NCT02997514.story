(fifthQuint)Solution Focused Coaching Strategy Within a Paediatric Multidisciplinary Neuromuscular Clinic.

 Nationally, standards of care have been published for paediatric neuromuscular (NM) conditions to optimize care, improve quality of life and increase life span.

 Children with NM conditions are followed in regional multidisciplinary clinics in Ontario and across Canada.

 At each visit they can be seen by 8 health care providers each focusing on and making recommendations for the different aspects of their care.

 Currently, there are no evidenced based interventions for children with NM conditions evaluating the ability of children to set and attain their care goals and/or other personally meaningful goals.

 Self-determination is defined as the ability to "use skills, knowledge and beliefs that enable a person to engage in goal directed, self-regulated, autonomous behavior.

" The development of self-determination is a process that begins in childhood.

 Solution Focused Coaching (SFC) is a strengths- based, client-centered approach to service delivery that supports clients to build on their existing capacity to move closer to meaningful goals.

 This study will evaluate the impact of SFC on goal setting, achievement and self determination in children with NM conditions.

 Solution Focused Coaching Strategy Within a Paediatric Multidisciplinary Neuromuscular Clinic@highlight

The purpose of this study is to implement Solution Focused Coaching in pediatric rehabilitation (SFC-peds) within the multidisciplinary neuromuscular clinic at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital and evaluate its effect on children's ability to set and attain personally meaningful goals.

 A secondary goal is to determine the impact of SFC-peds on self-determination in children with neuromuscular conditions.

 This study aims to compare two methods of SCF-peds delivery, a single coaching session vs.

 intensive coaching (5 sessions) on goal attainment.

 This study will also help researchers and clinicians understand the types of goals that are set by children with neuromuscular conditions.

 Lastly, this study is going to explore with the participants their perception of the feasibility of using this methodology within a clinical context.
