(firstQuint)OSUWMC EEI Sequential Cataract Patient Experience Project.

 Each patient is scheduled to undergo two sequential cataract extractions under topical anesthesia with local anesthetic eye drops and minimal sedation- one on each eye.

 The surgeon, basic surgical procedure, anesthetic technique, and approximate length of procedure are reasonably similar and the patients act as their own control.

 Subjects in the study will answer very brief questions regarding anxiety and comfort about their surgery before and after each procedure, and on the day after their second surgery.

The purpose is to gauge the patients' level of comfort and anxiety for sequential cataract surgeries to assess if the second experience of cataract surgery differs from the initial experience.
