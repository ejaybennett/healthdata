(thirdQuint)Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel (HAV) in Patients With Limb-threatening Peripheral Arterial Trauma.

 This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm, non-randomized phase 2 study in up to 20 adult patients with limb-threatening damage to the superficial femoral or popliteal artery who require surgical repair.

 Subjects will be implanted with a Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel (HAV) as an interposition vessel or bypass using standard vascular surgical techniques.

 There is no control arm.

 The active study duration for each study participant will be 12 months from HAV implantation or until HAV failure/ removal/ death if earlier.

 Additional follow up at 6 month intervals until 36 months will involve the capture of information on assessments performed at "standard of care" routine clinic visits or by telephone follow up with the patient or his/her physician.

 There are no study specific visits or procedures after 12 months.

 The total expected duration of the clinical study is 24 months (12 months of enrollment and 12 months of study specific visits) plus 2 years additional follow up at routine clinical visits or via telephone contact with the subject and/or the physician designated to continue long term care of the subject.
