(thirdQuint)Omission of Intact Parathyroid Hormone Testing During Surgery in Treating Patients With Primary Hyperparathyroidism.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the non-inferiority of omission of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients who meet the biochemical and radiological criteria compared to current standard of care (i.

e.

 use of intraoperative parathyroid hormone testing).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Cost-analysis to determine savings of omission of intraoperative PTH testing.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard minimally invasive parathyroidectomy without PTH testing during surgery.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks.

 Omission of Intact Parathyroid Hormone Testing During Surgery in Treating Patients With Primary Hyperparathyroidism@highlight

This clinical trial studies the omission of intact parathyroid hormone testing during surgery in treating patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.

 Omission of intact parathyroid hormone testing during parathyroid gland removal may help patients with primary hyperparathyroidism to decrease their time under anesthesia, and decrease the overall time and cost of surgery.
