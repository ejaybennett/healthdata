(fifthQuint)Japanese Post-Market Cohort Study.

 This is a prospective, observational, open cohort study of adults, legally authorized to purchase tobacco products in Japan.

 The study will describe the patterns of use of tobacco and nicotine containing products and self-reported health outcomes in CC smokers and IQOS users.

 For IQOS users, the date of initiation of IQOS use is the trigger for all study assessments in the study.

 However the process will be different for CC smokers for whom assessment timing will be based on the date of enrollment.

 IQOS users will be enrolled into the study at least two months after initiating use of IQOS (to ensure adoption of IQOS), but less than 12 months after initiating use of IQOS.

 The study assessments will start at the next appropriate study time point after enrollment.

 As this study is observational by design and is conducted in a post-market setting, adverse event (AE) reporting will follow the Sponsor's established post-market Safety Surveillance Procedures for spontaneously reported events.

 IQOS users will be reminded of the product quality complaints (including AEs) hotline that is available for all IQOS consumers in Japan.

 Japanese Post-Market Cohort Study@highlight

The objectives and endpoints of this study will be analyzed in the study population of adults legally authorized to buy tobacco products.

 The study will describe the patterns of use of tobacco and nicotine containing products and self-reported health outcomes and health related events in CC (Cigarette) smokers and IQOS users in Japan.

 Note: The initial study record (posted to ClinicalTrials.

gov) included a clinical sub-study designed to estimate population level differences in the biomarkers of exposure and clinical risk endpoints between iQOS users, CC smokers and never-smokers.

 However, due to low recruitment and retention of subjects, the clinical sub-study was terminated in May 2017 and the main study was terminated in March 2018.

 The study protocol was updated to remove the clinical sub-study objectives.

 This version of the study reflects the latest version of the updated study protocol.
