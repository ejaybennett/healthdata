(firstQuint)An Evaluation of Tilmanocept by IV Injection Using SPECT/CT vs PET Imaging in Subjects With Liver Metastases.

.

 This is a prospective, open-label, single-center, comparator study of IV injected Tc 99m Tilmanocept in the localization and detection of liver metastases in subjects with confirmed CRC.

 The study will be divided into two cohorts.

 This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Tc 99m tilmanocept administered intravenously.

 SPECT/CT imaging of the subject's abdominal cavity will be reviewed to establish concordance with FDG PET imaging.
