(secondQuint)Procalcitonin Level as a Surrogate for Catheter-related Blood Stream Bacteremia Among Hemodialysis Patients.

 Catheter-related blood stream bacteremia is common among hemodialysis patients.

 Clinically, fever and/or rigors with laboratory indicator of inflammation as leucocytosis and elevated c-reactive protein level are considered as markers for CRBSI before blood culture results became available.

 Procalcitonin is a valid indicator of sepsis.

 In this study, Procalcitonin level will be measured in any patient with suspected CRBSI and correlation will be tested for proved CRBSI by blood cultures.

 Procalcitonin Level as a Surrogate for Catheter-related Blood Stream Bacteremia Among Hemodialysis Patients@highlight

Hemodialysis patients frequently develop catheter-related blood stream bacteremia (CRBSI).

 Procalcitonin is a marker of sepsis in bacterial infection.

 this study for detection of its role as a surrogacy marker in CRBSI.
