(fifthQuint)Phase 1b Study PVSRIPO for Recurrent Malignant Glioma in Children.

 PVSRIPO will be delivered intratumorally by CED using an intracerebral catheter placed within the enhancing portion of the tumor.

 The population group are patients with recurrent WHO grade III or IV malignant glioma who are aged 12 through 18 years old.

 After a single dose of PVSRIPO, subjects will return for periodic visits to monitor tumor status, adverse events, and changes in blood immune profiles.

 A maximum of 12 pediatric patients will be treated with PVSRIPO, and then carefully monitored for safety for at least a year after treatment.

 Phase 1b Study PVSRIPO for Recurrent Malignant Glioma in Children@highlight

The purpose of the study is to confirm the safety of the selected dose and potential toxicity of oncolytic poliovirus (PV) immunotherapy with PVSRIPO for pediatric patients with recurrent WHO grade III or IV malignant glioma, but evidence for efficacy will also be sought.

 The primary objective is to confirm the safety of the selected dose of PVSRIPO when delivered intracerebrally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) in children with recurrent WHO Grade III malignant glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma) or WHO Grade IV malignant glioma (glioblastoma, gliosarcoma).

 A secondary objective is to estimate overall survival (OS) in this population.
