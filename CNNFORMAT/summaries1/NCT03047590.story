(thirdQuint)Comparison of Affect-based, Self-selected, and Traditional Exercise Prescriptions.

 The purpose of this study is to determine if an "affect-based" or "choice-based" exercise prescription is more effective for behavior change than a traditional, "moderate-intensity" exercise prescription.

 Prior research suggests that "choice-based" or "self-selected" exercise intensity is more pleasant and adhered to than "moderate-intensity exercise" (Williams et al.

, 2014).

 Similarly, affect-based exercise prescriptions (i.

e.

, an exercise prescription where intensity is regulated based on the pleasure-displeasure one feels while exercising) appear to have merit (Baldwin, Kangas, Denman, Smits, Yamada, & Otto, 2016).

 However, choice-based and affect-based exercise prescriptions have not been compared to each other.

 Further, it is unknown if it is the intensity regulation that matters (e.

g.

, "choose an intensity that feels good" or the focus on affect (e.

g.

, "focus on feeling good).

 Third, prior research has not objectively measured physical activity behavior.

This study will evaluate adherence to four types of walking programs.

 Participants will be randomized to walking programs that included either (1) affect-based exercise intensity, (2) self-selected (or "choice-based") exercise intensity, (3) heart-rate based exercise intensity, or (4) heart-rate guided exercise intensity with the emphasis on affective benefits.
