(fifthQuint)Screening for Glucose Metabolism Disorders in Cardiac Rehabilitation.

 We will select all the patients referred to our Cardiac Rehabilitation center after an ACS.

 HbA1c will be measured in each patient included in the study.

 the OGTT will be prescribed in all the patients without known diabetes and with HbA1c < 6.

5%.

 In order to perform a "real life" study, the OGTT will not performed in the CR center but will prescribed in each patient who will be asked to perform it in an external biological laboratory.

 The OGTT will be performed in the morning after a 12 hour fast, with 75g oral glucose load.

 Plasma glucose will be measured at baseline and 120 min after the oral glucose load.

 The results will be classified according to the WHO criteria: diabetes is defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) greater or equal to 7.

0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or glucose level 2h (2hPG) after the OGTT greater or equal to 11.

1mmol/L (200mg/dL); impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is defined as FPG greater or equal to 6.

1 mmol/L (110mg/dL) and less than 7.

0 mmol/L and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is defined as a 2hPG greater or equal to 7.

8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) and less than 11.

1mmol/L.

 In parallel, screening for glucose metabolism disorders with the OGTT after an ACS will be evaluated in the whole French population from a representative sample of 1/97eme French population of the "National Health Insurance Inter-Regime Information System" (SNIIRAM) which collects individual hospital and non-hospital data for health care consumption.

 Screening for Glucose Metabolism Disorders in Cardiac Rehabilitation@highlight

Because prevalence of glucose metabolism disorders is high in patients with coronary disease, the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) is recommended in all patients without diabetes after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

 However, there are some concerns about its performance in clinical practice.

 The aim of our study was to evaluate, after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the feasibility and efficacy of the OGTT in a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) center in comparison with its real application in the whole French population.
