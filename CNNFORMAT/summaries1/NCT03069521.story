(firstQuint)Study to Evaluate the Safety of the EndoArt for Treatment of Subjects Suffering From Corneal Edema.

 Title: Prospective, feasibility study to evaluate the safety of the EndoArt cent for treatment of subjects suffering from corneal edema Device: EndoArt cent (Artificial Endothelial Layer) Intended Use: The EndoArt cent device is intended for use as an endothelial kearatoprosthesis in patients with chronic cornel edema Study Design: Prospective open-label feasibility clinical study Study Objectives: To evaluate the safety of the EndoArt cent implanted in subjects suffering from corneal edema.

 Study Hypothesis: Treatment with the EndoArt cent is safe and may result in alleviating symptoms resulting from chronic corneal edema (corneal thickness).

 Study population: Men and women suffering from a decrease in vision due to chronic corneal edema that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and provide written Informed Consent will enrolled in the study.

 Enrollment: A total of 12 subjects will be enrolled.

 Study Duration: Completion of active enrolment is anticipated to last approximately 12 months.

 The primary end point will be achieved when the final study subject has completed 6 month follow up.

 Subject will be followed up to 12 month.

 Primary Safety Endpoint: The frequency and severity of all treatment-related adverse events, during and after implantation of the EndoArt cent and throughout the 6 month follow-up period.

 Adverse events will be assessed on a continuous basis from the procedure through the study completion at 6 months.

 Related adverse events include: corneal perforation, melting, uncontrolled inflammation, severe infection.

 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Corneal thickness, Subjective corneal clarity, Pain as assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Measurement Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (BCDVA) Study Treatment: Subjects will be implanted with the EndoArt cent.
