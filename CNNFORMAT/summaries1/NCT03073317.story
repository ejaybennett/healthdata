(thirdQuint)PREPARE, Prematurity Reduction by Pre-eclampsia Care.

 This proposal (PREPARE), led by Brazilian investigators in collaboration with the Global Pregnancy Collaboration (CoLab) is centred on 7 hospital centres and their 23 satellite community health centres (UBSs).

 There are two clinical initiatives: First, a programme of systematic knowledge transfer (KT) to encourage adoption of the WHO Guidelines to prevent pre-eclampsia as part of routine antenatal care (Objective 1); second an intervention to reduce unnecessary preterm deliveries for the management of pre-eclampsia.

 CoLab investigators have developed methods to identify those women with preterm pre-eclampsia whose pregnancies can be safely prolonged.

4-6 In Objective 2.

1, these methods will be applied to women presenting with definite or suspected pre-eclampsia at 16 weeks, 28-32 weeks) at each UBS, relevant data and plasma, serum, urine and DNA samples will be stored to the appropriate standards in the biorepository (at least 7000 cases).

 Investigators estimate that will acquire samples at delivery in at least 5000 of these women.

 For four years, biological samples from women with pre-eclampsia or other adverse outcomes and 2 matched controls will be collected at admission for labour (an additional 3,000 subjects).

 Objective 4 will initiate pilot studies to identify novel biomarkers, and compare these and other known pathophysiological factors with those from LMIC (Africa, India) and HIC using samples from CoLab.

 Additional funding will be sought for expansion and validation (e.

g.

 Merck for Mothers).

 Investigators will also seek funding to address risk stratification in apparently low risk women, based on the samples collected at 28-32 weeks.

 Objective 5 will promote intellectual interactions and collaboration between the seven centres and CoLab.

 Ability to understand and cure complex adverse pregnancy outcomes leading to acute and long-range disability in children requires intensive collaboration across usual "silos" including hospitals and nations.

 The coordinators anticipate the interaction of investigators and care providers in the seven centres will foster intellectual collaboration and improved standardized care.

 Brazilian investigators will become members of CoLab, increasing its unique vision, expertise and resources (current data and biological materials from 28 centres).

 PREPARE, Prematurity Reduction by Pre-eclampsia Care@highlight

Investigators will test a novel system of integrated care, to promote the use of the WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION Guidelines for the management of pre-eclampsia and initiate the use of a structured risk assessment strategy to reduce the incidence of preterm delivery from pre-eclampsia by providing obstetricians with the confidence to safely defer delivery of women with pre-eclampsia, identified to be of low risk.
