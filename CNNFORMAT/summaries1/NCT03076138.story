(thirdQuint)Gene-activated Bone Substitute for Maxillofacial Bone Regeneration.

 All participants of the study will receive standard treatment according to the medical care standards for diseases and pathological conditions characterized by maxillofacial bone defects and/or alveolar ridge atrophy.

 Bone grafting procedures as part of the surgical treatment will be performed with the use of investigated medical device.

 The safety and efficacy of the implanted gene-activated bone substitute will be evaluated by clinical examination, comprehensive laboratory tests, and computer tomography within 6 months after surgery.
