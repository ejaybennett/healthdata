(thirdQuint)The Role of Food Sensitivity in Psoriasis.

 Purpose: To determine the role of food sensitivity in psoriasis and assess the clinical response of an individualized elimination diet on psoriasis.

 Design: Up to 50 volunteers with psoriasis and 20 age- and sex-matched controls will be recruited for a 12-week prospective correlational study.

 Methods: Venous blood samples for the detection of antibodies against food antigens will be collected and individualized elimination diets will be designed based on the most reactive food antigens.

 Assessments: Clinical assessments of objective and subjective parameters will be measured using Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Static Physicians Global Assessment (sPGA), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and Itch Numeric Rating Scale (Itch NRS).

 Objectives: The primary objectives are to determine whether psoriasis patients are more likely to have food sensitivities and assess the clinical response of a 12-week elimination diet on psoriasis.

 The Role of Food Sensitivity in Psoriasis@highlight

Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder that affects over 4 million people.

 There is no cure for psoriasis and treatment is directed at controlling patients' symptoms.

 The purpose of this study is to determine whether psoriasis patients are more likely to have food sensitivities than those patients without psoriasis.

 We will also determine if eliminating certain foods from the diet results in a change in psoriasis symptoms.
