(secondQuint)NHFOV vs.

 NCPAP as a Primary Treatment to Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome(NRDS).

 Background: Invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with development of adverse pulmonary and non-pulmonary outcomes in very low birth weight infants.

 Various modes of non-invasive respiratory support are being increasingly used to minimize the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

 The aim of this trialis to compare the effect of noninvasive high-frequency oscillatoryventilation (NHFOV) and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) as a primary noninvasive ventilation support mode.

 Methods/Design:In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, 300 preterm infants at gestational age (GA) less than 34 weeks with a diagnosis of RDS will be randomized to NHFOV or NCPAP as a primary mode of non-invasive respiratory support.

 Study will be conducted in 18 tertiary neonatal intensive care units in China.

 The primary outcome isthe need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)during the first 7 days after enrollment in preterm infants randomized to the two groups.

 The secondary outcomes include days of hospitalization, days on noninvasive respiratory support, days on IMV, days on supplemental oxygen, mortality, need for surfactant, incidence of retinopathy of prematurity(ROP) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD), occurrence of abdominal distention, air leaks, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH grade 3) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC> II stage).

 Other secondary outcomes include scores of Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 2 months and 2 years of corrected age.

The investigators compared advantages and disadvantages of two forms of noninvasive respiratory support -noninvasive high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (nHFOV) or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) -as a primary mode of ventilation in premature infants with RDS.
