Hanshaugen, NAV Vaernes International collaborators: Professor Jukka Vuori, Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Finland Professor Richard Price, University of Michigan, US Senior researcher Gayle Hamilton, MDRC New York, US Professor Bruce Thyer, Florida State University, US The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration has developed a comprehensive model in order to improve the follow-up of low income families, and thereby decrease poverty and its consequences.

 By close follow up and better coordination of existing services the model aims to improve the financial and housing situation of the family, labour market attachment among the parents and the social inclusion of children.

 Oslo and Akershus University College has been commissioned to evaluate the effects of the model between 2016 to 2019, with long-term follow-ups until 2021.

 The evaluation is conducted as a cluster-randomized controlled trial, where 29 labor and welfare offices have been randomly assigned to the experimental and control group.

 All 29 offices receive funding two family coordinators each in order to work with low-income families.

 While the experimental group offices implement the HOLF-model for the follow-up of low income families, the control group offices implement locally developed models.

 Prior to randomization, a baseline questionnaire was collected from office leaders and family-coordinators, while baseline information on families is collected based on administrative data prior to randomization and questionnaire data after randomization, but prior taking part in family projects.

 Shorter-term effects will be measured + 12 months after baseline for families, and long-term effects will be measured based on administrative data fup to four years after baseline.

 Researchers at Oslo and Akershus University College analyses the implementation processes and effects of the implementation through questionnaires, administrative data, observational data, qualitative interviews with leaders, family coordinators and families.

 The project will contribute to increased knowledge about measures to improve the follow up of low income families.

 It will generate knowledge of whether the HOLF-model is more effective than locally developed follow-up models, knowledge important for the discussion of evidence-informed vs practice-based interventions.

 The project is financed by Labor and Welfare Administration and led by Ira Malmberg-Heimonen, Faculty of Social Sciences.

 Participants in the project are: Ira Malmberg-Heimonen (project leader), Anne Grete Toge, Krisztina Gyure, Knut Fossestol, Marianne Rugkasa, Berit Bergheim and Tone Liodden.

 Comprehensive Follow-up of Low Income Families.

 A Cluster-randomized Study@highlight

In a cluster-randomized design, the study evaluates the effectiveness of a skill- training program for social work professionals with the aim of improving the follow-up of low income families within Norwegian labor and welfare services.

 While the Norwegian Labor and Welfare Administration are responsible for developing and implementing the program, researchers at Oslo and Akershus University College are conducting an independent evaluation of its effectiveness.

 By close follow up and better coordination of existing services the model aims to improve the financial and housing situation of the family, labor market attachment among the parents and the social inclusion of children.

 The cluster-randomized field experiment will take place over a 40-month period, involving 29 labor and welfare offices, 58 family coordinators and, based on estimations, 650 families.

 The research is funded by the Norwegian Labor and Welfare Administration.

 The project is financed by Labour and Welfare Administration and led by Ira Malmberg-Heimonen, Faculty of Social Sciences.

 Participants in the project are: Ira Malmberg-Heimonen (project leader), Anne Grete Toge, Krisztina Gyure, Knut Fossestol, Marianne Rugkasa, Berit Bergheim and Tone Liodden.
