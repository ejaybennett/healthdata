(fifthQuint)The Affect of Hemostasis Technique During Laparoscopic Ovarian Cystectomy on Future Fertility.

 Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy will be recruited after signing an informed consent, and randomly divided into 2 groups according to intervention technique-half will be allocated to the bipolar coagulation group and half to the SURGIFLO group.

 Patients will be assessed both pre-operatively and 6 months post-operatively by blood tests including FSH, LH, E2, Progesterone and AMH levels, and sonographic evaluation of ovarian volume and antral follicle count.

 Antral follicle count will be performed on the cyst post-surgery using light microscopy.

 The difference in hormone levels, especially AMH reflects the damage done during surgery to the ovarian reserve.

 Sonographic signs including a decrease in ovarian volume and antral follicle count also reflect the damage done during surgery to the ovarian reserve.

 Patients will be assessed both pre-operatively and 6 months post-operatively by blood tests including follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), lutenizing hormone (LH), Estrogen (E2), Progesterone and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels, and sonographic evaluation of ovarian volume and antral follicle count.
