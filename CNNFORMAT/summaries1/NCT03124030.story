(thirdQuint)Intra- and Post- Operative Bleeding After Simple Dental Extraction in Direct Oral Anticoagulant Therapy.

 Many protocols of drug suspension for surgical procedure has been designed, since the introduction of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications.

 Nowadays it is not certain if suspension could give more costs than benefits for the surgical procedure itself.

 With the recent development of the Direct Oral Anticoagulant it is still unclear whether these medications might bring more bleeding events in the intra-operative and post-operative phase after oral surgery procedure, equal to, or more than Oral Anticoagulant Therapy.

 The purpose of this study is to assess the degree of intra- and post-operative bleeding complication between direct oral anticoagulant therapy patients and Oral Anticoagulant Therapy patients.
