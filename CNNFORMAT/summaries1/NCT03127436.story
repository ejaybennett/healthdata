(firstQuint)Non-interventional Study to Assess the Tolerability and the Safety Profile of SCIT Therapy With Acarovac Hausstaubmilbe.

 This prospective open multi-centre non-interventional study was initiated to document the tolerability and the safety profile of the subcutaneous allergen-specific immunotherapy with Acarovac(R) in house dust mite allergic patients in routine medical care.

 During the up-dosing phase with Acarovac(R), patients will receive 4 injections in 1-2 week intervals with increasing allergen amount up to the individual maximum tolerable dose.

 After reaching the individual maximum tolerable dose patients will receive one maintenance dose in a 4 - 8 week interval.

 Data on tolerability are documented by the physicians.
