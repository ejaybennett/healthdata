(firstQuint)Validation of the STarT Back Screening Tool in the Military.

 Subjects with low back pain presenting to primary care will be enrolled in a study that aims to evaluate the utility of the SBST for providing risk-stratified care.

 The concept of this approach revolves around matching treatment to patients based on their risk for developing chronic disability from back pain.

 Those at low risk receive less treatment, and those at high risk need more specialized treatment, that includes psychosocially-focused and cognitive considerations.

 This approach will be compared to usual care, where general practitioners carry out the course of action they think best for each patient, without any other guidance.

 Patients will be followed for 1 year.
