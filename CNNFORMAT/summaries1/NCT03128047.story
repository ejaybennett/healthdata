(secondQuint)HUMC 1612: Optune NovoTTF-200A System.

 This phase I trial will utilize a standard 3+3 design to determine the safety and tolerability of the Optune NovoTTF-200A System in pediatric high-grade glioma patients.

 The initial cohort of patients will receive treatment with the Optune NovoTTF-200A System alone and will consist of children with recurrent high-grade gliomas.

 Newly-diagnosed patients will be excluded from this initial cohort as withholding more proven initial therapies may be considered unethical.

 Patients enrolled to the Optune NovoTTF-200A System monotherapy cohort will receive treatment with 200kHz for a minimum of 18 hours per day in 28 day cycles.

 Phase I safety evaluation will take place over the initial two cycles (56 days) of treatment.

 Following the completion of the safety evaluation period, patients will continue to receive treatment in 28 day cycles, which may be repeated continuously without therapy interruption until any criterion for discontinuation is met.

 If the Optune NovoTTF-200A System is found to be well-tolerated in pediatric patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas, then the study will proceed to determine the safety and tolerability of the device when used in combination with chemotherapy agents, temozolomide and bevacizumab.

This second cohort of patients will include children with both newly diagnosed and recurrent high-grade gliomas.

 Children with recurrent tumors will only be eligible if they have not previously received therapy with temozolomide and/or bevacizumab.

 (The lone exception to this rule is temozolomide and/or bevacizumab administered solely during radiation therapy.

) Patients enrolled to the Optune NovoTTF-200A System plus temozolomide and bevacizumab cohort will receive TTField treatment with 200kHz for a minimum of 18 hours per day in 28 day cycles.

 Patients will also receive temozolomide 200mg/m2/dose orally on Days 1-5, as well as bevacizumab 10mg/kg/dose intravenously on Days 1 and 15 of each 28 day cycle.

 Phase I safety evaluation will take place over the initial two cycles (56 days) of treatment.

 Following the completion of the safety evaluation period, patients will continue to receive treatment in 28 day cycles, which may be repeated continuously without therapy interruption until any criterion for discontinuation is met.

 Once a patient is assigned to a treatment cohort, it is planned that they will continue to receive treatment in cycles of 28 days (4 weeks), which may be repeated continuously without therapy interruption until any criterion for discontinuation (clinical or radiological progression of disease, clinically unacceptable toxicity, completion of treatment, etc.

) is met.

 HUMC 1612: Optune NovoTTF-200A System@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if the Optune NovoTTF-200A device can be safely used in pediatric patients with high-grade glioma, both alone and in combination with standard chemotherapy medications.
