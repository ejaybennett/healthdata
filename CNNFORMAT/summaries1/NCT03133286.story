(firstQuint)Radiotherapy Assessments During Intervention ANd Treatment (RADIANT).

 In order to further refine and independently validate the performance of DxTerity's test developed during the previous pilot study, the study will collect pre-, during, and post-irradiation blood samples and associated clinical and self-reported information from up to five hundred (500) subjects for analysis.

 Patients with a diagnosis of primary gastrointestinal (GI), genitourinary (GU), or gynecological (GYN) cancer requiring radiation treatment to the primary disease site will be included in the study.

 Combining chemotherapy is allowed.

 Blood samples for this study will be collected from cancer patients scheduled to undergo radiation therapy prior to, during, and after treatment.

 Approximately 1501/2L of blood per time point will be obtained via fingerstick remotely, from the participant's home; participation in this study will not affect any aspect of patient treatment.

 Samples will be collected using DxTerity's proprietary DxCollect(R) MCD Fingerstick Kit (MCD).
