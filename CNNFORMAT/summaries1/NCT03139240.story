 Opioid Analgesia for MAB@highlight

Our primary objective will be to determine if a strong opioid, oxycodone, given at a dose recommended for severe pain in addition to ibuprofen decreases maximum pain scores compared to ibuprofen and placebo in women undergoing medical abortion (MAB).

 Results of this study will help future providers understand whether prescribing opioids are an important adjunct for pain control in women undergoing MAB.
