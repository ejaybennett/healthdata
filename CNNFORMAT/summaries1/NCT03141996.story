(secondQuint)Use of Vibration to Improve Visual/Spatial Neglect in Patients Affected by Stroke.

 Spatial neglect is a common syndrome following stroke, most frequently of the right side of the brain.

 Such patients fail to be aware of objects or people to their left.

 This study is being done to learn if vibration treatment can improve visual/spatial neglect and activities of daily living in stroke patients better than current standard intervention.

This treatment will be performed by occupational therapist practitioners prior to regular occupational therapy session using a vibration tool.
