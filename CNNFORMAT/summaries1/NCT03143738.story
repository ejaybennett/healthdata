(thirdQuint)Comparison of Regional Anesthesia Techniques After Total Knee Arthroplasty.

 Written consent will be obtained a day before the surgery.

 Only subarachnoidally anaesthetised patients may participate in the study.

 Pencil-point spinal needle and bupivacaine (Marcaine Heavy Spinal 0.

5 %) will be used.

 Before the beginning of operation, under ultrasound control, a catheter will be implemented to one of the chosen position: the adductor canal (the middle or lower third of thigh) or near the femoral nerve (below the inguinal ligament).

 The local anesthetic solution of 0.

2 % ropivacaine will be started with an elastomeric pump (5 mL per hour, up to 72 hours) as soon as a catheter in the right position.

 The pain will be measured with VAS (visual-analogue scale) 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the end of operation.

 At the same time, i.

e.

: 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours from the end of surgery, the range of flexion and extension in the operated knee will be assessed.

 Moreover, the possibility of patient's sitting, standing up and walking will be noted.

 All parameters will be reassessed before patients' discharge from the hospital.

 Each patient will receive paracetamol (1.

0) and metamizol (1.

0) intravenously (i.

v.

) q6h.

 5 mg of morphine may be given as required, up to 2 dosages per day as a rescue medication.

 Comparison of Regional Anesthesia Techniques After Total Knee Arthroplasty@highlight

Comparison of continuous adductor canal block to continuous femoral nerve block in patients after total knee arthroplasty.

 All patients will be anesthetized with spinal anesthesia.

 Continuous infusion of ropivacaine with a catheter implemented to the adductor canal or next to the femoral nerve.

 The observed goals: pain intensity, the beginning and quality of rehabilitation.
