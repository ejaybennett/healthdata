(thirdQuint)EPIC: An Intervention for Early-stage AD Dyads.

 The purpose of this study is to help early-stage individuals who have early-stage memory loss or early stage dementia and their current or future care partners by providing education and skill-training programs designed to reduce stress and distress, increase well-being and quality of life, and plan for the future.

 About 160 early-stage dyads (person with early-stage dementia and his/her care partner) will be enrolled across Arizona and Nevada through Arizona State University.

 People who decide to voluntarily participate in this program, will be asked to: - Meet others with memory loss and their care partners.

 - Attend six group sessions (2 hours & 30 minutes each) to learn strategies to help handle new situations, reduce stress, improve mood, communicate better with each other, and plan for the future.

 - Participate in one 90-minute individualized session to address specific issues that may be unique to each dyad's situation.

 - Participate in five 2-hour confidential interviews that involve questions about background, mood, and quality of life.

 - Participate in interviews at the start, and again about 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, to help us to continue to improve the program.

 - Attend several monthly booster sessions after completion of the seven EPIC sessions.

 Each person will receive up to $95 for completing all follow-up interviews, or $20- 25 for each interview completed.

 All participants are offered the EPIC sessions shortly after their first interview or shortly after their 3-month interview.

 Some participants will also attend an additional free education workshop within one month of the initial assessment.

EPIC II (Early-Stage Partners in Care) is a research project designed to assist people with early-stage memory loss and their care partners by providing early-stage related education and skill-training sessions designed to reduce stress, enhance well-being, manage challenges, and plan for the future.

 Researchers will gather feedback from individuals about their experience to continue to improve programs for early-stage memory loss.
