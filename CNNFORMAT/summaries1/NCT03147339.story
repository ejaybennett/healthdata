(fifthQuint)The Effects of Restricted Dietary of AGEs on the Glycemic Control, Oxidative Stress and Inflammation.

 Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of cardiovascular risk factor abnormalities associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality.

 Non-enzymatic glycation plays an important role in the development of physiological and pathophysiological processes such as aging, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and chronic renal failure.

 Preventing glycation can minimize diabetic complications.

 Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed endogenously when the carbonyl groups of reducing sugars nonenzymatically react with the free amino groups on proteins.

 AGEs are generated in vivo as a normal consequence of metabolism, but their formation is accelerated under conditions of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and increased oxidative stress.

 It can also form in food processing and the variety and the amount of dietary AGEs (dAGE) depend on food nutrients, the heating used in food processing, pH conditions, presence of some metal ions (Cu++, Fe++) and water content.

 In this study 2 groups of metabolic syndrome patients(22 in each group) will receive same low calorie diet and one of the groups plus restricted dietary AGEs according to the international references.

Along 8 weeks the investigators will talk to each patient by phone and every months the participants will come and the investigators will take anthropocentric measurements and the recommendations for diets will review.

 The three-day 24-hour recall food questionnaire will take at first,middle and the end of program.

 The Effects of Restricted Dietary of AGEs on the Glycemic Control, Oxidative Stress and Inflammation@highlight

To evaluate the effects of dietary restriction of advanced glycated end products (AGEs) on glycemic control, oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, in a randomized, 44 subjects with metabolic syndrome for 8 weeks.

Both groups will be advised to follow same low energy diet and no changing in physical activity pattern.

Parameters related to metabolic syndrome, anthropocentric factors, oxidative stress(Malondialdehyde), CML(AGEs factor in blood) and systemic inflammation factors (hs-CRP TNF- ) will be measured at the baseline and at the end of the study.
