(secondQuint)Pretreatment With Sumatriptan on Cilostazol Induced Headache in Healthy Volunteers.

 There remains a great need for more effective anti-migraine drugs with fewer side effects.

 Human experimental models are valuable in early phase development of new anti-migraine drugs but useful models have not yet been developed.

 The investigators' group has shown that Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor induce headache/migraine in both healthy volunteers and in patients with migraine without aura (MO).

 To validate cilostazol as a model, the headache must respond to specific migraine treatment with sumatriptan.

 Hypothesis: Cilostazol induces a migraine-like headache in healthy subjects.

 The induced headache can be pre-treated with a specific anti-migraine drug; sumatriptan.

 Aim: Developing a pragmatic and valid model for the testing of new anti-migraine drugs.

 Pretreatment With Sumatriptan on Cilostazol Induced Headache in Healthy Volunteers@highlight

To develop a pragmatic migraine model the investigators will induce headache in healthy volunteers with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (cilostazol).

 The participants will be pre-treated with sumatriptan.

 If the headache responds to sumatriptan, the model can be used to test new drug candidates.
