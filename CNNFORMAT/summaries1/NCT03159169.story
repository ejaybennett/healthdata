(secondQuint)Treatment of Neck and Upper Limb Pain Using BurstDR (De Ridder) Stimulation.

 Subjects diagnosed with chronic intractable neck pain with or without radiation down to arm/shoulder/upper back will be considered for inclusion in this study.

 After baseline evaluation, subjects will undergo a SCS trial using the Abbott Invisible Trial system.

 At the end of the SCS trial, subjects experiencing at least 50% pain relief, according to average neck VAS (calculated by the average of last 3 days on the pain diary), will be considered for permanent implant and further participation in the study.

 Pain intensity, quality of life, disability, headache severity, sleep quality, patient satisfaction, anxiety, depression, stimulation sensation and medication usage assessments will be performed at baseline, after SCS trial and at the 3, 6 and 12 month follow up visits.
