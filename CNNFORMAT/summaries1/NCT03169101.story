(fifthQuint)Cognition and Smoking Relapse (HCS).

 Medical advances in the treatment of HIV/AIDS have improved the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals.

 Unfortunately, HIV-infected individuals are three times more likely to use tobacco than those in the general population, but little is known about the mechanisms that underlie these high smoking rates.

 This will be the first study to test whether the neurocognitive impairments associated with HIV-1 infection may be exacerbated during nicotine withdrawal and increase the probability of smoking relapse among HIV-infected smokers (HIV+), compared to HIV-uninfected smokers (HIV-).

 To this end, adult treatment-seeking smokers (N=300; 150 HIV+ and 150 HIV-) will complete this 12-week study, which is divided into two phases: a pre-quit laboratory phase (weeks 0-2) and a treatment phase (weeks 3-12).

 Subjects will complete two laboratory sessions during the pre-quit phase: once following 24 hours of mandatory smoking abstinence and once while smoking-as-usual (order counterbalanced).

 A comprehensive cognitive task battery assessing memory, attention, and executive function will be administered during each laboratory session.

 During the treatment phase, all subjects will receive standard smoking cessation treatment, including counseling (weeks 3-8) and open-label transdermal nicotine (TN) patches (weeks 4-12).

 The primary outcomes are: 1) cognitive performance following 24-hours smoking abstinence (vs.

 smoking-as-usual) during the pre-quit phase; and 2) 7-day point-prevalence, biochemically-confirmed abstinence rates at the end-of-treatment (EOT) for the treatment phase.

 Cognition and Smoking Relapse (HCS)@highlight

This study tests whether withdrawal-related cognitive deficits increase smoking relapse among HIV-infected (HIV+) vs.

 HIV-uninfected smokers (HIV-).

 Adult smokers (N=300; 150 HIV+, 150 HIV-) will complete 2 sessions to assess cognition (24h abstinence vs.

 smoking-as-usual; order counterbalanced; weeks 0-2).

 Subjects will then receive smoking cessation counseling and open label transdermal nicotine (weeks 3-12).

 Outcomes are: 1) cognition; and 2) abstinence rates at the end-of-treatment.
