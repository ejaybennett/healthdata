(thirdQuint)Salpingectomy at the Time of Elective Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (SaLCHE).

 Many serous ovarian cancers are now thought to originate in the fimbria of the fallopian tubes.

 This has led a number of professional societies worldwide to recommend consideration of prophylactic salpingectomy at the time of elective gynecologic surgery or tubal sterilization.

 This study explores the acceptability and feasibility of incidental (opportunistic, risk-reducing, prophylactic) salpingectomy at the time of a common nongynecologic procedure in women, i.

e.

 elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCHE).

 The study addresses whether women 45 years would accept opportunistic salpingectomy and the technical feasibility (time, port placement, complications) in women who consented to salpingectomy.

Prophylactic salpingectomy (also called opportunistic, risk-reducing or incidental salpingectomy) has been advocated at the time of gynecologic surgery to reduce the risk of serous ovarian cancer.

 This study explores the acceptability and feasibility of opportunistic salpingectomy at the time of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCHE).
