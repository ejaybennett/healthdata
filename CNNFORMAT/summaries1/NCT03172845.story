(firstQuint)Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Findings and Coronary Bifurcation Lesions.

 This is a prospective registry study in which patient with true bifurcation lesion undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention will be studied.

 Before procedure Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) will be assessed for documentation of prevalence of vulnerable plaque, its characteristics and its clinical relevance.

 Group A: presence of vulnerable plaque at the bifurcation Group B: absence of vulnerable plaque at the bifurcation Documentation of immediate post stent OCT and 12 months follow up angiography with OCT will be performed.

 Immediate post stent OCT to assess successful stent implantation and after 12 months follow up OCT to document later stent thrombosis.
