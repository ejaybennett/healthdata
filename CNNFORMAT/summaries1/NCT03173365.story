(thirdQuint)The Effect of Topical Brimonidine Tartrate on Hand-foot Syndrome (HFS) in Cancer Patients.

 Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is an adverse event frequently associated with the use of classical chemotherapeutic agents such as capecitabine or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, as well as targeted cancer drugs such as sorafenib or other tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.

 If the toxicity progresses edematous swelling, blistering and desquamation can lead to ulcerations of the palms and soles.

 Additionally, patients may be affected by nail-toxicities, such as discoloration, ridging, pitting up to complete onycholysis and pain.

 Today, cooling of hands and feet during infusion chemotherapy as well as preventive treatment with topical formulations containing urea 10% (e.

g.

 Excipial U10 Lipolotion(R)) is considered as standard of care.

 Yet, these strategies are limited by intricateness, patient inconvenience and low efficacy.

 Hence, at this point the satisfactory treatment of HFS remains an unmet medical need, as until now, no effective therapy is available to prevent or reduce HFS symptoms during the cycle of chemotherapeutic treatment.

 Recently, brimonidine 3 mg/g gel (Mirvaso(R)) has been approved as a topical treatment of facial erythema of rosacea in adult patients.

 Brimonidine is an effective agonist of 2-adrenoreceptors thereby, in analogy to skin cooling, leading to peripheral vasoconstriction.

 Against this background, the following hypothesis was developed: The topical application brimonidine 3 mg/g gel (Mirvaso(R)) may prevent or reduce the severity of HFS in cancer patients that receive respective antineoplastic agents.
