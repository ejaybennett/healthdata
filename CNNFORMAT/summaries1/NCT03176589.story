(fifthQuint)Effect of PEP on Oxygen Saturation and Carbon Dioxide After Abdominal Surgery.

 Background Patients who have undergone thoracic and abdominal surgery receive lung atelectases after surgery.

 This in turn leads to poorer oxygenation, longer healing time and can contribute to increased risk of complications.

 In order to counteract atelectasis, patients are instructed by a physiotherapist to take deep inspiratory breaths and expire in a PEP-device (positive expiratory pressure) or incentive spirometry.

 The method is used routinely at our hospital and the patient breathes against 10-15 cm water resistance.

 This is repeated 10x3 ie 10 deep breaths and exhalation towards PEP then rest, breath, rest and another 10 breaths.

 This procedure should be done once an hour after surgery.

 The idea is that this will widen alveoli and fill atelectases with air, thus increasing the oxygen uptake, lowering the carbon dioxide level, and reducing the risk of postoperative complications.

 In a systematic Cochrane review and in an overview of JAMA surgery, it was found that there is no evidence that postoperative PEP use or incentive spirometry (same method) prevents postoperative pulmonary complications (1, 2).

 Nevertheless, the PEP method is used in Sweden and internationally.

 There are no studies that investigate the effect on continuous oxygen and carbon dioxide levels below and directly after the actual PEP use.

 If oxygenation is improved, and the carbon dioxide content decreases with PEP, the method is likely to be safe.

 If oxygenation instead drops and the carbon dioxide level rises when breathing out a resistance, the use of postoperative PEP should be questioned Aims What effect does PEP have on the oxygenation and carbon dioxide concentration? What is the effect of very deep breathing on oxygenation and carbon dioxide? Method Inclusion: 65 adult patients over 18 years of age who have undergone open or laparoscopic abdominal surgery.

 Patients receiving postoperative PEP are asked after surgery to participate in the study.

 Exclusion: Patients who cannot participate in using PEP or who do not agree to participate in the study.

 Power calculation: The outcome is unclear because no similar study has been done before.

 If tcPCO2 becomes in medium (SD) 5 (1) kPa in a group and 5.

5 (1) kPa in the second group, 63 patients are required before obtaining a significance of p <0.

05 and a power of 0.

80.

 As the outcome is uncertain, the investigators intend to include 65 patients.

 Design / Randomization: RCT study with cross-over design.

 Patients are randomized using computer programs, handled by a person outside the study, to either start with PEP breathing 10x3 or deep breathing 10x3.

 Method: Starting with lung function assessment to determine PEF (Mini Wright Clement Clarke).

 Then, application of continuous transcutaneous PCO2 / SaO2 (SenTec Digital Monitoring System, ResMed) and a respiratory belt around the chest detecting the respiratory rate.

 Data is recorded with computer equipment (Noxturnal T3, ResMed).

 The patient is randomized to initiate the measurements with either the deep breath and PEP or deep breathing alone.

 After a rest period, patients switch to the second treatment (cross-over) ie only deep breathing or deep breathing and PEP.

 Deep breathing is then defined as 10x3 deep breaths.

 PEP breathing is performed 10 x 3 resistance breaths.

 At the start of the study, baseline level for SaO2 and TcPCO2 is recorded, and an arterial blood gas is recorded to calibrate the transcutaneous PCO2 measurement.

 Thereafter, the registration continues during breathing / blowing until the patient returns to its baseline values.

 New PEF examination is made after each study arm.

 At the end of the study we will also measure the effect of 10x3 very deep inspirations and no expiratory no expiratory resistance.

 Effect of PEP on Oxygen Saturation and Carbon Dioxide After Abdominal Surgery@highlight

PEP (positive expiratory pressure) is routinely given to patients after surgery in order to improve lung function.

 There is, however, no evidence of effect on lung function, postoperative pneumonia or any other outcome (Guimaraes MMF, Tyson AF).

 The investigators aim to test the immediate effects on oxygen saturation and carbon dioxide.

 65 patients will be investigated in RCT design with deep inspirations and expiration using PEP or only deep inspiration with expiration a placebo tube without resistance air.

 At the end of the study we will also measure the effect of 10x3 very deep inspirations and no expiratory no expiratory resistance.

 Primary outcome: continuous oxygen saturation from pulse oximetry and transcutaneous carbon dioxide.
