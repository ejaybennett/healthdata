(thirdQuint)Implementation of Telerehabilitation In Support of HOme-based Physical Exercise for Heart Failure.

 Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programs are well documented as an important part of treatment and care for heart failure patients.

 Training with instruction gives the participant a commitment to participate.

 The result is increased activity compared to controls.

 This trial will include participants from the about 75 % of heart failure patients who for some reason do not participate in regular outpatient rehabilitation.

 Distance to rehabilitation centers and the psychological burden of a group setting are believed to be important reasons for not participating.

 Telerehabilitation can hopefully overcome these hurdles for many patients, and thereby provide instructed training for these patients.

 The trial will also include patients with renal disease.

 Heart disease is the main cause of death in patients with renal disease, even at younger ages.

 Because of the complexity of both optimal medical treatment and fluid balance, these patients are often not included in clinical trials.

 The cardiorenal crosstalk will be explored, how in influence the heart failure phenotypes and the response to exercise.

 Implementation of Telerehabilitation In Support of HOme-based Physical Exercise for Heart Failure@highlight

ITISHOPE4HF is a randomized controlled trial of telerehabilitation in a heart failure population.

 The goal is to evaluate if a home-based telerehabilitation project can increase physical activity in heart failure patients.

 Patient will be provided telerehabiliation or advice on physical activity (standard care).
