(thirdQuint)Effectiveness of Immobilization in the Postoperative Analgesia of Surgically Treated Distal Radius Fractures.

 Volar locking plate fixation has been used as the gold standard treatment for intra-articular distal radius fractures.

 The need for postoperative immobilization after this type of fixation is controversial, with some authors advocating its use for analgesia.

 Conversely, the use of immobilization might retard the recovery of wrist range of motion and function.

 The objective of this study is to compare the level of pain and function of patients undergoing surgical fixation of distal radius fractures using or not postoperative immobilization.

 Patients will be randomly assigned to receive a plaster splint or conventional dressing immediately after the surgery.

 The main outcome is the level of pain in the first two weeks postoperatively.

 Effectiveness of Immobilization in the Postoperative Analgesia of Surgically Treated Distal Radius Fractures@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine wether postoperative immobilization is effective in controlling the pain of patients with intra-articular distal radius fractures treated with volar locking plate fixation.

 The study hypotheses is that postoperative immobilization does not enhance the analgesia of these patients.
