(thirdQuint)Open Trial of Behavioral Activation and Social Engagement (BASE) for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

 Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that some people develop following exposure to a traumatic event.

 PTSD often results in a reduction in feelings of connection to other people and changes in views about others, as well as reduced participation in valued activities.

 Many veterans with PTSD do not seek treatment offered in specialty mental health settings and may forgo treatment of any kind.

 This study is an open-trial format (no comparison condition) of U.

S.

 military veterans who will participate in a brief psychotherapy treatment for PTSD offered in a Primary Care setting.

 This is a pilot trial to see if the treatment is effective at reducing symptoms of PTSD and increasing feelings of social support, and an exploratory aim is to see if veterans engage in additional treatment after completing this treatment.
