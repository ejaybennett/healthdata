(secondQuint)RE-GENERATION: The Safety and Performance of the Relay Pro and Relay NBS Pro Stent-graft Devices in the European Union (EU).

 This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, single arm clinical study in patients presenting thoracic aortic pathologies.

 Patients with thoracic aortic pathologies who are planned to undergo thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with a stent-graft based on routine clinical assessments performed as part of the patients' standard care will be screened after obtaining the informed consent from the patients, and if eligible, enrolled and scheduled for the implantation procedure with the study device.

 Following a baseline assessment, the implantation procedure will be performed according to the Instructions for Use and local routine practice.

 A follow-up visit will be performed 30 days after the implantation procedure.

 The investigator will perform assessments of the implantation procedure and device system and document adverse events and device deficiencies.
