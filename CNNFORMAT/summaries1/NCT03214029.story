(secondQuint)COmparisoN of High-sensitivity Cardiac TRoponin I and T ASsays Trial.

 Background: Comparative studies addressing the analytical and clinical performance of hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT assays for the diagnosis of acute myocardial injury and myocardial infarction in consecutive patients presenting to a United States (US) emergency department are lacking.

 Study objective: Compare the analytical and clinical performance of hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT assays for the diagnosis of acute myocardial injury and myocardial infarction in patients presenting to the emergency department in whom serial cTnI measurements are obtained on clinical indication.

 Null Hypothesis: hs-cTnI and or hs-cTnT assays will offer comparable diagnostic performance for acute myocardial injury and acute myocardial.
