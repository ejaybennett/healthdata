(thirdQuint)DASH Cloud: Using Digital Health to Improve Adherence to the DASH Diet Among Women.

 Specifically, this study aims to 1.

 To test the feasibility of the DASH Cloud intervention compared to education control among women with prehypertension and hypertension via a 3-month randomized controlled trial.

 2.

 To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the DASH Cloud intervention relative to education control on blood pressure, weight and medication adherence at 3 months.

 This study will enroll 50 adult women aged 21-70 with pre-hypertension or hypertension in a 3-month randomized controlled trial to test the initial feasibility of DASH Cloud.

 Women will be randomized to either the DASH Cloud intervention or DASH Light and followed up 3 months post randomization.

 The investigators will recruit participants from the Durham, NC area.

 Women randomized to the DASH Cloud intervention will be asked to track their diet daily using a smartphone diet tracking app.

 Based on the foods/beverages entered, the intervention will send daily or weekly text messages with feedback about DASH adherence and information videos about how to follow DASH.

 Women randomized to DASH Light will also be asked to track their diet using the smartphone diet tracking app and will receive basic informational materials about DASH.

 DASH Cloud: Using Digital Health to Improve Adherence to the DASH Diet Among Women@highlight

This study will test whether a digital health intervention (DASH Cloud) using smartphones can improve diet quality among women at risk for cardiovascular disease.

 The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet has been proven to lower blood pressure, yet dissemination efforts remain poor.

 This study aims to use technology to improve adherence to DASH.
