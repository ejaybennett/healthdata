(thirdQuint)The PREServation of MUScle Function in Critically Ill Patients (PRESMUS).

 Muscle wasting has an enormous impact on long-term physical performance and quality of life of intensive care survivors.

 Limitation of muscle wasting might therefore improve physical performance and quality of life.

 Data on high protein nutritional intake in addition to a standardized exercise training program to prevent skeletal muscle wasting during critical illness are lacking.

 Objective: to determine whether early high protein intake, using an enteral whey protein supplement, in addition to a standardized exercise training program and standard enteral nutrition preserves: a) in vitro skeletal muscle function in critically ill patients during the first week of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and b) short- and long-term in vivo muscle function and mass, clinical outcomes and quality of life in critically ill patients.

 Secondly, to determine whether high protein intake, in addition to standardized exercise and standard enteral nutrition, increases muscle protein synthesis and attenuates activation of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome pathway in critically ill patients.

 The PREServation of MUScle Function in Critically Ill Patients (PRESMUS)@highlight

This study evaluates the effect of whey protein enriched enteral nutrition in addition to exercise training on the preservation of muscle function in critically ill patients.

 One half of patients receive whey protein enriched enteral nutrition with a protein intake of 1.

5 g/kg/day and the other half of patients receive standard enteral nutrition with a protein intake of 1 g/kg/day.
