(secondQuint)The Effect of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T Cell Therapy on the Reconstitution of HIV-specific Immune Function.

 Despite the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), the persistence of viral reservoirs remains a major barrier to curing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.

 Recently, the shock and kill strategy, by which such reservoirs are eradicated following reactivation of latent HIV-1 by latency-reversing agents (LRAs), has been extensively practiced.

 It is important to reestablish virus-specific and reliable immune surveillance to eradicate the reactivated virus-harboring cells.

the VC-CAR-T cells effectively induced the cytolysis of LRA-reactivated HIV-1-infected CD4 T lymphocytes isolated from infected individuals receiving suppressive cART.

 Our previous study demonstrated that the special features of genetically engineered CAR-T cells make them a particularly suitable candidate for therapeutic application in efforts to reach a functional HIV cure.

In this clinical trial, we intend to study the safety and effectiveness of CAR-T Cell Therapy on HIV patients whose plasma HIV has been successfully suppressed after cART, by observing the adverse events and the immunity(CD4,Th1/Th2 and VC-CAR-T) and HIV viral load of patients.
