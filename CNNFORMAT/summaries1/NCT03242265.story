(firstQuint)Measurement of Natural Killer Cell Activity in Whole Blood in Men Being Screened for Prostate Cancer With Biopsy.

 The NK Vue diagnostic test for natural killer cell activity uses the principle of stimulation of whole blood with a proprietary cytokine followed by the quantitative detection of interferon-gamma using an immunoassay.

 NK Vue is intended to be used for the monitoring of the immune status of individuals.

 Measurement of NK cell activity could be a useful tool for assessing changes in immunosurveillance in patients with conditions or diseases where NK cell activity has been shown to be affected.
