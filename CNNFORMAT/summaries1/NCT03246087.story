(secondQuint)Acupuncture for Plantar Fasciosis in the Primary Care Setting.

 Investigators are studying whether a specific acupuncture protocol, when added to the standard of care treatment, can improve pain and function in adults with plantar fasciosis.

 Investigators hypothesize that there will be a significant improvement in both pain and functional outcomes, both acutely and over time, in the experimental group compared to the control group.

 Investigators will measure foot pain immediately prior to treatment (baseline), immediately after the initial treatment and at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 months.

 The Foot Function Index Revised short form will be used during the same intervals to evaluate foot function.

 At 3 months, patients in the non-acupuncture group will cross-over into the acupuncture group if still experiencing pain.
