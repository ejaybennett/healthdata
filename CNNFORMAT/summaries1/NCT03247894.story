(secondQuint)Obstetric Anesthesia and Analgesia and Multiple Sclerosis.

 The role of anesthesia in multiple sclerosis (MS) progression remains unclear in spite of few foreign studies.

 The most frequently afflicted patients by MS are women of childbearing age and influence of anesthesia or obstetric epidural analgesia has only not been investigated in Czech Republic.

 The study aims to retrospectively compare the further course of the disease of MS in patients who labor between 2004 and 2013 in University Hospital Brno either by caesarean section or vaginally with epidural analgesia , with patients who gave birth spontaneously without anesthesia.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of the labour on the clinical course of MS and further evaluate the possible influence of the type of anesthesia/analgesia in the peripartal period on the MS progression.
