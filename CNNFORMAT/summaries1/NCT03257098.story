(secondQuint)Allogeneic ABCB5-positive Stem Cells for Treatment of CVU.

 This is an interventional, single arm, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic ABCB5-positive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on wound healing in patients with chronic venous ulcer (CVU).

 Allogeneic MSCs will be isolated ex vivo and will be expanded in vitro.

 The IMP incorporating the ABCB5-positive MSCs will then be applied on the wound surface of CVU under local anesthesia.

 Patients are followed up for efficacy for 3 months which allows to distinguish actual wound healing from transient wound coverage.

 The wound healing process will be documented by standardized photography.

 The wound size evaluation will start on the day of the first change of wound dressing.

 The quality of the wound healing process will be assessed on the basis of formation of granulation tissue, epithelialization and wound exudation.

 Pain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated with standardized and validated questionnaires.

 To assess long-term safety of allo-APZ2-CVU three follow-up visits at Months 6, 9 and 12 post IMP applications are included.

 Allogeneic ABCB5-positive Stem Cells for Treatment of CVU@highlight

The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy (by monitoring the wound size reduction of Chronic Venous Ulcers) and safety (by monitoring adverse events) of the medicinal product to be studied after one single application on the wound surface in patients with Chronic Venous Ulcers.
