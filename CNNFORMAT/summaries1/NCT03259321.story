(thirdQuint)Fish, Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Intake and Type 2 Diabetes.

 The role of fishery diet and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the development of T2D is heavily debated but evidence from large populations in China is still lacking.

 We aim to utilize data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS, 1997-2011).

 We will calculate cumulative means of fish and PUFA intake based on 3-day food records in each wave.

 Sex-specific Cox regression models will be used to estimate relative risk of T2D.

 Results from this work will provide epidemiological evidence for improving recommendations on fish and PUFA intake for Chinese in dietary guidelines.

 Fish, Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Intake and Type 2 Diabetes@highlight

The role of fishery diet and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is heavily debated but evidence from large populations in China is scant.

 We aim to use data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) to assess the long-term association between fish, PUFA intake and T2D risk.
