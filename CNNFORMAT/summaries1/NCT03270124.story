(fifthQuint)A pragmatiC sTrategy to Promote actIVity and Enhance Quality of Life AFTER Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

 The study will be conducted in three phases.

 Subjects who have been treated commercially with TAVR with a SAPIEN 3 valve and are being discharged to home will be eligible for Phase 1.

 Once consented prior to discharge, patients will complete the 5m walk, chair stand, and handgrip tests.

 During phase 1, all subjects will have an accelerometer device and answer questions on the iPad about their activities and quality of life.

 After 30 days, the subject will return to complete the 5m walk, chair stand, and handgrip tests, as well as a KCCQ.

 If the subject has consistently provided data throughout Phase 1, they will be asked to continue on to Phases 2 and 3.

 For Phase 2, subjects will be randomized to one of two arms.

 In one arm, they will have a daily activity goal and resistance exercises; in the other arm, there will not be a daily activity goal and no resistance exercises given.

 After 6 weeks, the subject will return to complete the 5m walk, chair stand, and handgrip tests, as well as a KCCQ.

 Five months after enrollment into Phase 2, subjects will be given an accelerometer to track their daily activity for 1 week (Phase 3).

 They will also complete a KCCQ and end of study questionnaire.

 A pragmatiC sTrategy to Promote actIVity and Enhance Quality of Life AFTER Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement@highlight

This study is being performed in patients who have undergone transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for aortic stenosis.

 The goal is to obtain pilot and feasibility data on a novel post-procedure rehabilitation strategy, including a daily activity goal using a waist-worn accelerometer and in-home resistance training exercises targeting muscles related to activities of daily living.

 We will evaluate the effect of these interventions on physical performance and several quality of life domains.
