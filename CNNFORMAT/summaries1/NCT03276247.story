(firstQuint)Iron Status in Women of Reproductive Age Reproductive Age.

 HEIRS included a cross-sectional screening study of 101,168 patients, 25 years of age or older, in the primary care setting.

 Participants were recruited from four centers in the U.

S .

and one in Canada from February 2001 to February 2003.

 We will evaluate results for women aged 25-44 years of age who are self-reported as Asian, Black, Hispanic or White.

 The lower detection limit for the serum ferritin (SF) assay in the HEIRS study was 15 1/2g/L and therefore the definition of iron deficiency will be SF concentration 15 1/2g/L.

 Elevated SF concentrations, possibly indicative of elevated iron stores, will be classified by two definitions: 1) SF concentration > 300 1/2g/L and 2) SF >200 1/2g/L in combination with TSAT >45%.

 Proportions will be compared by Pearson's chi-square.

 Logistic regression models will be used to identify independent associations with measures of iron deficiency and elevated iron stores.
