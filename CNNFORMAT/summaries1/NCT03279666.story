(firstQuint)Biopsy Size and Pain Perception During Colposcopic Biopsy.

 The study was designed four arms.

 The investigators will perform colposcopy because of various causes.

 The first arm is used tenaculum and performed intracervical blockage.

 The second arm is not used tenaculum and performed intracervical blockage.

 The third arm is used tenaculum and not performed intracervical blockage.

 The fourth arm is not used tenaculum and not performed intracervical blockage and then we will study patients pain and biopsy size during colposcopic biopsy.

 Pain reduce and biopsy size are very important for patient and diagnose of the cervix cancer.
