(thirdQuint)The Effect of EXPAREL on Postsurgical Pain, and the Use of Narcotics.

 Based on prior research, it is hypothesized EXPAREL(R) can potentially be used as a local anesthetic option after undergoing an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in the outpatient setting.

 Conducting this study, will allow the option for a surgeon to administer a local anesthetic, in a single injection, to the exact location of the surgical procedure and in a sterile environment.

 The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if EXPAREL(R) can be used as a safe alternative to current post-operative pain control methods, while limiting narcotic use and providing appropriate postoperative analgesia.
