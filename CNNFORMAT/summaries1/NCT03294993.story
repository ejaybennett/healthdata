(firstQuint)Doppler Ultrasonography Assessed Vascular Changes Before and After Radial Artery Puncture.

 The investigators designed a study to assess whether there were any blood flow indexes change before and after radial artery puncture with doppler ultrasonography.

The indexes include Arterial Diameter,Peak Systolic Velocity,End Diastolic Velocity,Resistive Index,Pulsatility Index,Systolic/End Diastolic Ratio,Time AverageMean Velocity and Blood Flow.
