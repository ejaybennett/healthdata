(secondQuint)All Ligaments Left In Knee Arthroplasty Trial.

 The purpose of the proposed ALLIKAT study (All Ligaments Left in Knee Arthroplasty Trial) is to evaluate the early outcome of a Total Knee Replacement device that retains both cruciate (Vanguard XP) by comparing it with a control group of patients implanted with an established single cruciate retaining device (Vanguard CR).

 The study also aims to examine short and long term descriptive cohort outcome data.

 A small preference cohort group of 60 patients receiving the Vanguard XP Knee System will be recruited alongside the RCT group.

 This data will be used to confirm the external validity of the RCT group and to contribute to the safety data for the British Orthopaedic Association's Beyond Compliance Programme.

 Evaluation will include intra-operative and post-operative complications, longer term survivorship and patient reported outcome measures.
