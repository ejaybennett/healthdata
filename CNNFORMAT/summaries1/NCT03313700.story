(firstQuint)Clinical Outcomes of Robotic Versus Laparoscopic Assisted Distal Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer.

 Robotic surgery has been developed with the aim of improving surgical quality and overcoming the limitations of conventional laparoscopy in the performance of complex mini-invasive procedures.

 The study is designed to explore the clinical outcomes of the robotic assisted distal gastrectomy by comparing short- and long-term outcomes including financial cost of robotic and laparoscopic assisted distal gastrectomy in the treatment of gastric adenocarcinoma (cT1-4a, N-/+, M0).
