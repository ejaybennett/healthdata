(secondQuint)Vielight Neuro RX Gamma - Feasibility Pilot.

 The Neuro RX Gamma system is a headset which emits near-infrared energy through diodes placed on the scalp and inside a nostril.

 A potential participant will undergo screening procedures to confirm eligibility to participate in the study, followed by randomization procedure to one of the study groups - treatment or sham (placebo).

 A dedicated caregiver will apply the device to the subject for 20 minute daily sessions at home, 6 days a week for a total of 12 weeks.

 The subject and caregiver will be required to return to the clinic for follow-up assessments after 3, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment.

 40 patients will be enrolled in 2 clinical sites in Ontario, Canada.
