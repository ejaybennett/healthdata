(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Effects of Age, Prior Exposure, and Previous Vaccination on B Cell Response to Influenza Vaccine in Healthy Adults and Children.

 The study will be designed as a prospective surveillance of the immune response to seasonal influenza vaccination in 240 healthy children and adults ages 9 and over.

 Study duration will be 5 years, with a participant duration of 6 months.

 Subjects will receive Fluarix (GSK) quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, at a dose of not less than 15 ug of hemagglutinin (HA), by intramuscular injection in open label fashion on day 0.

 Blood draws will occur at baseline, day 7, 28 and 90.

 The primary hypothesis being tested in this study is that there will be differences in the specificity and magnitude of the HA-specific B cell response depending on the age, previous vaccine history and baseline B cell reactivity.

 The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between first influenza A virus exposure (inferred by age), vaccine history, and baseline serum antibody and Memory B cell (MBC) specificity, and the magnitude and breadth of the subsequent B cell response to seasonal influenza vaccine in healthy adults and children.

 The secondary objective is to determine the durability of the antibody response and relationship between acute and durable antibody.
