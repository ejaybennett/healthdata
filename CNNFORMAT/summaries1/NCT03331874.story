(fifthQuint)RCM to Diagnose BCC - Reflectance Confocal Microscopy to Diagnose Basal Cell Carcinoma.

 Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinics of the Departments of Dermatology and Plastic Surgery at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital Foundation Trust.

 These will be patients who have been assessed in clinic by a consultant dermatologist or consultant plastic surgeon.

 They will be suspected of having a BCC on the head and neck region.

 Clinical and dermoscopic (a dermatoscope is a hand held microscope) images will be taken by the Medical Illustration at NNUHFT as part of their routine standard of care.

 Patients will be invited to participate in the trial and provided with a patient information leaflet.

 They will be given sufficient time to review the information sheet and ask questions.

 Patients will be consented to having reflectance confocal microscopy performed of the target lesion before undergoing biopsy for histology.

 These patients would be having photographs, including dermoscopic images, and a biopsy as part of their standard of care prior to their final treatment being determined - the only additional intervention is examination with the confocal microscope.

 The images taken of the tumour by the reflectance confocal microscope will be anonymised.

 These images will then be examined by a different in house dermatologist who has undergone training in examining confocal images.

 The images will also be sent to a dermatologist in Modena, Italy who is experienced in interpreting confocal microscopic images - both of these dermatologists will be blinded as to the patient's history and the results of the punch biopsy.

 The biopsies will undergo routine processing in our histopathology laboratory as normal and will be analysed by a pathologist who will be unaware of the findings on confocal microscopy.

 The patients will undergo one additional intervention over-and-above their standard investigation and treatment pathway.

 The treatment pathway for the patients will not be lengthened or shortened by their participation.

 RCM to Diagnose BCC - Reflectance Confocal Microscopy to Diagnose Basal Cell Carcinoma@highlight

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the commonest non melanoma skin cancer in the UK and its incidence is rising.

 The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital Foundation Trust (NNUHFT) see and excise approximately 3,000 new cases of BCC each year.

 Many of these patients have a biopsy to confirm their diagnosis before being listed for surgical excision.

 In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) involves using a machine which can examine the upper layers of the skin non invasively.

 In clinically suspicious lesions, the Investigators will use RCM prior to biopsy with the aim of demonstrating that RCM can accurately diagnose BCC.

 The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility and utility of using RCM for the diagnosis of BCC in the NHS setting, thereby shortening the patient pathway and effectively using limited public resources.

 If the Investigators' study shows that RCM can accurately diagnose BCC in these patients then this would prevent the need for biopsy as a routine in these patients.
