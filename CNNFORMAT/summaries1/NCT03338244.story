(secondQuint)Mortality Reduction After Oral Azithromycin Contingency: Mortality Study.

 Establish the effects of longer-term biannual mass azithromycin distribution.

 Establish the efficacy of 3-4 years of mass azithromycin on child mortality compared to 1-2 years, to address loss (or augmentation) of efficacy with increasing years of distribution.

 For example, initial efficacy may be mitigated by increasing antibiotic resistance.

 The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality in children aged 1-59 months, as determined by biannual census.

 A determination will be made whether there is an increase in mortality in communities randomized to stop versus continue mass azithromycin distributions both as compared to historical mortality in the placebo arm of MORDOR I and between randomization arms at 48 months.

 Mortality Reduction After Oral Azithromycin Contingency: Mortality Study@highlight

In the event that MORDOR (NCT02047981) established the efficacy of oral azithromycin in preventing mortality in 1-59 month children, the contingency study was to treat both arms in Niger with oral azithromycin (unmasked) for two more years in Niger only.
