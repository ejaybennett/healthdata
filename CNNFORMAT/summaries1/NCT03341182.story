(thirdQuint)The Effects of Use of Mirror Image on Radiation Exposure During Fluoroscopically Guided Transforaminal Epidural Injection.

 1.

 A planned Fluoroscopically Guided Lumbar Transforaminal Epidural Injection should be performed after receiving the informed consent of the patient.

 2.

 This study is single-blind because it is not possible to blind the practitioner performing the injection.

 3.

 Subjects were randomly assigned to the normal method group (group A) and the mirror use group (group B) by a random random number table, and the possibilities for belonging to any group were all the same and can not be artificially controlled by researchers.

 4.

 After the procedure, a resident who does not know of this study records the radiation exposure time displayed on the monitor and the overall procedure time.

 The Effects of Use of Mirror Image on Radiation Exposure During Fluoroscopically Guided Transforaminal Epidural Injection@highlight

Lumbar Transforaminal Epidural Injection is helpful for the treatment of lumbosacral radicular pain.

 Tunnel view technique is the basis of X-ray assisted intervention.

 In this technique, it is necessary to handle the block needle in order to adjust the direction of needle to the tunnel view toward target.

 If a mirror is used during needle handling, overall procedure time and radiation exposure can be reduced.
