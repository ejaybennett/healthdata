(firstQuint)Lanthanum Carbonate (Fosrenol) to Reduce Oxalate Excretion in Patients With Secondary Hyperoxaluria and Nephrolithiasis.

 Nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis is a prevalent (overall lifetime risk up to 13% in Western countries) and highly recurrent disease.

 Secondary hyperoxaluria is a key risk factor for the development of calcium oxalate stones, the most frequent stone type.

 Currently used therapeutic options in secondary hyperoxaluria have limited efficacy.

 Recent findings in vitro and in a rat model, provided evidence that Lanthanum Carbonate is an effective oxalate binder.

 The objective of this study is to investigate whether treatment with Lanthanum Carbonate reduces urinary oxalate excretion in human subjects with secondary hyperoxaluria and nephrolithiasis.

 By treating the patients with two different doses of Lanthanum Carbonate during two 14-day treatment periods, a dose-response will be evaluated.
