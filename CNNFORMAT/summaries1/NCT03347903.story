 Prevalence and Clinical Characteristics of Patients With Jackhammer Esophagus and Symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease@highlight

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is involved in the development of esophageal motility disorders like Jackhammer esophagus (JE), a novel hypercontractile condition that was associated with progression to achalasia and limited outcomes following surgical anti-reflux therapy.

 This trial was designed to assess the prevalence and characteristics of JE in patients with typical symptoms of GERD and responsiveness to PPI therapy.
