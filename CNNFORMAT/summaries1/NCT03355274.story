(fifthQuint)Systematic Transcutaneous Oxymetry Use in Thoracic Outlet Syndrome.

 Patients referred for suspected thoracic outlet syndrome causing and healthy asymptomatic subjects will be included.

 After signing the consent, the subject will have a clinical and paraclinical examination.

 Age, sex, height, weight, side of clinical symptomatology will be collected.

 Medical history current treatments will also be noted.

 The examination of transcutaneous oximetry dynamic measurement with palmar face of both forearms during two consecutive maneuvers known as the "candlestick" (hands up).

 The most symptomatic arm value in patients and the dominant arm in the control group will be noted.

 In case of DROP between 0 and -25 mmHg, in addition to the maneuvering of the "candlestick", the other maneuvers such as those of Wright, Roos, Tinel and Adson will be realized.

 For patients, the microcirculation measurement by the TIVI system will be performed on the hands during the operation of the candlestick.

 The results of any additional examinations and / or pre- and post-operative consultations will be collected.

 Systematic Transcutaneous Oxymetry Use in Thoracic Outlet Syndrome@highlight

The measurement of the transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure (TCPO2) at exercise is, to our knowledge, the only method to estimate during the exercise the importance of ischemia segment of limb by segment of limb bilaterally and carry on.

 The diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome causing remains difficult and dependent operator in ultrasound because of the risk of false positive (loss of signal) or false negative (insufficient effort, inappropriate movement).

 Our main hypothesis is the existence of significant measurable ischemia in the forearm by transcutaneous oximetry during the maneuvering of the "candlestick".

 In the event of failure of this maneuver, the other maneuvers such as those of Wright, Roos, Tinel and Adson will be realized.

 In this study we want to evaluate the possibility of using dynamic transcutaneous Oximetry as a tool for evaluating ischemia in case of suspicion of thoracic outlet syndrome causing.
