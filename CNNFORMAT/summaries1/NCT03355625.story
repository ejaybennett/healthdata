(thirdQuint)Platelet Function During Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Adult Patients.

 The knowledge of platelet function during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remains sparse.

 In the present study, the aim is to investigate platelet function in adult patients treated with ECMO using flow cytometry.

 The investigators hypothesize that platelet function increases from day 1 to day 3 in patients treated with ECMO.

 The secondary aim is to investigate the association between platelet function and the incidence of bleeding episodes and thrombosis during ECMO treatment.

 The present study is a substudy to the study entitled; "Coagulopathy During Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation" (pending Clinical Trial ID number).

 Platelet Function During Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Adult Patients@highlight

The primary aim is to describe platelet function in adult patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

 A clarification of the platelet function in these critically ill patients contributes to an understanding of the mechanisms underlying their coagulopathy.

 The present study is a substudy to the study entitled; "Coagulopathy During Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation" (pending Clinical Trial ID number).
