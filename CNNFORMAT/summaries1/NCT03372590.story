(fifthQuint)NEO Rehab for Infants at Risk of Cerebral Palsy.

 The study objective are 3-fold: 1.

 To determine the proportion of infants (<32 weeks gestation and/or <1500g) who have abnormal GMs findings using the GMA tool.

 2.

 To determine the feasibility of NICU based rehabilitation program in 20 infants determined to be at high risk for CP using the GMA tool.

 The intervention bundle will consist of a maternal-driven gestational age (GA)-appropriate intervention bundle that will include evidence-based interventions including vocal soothing, comforting touch, scent exchange, kangaroo care, and infant massage.

 Patients will be compared to contemporary and GA-matched controls receiving standard of care with a 1:2 assignment.

 3.

 To evaluate the short-term impact of a maternal-driven intervention bundle on the mother-infant dyad.

 Maternal stress will be measured using the Parental Stress Scale for NICU patients (PSS: NICU) prior to the intervention and prior to the infant's NICU discharge.

 Further, stress will be assessed by measuring maternal and infant salivary cortisol pre-and post-kangaroo care on 3 separate occasions (post enrollment in the study, mid-hospital stay, and prior to discharge).

 Measures of maternal anxiety and depression will be evaluated prior to the intervention and prior to NICU discharge using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instrument.

 The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will lead to positive and measurable outcomes for the mother-infant dyad.

 NEO Rehab for Infants at Risk of Cerebral Palsy@highlight

Premature infants are at increased risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP).

 Early interventions for at risk infants have the potential to decrease disease severity and improve quality of life.

 All infants demonstrate general movements (GMs), which are reliable indicators of brain function and can be reproducibly evaluated using the General Movement Assessment (GMA) tool.

 Prior studies have demonstrated the impact of early maternal-driven intervention strategies on neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants.

 Investigators have shown that interventions promoting the establishment of emotional connection between the infant and his or her mother, including mother/infant calming sessions with scent cloth exchange, vocal soothing, eye contact, and kangaroo care, can impact neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months.

 Investigators have also shown that 60 minutes of kangaroo care leads to decreasing levels of the stress hormone cortisol in both mothers and infants.

 This pilot study aims to determine the feasibility of a maternal-driven early intervention bundle in preterm infants with abnormal GMA.
