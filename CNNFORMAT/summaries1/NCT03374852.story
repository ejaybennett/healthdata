(fifthQuint)CPI-613 in Combination With Modified FOLFIRINOX in Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.

 Primary Objective: 1) To determine if CPI-613 increases overall survival (OS) when used in combination with mFOLFIRINOX, in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

 Secondary (Exploratory) Objectives: 1.

 To assess the safety of CPI-613 + mFOLFIRINOX combination in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

 2.

 To collect tissue specimens for future correlative studies 3.

 To estimate median progression free survival (PFS) when CPI- 613 is used in combination with mFOLFIRINOX, in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

 4.

 To estimate the percent resected when CPI-613 is used in combination with mFOLFIRINOX in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

 CPI-613 in Combination With Modified FOLFIRINOX in Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer@highlight

This study is a single arm, phase II trial, of 45 patients with locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

 The efficacy of the novel drug and mitochondrial inhibitor, CPI-613, in conjunction with standard-of-care FOLFRINOX, as a first-line therapy will be evaluated.

 Pre-treatment, diagnostic biopsy tissue will be collected when available, and clinical data will be evaluated to determine if the combination results in improved overall survival compared to historical experience.
