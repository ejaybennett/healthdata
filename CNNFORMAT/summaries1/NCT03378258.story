(thirdQuint)Petechiae In Children (PIC) Study: Defining A Clinical Decision Rule for The Management Of Fever and Non-Blanching Rashes In Children Including The Role Of Point Of Care Testing For Procalcitonin & Neisseria Meningitidis DNA.

.

 A fever an a non-blanching rash is a relatively common presentation the the emergency department.

 A minority of children with a fever and a non-blanching rash with have a life-threatening infection.

 Currently it is very difficult to determine those children that require urgent treatment from those that have a simple viral illness.

 The aim of the PIC study is to research how to better diagnose those serious infections earlier.

 The investigators plan on recruiting 300 children over 2 years.

 Children will undergo current best practice care.

 Investigators will analyse surplus blood and throat swab specimens using quick bedside tests.

 The quick bedside tests include a test for infection known as Procalcitonin and a test for the bacteria that causes meningococcal disease know as Loop-mediated-isothermal AMPlification (LAMP).

 Data from the study will be used to test the effectiveness of current practice and to identify areas where current practice could be improved.

A fever and a non-blanching rash is a relatively common reason for a child to attend an emergency department.

 A fever and a non-blanching rash can be an early sign of a life-threatening infection known as meningococcal disease.

 The aim of the PIC study is to determine how best to diagnose early meningococcal disease in children.

 In particular the investigators are interested in researching how quick bedside tests can be used to do this.
