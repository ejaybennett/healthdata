(thirdQuint)The Effect of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning in Living Donor Hepatectomy.

 Liver ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury (IRI) is a phenomenon in which cellular damage caused by hypoxia is accentuated following return of blood flow and restoration of oxygen delivery.

 This remains an important clinical problem during shock, hepatic resection, and liver transplantation.

 Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), involves brief periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion of one organ or tissue that subsequently affords protection to a remote organ or tissue suffering from a prolonged ischemic injury.

 RIPC of the limb reduces IRI to the heart, lungs, and other organs in humans and animals.

 Studies have investigated the protective effect of RIPC of the hind limb in reducing the adverse effects of liver IRI and underlying mechanism involved in increased hepatic blood flow, the role of heme oxygenase, modulation of the hepatic microcirculation, the role of High Mobility Group-Box1and, and others.

 However, impact of RIPC on living donor hepatectomy has not been elucidated.

 In this study, the investigators tried to elucidate the effects of RIPC on postoperative liver function test after living donor hepatectomy.

 The Effect of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning in Living Donor Hepatectomy@highlight

It has been demonstrated that liver ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) was associated with poor outcomes after liver resection.

 Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been shown to have protective effects on liver IRI.

 However, impact of RIPC on living donor hepatectomy has not been elucidated.

 In this study, the investigators tried to elucidate the effects of RIPC on postoperative liver function test after living donor hepatectomy.
