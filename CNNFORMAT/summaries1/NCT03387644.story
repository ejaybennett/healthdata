 Pregabalin Premedication for Conscious Sedation@highlight

Conscious sedation is usually required during flexible bronchoscopy.

 Sedation should be done without causing respiratory depression or loss of consciousness.

 The present study was designed to evaluate the advantage of pregabalin pre-medication on reducing sedatives and respiratory depression for patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy with dexmedetomidine and midazolam.
