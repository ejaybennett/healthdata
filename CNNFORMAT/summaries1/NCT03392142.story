(thirdQuint)Tabelecleucel for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Subjects With EBV+ PTLD After Failure of Rituximab.

 This is a multicenter, open label, single-arm, phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of tabelecleucel for the treatment of EBV+ PTLD in the setting of allogeneic HCT after failure of rituximab.

 Tabelecleucel will be selected for the subject from the bank of available tabelecleucel cell products based on matching 2 HLA alleles, at least one of which is a restricting HLA allele, shared between the tabelecleucel donor and the subject's EBV+ PTLD.

 Sites will provide high resolution subject and subject's graft donor HLA typing results and other information as required by the protocol.

 Tabelecleucel will be administered in cycles lasting 5 weeks (35 days).

 During each cycle, subjects will receive intravenous (IV) tabelecleucel at a dose of 2*10^6 cells/kg on Days 1, 8, and 15, followed by observation through Day 35.

 Tabelecleucel for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Subjects With EBV+ PTLD After Failure of Rituximab@highlight

This is a multicenter, open label, single-arm, phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of tabelecleucel for the treatment of Epstein-Barr Virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) after failure of rituximab.
