(firstQuint)Serum Concentration of lgG in Patient With Acute Coronary Syndrome.

 Immunoglobin G (IgG), a highly abundant glycoprotein in serum, is known to participate in blood immune responses.

It has been an increasing interest in the analysis of the abnormal glycosylation of human lgG in healthy and disease states, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer.

However, there is few relevant studies about the changes in glycopeptides of serum immunoglobulin G in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

 This study was performed for the frst timeto assess the quantitative changes of serum IgG glycosylation in patients with acute myocardial infarction and the relationships between its change and prognosis.
