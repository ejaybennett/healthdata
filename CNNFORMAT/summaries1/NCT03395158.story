(thirdQuint)Implementation of New Trauma Triage Criteria and Implications on Under- and Overtriage.

.

 The Swedish trauma registry (SweTrau) was initiated in 2011, and has up to date 40.

000 registered patients.

 In order to evaluate trauma alert criteria implemented during 2017, we plan a prospective stepped wedge trial at six hospitals in the Uppsala/Orebro region.

 These hospitals register in SweTrau and all had the same alert criteria prior to the implementation of new alert criteria.

 A power estimation show the need for 588 patients in each group in order to show a statistical difference between 2-5% undertriage at a 95% CI.

 The including hospitals has a population base of 1.

300.

000 inhabitants, and the annual number of trauma alerts has been about 3.

000.

 The registry has information about time of trauma, initiated alerts, Injury Severity Score and mechanism of injury suitable for analysis for our hypothesis.

 The Swedish trauma registry is used to identify eligible patients.
