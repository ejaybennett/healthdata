(fifthQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Triptolide Wilfordii in New Onset HIV-1 Infection.

 Acquired immune deficiency syndrome(AIDS) is a severe fatal disease caused by HIV infection.

 Despite viral suppression achieved, antiretroviral therapy(ART) cannot ameliorate HIV-induced immune activation and the consequent non-AIDS complications including cardiovascular, renal, hepatic diseases.

 Recently, immunosuppression therapy has become the focus since it can suppress exorbitant immune activation and inflammation so as to reduce the risk of non-AIDS cardiovascular and central neural system complications.

 Triptolide Wilfordii is a traditional Chinese herbal remedy and has long been used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

 Moreover, a recent study has shown that Triptolide Wilfordii combined with ART is associated with increased CD4 T cell counts and reduced immune activation in immunological non-responders, who were defined as patients with CD4 cell counts1/2l despite over 2 years of ART.

 Hence we expect Triptolide Wilfordii to bring up similar improvement in treatment naive HIV infection.

 This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Triptolide Wilfordii and hopefully provide evidence for a new treatment strategy.

 Safety and Efficacy of Triptolide Wilfordii in New Onset HIV-1 Infection@highlight

The traditional Chinese herbal medicine Triptolide Wilfordii has displayed remarkable effect on the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

 Now that immunosuppression therapy has recently become a new strategy for HIV infection, it's reasonable to expect the anti-inflammatory effect of Triptolide Wilfordii in HIV infected patients.

 So we designed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to explore the efficacy and safety of Triptolide Wilfordii in new-onset HIV infection.
