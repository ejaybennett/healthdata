(secondQuint)Dupilumab Phase 4 Study.

 The investigators will conduct a prospective, longitudinal, non-interventional and observational sub-study of patients receiving dupilumab as normal standard-of-care treatment to assess the efficacy (Specific Aim #1) and safety (Specific Aim #2) of dupilumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD, as well as the prevention and/or mitigation of comorbid health conditions (Specific Aim #3).

 This study will address the hypotheses that dupilumab will lead to improved long-term control and decreased severity of AD, and that long-term monitoring will shed light on the incidence of adverse drug events.
