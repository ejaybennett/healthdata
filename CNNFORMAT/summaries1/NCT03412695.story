(fifthQuint)Development of a Decision Support System to Prevent and Treat Disease-related Malnutrition.

 The prevalence of disease-related malnutrition among hospitalized patients is 30-50%.

 Disease-related malnutrition increase the morbidity and mortality among patients and leads to longer length of stay.

 There is a lack of tools to follow up the nutritional treatment of patients at nutritional risk.

 The decision support system "MyFood" are developed in the project with the purpose to prevent and treat disease-related malnutrition.

 MyFood includes 4 modules: 1) A function to register patient needs and symptoms, 2) Dietary assessment function, 3) Automatic evaluation of dietary intake compared to individual needs, 4) Feedback, including a report on intake of energy, protein, and liquids compared to individual needs, and recommendations for nutritional measures and an individual nutrition plan.

 Clinical effects of using MyFood among hospitalized patients will be studied in a randomized controlled trial.

 In addition, the implementation of the tool among nurses and other healthcare workers will be explored.

 Development of a Decision Support System to Prevent and Treat Disease-related Malnutrition@highlight

The prevalence of disease-related malnutrition among hospitalized patients is 30-50%.

 There is a lack of tools to follow up the nutritional treatment of these patients.

 The investigators develop the decision support system "MyFood" which can be used to assess patients' dietary intake, evaluate intake against individual needs, and propose nutrition related measures and an individual nutrition plan for each patient.

 The investigators will study the clinical effects of using MyFood among hospitalized patients.

 In addition the implementation of the tool among healthcare workers will be studied.
