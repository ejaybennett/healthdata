(thirdQuint)Accelerated iTBS for Post Partum Depression.

 This is an open-label study designed to investigate the feasibility and tolerability of a novel TMS treatment protocol to treat depression in women with post-partum depression.

 It is known that TMS can effectively treat depression.

 The FDA approved protocol lasts 6 weeks and is not feasible for many women with post-partum depression.

 The investigators are investigating a 3 day treatment for depression which may be more acceptable for this population.

 The investigators further hope to characterize the ant-depressant effect of this protocol in order to design a larger trial.

The investigators are studying the feasibility and tolerability of 6x/day intermittent theta burst (excitatory) transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex over the course of 3 days for women with post-partum depression.

 The investigators further hope to characterize the anticipated anti-depressant effect of this treatment paradigm.
