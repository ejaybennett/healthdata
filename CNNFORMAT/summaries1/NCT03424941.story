(fifthQuint)The TransCatheter Valve and Vessels Trial.

 Prospective, randomized, controlled, open label, multicenter, international, non-inferiority trial If the Heart Team decides that a coronary revascularization and aortic valve replacement is needed and the patient complies with inclusion and exclusion criteria then the patient will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion between FFR-guided PCI + TAVI and CABG + SAVR.

 Patients will receive optimal medical treatment at discharge.

 Follow-up will be performed at 30 days and at one year.

 During the 30 day follow-up visit (after TAVI) patients will be evaluated for symptoms of angina.

 The TransCatheter Valve and Vessels Trial@highlight

The trial objective is to investigate whether Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR)-Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) and TransCatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) strategy for treatment of multivessel disease and aortic stenosis will be non-inferior to Coronary Artery By-pass Grafting (CABG) and Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR) for a composite primary endpoint of all-cause mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary or valve re-intervention and life-threatening or disabling bleeding at one year.
