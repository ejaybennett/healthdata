(thirdQuint)Capecitabine Versus Bolus 5-Fu Associated to Radiotherapy as Neoadjuvant Treatment for Rectal Cancer.

.

 Patients harbouring rectal adenocarcinoma T3-4 or N>0 M0 within 10 cm to anal verge were randomized in two treatment arms: (1) capecitabina orally 825mg/m2 bid.

 5 days a week for 5 weeks and (2) bolus intravenous 5-FU/LV 350mg/m2/20 mg/m2 D1-D5 on the first and fifth weeks, both combined to pelvic radiotherapy, total dose 50.

4 Gy in 28 fractions.

 Clinical stage before and after CRT was determined using pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), endorectal ultrasonography (ERUS) and chest, abdominal and pelvic Computer Tomography.

 Surgery was planned 6 to 8 weeks after CRT.

 Sphincter preservation was always considered when negative margins were possible.

 Pathological assessment included stage (TNM 7th Ed.

) and Mandard's Tumor Regression Grade (TRG).

 QOL questionnaires QLQ-C30 and CR38 were completed by patients before and after CRT, after surgery and during follow-up.

 Capecitabine Versus Bolus 5-Fu Associated to Radiotherapy as Neoadjuvant Treatment for Rectal Cancer.

@highlight

A randomized two-arm study comparing preoperative CRT using oral capecitabine versus bolus 5-FU/LV concomitant to external beam radiation (50.

5 Gy/28 fractions) for locally advanced rectal cancer.

 Main outcome was clinical response assessed using MRI and endorectal US 6-8 weeks after CRT.

 Secondary endpoints were pathological response, adverse effects, sphyncter preservation, quality of life, OS and DFS.
