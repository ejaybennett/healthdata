(firstQuint)SARC031: MEK Inhibitor Selumetinib (AZD6244) in Combination With the Dual mTOR Kinase Inhibitor Vistusertib (AZD2014) for Patients With Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors.

 I.

 Primary Objective cent To determine the clinical benefit rate of selumetinib in combination with vistusertib in patients with unresectable or metastatic NF1 associated or sporadic MPNST II.

 Secondary Objective(s) - To define and describe the toxicities of selumetinib in combination with vistusertib in patients with unresectable or metastatic NF1 associated or sporadic MPNST.

 - To assess the impact on intensity and pain interference and correlate to changes in clinical, imaging response and progression - To assess progression free and overall survival Selumetinib will be given orally 75mg twice daily continuously and vistusertib will be given orally 125mg twice daily 2 days on/5 days off.

 One cycle will be 28 days.

 Patients will be able to remain on treatment as long as they do not experience progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

 Stage 1 will require 7 patients, with no further accrual if 0 of 7 respond.

 If 1 or greater of the 7 patients respond, accrual will continue until 21 patients have been enrolled.
