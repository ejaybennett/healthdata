(thirdQuint)A Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Vamorolone in Boys With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).

 This Phase IIb study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo and active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PD, and population PK of vamorolone administered orally at daily doses of 2.

0 mg/kg and 6.

0 mg/kg versus prednisone 0.

75 mg/kg/day and placebo over a Treatment Period of 24 weeks, and to evaluate persistence of effect over a Treatment Period of 48 weeks in ambulant boys ages 4 to 6 years).

 During the 4-week Transition Period between Treatment Period #1 and Treatment Period #2, all subjects will continue on the same oral suspension (vamorolone 2.

0 mg/kg or 6.

0 mg/kg, or matching placebo) they received during Treatment Period #1 and all subjects will have their tablet dose tapered to zero.

 Thus, subjects randomized to receive vamorolone during Treatment Period #1 (Groups 1 and 2) will continue to receive vamorolone at the same dose, while subjects randomized to receive prednisone will have their dose tapered to zero, and subjects randomized to placebo will continue to receive placebo.

 A total of approximately 120 subjects will be randomized (2:2:1:1:1:1) to treatment.

 The prednisone group will be used as an active control comparison for safety and efficacy endpoints as requested by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

 The placebo group will be used as comparator for efficacy endpoints (superiority model) as requested by the EMA and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) protocol advisory board.

 At the end of the Treatment Period #2, subjects will be given the option of enrolling into a long-term extension study (VBP15-005) or to transition to standard of care treatment for DMD (may include glucocorticoids).

 Subjects completing VBP15-004 and enrolling directly into VBP15 005 will not need to taper their vamorolone dose prior to enrollment into VBP15 005.

 All other subjects will begin a 4 week double blind Dose tapering Period during which the dose of study medication will be progressively reduced and discontinued.
