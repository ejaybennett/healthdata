(firstQuint)RIPC and Platelet Activation on Platelet Activation During Cardiopulmonary Bypass.

 Previous studies reported that remote ischemic conditioning reduce platelet activation in patients with coronary artery disease or patients undergoing ablation for atrial fibrillation.

 Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass has been associated with platelet activation.

 In this randomized study, investigators are going to compare the effects of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on platelet activation using flow cytometry in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.
