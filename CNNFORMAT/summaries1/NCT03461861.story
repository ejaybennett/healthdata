(secondQuint)Network-Level Mechanisms for Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Development.

 In this study the investigators want to find out whether the use of a low dose of levetiracetam (LEV) in healthy adults with the Apolipoprotein e4 gene (APOE 4) can reduce abnormal hippocampal network activity.

 The investigators also want to study whether this low dose of LEV can improve memory function.

 LEV is a type of drug called an anti-epileptic or anti-seizure medication.

 It is FDA approved worldwide for adults and children as young as one month with seizures.

 It is a generic drug used in long-term epilepsy treatment.

 It is relatively safe and has an acceptable side-effect profile.

 It is known that age and the APOE 4 gene are important risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

 Further studies have shown that cognitively normal, older adults with the APOE 4 gene have more hyperfunctional brain network activity, increased alpha beta accumulation, decreased memory function, and decreased brain volume, which is consistent with Alzheimer's disease patterns.

The purpose of this project is to test the hypothesis that a low dose of levetiracetam can reduce abnormal hyperfunctional activity in the hippocampus in normal, healthy adults who are APOE 4 carriers.

 The investigators will compare the results to normal, healthy adults who are APOE 4 non-carriers.
