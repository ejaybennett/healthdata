(fifthQuint)Trial of Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Bevacizumab vs Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Bevacizumab-Rucaparib vs Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Rucaparib in Patients With Advanced (Stage III B-C-IV) Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal and Fallopian Tube Cancer.

.

 Phase I study design: This is a single-centre, Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab-rucaparib combination and determine the MTD in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

 The dose of bevacizumab is fixed in cohort 1, 2 and 3 of the study at 15mg/kg, q 3 weekly.

 The dose of rucaparib is evaluated in three cohorts (400 mg BID; 500 mg BID; 600 mg BID).

 This trial will enroll at least 3 patients in cohort 1 with dose escalation to rucaparib 500 mg from cohort 1 to 2.

 Cohort 2 will enroll at least 3 patients with dose escalation to rucaparib 600 mg from cohort 2 to 3.

 The standard 3+3 design will be used.

 Patients will be enrolled in cohort of 3 patients, if no DLT event will be reported among the first 3 patients, a second cohort will be enrolled at the upper dose level.

 If 1 DLT event is registered in the first cohort, other 3 patients will be enrolled at the same dose.

 Phase II study design: Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Bevacizumab vs Carboplatin-Paclitaxel- Bevacizumab-Rucaparib vs Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Rucaparib in the following treatment arms: - ARM A: Carboplatin AUC 5 + Paclitaxel 175 mg/mq d 1 q 21 for 6 cycles + Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg d 1 q 21 days for 22 cycles (in combination and maintenance); - ARM B: Carboplatin AUC 5 + Paclitaxel 175 mg/mq d1 q 21 days for 6 cycles + Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg d1 q 21 for 22 cycles (in combination and maintenance) + Rucaparib at the dose defined by the Phase I study continuously for 2 years (Rucaparib only in maintenance); - ARM C: Carboplatin AUC 5 + Paclitaxel 175 mg/mq d1 q 21 days for 6 cycles + Rucaparib 600 mg BID continuously for 2 years (Rucaparib only as maintenance).

 Randomization to study treatment will be performed within 28 days following surgery.

 Study treatment must be initiated within 4 days of randomization so chemotherapy treatment will be initiated within 32 days from previous surgery.

@highlight

This trial is a randomized, open-label Phase II multi-center study designed to evaluate the effect of first line therapy of Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Bevacizumab (in combination and maintenance) vs Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Bevacizumab-Rucaparib (Rucaparib only in maintenance) vs Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Rucaparib (Rucaparib only in maintenance) on progression-free survival in patients with advanced high grade ovarian cancer.

 The randomized phase of the study will be preceded by a single arm Phase I study aiming at evaluating the MTD of the combination Rucaparib-Bevacizumab.

 Once the MTD has been reached the randomized study will start.
