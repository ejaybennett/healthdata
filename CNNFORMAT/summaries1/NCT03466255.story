(thirdQuint)Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease.

 Study Design: The investigators will conduct a prospective, single-center, observational study at the Cardiovascular Imaging Network at Queen's (CINQ, www.

CINQLab.

com).

 This facility allows a CEUS protocol to be conducted on the same day as the angiogram.

 It is anticipated that 100 participants can be recruited per month with a total target enrolment of up to 1000 participants.

 Objectives 1.

 To determine the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, negative/positive predictive values) of carotid plaque by CEUS (Definity(R)) for predicting significant CAD (50% stenosis) in participants referred for angiography 2.

 To determine the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values) of carotid plaque by CEUS for predicting future CV events, such as death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular interventions.

 Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease@highlight

The investigators plan to evaluate the correlation between carotid plaque enhancement on Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), significant coronary artery disease (CAD), and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in a systematic manner.

 The investigators hypothesize that increased levels of CEUS-detected vulnerable carotid plaque will be predictive of CV risk determined by angiography and future cardiovascular events.
