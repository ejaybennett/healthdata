(fifthQuint)Breathing Exercises and Adhesive Capsulitis.

 Pain in the early stages of adhesive capsulitis leads to many symptoms such as sleeping problems.

 Breathing exercises also began to take place among the applications towards pain.

 Abdominal respiration is considered the easiest method to reveal relaxation response.

 Slow breathing increases parasympathetic activity in the body and reduces sympathetic activity.

 This is the first and fundamental step of real healing.

 The reduction of pro-inflammatory markers with respiratory exercises suggests that respiratory exercises are effective in inflammation.

 On study group; Hotpack was applied for 15 minutes and TENS was applied for 15 minutes and ultrasonics for 5 minutes.

 Then, scapular mobilization and passive stretching exercises were applied in 10 sets of 3 sets (flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation) to increase joint range of motion by physiotherapist.

 Then abdominal respiratory exercise training was given 3 times a week as 30 sets of 3 times a week and patients were treated for 8 weeks.

 For the control group; Hotpack was applied for 15 min and TENS was applied for 15 min and ultrasonics for 5 min.

 Then scapular mobilization and passive stretching exercises were applied for 8 weeks in 10 sets of 3 sets (flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation) to increase joint range of motion by physiotherapist.

 Breathing Exercises and Adhesive Capsulitis@highlight

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of abdominal breathing exercises on pain, sleep quality and quality of life with adhesive capsulitis patients.

 The 41 adhesive capsulitis patients, 29 women and 12 men aged between 40-65 years, had divided into two groups by simple random sampling.

 In the study group, abdominal breathing exercise training was applied to routine physiotherapy program, in the control group routine physiotherapy program was applied for 8 weeks.

 Individuals were assessed for lung function test, range of motion, pain, sleep quality and quality of life.

 First assesment were performed at the beginning of treatment, 2nd assesment were performed at the end of 8 th week.
