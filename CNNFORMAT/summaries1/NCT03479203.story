(thirdQuint)Acute Effects of E-Cigarette Aerosol Inhalation.

 The purpose of this study is 1) to examine the acute effects of nicotine free e-cigarette aerosol on vascular function in healthy, non-smokers and 2) to examine and compare vascular function in healthy smokers chronically exposed, at baseline and after 12 months, to nicotinized e-cigarette aerosol versus conventional cigarettes as compared to age, gender and body mass index-matched nonsmokers.

 Vascular function (microvascular reactivity via dynamic femoral oximetry, arterial hyperemia, femoral artery flow-mediated dilation, central pulse-wave velocity, neurovascular reactivity) will be assessed as part of a single integrated MRI protocol.

 The outcome of the project will provide new insight into the acute and chronic effects of e-cigarette aerosol inhalation in terms of surrogate markers of endothelial dysfunction (EDF), the prime promoter of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and aid toward establishment of future public health advisories.

 Acute Effects of E-Cigarette Aerosol Inhalation@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine the acute effects of nicotine free electronic cigarette aerosol on vascular function in healthy, non-smokers.

 This study comprises a portion of a larger study comparing results of vascular function in nonsmokers to vascular function in healthy smokers chronically exposed to nicotinized electronic cigarette aerosol versus conventional cigarettes.
