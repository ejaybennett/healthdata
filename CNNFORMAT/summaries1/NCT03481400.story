(secondQuint)CGRP-induced Migraine Attacks in Patients Who Have Tried Anti-CGRP Monoclonal Antibody Treatment.

 Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a role in migraine pathophysiology.

 Infusions of CGRP can trigger migraine-like attacks in migraine patients and antibodies against CGRP or the CGRP receptor significantly reduces the number of migraine days per month when administered regularly.

 Some patients however, do not experience migraine attack after CGRP infusion, and some do not experience migraine reduction with antibodies.

 The underlying mechanisms of these effects are largely unknown.

 The purpose of this study is to examine CGRP-induced migraine in patients who have evaluated the efficacy of anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment for migraine using a purpose-developed standardized interview.

 The investigators will use a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study design to examine migraine susceptibility to CGRP in these patients.

The investigators aim to investigate the incidence of migraine attacks after calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) infusion in patients who have tried anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment for the prevention of migraine.
