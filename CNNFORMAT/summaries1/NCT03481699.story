(secondQuint)Intervention Based on Implicit Theories of Personality: Effects on Depression and Bullying.

 Depression and bullying are two problems arising in childhood and adolescence, which cause severe suffering.

 Although there are good intervention programs for children and adolescents at risk, the results for universal interventions have generally been poor.

 The current project will test the efficacy of an Intervention based on the Implicit Theories of Personality (ITP).

 This procedure has recently been developed at US by David S.

 Yeager and colleagues, with extraordinary results in the reduction of depression, stress, and aggression.

 The project includes the following aims: (1) the evaluation of the efficacy of the ITP in Spanish adolescents; (2) the identification of the mechanisms mediating the effects of ITP in depression and bullying (these mediators include changes in cognitive vulnerabilities and hormones -cortisol, testosterone and DHEA in saliva); (3) the identification of moderators of the effects of the ITP, such as age, early family experiences, temperament and gender; and (4) the inclusion of a transactional perspective in order to determine whether the ITP changes the reciprocal longitudinal paths between risk factors, environmental stressors, cognitive vulnerabilities, and depressive symptoms and aggressive behavior; The study involves the evaluation of the intervention in a sample of around 1000 adolescents (12-18 years), randomly allocated to experimental and control condition.

 It is a field experiment conducted in high schools and involves multiple measures over time (self-reports and parent reports; as well as levels of cortisol, testosterone and DHEA in saliva in random subset -60%- of the participants).

 In summary, the project aims to respond to the challenge of health and wellness in the population through a randomized controlled trial with multiple sources of measure and from a biopsychosocial perspective.

 The ITP intervention has the potential to become a universal intervention to help reduce the rates of depression and bullying.

This study evaluates the efficacy of an intervention based on the Implicit Theories of Personality (ITP) in Spanish adolescents.

 Half of participants received the ITP intervention, while the other half received an educational intervention.
