(thirdQuint)The Impact of Preoperative FoodforCare at Home on Functional and Clinical Outcomes.

 Each year, approximately 1.

4 million patients in the Netherlands are operated.

 Adequate nutritional intake, mainly protein intake, before surgery is important to improve preoperative muscle strength and functional capacity.

 However, up to 40% of patients admitted to the hospital suffer from malnutrition and this further deepened during hospitalization, which is an independent risk factor for peri-operative morbidity and severe complications, ranging from increased muscle loss, to higher infection rates, delayed wound healing and subsequently a prolonged hospital stay.

 An adequate food service is one strategy to improve protein intake and thereby the nutritional status.

 Extension of the study period to the out-of-hospital setting is recommended to explore the effects of long-term exposure to this concept on clinical outcomes.

 Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that providing meals from FoodforCare at Home before surgery will contribute to functional and clinical outcomes of patients when compared to usual care.

Malnutrition is still a big problem in hospitals since 2-38% of clinical patients is malnourished, because of the underlying disease as well as its treatment.

 An adequate nutritional status before surgery is essential in order to improve recovery after surgery.

 Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that providing meals from FoodforCare at Home before surgery will contribute to functional and clinical outcomes of patients when compared to usual care.
