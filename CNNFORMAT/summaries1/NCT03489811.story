(thirdQuint)The Effect of Aroma on Anxiety Among Children With Autism.

.

 Essential oils have been found in studies to reduce both stress and anxiety as measured by an anxiety inventory, but studies have not tested these effects among children who have an autism spectrum disorder.

 The essential oils used in this study are administered each morning for a total period of four weeks, with an optional second exposure on an as-needed basis during the final two of the four weeks of the study.

 The oils are administered during this time to evaluate both the preventive effects and the treatment effects of the essential oils.

 Anxiety is measured on an anxiety inventory, which is completed by the parent of the participant at the end of each week during the study.

 Parents complete this data online, allowing them to participate from anywhere in the U.
