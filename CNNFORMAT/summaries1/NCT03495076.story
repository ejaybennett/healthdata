(thirdQuint)Perceptual Distortions in Acute Neck Pain.

 This project has following goals: 1.

 To test the hypothesis of pain as a process of biological value leading to improvement in tactile acuity 2.

 To investigate intra-rater reliability of tests measuring perceptual distortions in pain 3.

 To investigate validity of novel tests measuring perceptual distortions in pain 4.

 To explore the influence of acute neck pain on left/right recognition task 5.

 To explore the effect of acute neck pain on body perception.

 Perceptual Distortions in Acute Neck Pain@highlight

Research has shown that chronic pain is related to variety of perceptual distortions.

 Little is known on how acute pain experience influences perception, especially precision of touch.

 This project is aiming to test the hypothesis of pain as a process of biological value leading to improvement in tactile acuity.
