(secondQuint)Combination Effects of Pregabalin and Dexmedetomidine on Postoperative Pain.

 One hour before spinal anesthesia, patients received pregabalin 150 mg or placebo orally and a bolus dose of 0.

5 1/2g /kg IV dexmedetomidine was given over 10 min before induction of spinal anesthesia, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.
