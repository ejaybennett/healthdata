(thirdQuint)Dose-response Relationship of Botullinum Toxin (DWP 450) for Finger Flexor Spasticity.

 Seventy-eight patients with upper extremity spasticity after cerebrovascular accident will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of 5 groups.

 The groups are as followings.

 Gp 1: placebo group (Normal saline 1.

2 ml) Gp 2: Clostridium Botulinum Toxin Type A (Nabota, DWP 450) 15 U Gp 3: Clostridium Botulinum Toxin Type A (Nabota, DWP 450) 30 U Gp 4: Clostridium Botulinum Toxin Type A (Nabota, DWP 450) 50 U Gp 5: Clostridium Botulinum Toxin Type A (Nabota, DWP 450) 70 U According to the group, the injection will be performed to the finger flexor musles (flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus).

 Outcome measurement will be MAS (Modified ashworth scale), FMA, Wolf Motor Assessment, Cross sectional area measured by Ultrasonography.

 Patient evaluation will be conducted 2 weeks, 1 months, 2 months, and 3 months after the injection.
