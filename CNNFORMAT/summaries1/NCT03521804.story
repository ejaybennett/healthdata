(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of the SoundBite Crossing System With ACTIVE Wire in Coronary CTOs.

.

 The study is intended to demonstrate that the SoundBite cent Crossing System - Coronary can facilitate the passage of either 1) devices intended to treat a CTO or 2) guidewires or additional crossing devices into the true lumen distal to the CTO.

 SoundBite cent Crossing System - Coronary, which consists of a re-usable console and a disposable device (ACTIVE Wire).

 The SoundBite cent Crossing System - Coronary is intended to facilitate passage of a guidewire or therapeutic devices through a coronary artery Chronic Total Occlusion.

 This is a prospective, multi-center, multinational, single-arm, phased clinical study intended to provide pivotal data for device approval.
