(firstQuint)Efficacy and Safety of MMFS in Mild AD.

 This is a phase 2 study in patients with probable mild Alzheimer's disease.

 The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group design, in which participants (up to 6 per arm; 12 total) will receive oral placebo or MMFS twice daily for 24 weeks.

 Randomized patients and their informants (required) will complete 3 assessments total: at baseline (prior to taking any study tablets), 12 weeks, and 24 weeks.

 At each of the three assessments, participants will complete cognitive and behavioral measures and clinical interviews, a blood sample will be collected for safety and biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease, and the informant will complete an interview concerning the patient's cognition, mood, and function.

 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will also be obtained from patients via lumbar puncture at baseline and Week 24 for biomarker analyses.

 A range of safety and tolerability assessments will also be performed (including vital signs, laboratory tests, and ECGs).

 Participants will be contacted by phone between clinical assessments for monitoring.
