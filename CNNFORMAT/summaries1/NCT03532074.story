(thirdQuint)Indocyanine Green and Rectosigmoid Endometriosis.

 Patients with symptomatic rectosigmoid endometriosis requiring laparoscopic surgery are included in the study.

 Before surgery, bowel symptoms are assessed using validated questionnaires (Knowles-Eccersley-Scott-Symptom Questionnaire and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index).

 Indocyanine green (1.

5 mL containing 3.

75 mg) are administered through peripheral line.

 A near-infrared (NIR) camera-head (KARL STORZ Gesellschaft mit beschrankter Haftung & Co.

, Tuttlingen, Germany) enables after a latency of 5 to 50 seconds a real-time direct visualization of bowel perfusion before and after the removal of the rectosigmoid nodule.

 Vascularization of rectosigmoid tract is assessed before and after the removal of the nodule.

 To estimate the vascularization, a scale with a score between 0 and 4 is used.

 After complete removal of rectosigmoid nodule, the post-operative follow-up will be the same as usual after intestinal endometriosis surgery.

 Postoperative bowel symptoms are evaluated using the same questionnaires.

 Indocyanine Green and Rectosigmoid Endometriosis@highlight

Indocyanine green is a fluorescent dye used for the intraoperative evaluation of tissue perfusion.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate a possible correlation between rectosigmoid vascularization and intestinal symptoms in patients needing surgery for rectosigmoid endometriosis.

 Bowel symptoms and rectosigmoid perfusion are assessed before and after surgery.
