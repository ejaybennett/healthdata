(thirdQuint)Behavioral Economics-Based Online Lifestyle Balance Program.

 This project investigates whether participants in a online weight loss program can be induced to achieve weight loss using financial incentives.

 The study is a 3-arm RCT stratified by gender.

 The goal is to examine how overweight individuals respond to two different types of financial incentives.

 The first type of incentive, IW (incentive for weight loss), is a cash award of approximately $150 given for achieving 5% weight loss over 12 weeks.

 The second type of incentive, IE (incentive for education), is a $150 award for passing quizzes that test the participants' health literacy about weight loss and techniques required for maintaining a healthful lifestyle.

 We compare the effectiveness of IW to IE in promoting weight loss in overweight individuals and investigate whether the two incentives work equally well for men and women.

 Behavioral Economics-Based Online Lifestyle Balance Program@highlight

The objective of this project is to design a Behavioral Economics Based Online Lifestyle Balance Program that employs behavioral economics to engage and motivate adherence to the Internet-based program.

 We compare the effects of two financial incentives on inducing weight loss: a direct financial incentive for weight loss and a financial incentive for learning health literacy.
