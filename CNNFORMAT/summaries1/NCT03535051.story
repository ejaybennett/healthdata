03% Cream vs Tacrolimus Alone in Vitiligo@highlight

The aim of our clinical trial was to find out whether fractional CO laser sessions in combination with application of daily topical tacrolimus 0.

03% would enhance the action of the drug and pose as a possible combination treatment option for stable vitiligo lesions.

 We applied this combination treatment on one side of the body and compared the response to the response of the lesions on the other side of the body to daily topical tacrolimus 0.

03% alone, which we used as control.
