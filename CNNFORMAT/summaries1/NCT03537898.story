 BASE is a pilot, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial of lactated Ringer's versus Normosol-R pH 7.

4 with regard to plasma bicarbonate concentration between intensive care unit admission and hospital discharge among all patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit.

 Between June 2018 and January 2019, all patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who are 18 years or older will be enrolled.

 The study will occur in one-month blocks.

 The medical intensive care unit (MICU) will be randomized to an initial fluid group (lactated Ringer's or Normosol).

 The assigned fluid will be used exclusively for all patients receiving isotonic crystalloid for the duration of the month-long block (except in the presence of pre-specified contraindications).

 The assigned study fluid will switch at the end of each month-long block such that half of hte months are assigned to lactated Ringer's and half of the months are assigned to Normosol-R pH 7.

4.

 It is anticipated that around 2,000 patients will be enrolled from the medical ICU during the study period.

 The primary outcome analysis will be an intention-to-treat comparison of the primary outcome of bicarbonate concentration (mmol/L) between enrollment and 7 days after enrollment between the lactated Ringer's and Normosol-R groups using generalized estimating equations with a random effect for study period and accounting for repeated measures.

The administration of intravenous fluids is ubiquitous in the care of the critically ill.

 Commonly available isotonic crystalloid solutions contain a broad spectrum electrolyte compositions including a range chloride concentrations.

 Recent prospective, randomized trials have shown improved patient outcomes with the use of balanced crystalloids compared to saline.

 There have not been large randomized studies comparing acetate buffered balanced crystalloids to non-acetate buffered balanced crystalloids in the critically ill.

 BASE will be a pilot study for a large, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial enrolling critically ill patients from the Medical ICU at Vanderbilt University from June 2018 until January 2019.

 The primary endpoint will be plasma bicarbonate concentration between Intensive Care Unit admission and hospital discharge.
