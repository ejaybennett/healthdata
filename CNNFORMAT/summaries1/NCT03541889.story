(fifthQuint)REVEAL Biomarkers of Engraftment After Alternative Donor HSCT.

 This is a prospective pilot study whose primary aim is to determine whether investigational FLT imaging can detect and distinguish nonengraftment from delayed engraftment after HSCT in populations at highest risk for graft failure.

 The investigators will enroll 50 patients undergoing myeloblative transplantation on this trial (15 pediatric and adult recipients of cord blood stem cells, 15 pediatric and adult recipients of haplo-identical HSCT, and 20 recipients of these two stem cell sources who have not engrafted by day 28).

 The planned length of this trial is 5 years and it will be conducted at 3 centers: Children's National Medical Center (pediatric), University of Oklahoma (pediatric and adult), and University of Michigan (pediatric and adult).

 For all pediatric and adult patients undergoing cord blood HSCT, FLT imaging will occur one day prior to HSCT and on days 9 and 28 after HSCT.

 For recipients of haplo-HSCT, FLT PET/CT imaging will occur one day prior to HSCT and on days 5 and 28 after HSCT.

 Pediatric and adult patients who have not engrafted by day 24 after cord or haplo-identical HSCT will undergo a single FLT PET/CT image within one week to determine if this scan can identify graft failure versus delayed engraftment.

 All patients will undergo serial peripheral blood evaluation for blood biomarker analysis, including thymidine kinase-1 (TK1).

 Study endpoints include: 1) detection of nonengraftment with FLT and TK1, 2) development of a model that predicts nonengraftment versus delayed engraftment using FLT and TK1, 3) sensitivity of individual biomarkers to distinguish between graft failure and delayed engraftment, and 4) biology of cord blood and haplo-HSCT engraftment.

 REVEAL Biomarkers of Engraftment After Alternative Donor HSCT@highlight

The primary objective is to evaluate whether an investigational nuclear medicine test (FLT imaging) distinguishes delayed engraftment from graft failure after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT, which is when the patient's blood system is depleted and a new healthy blood system infused) and Objectives:Secondary: - Map the cellular pathway to subclinical (before the new cells are present in the blood) engraftment after cord blood and haplo-identical engraftment through FLT imaging, identifying the earliest marrow site of settling.

 - Evaluate the safety of FLT for patients at highest risk for graft failure.

 - Determine whether levels of TK1, an investigational blood test to determine growth of new cells, correlate with graft failure or delayed engraftment, versus those of patients who had on-time engraftment.

 - Explore other blood markers of subclinical engraftment.
