(secondQuint)Pivotal Study of the iNAP in Adults With OSA.

 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) impacts sleep quality of patients, which contributes significantly to hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction and other health problems.

 Intraoral devices, such as tongue retaining devices, palatal lifting devices and mandibular repositioning devices designed to increase the patency of the airway and to decrease airway obstruction, are used to treat OSA.

 To this end, the investigators are conducting a prospective, self-controlled, first-night order cross-over and evaluator-blind pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iNAP(R) Sleep Therapy System (iNAP(R)), a tongue and soft palate retaining intraoral device, in adults with OSA.
