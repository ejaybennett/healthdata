(fifthQuint)Enteral Nutrition Tolerance And REspiratory Support (ENTARES).

 BACKGROUND: Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a common condition in premature infants and one of the major cause of neonatal mortality.

 For many years, preterm infants with RDS have been treated with mechanical ventilation increasing risks of acute lung injury and long-term morbidity, as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

 Early nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) treatment combined with surfactant replacement therapy decreases the need for mechanical ventilation and has been recommended as first line treatment for RDS.

 However, NCPAP has significant limitations, mainly related to the type of interface needed.

 Excessive leak around the prongs or mask and through the mouth can lead to inadequate support, whereas excessive pressure may result in pneumothorax and damage of the nose and face.

 Moreover, the bulky fixation devices obscure the infant's face both interfering with feeding and positioning.

 In recent years, heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) has been studied as an alternative non-invasive respiratory supports (NIReS).

 HHHFNC became popular partially thanks to some perceived advantages related to the type of interface used.

 Cannulae are easier to apply than NCPAP prongs or mask, may be more comfortable for infants, and may enable easier access to babies' faces, thus facilitating feeding and parental bonding.

 Whereas practical advantages seem to be established there is controversy about HHHFNC efficacy as respiratory support.

 Recent studies support that HHHFNC is as effective as NCPAP for the primary treatment of RDS, but evidences are still insufficient and data are still lacking, especially for the extremely preterm population ( 40% - pH 65 mmHg - 3 episodes of desaturations (SatO2 TC 80%) per hour - 3 episodes of apnea (> 20 sec) and/or bradycardia (FC 80 bpm) per hour - Silverman score > 6 The indications for the interruption of feeding are based on abdominal examination, on the occurrence of vomits/regurgitations and crises of apnea/bradycardia and on the evaluation of alvus and gastric residual volumes, if required by the protocol of the unit.

 The maximum cut-off for feeding progression is set at 30 mL/Kg/day.

 Data on ventilation, nutrition, growth and clinical events will be collected from enrollment to discharge.

 DATA ANALYSIS: Data will be analysed according to an intention-to-treat model.

 Therefore, data from all infants enrolled into the study will be considered for the analysis.

 Death and transfer to another hospital, before reaching full enteral feeding, are the only two reasons for exclusion.

 The primary outcome will be evaluated by a survival analysis with non-parametric distribution.

 Secondary outcomes will be evaluated by Fisher's exact test or appropriate generalized linear models.

 EXPECTED RESULTS AND IMPACT ON CLINICAL PRACTICE: The identification of the most suitable NIReS for preterm infants with RDS and FI could reduce gastrointestinal complications, improve growth and reduce hospital stay, thus improving quality of life of infants and their family and reducing health costs.

 The evaluation of the timing of oral feeding could be useful to understand the influence that NIReS techniques have on the development of sucking-swallowing coordination.

 The evaluation of the response to NCPAP and HHHFNC could clarify their efficacy as treatment for RDS in extremely preterm infants.

 Enteral Nutrition Tolerance And REspiratory Support (ENTARES)@highlight

This research study aims to evaluate the relation between non-invasive ventilation and feeding tolerance in preterms with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).

 To this purpose a multicenter randomized controlled trial was designed.

 It will involve 13 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Italy and will be coordinated by the NICU of the University of Turin.

 The study focuses on the impact of two non-invasive respiratory support techniques (NCPAP and HHHFNC) on feeding intolerance and gastrointestinal complications to identify which technique is the most effective and safe in preterms with RDS.

 Further aim is to identify which technique could be the most suitable for full enteral feeding achievement and acquisition of oral feeding.

 Improving enteral feeding tolerance and promoting oral feeding could improve clinical outcomes and reduce risks and costs of prolonged hospital stay.

 Further aim is to evaluate the response to NCPAP and HHHFNC in the treatment of RDS, focusing on a population of extremely low preterms.
