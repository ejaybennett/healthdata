(secondQuint)A Multidimensional Behavioral Intervention for Those at Risk for Alzheimer's Dementia.

 The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of a 10-week multi-dimensional intervention for older adults with subjective cognitive concerns (SCC).

 The goal of this intervention is to enhance compensation skills related to everyday executive and everyday memory functions through training in the systematic use of a calendar system, goal setting and task list system, and organizational strategies within the context of the individual's daily life.

 This multidimensional intervention program also targets engagement in healthy lifestyle activities (physical exercise, intellectual stimulation, positive emotional functioning) to further promote brain health and functional resilience.

 Importantly, both treatment components work synergistically as the use of compensation strategies assists in building healthy activities into daily routines (e.

g.

, scheduling exercise into one's calendar and putting it on a task list).
