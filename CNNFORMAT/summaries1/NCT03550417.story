(fifthQuint)Evaluation of Medical and Nursing Management for Bronchiectasis.

 Project design: The study will be a 12 month retrospective observational cohort study conducted through a review of medical records, internal respiratory databases and electronic hospital patient record (OACIS & HOMER.

 Participants: Participants in the study will include all patients who have emergency service presentations or admissions to The Queen Elizabeth Hospital (TQEH) with new or existing bronchiectasis in 2011(Jan 1st to Dec 31st).

 This will be repeated using the same criteria in 2013.

 Data collection: Demographics, clinical data, hospital service utilisation, and clinical outcomes such as exacerbation frequency and disease progression.

 All data will be extracted into a standardised data extraction form, which a random subset will be checked by a second researcher.

Analysis of results:Demographic and descriptive data will be given in means + standard deviation and compared using a two-tailed and Student t-test.

 Categorical variables will be compared using chi-squared or Fisher exact tests, and when appropriate the Mann Whitney U test for non-parametric data.

 Evaluation of Medical and Nursing Management for Bronchiectasis@highlight

The purpose of this research is to retrospectively evaluate current clinical care of Bronchiectasis (non-cystic fibrosis [CF]) in adults from a multidisciplinary management perspective.

 This evaluation aims to address the important gaps in current clinical care in 2011 and 2013.

 The primary outcome of this evaluation is to compare the efficacy of current multidisciplinary clinical practice to the British Thoracic Society (BTS) & Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand (TSANZ) guidelines for bronchiectasis.

 Secondary outcomes of this evaluation will determine the impact of clinical care in 2011 and 2013 through quantification of:hospital utilisation for using hospital admission data, average length of stay, readmission rates within 28 days, emergency service attendance, outpatient review, exacerbations use of antibiotics, use of Hospital and Home (H@H), number of contacts with the respiratory nursing service and type of contacts with the respiratory nursing service.
