(secondQuint)Evaluation of the Hypoallergenicity of a New Formula Based on Hydrolyzed Rice Proteins.

 The study is made of 2 different steps : 1st step is a double blind randomised food challenge where the new formula is compared to a placebo.

 The second part of the trial consists in an open phase during which all infants will be fed with the study formula.
