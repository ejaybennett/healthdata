 Sick Leave, Work Disability and Quality of Life in Korean Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases@highlight

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract that significantly affects quality of life of patients.

 Several studies have reported that the loss of work productivity is significantly higher than that of the general population due to disease-related symptoms and various factors in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in Western countries, but there is few data in Korea.

 Therefore, this study is to assess the effect of disease on sick leave, work disability and health related quality of life in Korean patients with inflammatory bowel disease by using validated questionnaires.
