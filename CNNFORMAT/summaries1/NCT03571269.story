(fifthQuint)Study on STEMI Reperfusion Strategy Based on the Characterization of Criminal Lesions Stability.

 This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter clinical study.

 Twenty hundred and forty AMI patients (according to all the inclusion criteria and did not meet any exclusion criteria) who were enrolled in the culprit who had a lesion stenosis 70% and who had TIMI blood flow grade 3 or residual stenosis 70% after thrombus aspiration and TIMI grade 3 were randomized Enter the OCT guidance group or the imaging guide group.

 For the OCT guidance group, if the OCT examination indicates that the patient's lesion features a plaque rupture, dissection, and severe calcification, the stent is implanted.

 If the lesion is characterized by plaque erosion, conservative treatment with drugs is used.

 For the contrast guide group, the surgeon judges the lesion according to the current treatment standard and decides whether to implant the stent.

 All subjects underwent outpatient follow-up in January after discharge from the hospital.

 Exercise stress test was needed to assess whether any recurrent ischemic events occurred.

 At 3, 6 and 9 months, telephone or outpatient visits were used.

 Follow-up visits were performed at the 12th month of follow-up and coronary angiography was performed.

 At each follow-up, general conditions, uncomfortable complaints, oral medications, recent related test results, and adverse events were required.

 Study on STEMI Reperfusion Strategy Based on the Characterization of Criminal Lesions Stability@highlight

A randomized controlled study of whether stent implantation in STEMI patients with 70% coronary stenosis was designed.

 A total of 240 STEMI patients with coronary artery diameter stenosis 70% were randomly assigned to either an OCT-guided group or an angiography-guided group.

 OCT guidance group: Stent implantation or drug therapy is determined based on the stability of the culprit lesions by the OCT.

 Angiographic guide group: According to the results of coronary angiography, stent implantation or drug treatment was determined.

 Comparing two groups the implantation rate, the incidence of HF within one year, the incidence of MACE, and the safety end point were used to investigate the effectiveness and safety of endovascular imaging in STEMI emergency intervention strategies.
