(secondQuint)Pentoxifylline (Trental) as a Modulator of Tumor Necrosis Factor and of HIV Replication in Patients With AIDS.

 Pentoxifylline decreases tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and therefore should decrease such TNF-intensified events as cachexia, enhanced HIV expression, and inhibition of zidovudine (AZT) activity.

 Twenty-seven AIDS patients with elevated TNF and less than 300 CD4 cells are given pentoxifylline 3 times a day for 8 weeks.

 If no significant changes are seen in virologic, immunologic, or related measures, 27 additional patients are given a higher dose of pentoxifylline 3 times a day for eight weeks.

To determine whether pentoxifylline lowers tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels in AIDS patients.

 Pentoxifylline decreases tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and therefore should decrease such TNF-intensified events as cachexia, enhanced HIV expression, and inhibition of zidovudine (AZT) activity.
