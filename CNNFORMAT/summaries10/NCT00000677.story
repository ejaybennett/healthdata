(fifthQuint)SCH 39304 as Therapy for Acute Cryptococcal Meningitis in HIV-Infected Patients Followed by Maintenance Therapy.

 Cryptococcal meningitis is a significant cause of illness and death in HIV-infected patients.

 Intravenous amphotericin B is effective for acute disease but relapse occurs in the majority of patients.

 Maintenance therapy is recommended but must be balanced against the multiple toxicities of the drugs used and the problems associated with the weekly administration of intravenous therapy.

 Treatments that are equally or more effective and less toxic than traditional methods are needed, especially oral therapy.

 SCH 39304 is an orally active antifungal drug that in animal studies is active against a wide range of systemic fungal infections including infections due to Cryptococcus.

 Features of SCH 39304 suggest that it might be of value in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis.

 HIV-infected patients with a diagnosis of acute cryptococcal meningitis, previously untreated or relapsed following a successfully treated acute episode, are enrolled in the study.

 SCH 39304 is administered orally once daily for 3 days followed by a lower dose once daily for 12 weeks.
