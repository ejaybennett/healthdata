(fifthQuint)A Multicenter, Double Blind, Comparative Study of Zidovudine Alone Versus Zidovudine and Acyclovir as Treatment for HIV-Infected Patients With CD4+ Counts Less Than 200 Cells/mm3.

 AZT has been shown to increase the life span of patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex and patients being treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

 Drugs that increase the effectiveness of AZT against HIV may also decrease the need for high doses of AZT.

 This might reduce some of the negative effects of AZT while not reducing the positive effects.

 AMENDED: Patients are randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens.

 They receive AZT (or other antiretroviral agent) with or without ACV.

 Treatment Plan 1: AZT along with placebo at the same time.

 Treatment Plan 2: AZT and ACV.

 Therapy is for 104 weeks with an optional extension of 24 weeks or until the end of the study whichever comes first.

 The maximum duration of therapy for any patient will be 128 weeks.

 Medication is dispensed on a biweekly basis for the first 4 weeks, then every other month for the remainder of the study.

 Original design: Patients are randomly assigned to one of four treatment plans to receive AZT alone or AZT and ACV.

 Medications are given every 4 hours (q4h) orally (PO) while awake (WA).

 A total of 5 doses/day are given.

 The per dose schedule for the four plans are: Treatment plan 1: AZT plus placebo (an inactive medication) substituting for ACV.

 Treatment plan 2: AZT and AZT placebo along with an ACV placebo.

 Treatment plan 3: AZT and ACV.

 Treatment plan 4: AZT and AZT placebo and ACV.

 A Multicenter, Double Blind, Comparative Study of Zidovudine Alone Versus Zidovudine and Acyclovir as Treatment for HIV-Infected Patients With CD4+ Counts Less Than 200 Cells/mm3@highlight

Original design: The study's purpose is to compare the effects of zidovudine (AZT) alone to the combination of AZT and acyclovir (ACV) to determine if AZT/ACV is associated with a lower death rate and fewer AIDS related opportunistic infections compared to AZT alone, and to investigate the effect of these treatment plans on cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections.

 The study evaluates two doses of AZT used alone versus two doses of AZT combined with ACV.

 Per 12/11/92 amendment: Another antiretroviral agent may be substituted for AZT.

 AZT has been shown to increase the life span of patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex and patients being treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

 Drugs that increase the effectiveness of AZT against HIV may also decrease the need for high doses of AZT.

 This might reduce some of the negative effects of AZT while not reducing the positive effects.
