(thirdQuint)A Phase I Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of 200 Mcg of gp120 (CHO) BIOCINE in MF59 Emulsion Versus the Emulsion Control: Three Injections at 0, 1, and 6 Months.

 Preliminary evaluations of two dose levels of gp120 administered to volunteers in protocol VEU 007A indicate that a gp120 dose of potentially greater immunogenicity may be of interest.

 Ten healthy volunteers receive 200 mcg gp120 in MF59 emulsion, and four volunteers receive placebo consisting of MF59 emulsion in PBS vehicle.

 Injections are given at months 0, 1, and 6.

 Patients are followed for 12 months following the third injection.
