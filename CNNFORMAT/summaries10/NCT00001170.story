 Study of the Psychological Development of Children of Parents With and Without Affective Disorders@highlight

This research study is the continuation of a study started more than 20 years ago.

 The study was designed to explore the effect that depressed parents have on their children and to better understand the factors that contribute to depression development and maintenance.

 The study will continue to investigate if children have certain characteristics in early and middle childhood that predict the later development of psychological disorders.

 In addition, the study will continue looking at the processes responsible for the development of children of parents with and without affective (mood) disorders.
