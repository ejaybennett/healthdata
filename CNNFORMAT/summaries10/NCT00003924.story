(fifthQuint)Interferon Alfa-2b Following Chemotherapy and Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Hodgkin's Disease or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the efficacy of interferon alfa-2b in reducing the relapse rate in patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in second remission following high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.

 II.

 Compare the time to disease progression and survival in this patient population treated with interferon alfa-2b vs no further treatment.

 III.

 Assess the tolerability of these treatment regimens in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to lymphoma subtype.

 Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

 Arm I: Patients receive no further therapy following high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.

 Arm II: Beginning 4 weeks after high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, patients receive interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously three times a week.

 Treatment continues for 18 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 6 months until disease progression.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients (180 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 4-5 years.

RATIONALE: Interferon-alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.

 Giving interferon-alfa following chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation may be an effective treatment for Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of interferon alfa-2b following chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
