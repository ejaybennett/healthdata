(secondQuint)Topotecan in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the antitumor activity of topotecan in patients with recurrent platinum sensitive ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.

 II.

 Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3.

 Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.
