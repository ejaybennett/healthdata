 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate, time to progression, median survival, and percent of 1-year survival in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with fenretinide.

 - Determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral fenretinide every 12 hours on days 1-7.

 Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients who achieve complete response continue treatment for 1 year.
