(secondQuint)ZD 1839 in Treating Patients With Stage IV or Recurrent Kidney Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in patients with progressive stage IV or recurrent renal cell cancer treated with ZD 1839.

 - Determine the median time to objective progression in these patients receiving this drug.

 - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in this patient population.

 - Determine if epidermal growth factor receptor expression in tumor tissue correlates with response and survival of these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral ZD 1839 daily.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 8 weeks.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-23 months.

 ZD 1839 in Treating Patients With Stage IV or Recurrent Kidney Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as ZD 1839 may interfere with the growth of the tumor cells and slow the growth of kidney cancer.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ZD 1839 in treating patients who have recurrent or stage IV kidney cancer.
