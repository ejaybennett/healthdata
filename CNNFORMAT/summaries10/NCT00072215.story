(fifthQuint)Cisplatin and Ifosfamide Combined With Either Paclitaxel or Vinblastine in Treating Men With Progressive or Recurrent Metastatic Germ Cell Tumors.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the overall survival of men with progressive or recurrent metastatic germ cell tumors treated with paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin vs vinblastine, ifosfamide, and cisplatin as second-line therapy.

 Secondary - Compare the progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

 - Compare the toxicity profiles of these regimens in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to prior complete response or partial response with negative markers for at least 6 months (yes vs no) and relapse at least 2 years after completing first-line chemotherapy for germ cell tumors (yes vs no).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 24 hours on day 1 and cisplatin IV over 20-30 minutes and ifosfamide IV over 30 minutes on days 2-5.

 Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 7-18 OR pegfilgrastim SC once within 24-72 hours after completion of chemotherapy.

 - Arm II: Patients receive vinblastine IV on days 1 and 2 and cisplatin IV over 20-30 minutes and ifosfamide IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5.

 Patients also receive G-CSF SC on days 7-18 OR pegfilgrastim as in arm I.

 In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

 Cisplatin and Ifosfamide Combined With Either Paclitaxel or Vinblastine in Treating Men With Progressive or Recurrent Metastatic Germ Cell Tumors@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide, cisplatin, paclitaxel, and vinblastine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 It is not yet known whether ifosfamide and cisplatin are more effective when combined with paclitaxel or vinblastine in treating germ cell tumors.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin to see how well they work compared to vinblastine, ifosfamide, and cisplatin in treating men with progressive or recurrent metastatic germ cell tumors.
