(thirdQuint)Proteomic Profiling in Diagnosing Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Patients Who Are Undergoing Lung Resection for Suspicious Stage I Lung Lesions.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine, prospectively, whether serum proteomic profiling can predict the presence of primary non-small cell lung cancer in patients with clinically suspicious stage I lung lesions who are undergoing lung resection.

 Secondary - Correlate the serum proteomic profile with pathologic nodal status and histopathologic features of primary lung cancer in these patients.

 - Correlate the initial and follow-up serum proteomic profile with overall and cancer-specific survival of these patients.

 - Correlate changes in the proteomic profile (preoperative to postoperative) with overall and cancer-specific survival of these patients.

 Tertiary - Determine whether novel molecular strategies can predict the presence of lung cancer and/or the biologic behavior of an individual cancer in these patients.

 Proteomic Profiling in Diagnosing Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Patients Who Are Undergoing Lung Resection for Suspicious Stage I Lung Lesions@highlight

RATIONALE: Evaluating specific proteins in the blood may be an effective and noninvasive procedure to help doctors determine if a patient has early non-small cell lung cancer.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying proteomic profiling to see how well it works in diagnosing non-small cell lung cancer in patients who are undergoing resection for suspicious (abnormal) stage I lung lesions.
