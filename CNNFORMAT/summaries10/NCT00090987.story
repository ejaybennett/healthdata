(secondQuint)Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With HIV-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine clinical response in patients with HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma treated with imatinib mesylate.

 Secondary - Determine the inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptors, as determined by immunohistochemistry, in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine cytokine profiles before and after treatment with this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug and antiretrovirals in these patients.

 - Determine mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily.

 Treatment continues for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed at 30 days.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.

RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in treating patients with HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma.
