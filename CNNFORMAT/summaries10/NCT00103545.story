(firstQuint)Use of ACA 125 in Patients With Ovarian Cancer: Safety and Immune Response.

 Patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer who receive surgical cytoreduction and platinum/taxane containing chemotherapy have a significant chance of entering complete clinical remission but about 70% will eventually relapse.

 Many patients respond to additional cytotoxic treatment with partial or complete responses, yet approximately 100% of these patients will ultimately progress.

 Novel consolidation strategies following treatment for recurrent disease are needed and an immunologic approach is an attractive option.
