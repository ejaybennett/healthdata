(thirdQuint)Docetaxel in Treating Older Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine degree of autonomy in instrumental activities of daily living on-therapy and at 6 and 12 months, as measured by Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, in older women with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast treated with docetaxel.

 Secondary - Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the degree of autonomy in daily activities as measured by Katz's Activities of Daily Living Scale, in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine mood status, as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale, of patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive docetaxel IV on days 1 and 15.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses.

 Ability to perform daily activities is assessed periodically.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 53 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Docetaxel in Treating Older Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well docetaxel works in treating older women with metastatic breast cancer and whether it helps improve the ability to perform daily activities.
