(thirdQuint)Irinotecan and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate in patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated extensive stage small cell lung cancer treated with irinotecan and carboplatin.

 Secondary - Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive irinotecan IV and carboplatin IV on days 1 and 8.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Irinotecan and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving irinotecan together with carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving irinotecan together with carboplatin works in treating patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.
