(thirdQuint)Predicting the Response to Montelukast by Genetic Variation in Asthmatics.

 Multiple genetic polymorphisms in the leukotriene pathway have been described but their clinical relevance is unclear.

 A single nucleotide polymorphism in the LTC4 synthase promoter region has been associated with increased LTC4 synthase mRNA and a trend toward improved bronchodilatory response to leukotriene modifiers in severe asthmatics.

 This study will examine mild to moderate asthmatics with the variant gene and evaluate the bronchoprotective response of montelukast in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over fashion.

 Predicting the Response to Montelukast by Genetic Variation in Asthmatics@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine a specific variation in the genetic code for an enzyme (LTC4 synthase) which plays an important role in the airway inflammation associated with asthma.

 We hypothesize that asthmatic patients with this variant gene will have a better response to montelukast than patients with the wild type gene, as measured by the ability of montelukast to protect against a hypertonic saline challenge.
