(secondQuint)Larger Dose of Spironolactone for the Treatment of Patients With Nonischemic Cardiomyopathy.

 In the investigators' recent daily clinical practice, they found that the larger dose of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone combined with a lower dose of an ACE inhibitor and the highest tolerable dose of beta blockers could reverse left ventricular remodeling more effectively than a smaller dose of spironolactone.

 The ventricular remodeling could get back to normal, especially in patients with none-ischaemic cardiomyopathy.

 The investigators hypothesize that long term use of a larger dose of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone could reverse left ventricular remodeling by stimulating new myocyte formation.

 Thus, they designed this study to verify its efficacy and safety in reversing left ventricular remodeling in severe congestive heart failure in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

 To avoid hyperkalemia, the investigators routinely use larger doses of diuretics in combination with a lower dose of an ACE inhibitor to offset the potassium-sparing effects of spironolactone and follow the patients closely.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether a larger dose of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone combined with a lower dose of an ACE inhibitor is more effective in reverse left ventricular remodeling in severe congestive heart failure in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.
