(fifthQuint)Effect of Intravenous Ferrous Sucrose on Exercise Capacity in Chronic Heart Failure.

 Study Phase and Design: Prospective two-centre, randomized, controlled, open-label, observer-blinded, parallel-group study Primary Objective: To evaluate the effect of intravenous (IV) iron supplementation on exercise tolerance, as determined by peak VO2.

 Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the effects of IV iron supplementation on exercise duration, left ventricular (LV) structure and function, symptom status (NYHA class, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire [MLHFQ], and subjective fatigue score), and haematological and biochemical (haemoglobin [Hb], haematocrit [Hct], iron status, N-BNP, cytokines and oxidative stress) indices.

 - To evaluate the safety profile of IV iron in subjects with moderate to severe CHF.

 Sample Size: 42 subjects (28 IV iron, 14 placebo); 50% anaemic and 50% non-anaemic.

 Effect of Intravenous Ferrous Sucrose on Exercise Capacity in Chronic Heart Failure@highlight

This is a two-center, randomised, single-blind (physician), prospective, controlled study to assess the acute (8 weeks) and chronic (16 weeks) effects of intravenous (IV) iron sucrose supplementation in anaemic and non-anaemic iron deficient patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).

 The hypotheses are: - Treatment of anaemic and non-anaemic iron-deficient CHF patients with IV iron sucrose improves exercise capacity as measured by peak VO2.

 - IV iron sucrose is safe and well tolerated in subjects with moderate to severe CHF.
