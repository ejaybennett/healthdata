(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Dermafill Dressing for Donor Sites.

 At the time of the procedure, donor sites that are symmetrical in size and shape will be selected.

 The donor sites will be harvested.

 Once the grafts have been harvested, the wounds will be randomized for treatment using either the Dermafill dressing or Xeroform.

 The wound dressings will then be observed at least once a day beginning post op day 2/48hours after surgery until healed, which is defined as 90% or more of the wound surface is confluently re-epithelized.

 Evaluation of Dermafill Dressing for Donor Sites@highlight

The purpose of the study is to compare one type of dressing against the current standard dressing that is used to cover the unburned area of the skin where a piece of skin is removed to cover another part of the body that was burned.

 Hypothesis: The mean healing time for wounds treated with the Dermafill dressing will be less than the mean healing time for wounds treated with Xeroform dressing.
