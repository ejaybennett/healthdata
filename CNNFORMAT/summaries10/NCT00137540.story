(fifthQuint)FLAT Study: First Line Ablation Therapy for Treatment of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (RAAFT).

 This study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical study that will enroll in its first phase 40 patients.

 The study will be performed in 3 European hospitals.

 Patients will be randomized to either the RF ablation strategy or to the medication arm.

 Hypothesis: As first line therapy, catheter ablation improves the long-term success, health-economic outcomes and is equally safe compared to the best anti-arrhythmic medication treatment in a selected group of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

 Primary endpoint: - long-term success, defined as patients free from any atrial fibrillation during 24 months after initial study treatment as determined by 7-days Holter and transtelephonic monitoring and by 12-lead ECG recordings.

 Secondary endpoints: - AF burden: frequency and duration of episodes - health-economic costs over 24 months - serious adverse events - Quality of Life scores, using SF-36 questionnaire.

 FLAT Study: First Line Ablation Therapy for Treatment of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (RAAFT)@highlight

The objective of this multicenter randomized study is to establish the effectiveness of treatment for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), in patients not previously treated with anti-arrhythmic drugs, by encircling the pulmonary veins with radiofrequency (RF) ablation, using the NaviStar(R) ThermoCool(R) catheter and the CARTO cent EP Navigation System.

 Effectiveness will be determined by comparing chronic success of ablation therapy versus anti-arrhythmic drug treatment, defined as patients with an absence of atrial tachycardias during 24 months of follow-up as determined by 7-days Holter and transtelephonic monitoring, and by 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings.
