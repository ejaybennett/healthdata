(thirdQuint)One Month Dual Antiretroviral Prophylaxis to Prevent Resistance Mutations in Mothers Exposed to Single Dose Nevirapine.

 A single nevirapine dose to the mother, with or without a dose to the child, in addition to oral ZDV prophylaxis starting from 28 weeks gestation has been proven to be highly effective in reducing further mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT).

 However, post exposure nevirapine resistance mutations are observed in the mother's viral population.

 These mutations detectable very early after exposure tend to disappear over time.

 Nevertheless, they may be associated with decrease in efficacy of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) containing regimens subsequently given to the women for their own health.

 Therefore, there is a need for research to prevent selection of resistance in the first place or to overcome the resistance in subsequent treatment of the infected mother or infant.

 Nevirapine plasma levels above IC50 have been detected in women exposed to a single 200 mg dose of nevirapine in a significant number of women during the third week postpartum.

 We hypothesize that giving ZDV+ddI to women exposed to nevirapine for one month as soon as possible after exposure may prevent the selection of nevirapine resistance mutations.

 One Month Dual Antiretroviral Prophylaxis to Prevent Resistance Mutations in Mothers Exposed to Single Dose Nevirapine@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether providing zidovudine (ZDV) and didanosine (ddI) during labor and for one month postpartum can reduce the selection of nevirapine (NVP) resistance mutations postpartum in women who received a single dose of nevirapine during labor and standard ZDV prophylaxis for the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV.
