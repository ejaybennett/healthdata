(secondQuint)Investigation of Vascular Relaxing Effects of the Antidiabetic Rosiglitazone.

.

 The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of oral rosiglitazone therapy on the vascular responsiveness of different vasoactive compounds (angiotensin II, insulin, histamine and glyceroltrinitrate) in healthy subjects.

 Rosiglitazone will be given orally (4 weeks 4mg/d, titrated to 8 mg/d for another 4 weeks) as treatment.

 Every subject will receive intravenous stimulation with angiotensin II, histamine, insulin and glyceroltrinitrate before and after an 8 weeks treatment interval with rosiglitazone.

 Investigation of Vascular Relaxing Effects of the Antidiabetic Rosiglitazone.

@highlight

The study is designed to test the hypothesis in healthy subjects that the oral antidiabetic drug rosiglitazone provides additional vascular relaxing or modulating effects in addition to its blood glucose level reducing ability.
