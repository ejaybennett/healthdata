(firstQuint)Risk Factors of Radiation Pneumonitis.

 We propose a prospective observational study to investigate the combinational effect of radiotherapeutic dosimetric parameters [mean lung dose & percentage of lung volume receiving at least 20Gy (V20)] and biological parameters [interleukin-6(IL6) & transforming growth factor beta (TGFB)] in predicting radiation pneumonitis, fibrosis, and change of QoL among at least fifty-three lung cancer patients.

 Eligibility included pathological or cytological proven small cell or non small cell lung cancer, thoracic RT planned for more than 30Gy [if fraction size >= 3Gy/fx] or 40Gy [if fraction size .

 Bronchial-alveolar lavage test of IL6, TGFB by ELISA will be done before and after RT if clinical available.

 Self-reported questionnaire [EORTC C30 & L13] will be collected before and after RT and in every follow up visits after double-checked by trained assistants.

 RT must be given by photon energies >=6MV.

 Radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis will be assessed according to common toxicity criteria 3 [CTC-3] weekly during RT and in every follow up visits.

 Chi-square test, logistic regression, and proportional hazard ratio method will be used to investigate whether the parameter(s) can be effective in predicting radiation related sequelae.
