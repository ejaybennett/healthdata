(fifthQuint)A Pilot Study of Montelukast Sodium (Singulair) in Older Adults With Asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

 Asthma and COPD are common chronic conditions in older adults.

 Adherence to therapy is an important consideration since patients typically take two or more medications a day and often have difficulties with inhaled breathing medications.

 Therefore, oral preparations, such as leukotriene modifiers, have considerable appeal for older adults with asthma or COPD.

 Phase 3 primary studies of the leukotriene modifier, montelukast sodium (Singulair), for the management of asthma have included very few older adults.

 The following randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed as a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of montelukast, in addition to usual therapy, in the treatment of older adults with asthma and/or COPD.

 Primary outcomes included pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1) and average daytime asthma symptom scores.

 Participants were recruited from Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW), an HMO with 450,000 members in Portland, OR.

 All were adults 50 years of age with asthma and/or COPD who were symptomatic despite using daily breathing medications.

 They were screened by phone to collect information on asthma symptoms, medications, health care utilization, and co-morbid illnesses.

 Eligible persons attended a baseline visit to further assess eligibility and collect baseline data, including smoking status, co-morbidities, and participant demographics.

 Spirometry was performed before and twenty minutes after administration of four puffs of inhaled albuterol delivered by metered dose inhaler.

 All participants received instructions about the use of a peak flow meter; maintenance of a daily asthma diary with peak flow measurements, symptoms, and medications; and optimal use of an MDI by spacer.

 Participants completed a two-week run-in period with placebo pills and used diaries to record peak flow each morning, use of inhaled ss-agonist, nocturnal awakenings for asthma, and occurrence of asthma attacks.

 A total of 149 participants were randomized and received either montelukast(one 10 mg tablet/day) (N=71) or placebo(one tablet/day) (N=78).

 Spirometry was repeated at the randomization visit, and information on health status, asthma quality of life, and asthma control was collected.

 Participants were followed for 6 weeks after randomization.

 A telephone call was made at three-weeks to collect information about adverse experiences.

 At the final visit, participants completed spirometry, and answered questions on health status, asthma QOL and asthma control.

 Unscheduled health care visits for asthma during the six-week study period were noted.

 Results showed that improvement in asthma control was mixed.

 A small improvement in the montelukast group was seen using one of the two control measures.

 There was no difference in lung function, asthma symptom scores, health care utilization, or health-related quality of life between the treatment and control groups.

 A Pilot Study of Montelukast Sodium (Singulair) in Older Adults With Asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease@highlight

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed the efficacy of montelukast in the treatment of adults 50 years of age with persistent asthma and/or COPD.

 Primary outcomes included forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1) and daytime asthma symptoms scores.

 Nocturnal symptoms, asthma control, health-related quality of life, peak flow measurements, and health care utilization were also assessed as secondary outcomes.

 Participants were recruited from the Kaiser Permanente Northwest member population.

 One hundred forty-nine subjects were randomized to treatment with montelukast (10 mg per day) or placebo, and were followed for a six-week period.

 No differences in lung function measures, health-related quality of life, health care utilization, and asthma symptom scores were observed; however, the montelukast group had slightly improved asthma control scores compared to the placebo group.
