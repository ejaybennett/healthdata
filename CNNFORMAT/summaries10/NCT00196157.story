(thirdQuint)Line Versus Spot Ablation in Persistent Atrial Fibrillation.

 This randomized study deals with two different ablative treatment strategies for persistent atrial fibrillation: a more anatomically guided linear ablation scheme with encircling of the ipsilateral pulmonary veins (PV), a left atrial roof line and an anterior line bridging the anterior mitral anulus to the ostium of the left superior PV versus an electrophysiological guided focal ablation strategy aiming at isolating, electrically, the PV and ablating areas of fragmented intracardiac electrograms thought to maintain atrial fibrillation.

 Both ablation approaches contain isolation of the most common source of triggering foci, i.

e.

, the pulmonary veins and additional modification of the substrate maintaining atrial fibrillation.

 The study endpoint is a combined efficacy/safety analysis.

 Extensive follow-up with three-monthly 7 days holter ECG is provided.
