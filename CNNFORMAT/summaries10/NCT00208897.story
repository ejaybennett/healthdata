(thirdQuint)Does Fluoxetine Have an Effect on the CNS CRF Systems in Women Abused in Childhood?.

 We compare indices of central CRF activity (i.

e.

 ACTH and cortisol response to CRF stimulation test) before and after 8 weeks of treatment with either fluoxetine or placebo between women with a history of childhood abuse (early life stress, ELS) and current major depression (ELS/MDD), women with a history of childhood abuse without major depression (ELS/non-MDD), and women without a history of childhood abuse and major depression (non-ELS/MDD).

 Changes in neuroendocrine responses to CRF are correlated with psychological outcome measures.

 We hypothesize that treatment with fluoxetine will normalize altered neuroendocrine responsiveness in cases with ELS and that this normalization will be correlated with improvement of symptoms of depression and anxiety.

 Does Fluoxetine Have an Effect on the CNS CRF Systems in Women Abused in Childhood?@highlight

The primary objective of this project is to determine whether treatment with the SSRI, fluoxetine versus placebo reverses alterations in the central CRF system induced by early life stress experiences (i.

e.

 childhood sexual and/or physical abuse) in cases with and without major depression.

 We also evaluate whether neuroendocrine changes after SSRI treatment correlate with clinical improvement.
