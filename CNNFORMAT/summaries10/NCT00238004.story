(fifthQuint)The Low HDL On Six Weeks Statin Therapy (LOW) Study.

 Objective: To assess, in patients with coronary heart disease and low HDL-cholesterol, the efficacy and tolerability of Niaspan as an adjunct to statin therapy in clinical practice.

 Background: Despite the clear reduction in mortality and cardiovascular morbidity associated with reduction of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) by statin therapy, a sizeable proportion of patients remain at risk of subsequent adverse cardiac events [1-3].

 It is clear that in some patients, further risk reduction may be obtained by addressing other elements of the lipid profile.

 In particular, sub-analysis of the Framingham study has shown that for any given level of LDL-C, the risk of coronary heart disease events decreased with increasing HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels [4].

 In addition, the adverse cardiac risk associated with elevated triglycerides is predominantly seen in patients with low HDL-C levels [5].

 The protective effect of HDL-C appears predominantly mediated via reverse cholesterol transport.

 In this process, excess cholesterol in cell membranes is transferred to HDL-C in the peripheral tissues, cholesterol is converted to cholesteryl ester in HDL-C by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), the newly synthesized cholesteryl ester is transported from HDL-C to lower density lipoproteins by the action of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and finally, the cholesterol is removed from plasma by hepatic clearance of plasma lipoproteins.

 Of the available licensed lipid lowering agents, nicotinic acid has the greatest potential for raising HDL-C, in addition to giving favourable reductions in LDL-C, triglycerides, lipoprotein (a), apolipoprotein B-100 and elevation of Apolipoprotein A-1.

 Early studies with nicotinic acid confirmed its efficacy in improving cardiac outcomes.

 The Coronary Drug Project [6], studied 8341 men with previous MI.

 A 26% reduction in non fatal MI and 24% reduction in cerebrovascular events was reported after 6 years follow up [6] and an 11% reduction in mortality after 15 years follow up [7].

 The Stockholm Ischemic Heart Disease Secondary Prevention Study [8] compared niacin plus clofibrate vs.

 placebo in 555 post MI survivors and after 5 years reported a 26% reduction in overall mortality (p50% diameter stenosis) 3.

 Established for at least 6 weeks on a "maintenance" dose of statin therapy (defined as Pravastatin 40mg, Simvastatin 40mg or Atorvastatin 10mg).

 The dose and type of statin should not be altered during the study period 4.

 Absence of concurrent major systemic illness (particularly liver or renal failure, or hypo or hyperthyroidism) Exclusion criteria: 1.

 Previous use of Niaspan or other non-statin lipid lowering agent within the previous 12 weeks 2.

 Contraindications to Niaspan therapy 3.

 Participation in another medical trial within the previous 30days 4.

 Failure to obtain informed consent Study Design: To be considered as a pilot study.

 Patients will be prospectively randomized, in a double blind fashion with 1:1 ratio, to receive Niaspan or to an otherwise identical placebo, with doses titrated according to the clinical response.

 The primary outcome measure will be the number of patients achieving target HDL-C levels (defined as HDL-C >1.

0mmol/l in males or >1.

29mmol/l in females) after completion of the study protocol while taking Niaspan compared with placebo.

 The final HDL-C blood sample for comparative analysis between groups will be taken at week 11, or at week 15, if the HDL-C target had not been reached by week 11.

 Given the HDL-C inclusion criteria of 90% power to detect this difference as statistically significant.

 Analysis by intention to treat will be made by an independent samples T test.

 The Low HDL On Six Weeks Statin Therapy (LOW) Study@highlight

Abnormal blood cholesterol levels increase the risk of developing, or dying from heart disease.

 It is well recognised that if "harmful" LDL cholesterol is high, and "protective" HDL cholesterol is low, this risk is increased.

 Drugs called statins are routinely used in patients with heart disease, are well tolerated, and decrease the harmful LDL cholesterol levels.

 However, statins only increase protective HDL cholesterol to a small extent.

 Some patients may thus benefit from additional medication to increase protective HDL-cholesterol further.

 One of the most effective drugs which can do this is nicotinic acid.

 This drug is well established having been available for over 30 years.

 Previous use has been limited by facial flushing in a large percentage of patients receiving the drug.

 However a new formulation called Niaspan is now available which is associated with much less flushing.

 Although many patients will have transient flushing, it is estimated that only 1 patient out of every 20 receiving the drug will have to discontinue treatment.

 We therefore propose, in patients with coronary artery disease and low HDL cholesterol despite being on a statin, to study the effect of Niaspan on HDL cholesterol and other lipid parameters, and to assess its tolerability.
