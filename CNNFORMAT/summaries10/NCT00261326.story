(thirdQuint)Simvastatin Treatment of Patients With Acute Optic Neuritis.

 Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease in the Central Nervous System (CNS).

 Acute optic neuritis is a common symptom of MS and is considered to have the same pathogenesis as MS, where autoimmune and inflammatory mechanisms lead to the progression of MS.

 Statins reduce the cholesterol in blood and in addition have anti-inflammatory effects.

 From experimental data and results from pilot projects there is evidence that the statins perform anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory effects and one can expect a beneficial outcome in the autoimmune inflammatory diseases after the treatment with statins.

The purpose of this study is to investigate if the simvastatin treatment improve the visual function after 3 months of the inclusion to this project and if the simvastatin influences the results on cerebral MRI after 3 and 6 months of the inclusion.

 In addition the development of new demyelinating relapses.

 In the patients with monosymptomatic acut optic neuritis to investigate whether the simvastatin reduces the risk to develop multiple sclerosis (MS).
