(firstQuint)Feasibility Study of a Chronic Retinal Stimulator in Retinitis Pigmentosa.

 The chronic retinal stimulation system is an implantable electronic device designed to provide electrical stimulation of the retina in order to elicit visual percepts in blind subjects.

 This chronic feasibility study will evaluate the ability of subjects to resolve multiple percepts and patterns under various stimulus conditions and optimize the effectiveness of electrical stimulus parameters with an initial chronic design.
