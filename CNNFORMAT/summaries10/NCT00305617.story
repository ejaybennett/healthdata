(thirdQuint)Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of Erlotinib in Patients Receiving Erlotinib For Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the cerebrospinal fluid penetration of erlotinib in a subset of patients who are undergoing treatment with erlotinib for stage III non-small cell lung cancer and have no CNS metastatic disease.

 OUTLINE: This is a pilot, nonrandomized study.

 Patients will undergo single lumbar puncture (LP) to remove cerebrospinal fluid for analysis.

 After completion of study, patients will be monitored for 1 month after LP to assess for any LP-related complications.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Determining whether erlotinib passes into the cerebrospinal fluid may help in planning treatment for some types of cancer.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well erlotinib is able to pass into the cerebrospinal fluid of patients receiving erlotinib for stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
