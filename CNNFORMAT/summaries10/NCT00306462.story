(secondQuint)Trial of Magnesium Sulfate Tocolysis Versus Nifedipine Tocolysis in Women With Preterm Labor.

 Primary Objective: To compare the efficacy of oral nifedipine versus IV magnesium sulfate on the rate of preterm delivery at <37 weeks in women with preterm labor between 24 and 32 6/7 weeks gestation.

 Secondary Objective: 1.

 To compare maternal side effects between the two tocolytic agents 2.

 To compare neonatal morbidities between the two study groups.
