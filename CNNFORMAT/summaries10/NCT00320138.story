(firstQuint)Acupuncture for the Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Among Military Personnel.

 Untreated Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) leads to decreased force readiness and increased health care utilization.

 Yet, service members with the disorder may be resistant to traditional treatments or find them undesirable because of side-effects, stigma, and long-term commitment.

 Acupuncture, which has few known side effects, holds promise as an effective treatment option for PTSD.

 Acupuncture has been shown to improve well-being and has been successfully used to treat stress, anxiety and pain conditions.

 In order to test the efficacy of acupuncture for treating the symptoms of PTSD-measured by the PTSD Checklist (PCL)-a 12-week, randomized, waitlist-controlled trial will be conducted using a sample of 75 active duty military personnel.

 Participants will receive an eight-session acupuncture treatment, and will be evaluated throughout the study by way of clinical assessments and an independent assessing acupuncturist.
