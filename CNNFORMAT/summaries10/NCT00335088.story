(thirdQuint)Local Moxifloxacin and Povidone Iodine Versus Povidone Iodine Alone as a Prophylaxis Before Eye Operations.

 Over all 500 patients admitted for various intraocular surgeries will be included in the study.

 The study will be prospective, double blind, placebo controlled, and randomized.

 Patients will be randomly allocated to prophylactic local therapy with either moxifloxacin and povidone iodine or povidone iodine alone before surgery.

 For patients treated with povidone iodine alone a placebo will also be given.

 Lacrimal sac and eye lid cultures will be obtained before the local therapy and just before surgery.

 All patients will be followed for 6 weeks for symptoms and signs of infection.

 Bacterial and fungal culture results will be compared between the 2 groups.
