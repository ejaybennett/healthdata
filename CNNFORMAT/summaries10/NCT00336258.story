(thirdQuint)US-Doppler and Procoagulant Microparticles for the Diagnosis of Asymptomatic DVT in Advanced Cancer Patients With Poor Performance Status.

 The association between malignancy and venous thromboembolism(VTE) is well known.

 VTE is one of the most common complications seen in cancer patients Early detection of VTE can identify patients who may benefit from anticoagulant therapy and prevent morbidity and mortality.

 There are recommendations for hospitalized cancer patients who are bedridden with an acute medical illness to receive prophylaxis, but in practice this is not clear cut.

It has been shown, in other selected groups of patients that Ultrasound Doppler can be used in order to diagnose asymptomatic DVT (deep vein thrombosis).

 Hematological coagulation tests, including procoagulant microparticles will be performed for the evaluation of coagulation profile, in order to evaluate the possible correlation between the prevalence of asymptomatic DVT and these laboratory parameters.

 US-Doppler and Procoagulant Microparticles for the Diagnosis of Asymptomatic DVT in Advanced Cancer Patients With Poor Performance Status@highlight

The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic lower extremity DVT detected by US-Doppler and procoagulant microparticles in a selected group of cancer patients suffering from an advanced stage of the disease.

 An attempt will be made to determine whether there is a correlation between this prevalence and various clinical and laboratory parameters.
