 Bridge is a pilot, single-arm, open-label, study to assess the ability of 3 FDA approved anti-retroviral drugs to decrease replication capacity of HIV virus in order to stabilize CD4 cell count and HIV RNA viral loads .

 All subjects will be prescribed the three-drug combination of lamivudine (3TC) + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) + nelfinavir (NLV)The "Bridge Study" is a pilot, study to assess the ability of 3 FDA approved anti-retroviral drugs to decrease replication capacity of HIV virus in order to stabilize CD4 cell count and HIV RNA viral loads.

 All subjects will receive the three-drug combination of lamivudine (3TC)+tenofovir disoproxil fumarate(TDF)+nelfinavir (NLV) The study will enroll 12 subjects for a 48 week study.

 Major entry criteria include: HIV+ Men and women 18 years of age who are currently failing antiretroviral(ARV)therapy with an HIV-1 RNA VL > 10,000 and have failed multiple treatment regimens due to resistance and/or intolerance.

 Genotype must demonstrate resistance to 3 major classes of ARV's - PI's, NNRTI's, and NRTI's.

 Phase 1 Pilot Study of an ART Bridging Regimen in Highly Experienced Patients Unable to Achieve Viral Suppression@highlight

We hypothesize that a simple bridging ARV regimen that tends to select for virus with a low replicative capacity may tend to stabilize CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load and might be an option to consider in patients with MDR HIV.

 This strategy will provide them with the bridge they desperately need so that they can await the development of new therapies that when used in combination will give them the best chance in achieving complete virologic suppression.
