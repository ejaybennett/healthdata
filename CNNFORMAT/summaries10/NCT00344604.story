(firstQuint)The Role of Psychosocial and Other Quality of Life Parameters in Evaluating Functional Changes Prior to and Following Laser in-Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK)Changes Laser in-Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK).

 Our purpose is to evaluate the changes in quality of life parameters after LASIK surgery.

 We intend to create a questionnaire to delineate the changes that occur in LASIK patients at the pre-operative visit and at the 1-month and 3-month post-operative visits.

 Additional questionnaires will be administered to demonstrate the validity of the new questionnaire.

 The approximate time the patient will be required to spend in clinic will be approximately 45 minutes at each of the three visits.
