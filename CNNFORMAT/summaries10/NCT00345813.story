(thirdQuint)Soy Supplements in Treating Patients Undergoing Surgery for Localized Prostate Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the effect of dietary supplementation with soy vs placebo on biomarkers of cell cycle regulation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and signaling pathways in patients with localized prostate cancer scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy.

 Secondary - Compare the toxicity and side effects of these regimens in these patients.

 - Compare the dietary patterns of these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a prospective, randomized study.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive oral soy supplementation daily for 4 weeks.

 - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo supplementation daily for 4 weeks.

 Patients undergo radical prostatectomy within 21 days after completion of soy or placebo supplementation.

 Blood and tissue samples are collected for biomarker analysis using immunohistochemistry.
