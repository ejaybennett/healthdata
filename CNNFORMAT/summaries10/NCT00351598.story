(thirdQuint)Lung Tumour Volume Database.

 Patients with locoregional non small cell lung cancer are registered on study after tumour volumes are outlined by a radiologist and prior to the commencement of any treatment.

 All patients must have recorded the volume of disease in the primary tumour (and of involved nodes > 1 cm diameter) as measured from a CT scan performed according to a standard set of conditions.

 Following registration patients are treated with Definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.

 Follow-up will occur with the collection of a minimum amount of data every 12 months from the date of registration on study.

 Quality Assurance procedures will be implemented with each site that participates in the study.

 Lung Tumour Volume Database@highlight

The main aim is to determine, in patients with locoregional, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated by definitive radiotherapy, the influence on survival of the volume of primary tumour, as measured from CT imaging, after adjusting for the effect of the current TNM staging system and other known prognostic factors (especially ECOG performance and weight loss).
