(thirdQuint)Efficacy Study of the Addition of Bemiparin to Icodextrin Solution in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients (Bemidextrina).

 Peritoneal dysfunction is a common complication in patients in stable treatment with peritoneal dialysis.

 This peritoneal dysfunction is defined by an elevated creatinine transport and lowered standardized ultrafiltration capacity.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the addition of bemiparin to icodextrin solution in patients in peritoneal dialysis with peritoneal transport disorders.

 The eligible patients are randomly assigned to receive the icodextrin solution with bemiparin or icodextrin solution without bemiparin.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether addition of bemiparin, once daily in icodextrin solution for peritoneal dialysis for 16 weeks, increases the peritoneal capacity for ultrafiltration and/or reduces creatinine transport in peritoneal dialysis patients presenting functional disorders related to ultrafiltration deficit and/or high transport.
