(secondQuint)An OCT-Guided Variable Dosing Regimen With Ranibizumab for the Treatment of Neovascular AMD.

 In this 2-year open-label, prospective, single-center, uncontrolled, investigator sponsored clinical study, neovascular AMD patients with subfoveal CNV (N=40) and a central retinal thickness of at least 300 mu m as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were enrolled to receive 3 consecutive monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (0.

5 mg).

 Thereafter, retreatment with ranibizumab was performed if one of the following changes were observed between visits: a loss of 5 letters in conjunction with fluid in the macula as detected by OCT, an increase in OCT central retinal thickness of at least 100 1/2m, new onset classic CNV, new macular hemorrhage, or persistent macular fluid following an injection of ranibizumab at the prior study visit.
