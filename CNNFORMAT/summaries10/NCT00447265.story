(fifthQuint)Etanercept for the Treatment of Lupus Nephritis.

 Kidney problems associated with lupus nephritis range from asymptomatic protein in the urine to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, leading to end-stage renal disease.

 The goal of therapies is to control kidney manifestations in order to avoid kidney failure, the occurrence of other medical problems and death.

 The treatment of lupus nephritis remains problematic.

 Despite the use of currently available therapies, patients experience disease relapse.

 Over time, patients develop significant morbidity from the disease as well as from medications used for treatment.

 Etanercept, a TNF inhibitor, is proposed as a potential treatment for lupus nephritis.

 TNF increases the number of reactive B and T cells.

 TNF levels can be elevated in lupus.

 Etanercept is believed to work by blocking inflammation, and it is hoped that it will lessen the signs and symptoms of lupus-related kidney disease.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of etanercept compared to placebo in combination with standard therapy to treat individuals with mild or moderately active lupus nephritis.

 This study will last 1 year.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either etanercept or placebo in addition to their regular medications.

 Participants will self-administer 50 mg etanercept or placebo injections once a week.

 They will continue receiving their usual treatment with corticosteroids and either MMF, Mycophenolic Acid, or AZA.

 Treatment with study medication will occur for 24 weeks.

 There will be a screening visit followed by a randomization visit, where subjects will receive and learn how to administer the study drug.

 Subjects will come to the clinic for 9 study visits.

 A physical exam and blood and urine collection will occur at most study visits.

 Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire on their health at most study visits.

 Subjects will be contacted by phone 5 times during the 24-week period to assess for adverse events and worsening disease status.

 Etanercept for the Treatment of Lupus Nephritis@highlight

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystem, autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own normal tissues.

 This abnormal autoimmune response can result in damage to many parts of the body, including the skin, joints, lungs, heart, brain, intestines, and kidneys.

 Kidney problems occur in 60-75 % of lupus patients.

 The development of lupus-related kidney disease (called lupus nephritis) is associated with an overall worse prognosis.

 SLE is usually treated with drugs that try to block inflammation caused by the immune system.

 These treatments can create their own problems and they do not cure lupus.

 The drugs that are often used to treat lupus nephritis include prednisone (steroids), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), azathioprine (AZA or Imuran), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF or Cellcept).

 The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of etanercept compared to placebo in combination with standard of care to treat individuals with active lupus nephritis.
