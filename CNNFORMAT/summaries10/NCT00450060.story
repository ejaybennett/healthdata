(firstQuint)Juvenile Postlumbar Puncture Headache After Puncture With Needles With Quincke Tip or With Sprotte Tip.

 After lumbar puncture patients may develop complaints as position dependent headache, other headache or backache.

 Several though not all studies in adults showed that the frequency of complaints can be reduced by using non-traumatic Sprotte-design needles instead of cutting Quincke-design needles.

 In children and adolescents there are no comparable data published.

 In most pediatric hospitals in Germany Quincke needles are used.

 Comparison: Children and adolescents from 4 to 18 years of age who have to undergo a lumbar puncture are randomly attributed to puncture with Quincke needle or with Sprotte needle.

 During the following days headache (main criterium), position-dependent headache, backache, vomitus, and malaise are noted.

 Pain is measured with a visual analogue scale/faces scale.
