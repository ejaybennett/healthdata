(thirdQuint)Interferon Alfa and Interleukin-6 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Multiple Myeloma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent multiple myeloma treated with recombinant interferon alfa and recombinant interleukin-6.

 - Determine the safety and optimal dose of this regimen in these patients.

 - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

 - Determine the impact of this regimen on clonogenic growth of myeloma cells in serial in vitro assays.

 OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

 Patients receive recombinant interferon alfa subcutaneously (SC) once daily.

 Beginning 1 month later, patients also receive recombinant interleukin-6 SC once daily.

 Treatment continues for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Interferon Alfa and Interleukin-6 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Multiple Myeloma@highlight

RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.

 Interleukin-6 may stimulate the white blood cells to kill cancer cells.

 Giving interferon alfa together with interleukin-6 may kill more cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well giving interferon alfa together with interleukin-6 works in treating patients with recurrent multiple myeloma.
