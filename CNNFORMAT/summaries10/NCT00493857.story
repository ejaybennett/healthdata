(fifthQuint)Study of Nimotuzumab and Irinotecan in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

 The patient will receive nimotuzumab every 2 weeks plus irinotecan.

 Nimotuzumab will be given at a dose of 400 mg once every 2 weeks for 12 weeks.

 Irinotecan will be given at the same dose and schedule as the last dose and schedule given during the most recent pre-study irinotecan containing therapy.

 If the tumour does not show signs of further growth after 12 weeks of treatment, the patient will continue receiving nimotuzumab 400 mg every 2 weeks for up to 18 months or as long as they are getting a benefit from the drug.

 Study of Nimotuzumab and Irinotecan in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer@highlight

This study will determine if nimotuzumab provides a benefit in this type of cancer when given in combination with irinotecan.

 The study will test: - How long any good effects last.

 - How bad any side effects are.

 Objectives: Primary: The primary goal is to assess the Objective Response Rate (ORR) that the combination of irinotecan and nimotuzumab will produce in patients with irinotecan-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer Secondary: - To assess the incidence of Grade 2 or greater acneiform rash or infusion reaction, allergic reaction or anaphylactoid reaction AEs in patients with irinotecan-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer following weekly or 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedules; - To assess Progression-Free Survival (PFS), defined as time from date of randomization until date of disease progression (clinical or radiological) or death due to any cause, for the two nimotuzumab schedules; - To assess the rates and durations of Stable Disease (SD) following weekly or 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedules; - To assess the Time to Disease Progression (TTP) following weekly or 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedules; - To evaluate ORR in patients who are identified as having "primary" irinotecan resistance following weekly or 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedules; - To evaluate Overall Survival (OS) following weekly or 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedules; - To compare the two dosing schedules of nimotuzumab with respect to objective response rates and safety; - To evaluate the overall safety and toxicity profiles of these two dose regimens of nimotuzumab; - To evaluate trough levels and accumulation of nimotuzumab in serum of patients receiving the drug on weekly or 2-weekly regimens.
