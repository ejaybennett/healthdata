(fifthQuint)Use of TheraSphere Yttrium-90 Glass Microspheres for Primary and Metastatic Liver Tumors.

 This study will use angiographic administration of radioactive TheraSphere(R) Yttirum-90 microspheres into the hepatic artery, to treat 50 patients with primary or secondary cancer involving the liver.

 The study population are those who have failed standard therapies, have a majority of their cancer in the liver, have a good performance status and reasonable hepatic function.

 Outcomes being studied are response to treatment, survival and toxicity.
