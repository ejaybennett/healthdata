(fifthQuint)Blood Collection From Individuals With Lung Disease for Genetic Studies (Qatar).

 This protocol is designed to collect a small amount of blood for extraction of DNA (genetic material) for the study of the genetic basis of lung disease.

 The study population will include individuals with known lung diseases and controls without lung disease.

 Individuals in the study population will be individuals at the Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar (HMC), as well as other individuals recruited for this study.

 In this protocol, researchers will survey medical records of patients with chronic lung disease, in order to study the clinical characteristics of these individuals, and the researchers will collect blood to evaluate the genetic characteristics of individuals with chronic lung diseases including asthma, and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), pulmonary fibrosis, and lung cancer.

 The researchers will also collect blood samples of individuals without lung disease to serve as control.

 This protocol, to be carried out at Weill Cornell Medical College - Qatar and Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar, parallels a similar approved protocol IRB #0508008095, entitled, "Collection of Blood for Gene Expression/Genomic Studies in Individuals with Chronic Lung Diseases", ongoing at Weill Cornell Medical College - New York.

 Blood Collection From Individuals With Lung Disease for Genetic Studies (Qatar)@highlight

This is a research study where researchers are collecting blood to evaluate the genetic characteristics of individuals with chronic lung diseases, including asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and lung cancer.

 The investigators hope to be able to identify an association between a genetic make-up in the blood samples and the risks of developing a particular lung disease, or severity of a lung disease.

 The findings of this study might be important to develop future preventative methods and potential treatments for the management of lung disease.
