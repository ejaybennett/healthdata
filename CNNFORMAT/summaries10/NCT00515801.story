(secondQuint)Sulfonylurea Effects on Glucagon Regulation During Hypoglycemia in Type 1 DM.

 The glucagon response during insulin induced hypoglycemia and rate of glucose recovery will be monitored in 10 C-peptide positive and 10 C-Peptide negative patients with type 1 DM following the application of glibenclamide and placebo in a randomized, single-blind, cross-over study.

 Cognitive function during hypoglycemia with and without glibenclamide pretreatment will be a secondary outcome.

 Sulfonylurea Effects on Glucagon Regulation During Hypoglycemia in Type 1 DM@highlight

We aim to demonstrate that oral administration of glibenclamide stimulates pancreatic glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia in insulin-deficient (C-peptide negative) patients with type 1 diabetes when compared to type 1 diabetic patients with residual insulin secretion (C-peptide positive).
