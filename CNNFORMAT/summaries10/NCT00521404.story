(secondQuint)Open-label Study of CS1008 for Subjects With Untreated and Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer.

 Primary Objective: - To evaluate the efficacy of CS-1008 administered in combination with gemcitabine to chemotherapy naive subjects with unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer, based on the progression-free survival rate at 16 weeks.

 Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the efficacy of CS-1008 administered in combination with gemcitabine on overall progression-free survival rate, objective response rate, duration of response and overall survival.

 - To determine the pharmacokinetics of C-1008 and gemcitabine - To study potential biomarkers of CS-1008 activity - To evaluate the safety profile of CS-1008 when administered in combination with gemcitabine to chemotherapy naive subjects with unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
