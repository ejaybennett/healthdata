(fifthQuint)Clinical Trial of the Safety and Effectiveness of CHR-2797 With Erlotinib in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 Study Phase A: Maximum tolerated dose will be determined during Cycle 1.

 Tumor assessments will be made after Cycle 2 (56 days), although it is not mandatory for Phase A patients to have measurable disease.

 Patients who have satisfactory outcomes after Cycle 2 may continue treatment for up to a year with erlotinib 150 mg/day, and the dose of CHR-2797 they received in Study Phase A.

 Study Phase B: Patients will be treated with the dose of CHR-2797 selected in Study Phase A and 150mg/day erlotinib.

 Patients will receive 2 cycles of treatment (56 days) before efficacy assessment.

 Patients who have complete response, partial response, or stable disease are eligible to continue the study for up to a year until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 If a patient has complete response, partial response, or stable disease at the end of the 1-year study period and the Investigator believes that continuation treatment would be beneficial, the patient may continue to be treated at the dose of CHR-2797 under a separate protocol.

 Clinical Trial of the Safety and Effectiveness of CHR-2797 With Erlotinib in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

This is an open-label, multicenter, multiple-dose, Phase I-II study of CHR-2797 co-administered with erlotinib in patients with histologically or pathologically confirmed Stage IIIB (with pleural effusion), Stage IV, or recurrent metastatic NSCLC.

 Throughout this protocol, "study medication" includes both CHR-2797 and erlotinib.

 This study will involve 2 distinct study phases.

 Study Phase A will assess safety and determine the MTD of the combination of CHR-2797 and erlotinib.

 In addition, PK profiles for the combination of CHR-2797 and erlotinib will be evaluated.

 In Study Phase B, the dose chosen based on the maximum tolerated dose established in Study Phase A will be administered in a single-arm treatment design in order to evaluate the efficacy of co-administration of CHR-2797 and erlotinib.
