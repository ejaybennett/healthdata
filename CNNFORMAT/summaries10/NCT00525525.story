(fifthQuint)Study of Bevacizumab Plus Temodar and Tarceva in Patients With Glioblastoma or Gliosarcoma.

 Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma are treated with standard of care radiation and temozolomide, plus the addition of Bevacizumab and Tarceva.

 The dose of temozolomide, Bevacizumab and radiation are the same for all patients.

 Tarceva dose is based upon the use of enzyme inducing anti-epileptic agents.

 Tarceva is given daily; Bevacizumab is given every 2 weeks; radiation is for 6 weeks, and temozolomide is given daily during radiotherapy and then in the adjuvant setting, is given on a 5-day schedule every 28 days.

 Patients are followed for progression and survival.

 The measure of response is MR scanning every 2 months.

 Dose adjustments are based upon the specific toxicity of the agent in question which differs for each agent (Bevacizumab, temozolomide, or Tarceva).

 Patients are not randomized, but assigned to an arm based on use of anti-epileptic agents.

 Study of Bevacizumab Plus Temodar and Tarceva in Patients With Glioblastoma or Gliosarcoma@highlight

This is a phase II study of Bevacizumab plus Temodar and Tarceva in patients with non-progressive glioblastoma or gliosarcoma.

 Patients must have stable disease immediately following a standard course of up-front radiotherapy and Temodar.

 All patients will receive Bevacizumab, Temodar and Tarceva.

 A total of 60 patients will be enrolled.

 Our hypothesis is that the combination of Bevacizumab plus Temodar and Tarceva will increase survival over that seen in historical controls who have newly diagnosed, non-progressive glioblastoma or gliosarcoma following radiotherapy plus Temodar and use Temodar alone.
