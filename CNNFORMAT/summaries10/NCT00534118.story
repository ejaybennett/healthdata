(thirdQuint)Donor Lymphocyte Infusion in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Hematologic Cancer After Donor Stem Cell Transplant.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine if the complete response rate exceeds 10% in patients with recurrent or persistent hematologic malignancies treated with donor lymphocyte infusion.

 Secondary - Estimate the complete response rate in these patients.

 - Assess the toxicity of donor lymphocyte infusion in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive up to four donor lymphocyte infusions at least 1 month apart in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or uncontrolled graft-versus-host disease.

RATIONALE: Giving an infusion of donor lymphocytes may be able to kill cancer cells in patients with hematologic cancer that has come back after a donor stem cell transplant.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well donor lymphocyte infusion works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent hematologic cancer after donor stem cell transplant.
