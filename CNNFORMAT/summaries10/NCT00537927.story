(secondQuint)LACH-Trial: LAparoscopic Correction of Hernia.

 One of the complications in laparoscopic incisional / ventral hernia repair is postoperative pain.

 Method of fixation of the mesh in laparoscopic incisional / ventral hernia repair might influence the degree of this postoperative pain.

 Fixation of the mesh might also influence other outcome parameters such as return to preoperative activities, costs and recurrence rate.

 The study hypothesis is that there is no difference in postoperative pain when comparing three commonly used mesh fixation techniques in laparoscopic incisional / ventral hernia repair.
