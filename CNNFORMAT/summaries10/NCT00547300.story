 It is a multi-center, randomized, double blind (DB), active-control, parallel-group study, starting with a 4-week HCTZ run-in phase, followed by a 12-week DB treatment phase.

 Patients meeting the entry criteria at the end of run-in are randomized to one of two treatment groups, nebivolol or metoprolol ER.
