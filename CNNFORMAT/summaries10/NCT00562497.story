(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Prochymal Infusion in Combination With Corticosteroids for the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Acute GVHD.

 Subjects will be treated with a total of 6 infusions of investigational agent during the first 4 weeks of the study.

 Four infusions will be administered during the first two weeks (twice weekly), then two infusions administered during the next two weeks (once weekly).

 Subjects assigned to the active treatment group will receive Prochymal cent .

 Subjects assigned to the non active treatment group will receive placebo (excipient, less cells).

 It is recommended that all subjects receive all six infusions.

 The discontinuation of investigational agent is allowed for GVHD worsening with subsequent need for salvage therapy.

 All infusions must be given at least 3 days apart.

 Subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety until death, withdrawal or 90 study days after randomization, whichever occurs first.

 Study will be unblinded and data analyzed at Day 90 post 1st infusion (Day 0)following final subject enrollment.

 Subjects will be followed for safety for 12 months post 1st infusion (Day 0).

 Efficacy and Safety of Prochymal Infusion in Combination With Corticosteroids for the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Acute GVHD@highlight

This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety of Prochymal cent versus placebo in combination with corticosteroids as initial therapy for acute GVHD.

 Corticosteroids have been the primary therapy for patients with previously untreated acute GVHD and the historical published data define an expected 35% complete response (CR) at Day +28 using this therapy.
