(fifthQuint)Flexitouch Home Maintenance Therapy or Standard Home Maintenance Therapy in Treating Patients With Lower-Extremity Lymphedema Caused by Treatment for Cervical Cancer, Vulvar Cancer, or Endometrial Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I.

 Compare the effectiveness of the Flexitouch(R) System to standard home lymphedema therapy (Manual Lymphatic Drainage) in the management of lower-extremity lymphedema in women with a history of cervical, vulvar, or endometrial cancer.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: I.

 Compare the quality of life (QOL) and functional status between patients using the Flexitouch(R) System and those following standard home lymphedema treatment (Manual Lymphatic Drainage) programs in the management of lower-extremity lymphedema OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to site of cancer (cervical vs vulvar vs endometrial) and stage of lymphedema at diagnosis.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive standard home maintenance therapy and perform self-manual lymphatic drainage once daily for 60 minutes for 24 weeks.

 ARM II: Patients receive Flexitouch(R) home maintenance therapy once daily for 60 minutes for 24 weeks.

 Clinical staff measure patients' lower limb (both) volumes and patients complete quality of life questionnaires at baseline, every 8 weeks during treatment, and at completion of study treatment.

 Flexitouch Home Maintenance Therapy or Standard Home Maintenance Therapy in Treating Patients With Lower-Extremity Lymphedema Caused by Treatment for Cervical Cancer, Vulvar Cancer, or Endometrial Cancer@highlight

This randomized phase III trial is studying Flexitouch(R) home maintenance therapy to see how well it works compared with standard home maintenance therapy in treating patients with lower-extremity lymphedema caused by treatment for cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, or endometrial cancer.

 Flexitouch(R) home maintenance therapy may lessen lower-extremity lymphedema caused by treatment for gynecologic cancer.

 It is not yet known whether the Flexitouch(R) system is more effective than standard home maintenance therapy in treating lymphedema.
