(firstQuint)Carbon Dioxide Versus Air Insufflation in Oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD).

 To achieve a satisfactory examination of the GI tract it needs to be distended during endoscopic procedures.

 After the examinations many patients complain of abdominal pain and discomfort.

 This pain has been substantially reduced by substituting room air with CO2 in both colonoscopies and ERCPs.

 The use of CO2 during colonoscopy has become routine practice at many endoscopy centers.

 In our study we will test the hypothesis that abdominal pain after gastroscopies also can be reduced by substituting room air with CO2.
