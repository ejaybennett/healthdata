(fifthQuint)Bioavailability of Pepper Carotenoids in Humans.

 - list item one, Peppers Epidemiological data show that carotenoids and ss-C are health promoting when taken at physiologic levels in foods.

 However, human absorption and metabolism of carotenoids contained in various food matrices has not been studied well.

 It is important to investigate the characteristics of absorption and disposal kinetics after eating carotenoid rich foods in order to gain a basic understanding of the biological characteristics of lutein, zeaxanthin, and other carotenoids in food sources.

 We propose to evaluate bio absorption of pepper carotenoids in a 2-phase research study: phase 1 will utilize red bell-pepper and phase 2 will utilize non-pungent green jalapeno pepper.

 The pepper will be provided as a dish in a meal.

 We will feed 16 healthy man and women (50 - 70 y, females were at least one year post menopause), each with red pepper (phase 1) and/or green jalapeno pepper (phase 2) for ~ 4 days and donate blood samples up to 21 days.

 Volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of the following two phases: phase 1 and phase 2.

 The study will provide us the information on the bioavailability of pepper carotenoids.

 Bioavailability of Pepper Carotenoids in Humans@highlight

- list item one, Peppers We propose to evaluate bio absorption of pepper carotenoids in a red bell-pepper or non-pungent green jalapeno pepper.

 The pepper will be provided in a cooked dish.

 The specific aims of this study are: 1) to determine blood response kinetics of lutein following multiple doses of non-pungent green jalapeno pepper with meals.

 2) to determine blood response kinetics of zeaxanthin/capsanthin following multiple doses of red bell pepper with meals.

 We will feed 16 healthy man and women (50 - 65 y, females were at least one year post menopause), each cooked green jalapeno pepper or red pepper for 4 days and donate blood samples up to 21 days to determine blood response kinetics of xanthophylls following multiple doses of pepper dishes.
