(fifthQuint)Effectiveness of Standard Emergency Department Psychiatric Treatment Associated With Treatment Delivery by a Suicide Prevention Center.

 Very few studies have proved the effectiveness of treatment for suicide attempt patients.

 Our objective is to evaluate the addition of the resources of an existent suicide prevention centre to standard psychiatric treatment in the Emergency Department.

 Consecutive suicide attempt (self poisoning) patients in 2 Emergency departments (multicenter study) were included after standard psychiatric treatment and referral.

 After Written informed consent, psychological assessment (depression, suicide intent scale/SIS Beck Depression Inventory, Toronto Ale, Beck Hopelessness Sc, Audit, mini, PDQ 4) was carried out After randomisation, control patients were given an information card describing the Suicide Prevention Center (SPC); experimental patients had a first meeting with a psychologist of the SPC.

 The number of subjects included should be 405 per group.

 To verify the hypothesis of a decrease in suicidal behaviors in the experimental group, an evaluation of these behaviors was carried out every month during a two year follow-up The frequency of subsequent suicidal behavior will be monitored by the scrutiny of the Emergency Dept records.

 Death by suicide will be identified by the examination of information obtained from the national death statistics office (INSERM).
