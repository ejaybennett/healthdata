(thirdQuint)Randomized Trial of Vitamin B12 in Pregnant Indian Women.

 The incidence of poor fetal growth and adverse maternal and infant birth outcomes is quite high in India, and several lines of evidence suggest that maternal nutritional status may be an important factor.

 We have previously performed extensive evaluations of poor fetal and infant outcomes in other settings, and found that maternal micronutrient supplementation (B vitamins including vitamin B12, plus vitamins C and E) in HIV positive Tanzanian mothers decreased the risk of low birthweight ( mu g daily) in improving maternal B12 status.

 Secondary aims for this exploratory trial include maternal hemoglobin, maternal weight gain during pregnancy and infant birthweight.

 All women will receive standard of prenatal obstetric care, including routine supplementation with iron and folate.

 The study will be a collaborative effort between the Division of Nutrition, St John's Research Institute, Bangalore, India, and the Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, US.
