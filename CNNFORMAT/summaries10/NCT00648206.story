(thirdQuint)Testing Alcohol Only Samples for Drugs and Drugs Only Samples for Alcohol.

 There are 3 different possibilities for forensic analysis of suspected driving under the influence samples.

 Testing for alcohol or drugs only or testing for both alcohol and drugs.

 Often if the primary suspicion of the apprehending police officer is of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol then only laboratory analysis concerning that primary suspicion is requested.

 The study aims to provide information about those 'missed cases' where only analysis for drugs or alcohol is carried out.

 Traffic police samples from a 2 week period are to be screened for both drugs and alcohol, even if the primary suspicion is only one of these.

 The study is part of the EU-project DRUID.

 Altogether 13 European countries are participating in DRUID.

This study intends to supply information about the prevalence of psychoactive drugs and alcohol in suspected DUI samples which are suspected of only one of these rather than both drugs and alcohol.

 Police samples for suspected DUI samples that have been sent for alcohol analysis or drug analysis only will be screened for drugs and alcohol respectively.
