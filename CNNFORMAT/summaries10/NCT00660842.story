(secondQuint)Study Comparing Weekly Versus Every 3 Week Chemotherapy in Patients With Ovarian Cancer.

 The standard first-line treatment of ovarian cancer is combination chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, given every 3 weeks.

 Researchers are looking at new ways of giving chemotherapy to make it more tolerable and more effective.

 One way is by giving the chemotherapy more often in smaller doses.

 This approach can be associated with fewer or less troubling side effects.

 Some chemotherapy drugs such as paclitaxel have been shown to also be more active when given once a week rather than once every 3 week schedule.
