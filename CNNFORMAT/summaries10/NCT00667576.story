(secondQuint)Dose-response Study of Paricalcitol Injection in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients Receiving Hemodialysis.

 This multicenter, randomized, open-label trial consisted of 4 dose-adjustment regimens for paricalcitol injection (initial doses and dose adjustment ranges were 2 1 mu g, 2 2 mu g, 4 1 mu g, and 4 2 mu g) and 1 maxacalcitol regimen (initial dose and dose adjustment range was 5 mu g 2.

5 mu g or 10 mu g 2.

5 mu g) as a reference group.

 Subjects who met the inclusion criteria were randomized equally to 1 of the treatment groups with iPTH values at screening ( 500 pg/mL) as a dynamic allocation factor.

 Study drugs were administered 3 times weekly (every other day) from the venous end of the hemodialysis circuit just before completion of the dialysis session.

 The initial doses were continued for 2 weeks, followed by dose adjustments (increase, maintenance, decrease, suspension, or resumption) by 1 mu g or 2 mu g units for the paricalcitol groups and by 2.

5 mu g units for the maxacalcitol group based on iPTH, calcium (adjusted), and phosphorus values every 2 weeks.

 Subjects in the paricalcitol groups were to be suspended from treatment if their iPTH value decreased to 150 pg/mL).

 Dose-response Study of Paricalcitol Injection in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients Receiving Hemodialysis@highlight

The purpose of this study was to investigate the initial dose and dose adjustment range for paricalcitol injection in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis who have secondary hyperparathyroidism.
