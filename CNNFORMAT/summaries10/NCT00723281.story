(thirdQuint)Comparison of CT Angiography With Conventional Angiography and Intravascular Ultrasound in Heart Transplant Patients.

 Our hypothesis is that state of the art CT coronary angiography can be used to acquire data regarding the coronary arteries in the setting of heart transplant and be used to risk stratify patients with regards to the developments of transplant coronary artery disease.

 Specific Aim 1- To test the hypothesis that coronary CTA can accurately measure cross-sectional vessel wall area using conventional coronary angiography with intra-vascular ultrasound as the standard of reference.

 Specific Aim 2- To test the hypothesis that coronary CTA can accurately measure cross-sectional vessel wall thickness, vessel area and luminal area using conventional coronary angiography with intra-vascular ultrasound as the standard of reference.

 Secondary Aim - To asses the correlation of cross-sectional vessel wall area, vessel wall thickness, vessel area, luminal area and vessel wall index with global and regional left ventricular function using coronary CTA.

The overall goal of this study is to determine if non-invasive imaging with state of the art CT coronary angiography can be used to screen for transplant coronary artery disease in the setting of heart transplant.

 Our current protocol at UCSF for heart transplant patients involves screening with stress tests as well as coronary angiograms with intravascular ultrasound to assess the diameter of the lumen of the coronary arteries and to assess wall thickness.
