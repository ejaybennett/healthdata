(fifthQuint)Oral Cladribine in Early Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

 This will be a randomized, double blind, three-arm, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral cladribine versus placebo in the treatment of subjects who have sustained a first clinical demyelinating event within 75 days prior to the Screening.

 Subjects must have a minimum of 2 clinically silent lesions on the Screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

 The study will include a pre-study evaluation period (Screening period: between 10 and 28 days prior to the start of treatment with blinded study medication (oral cladribine or placebo).

 Depending upon the clinical course of their MS, subjects will then proceed from the ITP to either the Maintenance Treatment Period (with open-label interferon-beta treatment) or LTFU period (with either open-label low-dose cladribine or no additional treatment (if no progression to MS has been noted after the initial treatment period).

 The single primary endpoint for the overall study, which will be determined during the ITP, is time to conversion to MS (from randomization), according to the Poser criteria.

 For every subject, eligibility for study enrollment and entry into each of the study periods, and diagnosis of conversion to either McDonald MS or CDMS must be confirmed and approved by a Sponsor appointed study Adjudication Committee.

 Oral Cladribine in Early Multiple Sclerosis (MS)@highlight

A randomized, double-blind, clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of two doses of oral cladribine versus placebo in subjects who had a first clinical demyelinating event (clinically isolated syndrome).

 Subjects in either the cladribine or placebo group may also enter treatment periods with open-label interferon-beta or open-label cladribine depending upon the disease status.

 The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of two dosage regimens of oral cladribine versus placebo on the time to conversion to multiple sclerosis (MS) (from randomization) according to the Poser criteria in subjects with first clinical demyelinating event at high risk of converting to MS.
