(thirdQuint)A Study of Certain Prevail Implants Used for the Preservation of Crestal Bone in Short Fixed Bridge Cases.

.

 This is a prospective, randomized, longitudinal study in which qualified patients with partial edentulism will receive a short-fixed bridge restoration.

 Each implant site is randomized to receive either the Osseotite Certain Lateralized (test) or the Osseotite Certain Non-lateralized (control).

 All implants will receive a temporary prosthesis after two months of placement.

 Enrollment will include up to 20 patients (approximately 60 implants per center) at each participating study center.

 A Study of Certain Prevail Implants Used for the Preservation of Crestal Bone in Short Fixed Bridge Cases.

@highlight

This prospective, randomized study will evaluate the performance of the Osseotite Certain Prevail implant when compared to that of the non-lateralized version of the implant.

 Study (null) hypothesis: the crestal bone changes that take place after placement and loading of the Osseotite lateralized implants will be the same as for a similar but non-lateralized Osseotite Certain implant.
