(firstQuint)Stimulation of the Diaphragm in Patients With Severe Heart Failure Following Heart Surgery.

 Previous studies have shown that temporary stimulation of the diaphragm using an electrode to the phrenic nerve reduces electrical mechanical activation time (EMAT) and improves left ventricular function.

 This study examines whether patients with severe heart failure, who require permanent biventricular pacing after heart surgery, may benefit from an additional permanent electrode that stimulates the diaphragm.

 Heart function is assessed by echocardiography and acoustic cardiography (Audicor, Inovise Medical Inc.
