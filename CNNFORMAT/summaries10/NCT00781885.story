(fifthQuint)A Multi-Center, Open-Label, Multiple Dose, Dose Finding Study Exploring the Safety and Tolerability of Beraprost Sodium Modified Release in PAH Patients.

 This study is an international, open-label, multi-center, Phase II, multiple dose, dose-finding study to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of BPS-MR tablets in male and female patients with PAH.

 All patients will be receiving background therapy with either a phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) inhibitor, endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), or the combination of these two.

 The study is divided into two phases: 1.

 The Treatment Phase and 2.

 The Down-Titration Phase Screening will be conducted on an outpatient basis within 21 days prior to the Baseline visit.

 Patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria at the Baseline visit will enter the Treatment Phase and begin taking one BPS-MR tablet (60 mu g) b.

d.

 and escalating by one tablet b.

i.

d.

 each week to a maximum dose of 600 mu g (ten tablets) b.

i.

d.

 or until the patient reaches an intolerable dose.

 Patients who reach an intolerable dose will be instructed to continue treatment at the previous dose, which will be considered as their individual MTD.

 For example, if a patient attains a full week of six BPS-MR tablets b.

i.

d.

 (360 mu g) but is unable to tolerate seven tablets (420 mu g) then the patient will return to using six tablets of BPS-MR b.

i.

d.

 (360 mu g) for up to an additional week of treatment.

 In this scenario, BPS-MR 360 mu g b.

i.

d.

 is the patient's MTD.

 Patients who do not reach an intolerable dose and tolerate the full ten weeks of BPS-MR dosing will be considered to have their individual MTD as BPS-MR 600 mu g b.

i.

d.

 When patients reach their individual MTD (either at 10 weeks or earlier) they will return to the site 3-7 days after for an End of Treatment Phase assessment to be evaluated for safety and, optionally, a PK assessment.

 Subsequent to the End of Treatment Phase visit patients will be instructed to begin down-titration off of BPS-MR in weekly increments.

 However, patients may alternatively elect to continue taking BPS-MR at their MTD in a separate open-label extension study.
