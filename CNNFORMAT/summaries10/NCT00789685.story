(secondQuint)Safety, Tolerability and Preliminary Efficacy of FP-1201 in ALI and ARDS.

 Phase I/II.

 This was a phase I/II open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of FP-1201 (IFN -1a) in the treatment of patients with ALI and ARDS.

 The primary objective in the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of FP-1201 in patients with ALI/ARDS and to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the optimum tolerated dose (OTD) in patients likely to derive clinical benefit.

 The study consisted of a dose escalation phase to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and OTD followed by a separate cohort expansion phase in which the OTD was administered.
