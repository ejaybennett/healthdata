(fifthQuint)Trial of Ixabepilone in Patients With HER-2 Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer (HIT).

 Patients with measurable metastatic breast cancer that have been treated in the adjuvant or neo-adjuvant setting with chemotherapy will be considered for this study.

 Subjects must not have received cytotoxic chemotherapy for locally recurrent/metastatic disease.

 Patients who fulfil the eligibility criteria, and have signed inform consent for the trial will be centrally randomized by electronic means to one of two ixabepilone treatment arms.

 Stratification factors will include: time to recurrence from adjuvant treatment, calculated from the date of the last dose of adjuvant treatment to the date of relapse ( 1 year vs.

 > 1 year); and previous chemotherapy with taxane regimen in the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting (yes vs.

 no).

 Randomization will be balanced by site.

Treatment Protocol Arm A [standard once every three weeks schedule]:Ixabepilone [BMS-247550] will be administered on Day 1 (D1) every three weeks as a 3-hour infusion at a dose of 40 mg/m2.

 Arm B [weekly schedule]:Ixabepilone [BMS-247550] will be administered weekly for three weeks as a 3-hour infusion at a dose of 20 mg/m2, followed by one week-off.

Treatment can be continued until consent withdrawal by the patient, intolerable toxicity or documented disease progression.
