(firstQuint)A Study of Aflibercept Administered in Combination With Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in Patients With Advanced Carcinoma.

 The study will be conducted in two phases.

 In phase 1, patients with advanced cancer will receive different doses of aflibercept in combination with approved doses of pemetrexed and cisplatin.

 The objective of phase 1 is to determine the safest dose of the combined study medications.

 This dose will then be administered to patients with previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer in phase 2.

 The phase 2 portion of the study will determine if the combination is effective in treating non-small cell lung cancer.
