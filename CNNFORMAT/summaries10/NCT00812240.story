(firstQuint)A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Masitinib in Comparison to Imatinib in Patients With Gastro-Intestinal Stromal Tumour in First Line Medical Treatment.

 GISTs are uncommon visceral sarcomas that arise predominantly in the gastro-intestinal tract.

 Most GIST cells are positive for c-kit (CD117), a cell surface antigen corresponding to the Stem Cell Factor (SCF) receptor.

 The receptor has an intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) joined by a juxtamembrane domain.

 It is hypothesized that all malignant GIST cells harbor a mutation of c-kit, resulting in the activation of c-kit and cell division and tumour growth.

 Drugs that can selectively inhibit TKs are likely to be of benefit in GISTs.

 Masitinib (AB1010) is a TK inhibitor, selectively and effectively inhibiting c-kit.

 Imatinib is also a TK inhibitor indicated in the treatment of GIST.

 It might be associated with side effects and patients might develop a resistance to treatment over time.

 Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies, masitinib (AB1010) can be considered as a good candidate in the first line treatment of patients with GIST.

The objective of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib to imatinib in patients with gastro-intestinal stromal tumour (GIST) in first line medical treatment.
