(thirdQuint)Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Lovaza) for Second Generation Antipsychotic-Associated Hypertriglyceridemia.

 This is an open-label pilot study of omega-3 fatty acids (Lovaza) for hypertriglyceridemia in subjects who have been on an atypical (second generation) antipsychotic medication.

 Eligible subjects include men and women, ages 18-75, who have been taking an atypical antipsychotic for at least three months prior to enrollment.

 Atypical antipsychotics include: clozapine (Clozaril), olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), aripiprazole (Abilify), ziprasidone (Geodon), quetiapine (Seroquel), paliperidone (Invega), asenapine (Saphris), iloperidone (Fanapt), and lurasidone (Latuda).

 Eligible subjects must also have serum triglycerides >200 mg/dl or high cholesterol >250 mg/dl at baseline.

 Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Lovaza) for Second Generation Antipsychotic-Associated Hypertriglyceridemia@highlight

This is an open-label pilot study of omega-3 fatty acids (Lovaza) for hypertriglyceridemia in subjects who have been on an atypical (second-generation) antipsychotic medication.

 The investigators hypotheses are that patients who receive Lovaza will experience a significant decrease in triglycerides from baseline.

 Secondary hypotheses include: Patients will experience a significant decrease in total cholesterol, and Lovaza will be well tolerated.
