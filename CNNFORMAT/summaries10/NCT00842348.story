(thirdQuint)Study of Lanreotide Autogel 120 mg in Patients With Non-functioning Entero- Pancreatic Endocrine Tumour.

 While somatostatin analogue treatment is the primary medical therapy for patients with hormone related symptoms and is indicated for the treatment of hormone related symptoms in many international countries, there is no reference standard medical therapy for asymptomatic patients.

 A 96-week study (Study 2-55-52030-726 (726), NCT00353496) was conducted to investigate the effect of lanreotide Autogel on progression free survival (PFS) in patients with well or moderately differentiated nonfunctioning enteropancreatic NET.

 While Study 726 was ongoing, the sponsor considered that therapy with lanreotide Autogel should continue to be an option to patients with stable disease at the end of the 96-week treatment period.

 This extension study was therefore initiated (Study 2-55-52030-729 (729)) which investigated the long term safety of treatment with lanreotide Autogel and enabled investigators to continue to treat their patients who had stable disease, as well as to treat placebo patients who experienced disease progression during the initial 96-week study (Study 726).

The primary purpose of this extension study was to assess the long term safety of patients with nonfunctioning enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET), who were treated with open label lanreotide Autogel (120 mg every 28 days) and who participated in a previous study, 2-55-52030-726 (NCT00353496).
