(fifthQuint)Trial of Bendamustine, Lenalidomide and Rituximab in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).

 This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of bendamustine and lenalidomide (BL) and also bendamustine,lenalidomide, and rituximab (BLR) in relapsed/refractory CLL and relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas.

 Phase I dose escalation will be done independently for the CLL and NHL groups.

 In addition, the study will be conducted in 2 parts.

 In part I of the study, the maximum tolerated dose of bendamustine and lenalidomide will be determined independently for the CLL and NHL groups.

 In part II of the study, CLL and NHL subjects will be enrolled at the MTD of BL determined in Part I for CLL and NHL and all subjects will receive rituximab.

 Part II of the study will determine the MTD of BLT independently for the NHL and CLL groups.

 Trial of Bendamustine, Lenalidomide and Rituximab in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)@highlight

This study is for subjects with a B-cell lymphoid malignancy (lymphoma) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that has come back after or did not get better with previous treatment.

 The purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of lenalidomide that can be given together with bendamustine and rituximab.

 The study will also look what effects the combination of lenalidomide and bendamustine and the combination of lenalidomide, bendamustine and rituximab will have on patients and their disease.
