(firstQuint)Computer Aided Gap Balancing Improves Sagittal Stability and Outcomes for Cruciate-Retaining Total Knee Arthroplasty.

 The success of total knee arthroplasty depends on restoration of limb alignment, precise implant positioning and optimal gap balancing.

 The advent of computer aided surgery (CAS) has improved limb alignment and implant positioning.

 The objective of this study was to evaluate the functional outcome of computer aided soft tissue gap balancing in total knee arthroplasty.
