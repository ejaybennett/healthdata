(fifthQuint)Community Trial to Enhance Organ Donation.

 We propose a community-based randomized controlled trial involving 450 intervention and 450 control patrons visiting Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicle branches (OBMV) to obtain a driver's license.

 Interventions patrons will watch a 5-minute video prior to entering the OBMV.

 Study personnel will interview intervention and control patrons after they leave the OBMV to determine whether they signed an organ donor card.

 We will also determine the effect of the video intervention on willingness to donate organs while living.

 Community Trial to Enhance Organ Donation@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a 5-minute video intervention regarding organ donation and transplantation on increasing the number of organ donor cards signed in Northeastern Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (OBMV) branches and on willingness to donate organs while living.

 The investigators hypothesize that persons in the intervention group will sign more donor cards and be more willing to donate organs while living than persons in the control group.
