(fifthQuint)Iodine I 131 Ethiodized Oil in Preventing Recurrent Cancer in Patients Who Have Undergone Treatment for Liver Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine whether treatment with adjuvant intra-arterial iodine I 131 ethiodized oil reduces the percentage of tumor recurrence in patients with curatively treated hepatocellular carcinoma.

 Secondary - Evaluate the overall and recurrence-free survival of these patients.

 - Evaluate the deterioration of liver function in these patients.

 - Evaluate the toxicity of intra-arterial iodine I 131 ethiodized oil in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive an intra-arterial infusion of iodine I 131 ethiodized oil.

 - Arm II: Patients receive an intra-arterial infusion of unlabeled ethiodized oil.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

 Iodine I 131 Ethiodized Oil in Preventing Recurrent Cancer in Patients Who Have Undergone Treatment for Liver Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Iodine I 131 ethiodized oil may help prevent or delay the recurrence of cancer.

 It is not yet known whether iodine I 131 ethiodized oil is more effective than non-radiolabeled ethiodized oil in preventing recurrent cancer in patients who have undergone treatment for liver cancer.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying iodine I 131 ethiodized oil to see how well it works compared with non-radiolabeled ethiodized oil in preventing recurrent cancer in patients who have undergone treatment for liver cancer.
