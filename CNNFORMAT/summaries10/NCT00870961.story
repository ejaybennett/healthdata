(thirdQuint)Vitamin D Supplement in Preventing Colon Cancer in African Americans With Colon Polyps.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the accrual rate of African Americans with adenomatous polyps to a 6-month randomized intervention trial comprising supplementation with either cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) or placebo.

 - To determine the compliance rates in patients treated with these regimens.

 Secondary - To compare changes in pre- and post-treatment vitamin D levels in patients treated with these regimens.

 - To correlate vitamin D levels with vitamin D modifiers, such as levels of skin pigmentation, dietary vitamin D intake, and sun exposure in this patient population.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive oral cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) supplementation daily for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo supplementation daily for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients complete questionnaires about demographics, dietary vitamin D intake, personal history (e.

g.

, ancestry, alcohol and tobacco intake, occupation, height, and weight), medical history (e.

g.

, personal and family history of colorectal cancer and polyps), and ultraviolet radiation exposure.

 Blood samples are collected at baseline and at 6 months for correlative laboratory studies.

 Blood samples are analyzed for vitamin D levels by enzyme immunoassay.

 Patients also undergo assessment of skin pigmentation in sunprotected and sunexposed areas of skin by reflectance spectrometry at baseline.

 Vitamin D Supplement in Preventing Colon Cancer in African Americans With Colon Polyps@highlight

RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming.

 The use of vitamin D may keep colorectal cancer from forming in patients with colon polyps.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying a vitamin D supplement to see how well it works compared with a placebo in preventing colorectal cancer in African Americans with colon polyps.
