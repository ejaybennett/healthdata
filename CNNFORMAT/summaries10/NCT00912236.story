(secondQuint)Evaluation of High-Density Lipoprotein in Obesity Study.

 This study will determine if the protective function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is impaired in obese patients and will help to enhance cardiovascular risk prediction.

 Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) will be captured as a means of assessing early vascular changes associated with low HDL levels in obesity.

 A novel measurement for clinical correlation has also been introduced called carotid extra-medial thickness (cEMT) which will be compared to cIMT in this obese population.

 Evaluation of High-Density Lipoprotein in Obesity Study@highlight

Obesity is associated with an impaired functioning HDL (good cholesterol) resulting in an acceleration in the development of atherosclerosis.

 This study will evaluate HDL functionality in patients with BMI (Body Mass Index) 20 - 25 and BMI >30
