(fifthQuint)Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in Liver Metastasis (COLD 3).

 From July 2003 to May 2007, over 50 patients with liver metastases participated in two studies at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) designed to determine the safety of treating liver metastases with SBRT.

 These studies have shown that SBRT can be delivered safely to the majority of patients with liver metastases.

 The treated tumour was controlled (shrank or remained the same size) in 74% of patients at one year following treatment.

 The median survival of patients was 16 months (i.

e.

half of patients survived longer and half shorter than 16 months).

 This survival rate is better than that expected in patients whose tumours grew bigger even though they were treated with chemotherapy.

 Supportive care only (no treatment other than care to make you feel better) in these patients is associated with a median survival rate of 6-12 months.

 We expect that the benefits of SBRT in this study will be similar to those observed in our initial studies.

 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in Liver Metastasis (COLD 3)@highlight

This study is designed to see whether stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) can reduce tumour size, slow progression of the disease, prolong life and improve quality of life.

 SBRT is concentrated focused radiation therapy delivered very precisely to the liver tumour.

 Presently, the treatment for unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer is most often chemotherapy or novel targeted therapy.

 These treatments may improve survival, but not control the metastases permanently; so new treatments are needed to control metastases.

 It is hoped that knowledge obtained from this study will improve our ability to treat patients with liver tumours that cannot be treated with surgery and other methods, and that SBRT may prove to be a treatment that can lead to long-term and permanent control of liver tumours for some patients.
