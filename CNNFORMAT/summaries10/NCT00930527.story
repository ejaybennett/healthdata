(thirdQuint)Omega-3-Fatty Acid on Joint Symptoms Inducted by Aromatase Inhibitors.

 There are no data regarding the use of these supplements in other types of musculoskeletal pain and discomfort, namely AI induced joint pain and joint stiffness.

 Given the lack of effective treatments for AI induced joint pain/ stiffness and the safety and efficacy of omega 3 fatty acid for musculoskeletal pain, it is therefore reasonable to test the efficacy of these dietary supplements in a population of postmenopausal breast cancer patients who experience joint pain related to aromatase inhibitors.

 Since women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer require long term hormonal therapy, an important objective is minimizing long term side effects to enhance patient compliance and improve quality of life.
