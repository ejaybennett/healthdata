(firstQuint)Comparative Registry of the PROmus, ENdeavor and CYpher Drug Eluting Stents.

 Boston Scientific is developing the present PROENCY registry to collect real world data with the Promus cent Stent and to compare outcomes to the Cypher cent and Endeavor cent stents.

 All three stents have received CE Mark and are commonly used in Europe.

 All the data collected in this registry will be from patients treated according to the physician's choices, per Product Directions/Instructions for Use, per approved indications and per local standard of care.

 The results from this registry will provide an understanding of the use and outcomes associated with the Promus cent , the Endeavor cent and the Cypher cent stent systems in a real world setting.
