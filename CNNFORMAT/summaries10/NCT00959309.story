(fifthQuint)Media Use in Preschooler Study (MUPS).

 There have been no trials examining an intervention to decrease screen time in preschool children in the physician office setting.

 This setting is appealing for interventions directed to preschool children because of accessibility.

 In addition, other public health interventions implemented in a physician office setting, such as home safety advice, have been effective.

 The proposed study design will be a randomized controlled trial.

 The intervention group will receive the study intervention, which is a 15 minute session about the health impact of screen time in children and strategies to decrease screen time.

 The objective of this study is to determine if an office based intervention is effective in decreasing screen time (television, video viewing and playing video games) in preschool children.

Childhood obesity is an epidemic and increasing.

 There are very few effective treatments for obesity in children.

 Recent studies have shown an association between obesity and sedentary behaviors such as television, video viewing and playing video games ('screen time') in preschool aged children.

 A school based intervention to reduce screen time in older children has been effective in preventing obesity.

 The reduction of screen time may lead to the prevention of obesity and its complications in preschool children.
