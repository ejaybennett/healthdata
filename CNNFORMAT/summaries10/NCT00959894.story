(fifthQuint)Evaluating Once Daily Etravirine in Treatment-Naive Adults With HIV Infection.

 Participants: There will be approximately 80 HIV-1-infected men and women aged 18 years or older who have taken less than or equal to 10 days of prior antiretroviral therapy and have never taken etravirine, dapivirine (TMC120), or rilpivirine (TMC 278) in the main study.

 There will be approximately 40 subjects who enroll in the main study that will be in the metabolic sub-study and approximately 20 subjects (10 pre-menopausal women and 10 men) who enroll in the main study that will be in the genital secretions PK sub-study.

 Procedures (methods): For the main study subjects will take etravirine 400 mg once daily orally with fixed-dose tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada) one tablet once daily.

 For the genital secretions PK sub-study, genital secretion samples will be self-collected throughout the study except for the week 4 study visit where women will have the cervicovaginal sample at time 0 and at 24 hours collected by study staff.

 For the metabolic sub-study, waist measurements and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans will be performed at entry, week 24, and week 96, and 2-3 teaspoons of blood to check lipids, insulin, and glucose will be taken at entry and weeks 12, 24, 48, and 96.

 Evaluating Once Daily Etravirine in Treatment-Naive Adults With HIV Infection@highlight

The main study is a single arm, open-label, prospective study to assess antiretroviral activity and tolerability of etravirine (TMC-125) 400 mg once daily, given with fixed-dose tenofovir/emtricitabine, in treatment-naive HIV-1-infected men and women.

 There are also a genital secretions pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-study and a metabolic sub-study.

 The purpose of the genital secretions PK sub-study is to gain information about drug levels and HIV-1 RNA in genital secretions when subjects are taking etravirine.

 The purpose of the metabolic sub-study is to learn about the effects of etravirine on body composition, as well as lipid and glucose levels.
