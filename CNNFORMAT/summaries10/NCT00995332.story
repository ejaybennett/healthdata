(fifthQuint)Disease Stabilization in AML by Treatment With ATRA, Valproic Acid and Low-dose Cytarabine.

 Patients to be included: 1.

 Elderly patients (>60 years of age) or other patients unfit for conventional intensive chemotherapy with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

 2.

 Adult patients of any age (>18 years of age) with relapsed or resistant AML who cannot receive conventional therapy.

 Treatment: Valproic acid to be started on day 1 as continuous therapy until disease progression.

 ATRA administered from day 8 orally as 22.

5 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days, repeated every third month.

 Low-dose cytarabine 10 mg/m2 from day 14 and continued as daily injections for up to 10 days, repeated every third month.

 Supportive therapy is given according to the hospitals general guidelines.

 Followup: The first 2 days treatment in hospital, later regular out-patient treatment.

 Disease Stabilization in AML by Treatment With ATRA, Valproic Acid and Low-dose Cytarabine@highlight

Hypothesis: Combined treatment with valproic acid and ATRA can be used to achieve disease stabilization for a subset of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and this effect can be improved without serious toxicity by adding low-dose cytarabine to this treatment.

 Adult patients >18 years of age who can be included: Elderly patients who cannot achieve standard chemotherapy, patients with relapsed or resistant AML.

 Treatment: Combined therapy with: Valproic acid, continuous therapy until disease progression ATRA, oral therapy for 14 days every three months Low-dose cytarabine 10 mg/m2 up to 10 injections during week 2 and 3, repeated every 3 months.
