(thirdQuint)Study of Gemzar, Taxotere, and Xeloda (GTX) in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer (Stage IVB).

 This Phase II multicenter study is designed to determine the response rate to a biochemically synergistic regimen with Gemzar, Taxotere, and Xeloda in patients with Stage IVB metastatic pancreatic cancer.

 It will further determine the overall and one year survival rates, the diseasefree interval, and the toxicities for this regimen in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
