(thirdQuint)Phase I/II Trial of Sodium Stibogluconate in Myelodysplastic Syndrome.

 Patients receive sodium stibogluconate IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and 15-19.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients who respond to treatment may continue therapy until disease progression.

 Patients undergo bone marrow aspiration, biopsy, and peripheral blood sample collection periodically for correlative laboratory studies.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 8 weeks.

 The phase II portion of this trial was never conducted due to lack of funding.

 Phase I/II Trial of Sodium Stibogluconate in Myelodysplastic Syndrome@highlight

Sodium stibogluconate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 This was originally designed as a phase I/II trial studying the side effects of sodium stibogluconate and how well it works in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.

 Unfortunately, due to funding issues, the phase II portion was never conducted.
