(secondQuint)Evaluation of a Biofeedback-assisted Meditation Program as a Stress Management Tool for Hospital Nurses.

 Stress is a common problem with significant ramifications for health.

 This is especially true in the workplace and particularly true for nurses practicing in a hospital environment.

 A number of factors (e.

g.

 an aging population, the obesity epidemic, patients presenting with multi-system diseases, etc.

) have dramatically increased the demands on hospital nurses in the past decade.

 This increased stress has potential ramifications at a personal level (e.

g.

 increased risk of ill health) as well as an institutional (e.

g.

 higher staff turnover).

 Meditation has been shown to be an effective tool for stress management.

 A self-directed, computer-guided meditation training program that can be pursued independently may be particularly useful for hospital nurses where scheduling challenges may preclude the use of scheduled classes.

 Healing Rhythms cent is a computer program that teaches meditation and uses biofeedback (heart rate variability and galvanic skin response) to reinforce the training.
