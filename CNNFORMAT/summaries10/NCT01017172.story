(firstQuint)Safety and Immune Response to Adjuvanted A(H1N1)v Influenza Vaccine in HIV-1 Infected and Immunosuppressed Adult Patients.

 The efficacy of an adjuvanted A(H1N1)v influenza vaccine in HIV-infected and immunosuppressed patients is unknown.

 Therefore we aim to investigate the immunoresponse as assessed by a anti-hemagglutinin assay before, 21 days after the first and 21 days after the second vaccination.

 The safety of the vaccination will be recorded by a standardized questionaire.
