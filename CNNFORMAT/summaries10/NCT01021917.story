(thirdQuint)SUCCESS Tracking Study.

 Researchers desire to capture the behaviors and outcomes of those individuals who would enroll in these programs without the additional encouragement to be a participant in a research study.

 The study will employ an observational prospective design intended to introduce as little interference as possible with subjects' behaviors.

 This is in order to capture the pure effects of the weight-loss programs themselves, and to reduce the potentially confounding effects of merely participating in a research study.

 Subjects who have already committed to a weight-loss program (Medifast Direct, Take Shape For Life , or other) will be recruited to join this study, and will be asked to complete several questionnaires over a period of up to 6 1/3 years after enrollment.

 Questionnaires will measure information regarding anthropometrics, sociodemographics, and health & quality of life outcomes.

 The overall goal of this research is to be able to describe and compare the long-term dieting behaviors and outcomes among participants in Medifast Direct and Take Shape For Life programs in comparison with other dieters.
