 Results Among the 400 patients receiving curative treatment, five-year survival was 22.

8% (91 patients).

 Cytarabine consolidation dose was an independent determinant of survival (significant differences were found among the groups), whereas age, karyotype, induction protocol, French-American-British classification and etiology were not.

 In comparison with the very-high-dose group, the risk of death was 3.

 Conclusions Consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine appears to improve survival in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

 High-dose Cytarabine and Survival in AML@highlight

In adults with acute myeloid leukemia, especially those < 60 years of age, high-dose cytarabine consolidation therapy has been shown to influence survival, but the appropriate dose has not been defined.
