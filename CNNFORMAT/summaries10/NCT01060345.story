(secondQuint)A Pilot Study of Chemo-prevention of Green Tea in Women With Ductal Carcinoma in Situ.

 Many studies have shown that green tea may have anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects in cancer cells and animal models of breast cancer.

 Some studies have found that Asian women who drink many cups of green tea have lower rates of breast cancer.

 Green tea may have an effect on proliferative and inflammatory pathways.

 Women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) have been found to have inflammation in the breast tissue surrounding DCIS lesions.

 Inflammatory pathways are being studied for a possible link to cancer.

 This study is designed to evaluate changes in biomarkers of proliferation, inflammation, and angiogenesis in response to green tea intake.

 A Pilot Study of Chemo-prevention of Green Tea in Women With Ductal Carcinoma in Situ@highlight

The purpose of this study is to find molecular signs (biomarkers) to better understand the role of green tea as an anti-cancer and anti-inflammation agent in women with newly-diagnosed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
