(thirdQuint)Trial of Antimycobacterial Therapy in Sarcoidosis.

 Independent molecular and immunologic investigations strengthen the association between mycobacterial antigens and sarcoidosis pathogenesis.

 Molecular analysis of sarcoidosis granulomas reveals the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) DNA and proteins that are significantly absent from granulomatous controls.

 Mycobacterial DNA has been detected in cutaneous sarcoidosis lesions, in addition to systemic immune responses against mycobacterial antigens.

 Due to the association between sarcoidosis and mycobacterial antigens, we postulated that broad spectrum antimycobacterial therapy could lead to restoration of T cell function and clinical improvement of chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis lesions.

 We investigated the safety and efficacy of Concomitant Levofloxacin, Ethambutol, Azithromycin, and Rifampin (CLEAR) therapy among chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis subjects, with change in lesion diameter from baseline to completion of 8 weeks of therapy as the primary endpoint; we assessed for decreases in granuloma burden, if granulomas were evident upon histologic examination.

 Change in modified Sarcoidosis Activity Severity Index (SASI) was the secondary endpoint.

 Trial of Antimycobacterial Therapy in Sarcoidosis@highlight

Growing research from independent laboratories provide an association between mycobacteria and sarcoidosis.

 More recent immunologic and molecular studies demonstrate immune responses to mycobacteria virulence factors.

 The purpose of this study is to assess if administration of anti-mycobacterial drug therapy will aid in resolution of cutaneous sarcoidosis lesions.
