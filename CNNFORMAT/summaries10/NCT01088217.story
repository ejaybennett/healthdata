(fifthQuint)Role of Genetics in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).

 Familial Pulmonary Fibrosis (FPF) is a sub-category of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs).

 IIPs are progressive lung conditions, with limited treatment options and unknown etiology.

 Though the IIPs have been associated with both genetic risk factors and environmental exposures, the molecular mechanism underlying disease progression remain poorly understood.

 This investigation seeks to identify a group of genetic loci that play a role in the development of familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP) or FPF, where 2 or more cases of IIP are seen within a family.

 Role of Genetics in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate inherited genetic factors that play a role in the development of familial pulmonary fibrosis and to identify a group of genes that predispose individuals to develop pulmonary fibrosis.

 Finding the genes that cause pulmonary fibrosis is the first step at developing better methods for early diagnosis and improved treatment for pulmonary fibrosis.

 The overall hypothesis is that inherited genetic factors predispose individuals to develop pulmonary fibrosis.
