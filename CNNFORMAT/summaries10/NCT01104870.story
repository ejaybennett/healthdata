(thirdQuint)A Dose Response Study of UT-15C SR in Patients With Exercise-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension.

 Prospective, randomized, parallel group study with two periods: a 10 week, dose titration period, followed by a 2 week, dose maintenance period in patients with exercise-induced PH.

 The study population will be randomized into Dose Group 1, Dose Group 2, or an Individual Maximum Tolerated Dose (iMTD) of UT-15C SR by Week 10 and maintained through Week 12.

 Patients may be either currently receiving an approved oral background therapy for their PH (phosphodiesterase-5 [PDE-5] inhibitor, OR endothelin receptor antagonist [ERA]) (no dual background therapy), or not currently receiving therapy for PH.

 A Dose Response Study of UT-15C SR in Patients With Exercise-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension@highlight

This is a prospective, randomized, parallel group study to assess the hemodynamic effect of three different dose regimens of a sustained release (SR) tablet of UT-15C in patients with exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH), as measured by the change in peak total pulmonary resistance index (TPRI) during exercise from Baseline to Week 12.
