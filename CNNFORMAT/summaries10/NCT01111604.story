(secondQuint)A Study of IMC-1121B or IMC-18F1 in Colorectal Cancer.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer when treated with 1 of 3 modified FOLFOX-6 (folinic acid [FA] + fluorouracil [5-FU] + oxaliplatin [mFOLFOX-6])-based regimens, as second-line therapy.

 During 2010, there has been an identified shortage of injectable folinic acid (FA) in the United States.

 Levo-folinic acid (LFA) will be allowed as a substitute for FA in the mFOLFOX-6 chemotherapy regimen in circumstances in which FA is not available, to facilitate continuity of patient care.
