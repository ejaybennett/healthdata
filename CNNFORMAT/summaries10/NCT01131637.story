(firstQuint)Study of the Survival of Recombinant Human Neuregulin-1 in Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) Patients.

 The mortality of chronic heart failure patients remains high, in spite of recent treatment.

 RhNRG-1(recombinant human neuregulin-1)directly work on the cardiomyocyte and restored the normal structure and function of it.

 Both the preclinical trial and phase II clinical trail have confirmed that rhNRG-1 effectively enhance the heart function and reverse the remodeling of left ventricular in heart failure animals and humans.

 In this study, we will evaluate efficacy of rhNRG-1 in reducing the death rate of heart failure.
