(fifthQuint)VELCADE-Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (VTD) vs Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (TD) Incorporated Into Double Autotransplantation for Untreated Multiple Myeloma (MM).

 This prospective phase 3 trial is aimed at evaluating whether, in comparison with standard TD, addition of Velcade to TD increases rate of CR and nCR from 15% to 30%, respectively.

 For this purpose, symptomatic patients aged 18-65 years with previously untreated MM and quantifiable M-protein in serum or urine are randomized (1:1) to receive induction therapy comprising three 3-week cycles of Velcade 1.

3 mg/sqm, days 1, 4, 8, 11, thalidomide 100 mg, days 1-14, cycle 1, then 200 mg daily, and dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, or thalidomide and dexamethasone (same schedule and dosage as in VTD).

 Randomization to VTD or TD is stratified according to International Staging System disease stage at diagnosis.

 Following induction therapy, patients in both arms receive cyclophosphamide (4 g/sqm, day 0 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, 10 1/2cg/kg/day, from day +2) to collect autologous peripheral blood stem cells (minimum threshold CD34+ cells: 4 x 10^6/kg) and two subsequent courses of stem cell-supported high dose melphalan (200 mg/sqm), 3 to 6 months apart.

 Upon neutrophil (1 x 10^9/L) and platelet (75 x 10^9/L) recovery following the first autotransplantation, patients receive thalidomide (100 mg daily) and dexamethasone (40 mg, days 1-4 every 4 weeks) as bridge therapy until the day before the second transplantation.

 Patients initially randomized to receive VTD or TD induction therapy are planned to receive two 5-week cycles of VTD (Velcade 1.

3 mg/sqm, days 1, 8, 15, 22; thalidomide 100 mg daily; dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23) or TD (thalidomide 100 mg daily; dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1-4 and 20-23) as consolidation therapy, starting 3 months after last transplant.

 Maintenance therapy comprise dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1-4, repeated monthly until relapse or progression.

 VELCADE-Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (VTD) vs Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (TD) Incorporated Into Double Autotransplantation for Untreated Multiple Myeloma (MM)@highlight

Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (TD) is a standard induction therapy for Multiple Myeloma (MM).

 The present study is designed to compare TD with VELCADE-Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (VTD) as induction therapy in preparation for, and as consolidation after, melphalan-based double autologous stem cell transplantation for previously untreated patients aged 65 years with symptomatic MM.

 Primary study endpoint is the rate of complete response (CR) plus near-complete response (nCR) to induction treatment.

 Secondary endpoints include the rate of CR plus nCR to double transplantation and subsequent consolidation therapy, time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS),overall survival (OS) and toxicity profile of both VTD and TD.
