 Safety and Tolerability of NV1FGF in Patients With Severe Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease@highlight

The primary objective is to evaluate safety and tolerability of single and repeated administrations of escalating doses of NV1FGF administered intramuscularly in patients with severe Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease (PAOD), (Rutherford's Grade II, category 4 or Grade III, category 5 and 6).

 Secondary objectives are: - To determine the biological activity of NV1FGF on collateral artery development.

 - To evaluate the activity of NV1FGF on hemodynamic and clinical parameters.
