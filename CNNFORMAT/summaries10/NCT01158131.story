(fifthQuint)Diabetes Prevention in Women With a Recent History of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM).

 The landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) demonstrated that intensive lifestyle intervention in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) could reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes (Knowler, Barrett-Connor et al.

 2002).

 These findings were consistent, regardless of ethnicity, age, body mass index (BMI), gender (Knowler, Barrett-Connor et al.

 2002).

 However, the DPP lacks a specific focus on new mothers with a recent history of gestational diabetes despite their documented high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes.

 Although there are recommendations that all women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) receive postpartum testing for diabetes and type 2 diabetes risk reduction, study findings suggest that women with a recent history of GDM may be unaware of their risk for future diabetes, and also do not take steps to reduce their risks (Kim et al.

, 2007).

 The postpartum period is also a time when many changes occur in a woman's life, with competing responsibilities often altering sleep patterns, work schedules, eating patterns, exercise regularity, and time allocation (Walker, 1999; Swan et al.

, 2007).

 New mothers may have difficulties engaging in healthy lifestyle programs because of lack of time and energy, and because of competing work and family demands, including child care (Swan, Kilmartin, and Liaw, 2007).

 Modeled around the barriers identified in literature and gleaned from the focus groups and informant interviews of the preliminary study (2009p-000042), we have created a lifestyle/behavioral intervention that utilizes a modified DPP.

Many studies have shown that women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have an increased risk of developing diabetes later in life.

 The purpose of the study is to test whether a web-based lifestyle intervention program adapted from the NIH sponsored Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), modified specifically for women with a recent history of GDM, incorporating advice about diet and physical activity, delivered in the first 12 months after delivery will help women lose weight, improve overall health, and decrease their risk factors for type 2 diabetes.
