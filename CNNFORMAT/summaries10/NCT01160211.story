(secondQuint)A Study to Compare the Safety and Efficacy of an Aromatase Inhibitor in Combination With Lapatinib, Trastuzumab or Both for the Treatment of Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 This is a Phase III, randomized, open-label, multi-center, three arm study of lapatinib plus trastuzumab plus an aromatase inhibitor (AI), trastuzumab plus an AI, or lapatinib plus an AI to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these regimens as first- or second-line therapy in postmenopausal subjects with hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have received prior trastuzumab and endocrine therapies.

 Eligible subjects will be postmenopausal; have tumors that are ER and/or PgR positive and HER2-positive; have Stage IV metastatic breast cancer.

 The primary objective is to demonstrate superiority of lapatinib/trastuzumab/AI combination versus (vs.

) trastuzumab/AI combination for progression free survival.

 The secondary objectives are to evaluate progression free survival in trastuzumab/AI vs.

 lapatinib/AI and trastuzumab/lapatinib/AI vs.

 lapatinib/AI, overall survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, the safety and tolerability of all three treatment groups (lapatinib plus trastuzumab plus an AI, trastuzumab plus an AI, or lapatinib plus an AI), and quality of life status relative to baseline.
