(thirdQuint)Effectiveness of Tailored Activity Pacing for Symptomatic Osteoarthritis.

 In the United States, osteoarthritis is a growing public health issue and a leading cause of disability among older adults.

 Almost 50% of users of the Veterans Affairs (VA) system present with osteoarthritis.

 Veterans are a particularly important group to target for symptom management interventions as they are twice as likely as non-veterans to report chronic joint symptoms and activity limitations.

 There are few evidence-based symptom management interventions offered by health care professionals, such as occupational and physical therapists, at the time when people are seeking treatment for their symptoms.

 The proposed activity pacing intervention is individually-tailored to a person's symptom and activity patterns.

 This tailoring provides a personally-relevant and focused intervention that may help people adopt this strategy into their daily lives.

 Effectiveness of Tailored Activity Pacing for Symptomatic Osteoarthritis@highlight

The primary objective of this project is to examine effectiveness of a tailored pacing intervention on fatigue, pain, and physical function compared to general pacing intervention and usual care groups.

 A secondary objective is to evaluate the natural history of symptoms and physical disability over time among people with knee and hip osteoarthritis.
