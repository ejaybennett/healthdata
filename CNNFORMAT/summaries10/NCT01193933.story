(fifthQuint)Multicenter Clinical Trial for Adult Ph-negative ALL.

 Non-intensive But Non-iterruptive Treatment.

 1.

 The blast count in b/m after 7 days of prednisolone >25% was shown in 64% of patients.

 The substitution of prednisolone by dexamethasone did not influence survival.

 2.

 "no interruptions" induction was performed in 48% of patients.

 3.

 In 19% of patients the L-asparaginase therapy was stopped due to toxicity.

 4.

 Autologous stem cell transplantation was done in 20% of T-cell ALL patients.
