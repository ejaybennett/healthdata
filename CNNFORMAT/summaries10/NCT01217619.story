(secondQuint)Erlotinib as Neoadjuvant Treatment in Patients With Stage A N2 NSCLC With Activating EGFR Mutation.

.

 Screening phase: Patients clinically diagnosed as stage IIIA N2 lung caner by CT technique will be pathologically proven as NSCLC with N2 by EBUS.

 The pathology specimen will be detected EGFR mutation by DNA sequencing.

 The patients with EGFR mutation in exon 19 or 21 will be enrolled in this study.

 Neoadjuvant treatment phase: Patient will receive erlotinib 150mg/day.

 Treatment will be scheduled to continue for a total of 8 weeks or disease progression or unacceptable toxicities.

 Surgery treatment phase: Tumor response will be evaluated with CT scan after 8 weeks of induction treatment.

 The patients with responsive disease considered to be technique resectable will undergo resection.

 Post-surgery phase: It is the discretion of the investigator whether the patient is a candidate for post-operative treatment which is considered to be in the best interest of the patients.

 It is recommended that patients with positive margins or residual tumor after surgery should receive radiation therapy.

 Patients after surgery will receive long-term follow-up including chest CT scan every 3 months for up to 2 years.
