(firstQuint)Trial of Maintenance SU011248 Versus Placebo Post Chemotherapy Patients With Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma.

 The primary objective of this study is to compare the progression rate associated with SU011248 versus Placebo in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who have achieved at least stable disease following combination chemotherapy.

 Secondary objectives of the trial: We will explore the safety of SU011248, assess the objective response rate associated with SU011248 therapy in patients with stable disease after chemotherapy, and assess the median survival in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma treated with SU011248 or placebo following chemotherapy.

 Correlative objectives of trial: To correlate changes in VEGF and sVEGFR-2 levels with clinical response in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.

 Tertiary objective of trial: Determine response and progression rates to SU011248 in patients crossed over to treatment after placebo.
