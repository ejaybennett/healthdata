(secondQuint)The Effect of Chewing Gum on Small Bowel Transit Time.

 The subjects will include patients already referred to us for a capsule endoscopy (CE) in this unit.

 We have calculated how many patients we need from small bowel transit times from the last 100 patients who had a CE at our centre.

 We will include 122.

 These will be randomly divided into two groups.

 The patients (chew chewing gum) and the controls (do not chew chewing gum).

 The Effect of Chewing Gum on Small Bowel Transit Time@highlight

The purpose of this study is to see if chewing sugarless chewing gum alters the time it takes for a capsule endoscopy to travel through the stomach and small bowel, and to see if more/less capsule endoscopes reach the large bowel.
