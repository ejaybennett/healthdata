(firstQuint)Yellow Pea Fractions and Short-term Food Intake, Subjective Appetite and Glycemic Response.

 A within-subject, randomized study was conducted.

 Each subject returned 5 times, 1 week apart, and received 1 of the 5 treatments per week.

 The 5 treatments were tomato soup with 10 or 20 g of isolated yellow pea fibre or protein, or a control soup with no added pea fractions.

 Food intake was measured at an ad libitum pizza meal served 2 hours after treatment.

 Satiety and blood glucose (via finger prick) were measured throughout the treatment period.

 Yellow Pea Fractions and Short-term Food Intake, Subjective Appetite and Glycemic Response@highlight

It is hypothesized that yellow pea protein and fiber will reduce short-term food intake, subjective appetite and glycemic response.
