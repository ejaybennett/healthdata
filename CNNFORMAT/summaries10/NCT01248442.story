(fifthQuint)Immune and Metabolic Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation in Healthy Humans.

 This is a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial, with the aim to investigate the effect of a Vitamin D supplementation on parameters of the immune, endocrine and metabolic system in healthy humans without diabetes and obesity.

 The primary aim is to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation of the number and function of peripheral regulatory T-cells (Tregs).

 The investigators will measure the Tregs at baseline and monthly for 3 months.

 Furthermore the investigators assess additional immune cells from the adaptive immunosystem.

 Furthermore the investigators will perform a standard mixed meal tolerance test at baseline and 3 months following the supplementation in order to assess the insulin secretion in vivo.

In this placebo controlled study the investigators aim to investigate the effect of a 3 month vitamin D supplementation on parameters of the immune, endocrine and metabolic system in healthy women and men.

 Vitamin D.

 In a pilot study the investigators showed an increase of certain immune cells, which regulate immunotolerance, the investigators therefore try to confirm these results with a placebo group.

 Furthermore the investigators assess the effect of vitamin D on the glucose metabolism and hormone levels.
