(firstQuint)Yellow Pea Protein and Fibre and Short Term Food Intake.

 A within-subject, randomized study was conducted.

 Each subject returned 5 times, 1 week apart, and received 1 of the 5 treatments per week.

 The 5 treatments were tomato soup with 10 or 20 g of isolated yellow pea fibre or protein, or a control soup with no added pea fractions.

 Food intake was measured at an ad libitum pizza meal served 30 minutes after treatment.

 Satiety and blood glucose (via finger prick) were measured throughout the treatment period.
