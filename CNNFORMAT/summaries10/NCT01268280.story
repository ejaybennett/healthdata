(secondQuint)Pharmacodynamic Study of CK-2017357 in Patients With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis.

 This study is a Phase II, double-blind, randomized, three-way crossover, placebo-controlled, PD study of CK-2017357 in patients with generalized MG on standard therapy.

 36 to 78 patients will be randomized at approximately 15 study centers to one of six different treatment sequences.

 Each treatment sequence consists of three dosing periods in which patients receive single oral doses of placebo, 250 mg, and 500 mg of CK-2017357.

 All six treatment sequences will enroll 6 patients.

 A wash out period of at least 7 days (to a maximum of 10 days) will be employed between the individual doses for each patient.

 This study is designed to assess the effects of CK-2017357 on measures of muscle strength, muscle fatigue and pulmonary function utilizing the standardized Quantitative MG (QMG) score and Manual Muscle Test (MMT).

 The pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of CK-2017357 after two single doses will be assessed versus placebo, and the CK-2017357 concentration versus time data obtained in this study may be used to develop a population PK model to estimate intra- and inter-patient variability of PK parameters in patients with MG.

 Pharmacodynamic Study of CK-2017357 in Patients With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis@highlight

The primary objective of this early-stage clinical study is to demonstrate an effect of single doses of CK-2017357 on measures of skeletal muscle function and fatigability in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (MG).
