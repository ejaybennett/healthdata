(secondQuint)Immune Intervention With Rituximab to Preserve Beta Cell Function in Early Onset Type 1 Diabetes.

 Although the presence of autoantibodies is a diagnostic criterion, the immunopathogenesis of beta-cell destruction in type 1 diabetes is typically associated with T-lymphocyte autoimmunity.

 Many T-lymphocyte-mediated diseases include a B-lymphocyte component.

 B lymphocytes can play a crucial role as antigen-presenting cells, expressing high levels of class II major-histocompatibility-complex antigens and generating cryptic peptides to which T lymphocytes are not tolerant.

 B lymphocytes can be selectively depleted with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody.

 We will test the hypothesis that transient elimination of B lymphocytes with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody would decrease immune-mediated destruction of beta cells and result in preserved beta-cell function in patients with type 1 diabetes of recent onset.
