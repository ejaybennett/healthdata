(fifthQuint)Varenicline in Drug Treatment.

 Drinking alcohol and cigarette smoking are closely associated and use of one often leads to the use of the other.

 Also, since tobacco-related illness is the number one cause of death among recovered alcoholics it is imperative that we provide strong evidence-based treatment options for this population.

 Since smoking can be a strong trigger to drink in those who are dependent on both alcohol and tobacco, treating both at the same time may result in better treatment outcomes.

 This study will examine the efficacy of starting smoking cessation treatment while patients are in residential treatment for alcohol dependence, or outpatient in the Alcohol Research and Treatment Clinic.

 It will compare the effectiveness of varenicline, the most effective medication for smoking cessation with placebo.

 Both groups will receive weekly cessation counselling and support by a trained research analyst.

 We will measure abstinence from smoking at the end of the 12-week treatment period and again after 6-months to determine longer-term smoking cessation.

 Varenicline in Drug Treatment@highlight

The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of varenicline compared to placebo in tobacco dependent individuals who are undergoing concurrent treatment for alcohol dependence.

 As they will be inpatients and under 24 hour medical care for the first 21 days of treatment, or receiving outpatient treatment through the Alcohol Research and Treatment Clinic, this will allow for a comprehensive assessment of the safety of varenicline in this population with minimal risk of adverse consequences.

 The patients will continue their cessation treatment for an additional 10 weeks as outpatients through the Nicotine Dependence Clinic at CAMH.

 They will also be contacted at 6 months for follow-up.
