(thirdQuint)Foundations for Health.

 Young adulthood is recognized as a key time to focus on health promotion/disease prevention, as this time is when young individuals begin to transition to independence and thus are adopting health behaviors that will be carried into later adulthood.

 Unfortunately, this time period is often marked by decreases in physical activity and dietary quality.

 Working with young adults as they establish their first independent living situation can help set the foundation for behaviors that may aid with lifelong weight management and chronic disease prevention.

 Foundations for Health is the first study to examine the effect of a web-based lifestyle modification program in combination with culinary skills or lifestyle skills training sessions on weight loss, dietary intake, and meal preparation behaviors using a reduced energy dense diet in young adults with a family history of diabetes.

 Foundations for Health will provide a 12-week weight loss intervention for overweight and obese young adults, aged 18 to 35 years.

 Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1) a web-based behavioral intervention that decreases dietary energy density and increases physical activity; and 2) the same intervention combined with a hands-on culinary skills training program designed to increase food purchasing and meal self-preparation and consumption of meals low in energy density.

 The primary aims of this feasibility study are: 1) determine if the web-based plus culinary training condition has a greater increase in food purchasing, meal preparation/cooking behaviors, and intake of self-made meals; and a greater decrease in consumption of "convenience meals" than the web-based condition at 3 months; and 2) determine if the web-based plus culinary training condition has a greater decrease in dietary energy density and percent energy from fat and a greater increase in fruit and vegetable consumption than the web-based condition at 3 months.

Foundations for Health is a 12-week behavioral weight loss interventions primarily conducted via the internet aimed at helping overweight and obese young adults (ages 18-30) lose weight by increasing physical activity, decreasing the energy density of the diet, and increasing consumption of low energy dense self-made meals by providing culinary training skills.
