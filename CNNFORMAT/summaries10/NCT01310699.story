(secondQuint)Study of Flat Polyp Detection Using New Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) Compared to White Light Colonoscopy - The FIND FLAT Colonoscopy Study.

 Interval colorectal cancers diagnosed within a three year period following a clearing colonoscopy have been reported at a rate of 1 cancer/1000 person years.

The majority of these cancers are likely a consequence of a missed neoplastic lesion during routine colonoscopy.

 Recent tandem colonoscopy studies have shown no significant difference in adenoma miss or detection rates using narrow band imaging as compared to colonoscopy using white light.

 However, higher detection of flat neoplastic lesions using NBI was shown in a meta-analysis and should be furthered studied, especially considering that they are thought to be a strong contributor to a false negative colonoscopy.

 Study of Flat Polyp Detection Using New Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) Compared to White Light Colonoscopy - The FIND FLAT Colonoscopy Study@highlight

We hypothesize that high definition narrow band imaging (NBI) colonoscopy compared to high definition white light colonoscopy will detect an increased number of nonpolypoid (flat and depressed) colorectal neoplasm.
