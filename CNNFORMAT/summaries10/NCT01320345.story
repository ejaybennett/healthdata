(firstQuint)A Trial in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Evaluating the Effects of Fenofibrate Versus Placebo on Macular Thickness and Volume.

 Diabetes is the commonest cause of adult onset blindness.

 Vision loss, which is irreversible, is a most feared complication of diabetes.

 A blood fat lowering drug called fenofibrate, available in Australia, has been shown to reduce eye damage in people with Type 2 diabetes by 35-40%, and to prevent eye damage in Type 1 diabetic animal models.

 This study will evaluate the potential benefits of oral Fenofibrate 145mg once daily for 12 months in 300 adults with Type 1 diabetes mellitus who are at high risk of eye damage.
