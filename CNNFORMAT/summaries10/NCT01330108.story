(firstQuint)Safely Change From Bosentan to Ambrisentan in Pulmonary Hypertension.

 The therapy of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has been revolutionized with the development and subsequent instruction of oral endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA).

 The first approved ERA, bosentan (Tracleer, Actelion, Inc.

) is an effective drug widely used throughout the world in the therapy of PAH.

 Newer ERA's, with purported advantages over the first approved drug have since been tested and subsequently been approved for the therapy of PAH in the USA and other countries including ambrisentan (Letairis, Gilead Sciences, Inc.

).

 However, there is little data available on the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the elective change from oral bosentan to oral ambrisentan in PAH.
