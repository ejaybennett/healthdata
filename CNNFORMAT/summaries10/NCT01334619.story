(thirdQuint)Ropivacaine Volume for Ultrasound-guided Retrograde Infraclavicular Brachial Plexus Block.

 Thirty adults undergoing elective upper limb surgery received an US-guided retrograde infraclavicular block.

 The initial concentration of 0.

5% ropivacaine injected was 30 ml, which was subsequently varied at a ratio of 1: 1.

2 for each consecutive patient according to the response of the previous patient.

 The medium effective volume (EV50) was determined using the Dixon and Massey up-and-down method.

 The effective volume in 95% of patients (EV95) was calculated using probit regression.

 Ropivacaine Volume for Ultrasound-guided Retrograde Infraclavicular Brachial Plexus Block@highlight

The retrograde infraclavicular brachial plexus block has been proved an effective and safe approach.

 Realtime ultrasound guide will facilitate a successful peripheral nerve block.

 The purpose of this study was to determine the medium effective volume required to produce an effective retrograde infraclavicular block using an ultrasound (US)-guided technique.
