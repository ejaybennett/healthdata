(fifthQuint)Stress Reduction Training to Improve Sleep Quality, Stress Physiology & Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Markers.

 This study will be conducted among 200 men and women participating in 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) classes at Duke Integrative Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.

 The central hypothesis of this NIH-funded clinical trial (R00 AT004945, PI: Greeson) is that mindfulness meditation training is associated with increased levels of mindfulness and improved cognitive-emotional functioning that, together, are associated with reduced psychological distress, improved sleep quality, and less exaggerated physiological responses to emotional stress, including blood pressure and inflammation.

 This study is designed to examine psychological and biological mechanisms that may explain individual differences in MBSR outcomes.

 This knowledge is important because it will help us better understand who is most likely to benefit from mindfulness meditation training, and why.

 The results from this study are expected to elucidate mechanisms underlying the mental and physical health benefits of stress reduction, which can help guide clinicians in referring the most suitable patients to local MBSR programs.

 Stress Reduction Training to Improve Sleep Quality, Stress Physiology & Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Markers@highlight

The goal of this study is to better understand the potential value of reducing stress to ameliorate a cluster of biological and behavioral factors implicated in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

 These factors include psychological distress, poor sleep quality, and exaggerated physiological responses to emotional stress.

 Results will be used to develop an innovative brief intervention to reduce risk for CVD by improving sleep quality, ameliorating psychological distress, and attenuating stress physiology.
