(thirdQuint)Study of RAD001 for Treatment of NF2-related Vestibular Schwannoma.

 This protocol is a Phase II, open-label, efficacy and safety study of single-agent RAD001 in patients with NF2.

 During the study, subjects will receive continuous daily oral treatment with RAD001 for up to 1 year or until tumor progression.

 Primary Objective: To determine whether RAD001 has an effect on the VS growth in patients with NF2 at a rate sufficient to submit the drug for further testing.

 Secondary Objectives: To determine whether RAD001 has an effect on the volume of other intracranial tumors, and to assess the effect of RAD001 on hearing function in patients with NF2 (when applicable).
