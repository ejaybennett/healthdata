 Surveys used to conduct this study will be administered via telephone or online by InfoMedics, Inc.

, a company with a system for developing such patient-physician feedback programs.

 Participating physicians will ask their patients to participate in the program after Metanx(R) has been prescribed and provide them with a brochure containing an introduction to the program and instructions on how to enroll.

 Patients self-enroll, take a brief survey before starting their Metanx(R) prescription, and then two brief follow-up surveys at 6 weeks and 12 weeks.

 As patients complete surveys within the study, their physician will receive individualized feedback reports outlining their patient's treatment experience and progress.

 Patients will also receive a copy of their own reports, to help encourage them to continue taking Metanx(R) as directed.

 Patients will also receive educational materials about managing their diabetic neuropathy.
