(fifthQuint)MAGE-A3 Protein + AS15 as Consolidation for Multiple Myeloma Patients Undergoing Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation.

 Subjects were enrolled sequentially following confirmation of eligibility criteria, including International Staging System (ISS) stage 1, 2, or 3 multiple myeloma with MAGE-A3 tumor antigen expression.

 Subjects received a total of 8 immunizations with 300 mu g of recMAGE-A3 + AS15.

 The first immunization was administered approximately 6 to 15 weeks prior to auto-SCT (Day 0), with subsequent immunizations administered every 3 weeks ( 3 days) starting 10 days after auto-SCT (ie, Days 10, 31, 52, 73, and 94).

 Two additional immunizations were administered at 3-month intervals ( 7 days, ie, Days 180 and 270).

 No dose adjustments were allowed.

 Platelet counts must have been 50 x 10E9/L prior to immunization, with blood product transfusions permitted as necessary.

 The process for auto-SCT comprised the following: (1) up to 3 steady-state leukopheresis procedures to collect and freeze a sufficient quantity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), with the first leukopheresis performed 3 weeks ( 6 days) after the first immunization; (2) stem cell mobilization with cyclophosphamide, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and/or plerixafor; (3) high-dose melphalan (total dose 200 mg/m2) on Days -3 through -1; (4) auto-SCT on Day 0; and (5) re-infusion with thawed PBMCs on Day 3.

 MAGE-A3 Protein + AS15 as Consolidation for Multiple Myeloma Patients Undergoing Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation@highlight

This was an open-label, single-arm, pilot study of the recombinant MAGE-A3 protein plus the immunological adjuvant AS15 (recMAGE-A3 + AS15) in subjects with symptomatic multiple myeloma who had completed induction therapy with at least a Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria and who were eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT).

 The primary objective was to determine the safety and tolerability of immunizations when administered prior to stem cell mobilization and multiple times after stem cell reinfusion.

 Secondary objectives were to assess the humoral and cellular immunogenicity and clinical outcomes of immunization.
