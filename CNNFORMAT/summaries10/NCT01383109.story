(secondQuint)Human Mass Balance Study of Pyronaridine.

 This study will be a monocenter, open-label, non-placebo-controlled, single-group, single-dose study.

 Six subjects will receive a single dose of Pyronaridine 720 mg orally administered together with 14C-Pyronaridine (approx.

 100 mu g, 800 nCi (29600 Bq).

 Safety measurements (12-lead ECG, vital signs, blood chemistry and haematology) and adverse events will be monitored throughout the study.

 Subjects will come to the clinic the evening before the dosing of Pyronaridine.

 After the drug intake at day 1, subjects will have regular in-house periods for specimen collection up to 87 days after the drug administration Blood, faeces and urine will be collected during the hospitalisation periods.

 Samples will be analyzed for radioactivity by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS).

 Human Mass Balance Study of Pyronaridine@highlight

The combination of pyronaridine and artesunate is an antimalarial therapy in development.

 This Mass Balance study is intended to determine the rate and extent of excretion of total radioactivity in urine and faeces following administration of a single oral micro-dose of 14C-pyronaridine in humans.
