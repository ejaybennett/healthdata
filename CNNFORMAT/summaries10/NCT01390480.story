 This is a bicentric, randomized placebo controlled, double blind study, with the aim to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation in subjects with new onset of type 1 diabetes on immunological, endocrine and metabolic parameters.

 The primary study goal is to evaluate the influence of vitamin D supplementation on the number and function of the master regulatory T-cells under controlled conditions within 13 months.

 The secondary study goals are a comprehensive immune phenotyping to determine whether Vit D produces changes consistent with a general improvement in immune homeostasis that supports ss-cell tolerating interventions, the assessment of ss-cell function in all subjects to obtain preliminary data on the effects of Vit D on ss-cell survival.
