(thirdQuint)Study on the Possible Effects of Diet Supplementation With Essential Fatty Acids in Chocolate Craving Volunteers.

 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (of the omega 3 subtype) are fundamental in human diet, as they are components of cellular membranes, guaranteeing their fluidity and their functions of separating intracellular and extracellular means and transporting several substances to and from cellular microenvironment.

 Modern theories profess that lack of omega 3 fatty acids in western diets may be the cause of several deletery changes in neuronal physiology, which may cause or make worse several pathological conditions, such as depression, mood instability, and drug craving.

 The role of serotonin as the main lacking component in the conditions is well documented, and it is thought that omega 3 is important in the synthesis, transportation, and ultimately the activity of this neurotransmitter.

 Out theory states that supplementation with these acids can restore normal neuron balance, improving the condition of chocolate craving patients.

 Study on the Possible Effects of Diet Supplementation With Essential Fatty Acids in Chocolate Craving Volunteers@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether essential polyunsaturated acids (omega 3) are capable of reducing chocolate craving symptoms in healthy patients.

 Our hypothesis is that the omega 3 fatty acids have properties which stabilize and normalize neuronal functioning in many conditions, including chocolate craving.
