(secondQuint)Comparison of SureCALL Labor Monitor and Tocodynamometer Measurement in Preterm and Term Pregnant Women.

 The SureCALL(R) Labor Monitor(R) (SureCALL(R)) is a transabdominal electromyography monitor intended to measure uterine activity.

 It is intended for use on pregnant women, with singleton pregnancies, using surface electrodes on the maternal abdomen.

 The device is intended for use by healthcare professionals in a clinical setting.

 This measurement study was designed to evaluate the performance of SureCALL(R) Labor Monitor(R) (SureCALL(R)) compared to the predicate Tocodynamometer device (TOCO) in pregnant laboring preterm patients, nonlaboring preterm patients, and nonlaboring term patients.

 This study involved 25 women at a Gestational Age of 36 weeks or less and 5 women at a Gestation Age of greater than 36 at five clinical sites.

 Each study subject was instrumented with two technologies for measuring uterine activity: 1.

 Standard tocodynamometer attached to the maternal abdomen, 2.

 SureCALL(R) with a set of abdominal surface electrodes for uterine electromyography attached to the maternal abdomen Subjects did not recieve any interventions as a part of this study.
