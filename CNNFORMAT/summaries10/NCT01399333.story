(secondQuint)Comparison of Meal Replacements Versus Protein Supplements and Utilizing the Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) Method.

 The PDCAAS has been adopted by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the World Health Organization (WHO) and is currently recognized as the standard method to evaluate protein quality.

 This study will also examine patient tolerability, satiety, and satisfaction while using meal replacements versus protein supplements.

 This research study looks to gain knowledge on the varying qualities of protein and find the most effective protein supplement and/or meal replacement that provides increased patient compliance and promotes a healthy recovery.
