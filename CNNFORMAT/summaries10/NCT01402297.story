 Hydrogen Peroxide and Nitrite Reduction in Exhaled Breath Condensate of COPD Patients@highlight

The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of inhaled apocynin on ROS (reactive oxygen species) and NOS (reactive nitrogen species) synthesis in 13 COPD patients.

 Effects of nebulized apocynin (0.

5 mg/ml, 6 ml) were assessed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) after 30, 60 and 120 minutes.
