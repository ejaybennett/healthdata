(thirdQuint)Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Fluval AB-Like Flu Vaccines With 3.

5, 6, 9 or 15 g HA in Adult and Elderly People.

 Primary immunogenicity objectives - To assess immunogenicity of one 0.

5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection of four FLUVAL AB-like trivalent influenza vaccines containing either 3.

51/2gHA, 61/2gHA, 91/2gHA or 151/2gHA of seasonal A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B influenza antigens, as measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test 21 days after vaccination in compliance with the requirements of the current European Union recommendations as determined in CPMP/BWP/214/96.

 - To determine dose-effect relationship between one 0.

5 mL IM injection of four FLUVAL AB-like trivalent influenza vaccines containing either 3.

51/2gHA, 61/2gHA, 91/2gHA or 151/2gHA of seasonal A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B influenza antigens and immune response provoked 21 days after vaccination in terms of pre- and postimmunization HA titers as measured by HI test.

 Secondary immunogenicity objectives - To assess immunogenicity of one 0.

5 mL IM injection of four FLUVAL AB-like trivalent influenza vaccines containing either 3.

51/2gHA, 61/2gHA, 91/2gHA or 151/2gHA of seasonal A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B influenza antigens, as measured by HI test 14 days after vaccination in compliance with the requirements of the current European Union recommendations as determined in CPMP/BWP/214/96.
