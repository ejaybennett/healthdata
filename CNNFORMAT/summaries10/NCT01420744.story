(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of BT086 to Evaluate Adjunctive Therapy in sCAP.

 Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia (sCAP) is usually defined clinically as pneumonia acquired from outside the hospital (CAP) that requires intensive medical care.

 Mortality of (s)CAP patients admitted to ICU range from 35-58% depending on time and admission of the patient and has not much improved in the last years.

 BT086 contains a sufficient number of antibodies against the most frequent pathogens as well as antibodies against lipopolysaccharides and lipid A.

 Therefore, it can be assumed that administration of BT086 early in the clinical course of a severe infection such as sCAP may provide an effective adjunctive treatment to standard antibiotic therapy for sCAP patients.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether the adjunctive therapy to standard antibiotic treatment of BT086 is safe and effective of decreasing the days patients require endotracheal ventilation due to Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia (sCAP).
