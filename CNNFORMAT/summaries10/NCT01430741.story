(fifthQuint)MISSION-Vet HUD-VASH Implementation Study.

 This project tests an implementation platform-Getting To Outcomes (GTO)-designed to assist in the delivery of an evidence-based intervention for Veterans with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (MISSION-Vet) in the HUD-VASH program.

 This project will be a cluster randomized controlled trial that compares implementation of MISSION-Vet augmented by GTO to MISSION-Vet Implemented as Usual (IU) at three of the largest HUD-VASH programs in the country: VA Central Western Massachusetts Healthcare System (Northampton, MA), VA Capitol Health Care Network (Washington, D.

C.

), and VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (Denver, CO).

 This project will randomly assign 150 HUD-VASH case managers and 1106 Veterans on their caseloads who have received HUD-VASH vouchers and case management services into these two groups on a 1-year rolling admission basis determined by when the Veteran receives a housing voucher.

 The control group will receive MISSION-Vet in addition to HUD-VASH case management services and the intervention group will receive the same as the control, however the HUD-VASH case manager will have access to GTO implementation support.

 To compare case managers implementing MISSION-Vet augmented with GTO to HUD-VASH case managers using IU strategies on the following variables: (1) fidelity to the MISSION-Vet intervention; (2) proportion of time the Veteran is housed; (3) mental health, substance use, and functional outcomes among Veterans; and (4) factors key to the successful deployment of a new treatment as specified by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, & Maintenance (RE-AIM) model.

 Data will be collected on fidelity to MISSION-Vet in both IU and GTO groups.

 Data will also be collected on all subjects' substance use, overall mental health functioning, engagement in substance abuse treatment services, the length of time housed, and community participation.

 The investigators will collect data from individuals at baseline and three time points for up to one year.

 The investigators' data analysis strategy will be to use a repeated-measures model to test for the significance of the treatment-by-time interaction while accounting for the clustered design of case manager within site.

 This study intends to serve a dual function of comparing implementation of MISSION-Vet currently being planned through VA Office of Patient Care Services to an enhanced implementation approach using the GTO model.

 The proposed research will help to guide policy and practice actions to implement MISSION-Vet with fidelity and effectiveness to achieve maximum outcomes among homeless Veterans.

 MISSION-Vet HUD-VASH Implementation Study@highlight

A major goal for the Department of Veterans Affairs is to end Veteran homelessness by 2015.

 The VA's largest homelessness initiative is the joint Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) Supportive Housing program (HUD-VASH), which has been expanded greatly over recent years via the allocation of 30,000 Housing First vouchers between 2008 and 2010 and increased funding to hire 1,000 new program case managers.

 However, recent expansion has resulted in a number of implementation challenges including delays in the distribution of housing vouchers and dropout among program participants (25% of those housed in HUD-VASH drop out within a year).

 Much of this dropout can be attributed to untreated issues facing many Veterans enrolled in HUD-VASH.

 The most common among these untreated issues are mental health and substance use disorders.

 The presence of these disorders is due in large part to the fact that much of HUD-VASH case management focuses on housing placement and maintenance, with limited attention to mental health, substance abuse, and other related psychosocial issues, which when left untreated, negatively impacts voucher distribution and housing stability.

 This project will test an implementation model-Getting To Outcomes (GTO)-designed to assist in the delivery of an intervention for Veterans with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (MISSION-Vet) in the HUD-VASH program.

 The proposed study will compare implementation of MISSION-Vet currently being planned through VA Office of Patient Care Services to an enhanced approach using the GTO model.

 Thus, this project can contribute to ending all Veteran homelessness by 2015, a pledge made by President Obama.
