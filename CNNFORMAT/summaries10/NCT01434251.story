(secondQuint)Treatment of Hypotension of Prematurity (TOHOP).

 Rationale: Hypotension in the very preterm infant (gestational age [GA] 5 mmHg below GA in weeks for 30 minutes and/or they have indirect clinical or direct laboratory evidence of tissue hypoperfusion and/or end-organ dysfunction (i.

e.

 rScO2 is 6 mmol/L; and/or urine output <0.

6 mL/kg/hour).

 As CO2 is the most potent regulator of cerebral blood flow (CBF), it is understandable why changes in arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) has been associated with increased incidence of peri-intraventricular hemorrhage (PIVH) in preterm neonates with significant hypercapnia and with white matter injury (periventricular leukomalacia; PVL) in preterm neonates with hypocapnia during the immediate postnatal period.

 Therefore, in the present study, ventilation will be closely followed and PaCO2 values monitored and attempted to be kept within normal limits (40-to-50 mmHg) during the first three postnatal days to control for the potential impact of this confounding variable as far as the primary and secondary outcome measures are concerned (see below).

 Main study parameters/endpoints: To determine whether refraining (group B) from anti-hypotensive treatment has a negative, positive or no effect on the composite outcome of mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome (determined by BSID-III) at 24 months of age.

 Secondary outcome measures will include 1) differences between the groups in the incidence of PIVH during the first 7 postnatal days detected by head ultrasound, 2) differences in the incidence of white matter injury PVL and gray matter injury not detected within the first 7 days by ultrasound using advanced MRI parameters of the brain at the adjusted postmenstrual age of 40 weeks as well as the ability to maintain CBF autoregulation during the first three postnatal days.

 Treatment of Hypotension of Prematurity (TOHOP)@highlight

Hypotension in the very preterm infant (gestational age [GA] 6 mmol/L; and/or urine output 5mmHg lower than the current guideline.

 The investigators hypothesize that there will be no differences between the two groups concerning short and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.
