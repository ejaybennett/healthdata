(secondQuint)Safety and Tolerability Study of SNS01-T in Relapsed or Refractory B Cell Malignancies (Multiple Myeloma, B Cell Lymphoma, or Plasma Cell Leukemia (PCL).

 The main purpose is to test the safety and tolerability of SNS01-T.

 The first group of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, plasma cell leukemia or B cell lymphoma will be given a relatively low dose.

 If tolerated, a second group will receive a higher dose.

 If tolerated by the second group, a third and then a fourth group will receive higher doses.

 Treatment-related adverse events (side effects), changes in vital signs, physical examination, and laboratory values will be monitored.

 Patients will receive twice weekly infusions for 6 weeks and then will be followed monthly for 6 months.

 A secondary purpose is to explore whether SNS01-T is an effective treatment for multiple myeloma, B cell lymphoma and plasma cell leukemia.
