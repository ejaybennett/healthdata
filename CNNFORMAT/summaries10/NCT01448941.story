(firstQuint)Arthrodesis Versus Extra-articular Plate Fixation in Lisfranc Injury.

 We want to compare arthrodesis of TMT 1 to temporary bridge plating of TMT 1 in acute Lisfranc injuries where at least tarsometatarsal joints 1-3 are involved.

 We preform arthrodesis of TMT 2 and 3 in both groups.
