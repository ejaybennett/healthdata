(secondQuint)Endoscopic Treatment Alone Versus Combined Propranolol and Endoscopic Treatment of Acute Variceal Hemorrhage in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 Esophageal variceal bleeding is characteristic of high rebleeding rate and mortality.

 Thanks to the recent advance of treatment for variceal bleeding such as non-selective beta blocker (NSBB) added to endoscopic ligation further reduce rebleeding in cirrhotic patients, the rebleeding rate and mortality has a marked reduction.

 However, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a distinct group characteristic of very poor prognosis in patients with portal hypertension when compared to those of liver cirrhosis only.

 Therefore, the investigators design a study to randomize patients with HCC and acute variceal bleeding to endoscopic treatment alone and combination with endoscopic treatment and NSBB.

 This is the two years study.

 Endoscopic Treatment Alone Versus Combined Propranolol and Endoscopic Treatment of Acute Variceal Hemorrhage in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma@highlight

Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal varices bleeding were randomized to undergo endoscopic ligation alone (group A) and additive propranolol treatment (group B) after stabilization of their first acute bleeding.
