(firstQuint)Pharmacokinetics and Pharacodynamics of GW642444 in Paedetric Subjects.

 This study will investigate the effect of dosing with 25 1/2g GW642444, an orally inhaled long-acting agonist of the 2-adrenoceptor, in asthmatic subjects aged 5 to 11.

 GW642444 is currently under development as the long-acting beta-agonist component of a combination product containing an inhaled corticosteroid and a longacting beta-agonist.

 Subjects will receive a single dose via a novel dry powder inhaler, then 7 days once-daily repeat dosing following a washout period.

 The study will be a randomized two-way crossover, with a placebo control.

 Approximately 26 subjects will be recruited to this study, with the aim that 20 will complete the study.

 Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and glucose and potassium levels will be investigated.
