(thirdQuint)Haplo T-Cell Depleted Transplantation in High-Risk Sickle Cell Disease.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate host myeloimmunosuppressive conditioning followed by familial haploidentical T cell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with high risk Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).

 It is hypothesized that it will be safe and well tolerated, and result in sustained donor chimerism, acceptable engraftment and immune reconstitution.

 Also, that it will limit SCD related organ damage resulting in improved and/or stable neurological, neurocognitive, pulmonary and pulmonary vascular function and health related quality of life (QOL).

 Patients 2-20.

99 years of age with a diagnosis of high-risk SCD and with an unaffected HLA partially matched family donor and meeting eligibility criteria (inclusion and exclusion criteria) are eligible.

This study is being done to determine the safety and outcome (long-term control) of a high-dose chemotherapy regimen followed by an infusion of CD34 selected (immune cells) stem cells from a partially matched adult family member donor, called haploidentical stem cell transplantation, in high-risk sickle cell disease patients.
