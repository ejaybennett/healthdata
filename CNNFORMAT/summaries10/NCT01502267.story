(firstQuint)Desensitization Protocol for Highly Sensitized Patients on the Waiting List for Kidney Transplant.

 HLA sensitization is known to be the most important barrier to deceased donor kidney allocation.

 Therefore, the investigators need to develop better strategies for managing pre-sensitized patients using desensitization protocol.

 In this study the investigators will used two kinds of medication for the reduction of circulating antibodies (high dose IVIg, B cell depleting agents) to highly-sensitized patients who are on the waiting list for a deceased donor kidney transplantation.

 After desensitization, the investigators will check that this treatment can increase their chances of receiving a kidney transplant.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether high dose IVIG and B cell depleting agents can be used effectively in highly sensitized wait-listed patients.
