(thirdQuint)Effect of a Component of Fish Oil on Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction and Airway Inflammation in Asthma.

 Our research group has shown, on numerous occasions that fish oil has a markedly protective effect in suppressing airway inflammation and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in elite athletes and asthmatic individuals.

 Purified fish oil and the marine lipid fraction PCSO-524 cent (Lyprinol cent ) have both been used in supplementation studies in asthma [2, 10, 11].

 While fish oil is a rich source of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), Lyprinol(R) is a patented extract of stabilized lipids from the New Zealand green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus, combined with olive oil and vitamin E.

 EPA and DHA are the main ingredients of fish oil, and thus there will be similarities between Lyprinol and fish oil in terms of mechanism of action.

 Thus, we are aiming to show that Lyprinol(R) can modulate these inflammatory eicosanoids to exert anti-inflammatory effects.

 Effect of a Component of Fish Oil on Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction and Airway Inflammation in Asthma@highlight

The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate the effects of Lyprinol(R) supplementation on airway inflammation and the bronchoconstrictor response to dry air hyperpnea in individuals with asthma.

 The investigators hypothesize that Lyprinol(R) supplementation, compared to placebo, will significantly attenuate airway inflammation and hyperpnea-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic individuals.
