(secondQuint)The Oscillation for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Treated Early (OSCILLATE) Trial.

 High frequency oscillation is theoretically ideal for lung protection.

 Based on a strong physiological rationale, rapidly expanding use internationally, and promising results in early small RCTS, a definitive RCT to establish the impact of HFO versus current conventional ventilation on mortality is needed.

 We have completed a pilot multicentre RCT in preparation for this trial, with goals of investigating patient recruitment, protocol acceptance, and crossover rates.

 The pilot study met all objectives including recruitment that exceeded expectations (94 patients), and very good adherence to protocol.

 Results of the multinational OSCILLATE Trial will establish the impact of HFO versus conventional ventilation on mortality rates among adults with severe ARDS.

 The Oscillation for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Treated Early (OSCILLATE) Trial@highlight

What is the effect of early high frequency oscillation (HFO) versus a lung-protective conventional ventilation (CV) strategy (using HFO only as rescue therapy), on all-cause hospital mortality among patients with severe early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)?
