(fifthQuint)Assessing of Tooth Sensitivity Using Ibuprofen Before in Office-tooth Bleaching.

 Background: Ibuprofen has been recognized as anti-inflammatory and analgesic.

 The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of ibuprofen 400 mg on tooth sensitivity (TS) caused by in-office bleaching.

 Methods: A triple-blind, parallel design, randomized clinical trial will be conducted on 30 health adults who received either placebo or ibuprofen.

 The drugs will be administered 1 hour prior to the bleaching and a every eight hours during 48 hours.

 For bleaching used 35% hydrogen peroxide gel.

 The TS will be recorded for up and lower arc on two scales: VAS and 0-4.

 The shade evaluation will be performed before and 30 days after bleaching with visual shade guide and spectrophotometer.

 The % of patients that reported TS at least once during treatment and the TS intensity will be evaluated by Fisher`s and Mann-Whitney tests, respectively.

 The color changes will be evaluated by repeated measures ANOVA.

Ibuprofen has been recognized as anti-inflammatory and analgesic.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of ibuprofen 400 mg on tooth sensitivity (TS) caused by in-office bleaching.

 Methods: 30 health adults who received either placebo or ibuprofen.

 The drugs were administered 1 hour prior to the bleaching and will be prescribed 5 doses every 8 hours during 48 hours.

 For bleaching will be used 35% hydrogen peroxide gel.

 The tooth sensitivity will be recorded for up and lower arc on two scales: VAS (visual analogic scale) and 0-4.

 The shade evaluation will be performed before and 30 days after bleaching with visual shade guide and spectrophotometer.
