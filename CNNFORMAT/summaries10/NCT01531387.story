(fifthQuint)Sparing Conversion to Abnormal TCD (Transcranial Doppler) Elevation (SCATE).

 Results from previous studies confirm an increased risk of stroke among children with conditional TCD velocities.

 In addition, studies suggest that patients who were on observation alone, converted from conditional TCD (moderate risk category) to an abnormal TCD (with a much higher risk for primary stroke) within 30 months of initial identification of the conditional TCD velocity; this conversion led to initiation of chronic and indefinite transfusions in all cases.

 Preliminary data suggests that the risk of conversion to abnormal TCD velocities will be lower for subjects with conditional TCD velocities on hydroxyurea by at least three-fold.

 This important difference in conversion risk rate suggests that an alternative treatment could have a substantial and beneficial impact on patients with elevated TCD velocities.

 An alternative treatment could protect the brain of patients with SCA and conditional TCD velocities who are at increased risk for stroke.

 The avoidance of chronic blood transfusions would be a great benefit for all children with sickle cell disease, especially those in developing countries where the blood supply may be less safe (in comparison with that in the US) or unavailable, and very costly.

 Sparing Conversion to Abnormal TCD (Transcranial Doppler) Elevation (SCATE)@highlight

The primary goal of the Phase III SCATE trial is to compare 30 months of alternative therapy (hydroxyurea) to standard care (observation) in children with sickle cell anemia and conditional (170 - 199cm/sec) Transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities.

 For the alternative regimen (hydroxyurea) to be declared superior to the standard treatment regimen (observation), the hydroxyurea-treated group must have a three-fold reduction in the incidence of conversion to abnormal TCD velocities ( 200 cm/sec), compared to the standard treatment arm.
