(thirdQuint)Enhancing the Amount of Physical Activity Carried Out by Overweight Children at Leisure Time.

 Childhood overweight & obesity is the most common chronic disease in the western society.

 The prevalence of childhood obesity in Israel is among the highest in Europe.

 Recent data suggest that the recommended treatment for childhood obesity should be intense, multi-disciplinary intervention, including dietary, behavioral and physical activity components.

 Such a program exists at the Meir Medical Center in Israel for a few years with promising results.

 The program includes: physical activity(PA)exercise (twice a week/1h), dietary guidance, medical supervision and behavioral intervention.

 The participants are asked to enhance PA at their leisure time, and to report to their coaches.

 Yet, the amount of time they actually exercise is not controled by us.

 This study will include 3 groups of overweight& obese children: 1.

 Intervention with pedometers and supervision.

 2.

 Intervention with pedometer without supervision.

 3.

 Control.

 Obese and overweight children not taking part in a treatment program.

 Enhancing the Amount of Physical Activity Carried Out by Overweight Children at Leisure Time@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine if internet supervised by pedometer will contribute to enhance the amount of physical activity at leisure time by obese children.

 The investigators hypothesize that using pedometer will increase the amount of physical activity done by obese children in the afternoon and will improve the likelihood of success in the intervention program.
