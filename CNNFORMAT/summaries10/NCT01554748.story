(secondQuint)Improvement of Implant Survival in Total Joint Arthroplasty of the Trapeziometacarpal Joint.

 The study evaluates implant survival and clinical outcome in total joint arthroplasty of the TMC joint.

 Different implant designs are included in the study both cemented and uncemented implants.

 Also the influence of patient factors and surgical technique on implant survival is investigated.

 The primary outcome is implant migration and loosening.

 Evaluation is done by monitoring migration and loosening of different implant types using RSA evaluation of the implants.

 Secondary outcomes are patient reported function evaluated with the Disability of the arm, shoulder and hand score (DASH) and visual analog pain score (VAS).

 Tertiary outcome is range of movement (ROM) plus grip strength.
