(secondQuint)Effectiveness of Exercise Programs Following Total Hip and Knee Joint Arthroplasty.

 Rehabilitation program following total hip and knee joint arthroplasty typically focus on joint range of motion and muscle strengthening exercises.

 Although the balance ability of these patients tends to be reduced, leading to limitations in mobility and activities of daily living, clinicians often assume that strength and joint range of motion exercises will ultimately lead to improvement in balance, making the typical exercise programs appropriate.

 However, the feasibility and effectiveness of introducing balance specific exercises during the post-operative period is unclear.
