(secondQuint)Pupillometry and Pain Thresholds Patients Substituted by Methadone and Buprenorphine.

 Patients substituted since at least 3 months shall be included during a regular control visit.

 Each session shall consist in - check for toxics in urine sample; - measurement of pupil diameter; - measurement of mechanical punctuate pain threshold; - measurement of mechanical bone pain threshold.

 A first session shall be done at time of residual effect of the opiate.

 A second session shall be done at time of peak effect of the opiate.

 Pupillometry and Pain Thresholds Patients Substituted by Methadone and Buprenorphine@highlight

The purpose is to study the relation between pupillary diameter measured under scotopic conditions, and the pain thresholds measured at the time of peak and residual effect of methadone/buprenorphine in opiate-dependent patients following a substitution program.
