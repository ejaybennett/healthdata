(fifthQuint)Cardiovascular Effects of Aerosols in Residences Study.

 To address knowledge gaps about health risks of specific pollution sources and to provide new evidence on the health benefits of air pollution interventions, the objectives of this study are: 1) quantify the relationship between low-level exposures to combustion-derived PM air pollution and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease risk; and 2) compare the relative impact of HEPA filtration for two major PM sources (traffic and residential wood combustion) on these indicators.

 The use of HEPA filters may help to mitigate cardiovascular risks factors caused by combustion-derived air pollution (CDAP), (specifically woodstove and traffic emissions).

 We hypothesize that HEPA filter use and improved woodstove technology will help decrease indoor occurrences of CDAP.

 This project will help address knowledge gaps in CDAP-related health risks and benefits of interventions.

 Specific objectives include establishing a relationship between exposure to CDAP and biomarkers of cardiovascular risk and evaluating the impact of HEPA filter use towards improved indoor air quality and health indicators.

This study is focused on the effects of HEPA filtration to reduce exposures to combustion-derived air pollution (CDAP).

 Specifically, the study will evaluate the health benefits of HEPA filters and compare the cardiovascular toxicity of two major sources of CDAP, specifically traffic and residential wood combustion.

 Specifically, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of portable high efficiency particle air (HEPA) filters to reduce exposures to PM2.

5 and air pollution indoors and to improve subclinical indicators of microvascular function and systemic inflammation among healthy adult participants.

 The investigators hypothesize that HEPA filter use will help decrease indoor concentrations of CDAP thereby helping to mitigate the associated cardiovascular risks.
