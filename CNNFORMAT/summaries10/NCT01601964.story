(thirdQuint)Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Levels in Ectopic Pregnancy.

 This study is a prospective, observational, single-center study.

 Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board.

 This study will be completed with 30 patients with ectopic pregnancy.

 An intervenous cannula will be centrifuged for 15 minutes at 1000 g within 30 minutes of collection.

 Aliquots of plasma will be added to eppendorf tubes and stored at -20C.

 Plasma Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor levels will be measured using a Human VEGF-A Platinum ELISA kit (bioscience company, Catalog No: 00122, Santa Clara, California, USA).

 All assays will be performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.

 The test kit sensitivity is 2.

5 pg/ml.

 Intracycle variability is %4-6, intercycle variability is %8-10.
