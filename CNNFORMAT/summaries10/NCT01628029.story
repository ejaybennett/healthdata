(fifthQuint)Multimodal Therapy for the Treatment of Sleep Disturbance in Patients With Advanced Cancer.

 Counseling and Physical Activity: If you are found eligible and agree to take part, you will meet with a counselor.

 You will be asked to discuss your thoughts and feelings on different topics related to your well-being.

 The counseling session will last about 30 minutes and will be audiotaped for quality control.

 You will be given a watch to wear that records your body movements.

 This is called an actigraph.

 You should wear it all times, except in the shower or bathtub.

 On Day 15 (+/- 3 days), you will return the watch to the study staff and they will download information from it.

 Study Groups: You will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of dice) to 1 of 8 study groups.

 You will have an equal chance of being assigned to any group.

 You will have a 50% chance (like the flip of a coin) of receiving the placebo capsule or light therapy placebo.

 The skills learned during counseling will be different for each study group.

 The study staff will talk to you about your assigned skills.

 Neither you nor the medical study staff will know which group you are in.

 If needed for your safety, the medical staff will be able to find out which group you are in.

 Litebook: All patients will use a device called a Litebook to receive either the light therapy or the placebo light for 30 minutes within 2 hours of waking up.

 You will do this for 14 days.

 The placebo light is not designed to have any effect on your sleep.

 The Litebook is about the size of a deck of cards.

 To use the Litebook, you will place it on a table within 2 feet of you while you are sitting down.

 You do not need to look directly into the Litebook and you can do usual activities such as eating or reading while you are using it.

 The study staff will teach you how to use the Litebook.

 Study Diaries: You will complete the following diaries at the end of each day of the 14-day study period: - The patient diary about how much light you were exposed to using the Litebook.

 - The pill diary about your medication/placebo.

 It should take about 5 minutes each day to make entries in the study diaries.

 You will return the diaries to the study staff at the end of the study period.

 Study Drug/Placebo Administration: You will take the methylphenidate/placebo capsule by mouth with a cup (8 ounces) of water, 2 times each day.

 You must take both doses before 3 PM and wait at least 2 hours between doses.

 Methylphenidate may be taken without regards to meals and can be stored at room temperature.

 You will also receive a copy of the FDA-approved Medication Guide specific to methylphenidate.

 You will also take the Melatonin/placebo capsule by mouth with a cup (8 ounces) of water at bedtime.

 Study Visits: For all study visits/calls, you will be asked about any drugs you may be taking or any side effects you may be having.

 At home during the study, you will continue practicing skills from the counseling sessions and use the Litebook.

 You will be given a practice diary to record practice at home, which will be reviewed at each session.

 If not done at Screening, at Baseline (first visit): - Your medical history will be recorded.

 - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

 - You will be asked to complete the same 6 questionnaires from Screening.

 This should take about 30 minutes total.

 On Days 3, 8, and 15 (+/- 3 days) you will return to the clinic or be called on the phone if you are unable to return to the clinic in person: - You will be asked to complete a questionnaire that asks about any symptoms and/or side effects you may be having.

 This should take about 10 minutes.

 - You will be asked to complete 4 questionnaires.

 Each questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to complete, for a total of 20 minutes.

 The questionnaires ask about: - Your emotional and physical well being - Your level of fatigue - Any anxiety and/or depression you may be having - Any symptoms you may be having - On Days 8 and 15 only, you will have a counselling session with a counselor either in person or by phone.

 This should last about 30 minutes.

 - On Day 15 only, you will complete a questionnaire about your symptoms after starting study treatment.

 This should take less than 5 minutes.

 Length of Study Participation: You will take the study drug/placebo for up to 15 days (+/- 1 week) and will have a follow up visit at Day 29 (+/- 1 week).

 You will no longer be able to take the study drug/placebo if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, if you are unable to follow study directions, or if you cannot complete enough of the treatment combination as planned.

 Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed the follow-up visit.

 Follow-Up Visit: At Day 29 (+/- 1 week) after your last dose of study drug/placebo, you will return to the clinic for a follow-up visit.

 - You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.

 - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

 - Your performance status will be recorded.

 - If not done in the past 15 days, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - You will be asked to complete 5 questionnaires.

 Each questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to complete, for a total of 25 minutes.

 The questionnaires ask about: - Your emotional and physical well being - Your level of fatigue - Any anxiety and/or depression you may be having - Any symptoms you may be having If you are unable to return to the clinic for the follow-up visit, the research coordinator will call to ask about your health and you will complete the questionnaires over the phone.

 This call should last about 30 minutes.

 At Day 45 (+/- 5 days) or 30 days (+/- 5 days) you will receive a follow up telephone call or return for a follow up visit to assess for side effects of the treatments.

 This is an investigational study.

 Melatonin is an investigational drug.

 Melatonin is considered a food/nutritional supplement.

 The use of light therapy in patients with difficulty sleeping is investigational.

 It is currently being used for research purposes only.

 The combination of methylphenidate, melatonin, light therapy, and counselling for patients with difficulty sleeping is considered investigational.

 Up to 64 patients will take part in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

 Multimodal Therapy for the Treatment of Sleep Disturbance in Patients With Advanced Cancer@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the effects of different combinations of melatonin, supportive counseling, light therapy, and methylphenidate/placebo in patients with cancer having sleep problems.

 The safety of these treatment combinations will also be studied.

 Methylphenidate is designed to increase the activity of the central nervous system.

 Melatonin is a hormone that is made by the brain and may help in letting your body know when it is time to go to sleep and when it is time to wake up.

 A placebo is not a drug.

 It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any symptom, disease or illness.

 It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect.

 Light therapy is designed to help people sleep better.

 Supportive counseling is designed to help to control symptoms, fatigue, anxiety, depression, pain, and/or sleep disorders.

 The use of the therapies to treat sleep disturbance in combination is experimental.
