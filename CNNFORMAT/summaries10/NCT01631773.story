(secondQuint)A Comparison of microRNA Samples in Patients With Nasal Polyps and Aspirin Exacerbated Respiratory Disease and Those With Nasal Polyps Only.

 Nasal epithelial tissue will be collected from the inferior nasal turbinates of ten subjects with nasal polyps and AERD disease and from the inferior turbinates of ten subjects with nasal polyps but without AERD.

 A rhinoprobe cent will be used to collect this epithelial tissue.

 These samples will be analyzed by miRNA assay to determine if there is a difference in mircroRNA expression between the two subject groups.

 A Comparison of microRNA Samples in Patients With Nasal Polyps and Aspirin Exacerbated Respiratory Disease and Those With Nasal Polyps Only@highlight

We hypothesize that the miRNA expression in subjects with nasal polyps and Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) differs from the miRNA expressed in subjects with nasal polyps but without Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).
