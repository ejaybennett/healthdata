(fifthQuint)The Autonomic Nervous System State and Response to Different Stimuli Among Patients Post Stroke: A Follow-up Study.

 Subjects will be examined 3 times: a week 1 and 3 month post stroke.

 Control consist similar in description healthy subjects, will be examined once.

 Each test includes 24 hours Holter surveillance and an examine that include general check that reflects the autonomic reaction to different manipulation.

 The examination description: A.

 Prior to the examination subjects will be asked to fill the mRS, NIHSS forms.

 B.

 Subjects will receive an examination that includes - General neurological examination (strength, deep and superficial sensation, cognitive test and pain level.

) C.

 Holter will be place for 24 hours.

 And autonomic examination test will be conducted - Grip Test: emphases the sympathetic system.

 - Breathing Test: emphases the parasympathetic system.

 D.

 Manipulation to examine the two sub systems.

 Each manipulation lasts1 minute.

 The Autonomic Nervous System State and Response to Different Stimuli Among Patients Post Stroke: A Follow-up Study@highlight

The study describes the autonomic control system function in subjects post stroke in comparison with healthy subjects.

 Aims: To describe the Autonomic hart rate control system function in post stroke subjects in different rehabilitation levels in comparison with healthy subjects.

 To examine the reflective reaction of the autonomic control system as reflected in the heart rate variability to stimulations subjects in different rehabilitation levels in comparison with healthy subjects.

 To examine the autonomic control system reaction as reflected in the heart rate variability to physical and cognitive action subjects in different rehabilitation levels in comparison with healthy subjects.
