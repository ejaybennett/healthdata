(firstQuint)Pilot Functional Imaging Study to Evaluate Mechanisms Underlying Chronic Pain in Breast Cancer Patients.

 Women with breast cancer who either have chronic pain or who do not have chronic pain will be asked to enroll.

 Those who participate will have pictures taken of their brain using MRI when they are lying still and also when pressure is being applied to their thumbnails.

 These pictures will be compared to patients without breast cancer who do not have pain and to those who have other types of pain, such as fibromyalgia.

 By taking and analyzing these pictures the investigators hope to understand more about why breast cancer survivors develop pain after their diagnosis and treatment.

 In the future the investigators hope to better treat the pain or possibly even prevent the pain from occurring in the first place.
