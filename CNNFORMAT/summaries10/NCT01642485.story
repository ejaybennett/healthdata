(fifthQuint)Food and Insulin Effect on QT/QTC Interval of ECG.

 This study was initially performed in 24 healthy Caucasian and Japanese volunteers with an option to increase the sample size to up to 54 volunteers.

 The decision to increase the sample size to 32 was based on the standard deviation of the ECG intervals observed in the first 24 volunteers.

 This analysis was performed by an independent statistician under blinded conditions.

 Each volunteer participated in 2 periods.

 Each period consisted of 1 baseline day (D-1) followed by 3 study days (D1 - D3) when the various food effect and drug treatments or placebo were administered.

 All volunteers received all treatments.

 Moxifloxacin was always given on D3 to prevent any carryover effect and there was a minimum washout period of 3 days in between the 2 periods.

 How well the treatments (insulin/glucose, high carbohydrate breakfast, calorie reduced breakfast and moxifloxacin) were tolerated by the volunteers was assessed and any side effects noted.

 We compared the effects of the various treatments between Caucasian and Japanese volunteers.

 Moxifloxacin and placebo were given to volunteers by mouth, i.

e.

 they were asked to swallow them with water.

 The different types of breakfast were provided which volunteers were asked to eat.

 Insulin and glucose were administered intravenously (Insulin/glucose clamp).

 Hence, the study was performed as an open-label design.

 This study was conducted as a single site study at Richmond Pharmacology/ St George's University of London.

 Food and Insulin Effect on QT/QTC Interval of ECG@highlight

Moxifloxacin is routinely used as a probe to confirm assay sensitivity in thorough electrocardiogram (ECG) studies.

 It has been shown that a meal shortens the QT interval, which may affect pharmacokinetics (PK) and/or pharmacodynamics (PD) of the study drug.

 However, there is no published data clarifying this issue.

 There is also a paucity of data investigating ethnic differences of the effects of medicines on QTc.

 The aims of the study were to compare the effect of different food contents to placebo on the changes in ECG and to demonstrate the effect of insulin, C-peptide and glucose on the ECG.

 This was done by giving different treatments on separate days, which included intravenous insulin, a high carbohydrate breakfast [>70%], and a calorie reduced low carbohydrate American FDA standard breakfast.

 Moxifloxacin 400 mg was used as a positive control and was given with and without food to Caucasian and Japanese volunteers to investigate racial differences.
