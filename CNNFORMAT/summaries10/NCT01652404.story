(secondQuint)PROcalcitonin to SHORTen Antibiotics Duration in PEDiatricICU Patients (ProShort-Ped) Trial.

 In this study, the investigators aimed to design a multi-center trial addressing aforementioned flaws.

 The investigators will set stricter inclusion criteria, collect complete data on relapse or secondary infection, and include sufficient number of patients to show non-inferiority to conventional therapy by a delta margin of 10% [11].

 The investigators aimed to give conclusive evidence on whether serial PCT measurements can facilitate individual decision-making and shorten antibiotic treatment duration in patients with sepsis in the pediatric ICU.
