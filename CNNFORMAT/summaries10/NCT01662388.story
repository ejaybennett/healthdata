(thirdQuint)A Clinical Trial of Proximal Composite Restorations.

 A total of 188 premolar teeth with proximal cavity to be assigned on alternate basis in two groups.

 Intervention group teeth received Automatrix band after cavity preparation followed by the separation ring using clamp while the control group received Automatrix band alone.

 All teeth to be restored with P-60 composite restorative material(3M-ESPE Dental, USA).

 Outcome (proximal tightness) is determined by a blinded assessor just after the restoration.

 A Clinical Trial of Proximal Composite Restorations@highlight

Several techniques have been advocated to get good contacts in dental composite restorations including interdental separation ring.

 The investigators study focuses on using separation ring with circumferential matrix band instead of a sectional band.

 Moreover, the investigators have attempted to study proximal tightness and proximal contours of composite restoration as separate variables
