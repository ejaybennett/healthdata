(secondQuint)New Haven MOMS Partnership.

 The purpose of this project is to expand and enhance the New Haven Mental health Outreach for Mothers (MOMs) Coalition beyond pregnancy and depression to include a broader definition of mental illness (depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders), and a larger target population (low-income, racially and ethnically diverse, pregnant and parenting women) in the City of New Haven.

 Through this expansion, the Coalition will bring together the community of women, their families and advocates, healthcare providers, policy and agency leaders, and academics, to inform the development and conduct of public health approaches around the mental health of low-income, racially and ethnically diverse, pregnant and parenting women.

 The specific goals of this Phase I proposal are: 1.

 To conduct a community-led needs assessment on the mental health of low-income, ethnically and racially diverse pregnant and parenting women in the City of New Haven.

 2.

 To provide randomized intervention services to improve signs/symptoms of depression/stress/trauma among mothers living in public housing in New Haven, CT.
