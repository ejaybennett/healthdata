(fifthQuint)Clofarabine, Cyclophosphamide and Etoposide for Minimal Residual Disease Positive Acute Leukemia.

 Patients will be stratified at the time of enrollment based on diagnosis (ALL versus AML).

 Based on this two-stage optimal design, a maximum of 49 patients with ALL and a maximum of 49 patients with AML will be needed.

 For each disease cohort, 21 patients will be enrolled in stage 1.

 If at the end of stage 1, the criteria is met for activating stage 2 (based on success of clearing MRD, proceeding to transplant within 42 days and without excessive toxicity) for one or both groups, stage 2 will be activated with an additional 28 patients enrolled.

 Clofarabine, Cyclophosphamide and Etoposide for Minimal Residual Disease Positive Acute Leukemia@highlight

Study Design: This is a two-stage Phase II trial investigating the efficacy of Clofarabine, Cyclophosphamide and Etoposide in acute leukemia patients with detectable minimal residual disease (MRD) prior to allo-HCT.

 The primary objective is to determine the impact of the study treatment in eliminating the presence of minimal residual disease without causing a significant delay of allo-HCT due to treatment related toxicity.

 The intent of this study is to allow patients to proceed to transplant (independent of this study) within 42 days of Day 1 of Clofarabine based therapy.
