(firstQuint)An Assessment of the Feasibility and Safety of Conservative Oxygen Therapy in Critically Ill Patients.

 1.

 Identify patients likely to require ventilation until the day after tomorrow (a time frame of 36 hours of average) 2.

 Deliver a conservative oxygen therapy protocol while in ICU (a time frame on average of 10 days) 3.

 Target an oxygen saturation between 90 and 92% 4.

 Adjust FiO2 to achieve target SaO2 at all times 5.

 Assess percentage of time patient is within target 6.

 Assess for safety of this approach.
