(fifthQuint)Clinical Efficacy Study Comparing VisionScope Imaging (VSI) to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Injuries of the Knee.

 The primary objective of this study is to accumulate efficacy data on the VisionScope Imaging System (VSI) for pre-operative diagnoses when it is used to provide illumination and visualization of articular cavities.

 The study will analyze the VisionScope system's accuracy compared to MRI in diagnosing and confirming meniscus tears, chondral defects, loose bodies, minor arthritis, and/or any articular or capsular trauma.

 The hypothesis of the study is that the VisionScope System will be able to obtain direct visualization and diagnostic images of the intercapsular space without fluid distention in the knee.

 This study will provide feedback on the ability of the VisionScope system to potentially eliminate the need for MRI scans.

 Additionally, a cost-analysis comparison between the use of VSI vs.

 MRI for the diagnosis of orthopaedic knee injuries will be conducted.

 Finally, the study will help develop an algorithm of potential use for the VSI system in the management of knee pathologies.

 Clinical Efficacy Study Comparing VisionScope Imaging (VSI) to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Injuries of the Knee@highlight

The purpose of the study is to accumulate efficacy data on VisionScope Imaging (VSI) for pre-operative diagnosis of certain knee injuries (meniscal and articular cartilage injuries).

 The study will compare VSI's accuracy to MRI's in diagnosing the same injuries.

 The hypothesis is the VisionScope Imaging system will be able to provide direct visualization and diagnostic images of inside the joint capsule space without fluid distention in the knee.

 This study will provide valuable feedback on the ability of the VisionScope system to provide physicians with the information they need to make a definitive diagnosis.
