The proposed operations research study is designed to evaluate a package of family planning services and related behavior change interventions aimed at addressing the unmet need for family planning in postpartum women, integrated with an ongoing maternal and newborn health program, and to assess the program's impact (1) on knowledge of healthy fertility practices, (2) on contraceptive use prevalence in women during the postpartum period, (3) on postpartum birth spacing, and (4) to examine the feasibility and sustainability of the proposed integrated service delivery approach.

 The study will have a quasi-experimental design, with evaluation primarily through household surveys in four intervention unions and four comparison unions (unions are lowest local government entities with an average population of about 20,000) in rural Sylhet District, Bangladesh.
