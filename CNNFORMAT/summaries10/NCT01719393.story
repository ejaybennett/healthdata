(secondQuint)Pulse Spectrum Analysis in Adult Asthmatics: Correlation With Lung Function, Asthma Control Exhaled Nitric Oxide and Metabolites in Exhaled Breath Condensate.

 The microcirculation is directly involved in the cellular matabolism and homeostasis.

 Our hypothesis is that radial arterial pulse spectrum may reflect the airway condition in asthmatics.

 The aims of this study are to investigate the pulse spectrim of the radial artery in adult asthmatics, and evaluate its correlation with lung function, asthma control status,exhaled nitric oxide, and metabolites in the exhaed breath condensates.

 Pulse Spectrum Analysis in Adult Asthmatics: Correlation With Lung Function, Asthma Control Exhaled Nitric Oxide and Metabolites in Exhaled Breath Condensate@highlight

Our hypothesis is that radial arterial pulse may reflect the severity and airway function in asthmatics.

 The aims of this study are to investigate the pulse spectrim of the radial artery in adult asthmatics, and evaluate its correlation with airy inflammation an lung funtion in asthmatics.
