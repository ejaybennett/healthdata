(thirdQuint)Pilot Study to Assess the Efficacy of and Tolerance to a QUadruple Therapy to Treat HIV-HCV Coinfected Patients Previously Null Responders.

 The clinical trial is multi-center, national, Phase 2, open-label, single-arm.

 Primary objective is to estimate the Sustained Virological Response rate (SVR) 12 weeks after 24 weeks of treatment with quadruple therapy combining Asunaprevir, Daclatasvir, Ribavirin and Pegylated Interferon alpha-2a in HIV-HCV genotype 1 or 4 coinfected patients previously null responders to a Pegylated Interferon -Ribavirin standard regimen.

 Estimated enrolment is 65 patients during the enrolment period (9 months).

 The first 12 patients included will be on Raltegravir, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir and will participate to the pharmacological sub-study.

 Schedule of assessments: Evaluation of inclusion criteria: 4 to 8 weeks Anti-HCV treatment: 28 weeks (or shorter according to futility rules) Follow up: 24 weeks following the end of the treatment.

Evaluation of efficacy and tolerance to a QUadruple therapy with Asunaprevir , Daclatasvir, Ribavirin and pegylated Interferon alpha-2a, in HIV-HCV genotype 1 or 4 coinfected patients previously null responders to a standard Pegylated Interferon -Ribavirin regimen.

 The proportion of patients presenting cirrhosis (defined by a METAVIR F4 score on liver biopsy and/or with hepatic impulse elastometry 15 kPa) will be limited to 50% of all of the patients included
