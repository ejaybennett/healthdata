(secondQuint)Health Economic Assessment of Lower Extremity Diabetic (HEALED) Ulcers With PriMatrix.

 This study will be a multi-center, prospective, randomized single-blinded study evaluating the efficacy of PriMatrix MWT versus Standard of Care MWT in achieving complete wound closure of chronic diabetic foot ulcers by 12 weeks (84 days).

 To measure wound recidivism and changes in functional quality of life, each subject will complete the Cardiff Wound Impact Schedule and the SF-36v2 cent at three time points during the study i) at initial screening, ii) at completion of treatment phase, and iii)at 24 weeks (post-randomization).

 Additionally, the data obtained from the SF-36v2 cent will be used in an economic evaluation of the treatment arms.
