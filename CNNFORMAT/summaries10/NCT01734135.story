(thirdQuint)Provider Notification for High B-type Natriuretic Peptide Values.

 Rationale: B type natriuretic peptide is known to be elevated (> 100 pg/ml) in patients with heart failure.

 Furthermore, treatments are available to improve survival and reduce hospitalization if the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is < 40%.

 Accordingly, guidelines recommend an LVEF measure for patients with suspected heart failure.

 Prior work has demonstrated that patients with high BNP values do not always have a measure of left ventricular ejection.

 Hypothesis: A reminder to patients with BNP and no imaging may prompt providers to order appropriate imaging potentially leading to 1) identification of unsuspected depressed ejection fraction and 2) more appropriate treatment.

This proposal examines use of a clinical reminder to the primary provider of patient with a high B type natriuretic peptide but no prior imaging.
