(thirdQuint)Exercise Intervention and Dexterity in Parkinson.

 Motor symptoms in Parkinson frequently affect upper extremities.

 This has been associated in previous studies with limitation in the performance of activities of daily living and, consequently, with a decrease in quality of life.

 The possibility that a brief intervention improves eye-hand dexterity in Parkinson's, may be a therapeutic option to improve the performance of activities of daily living.

 The investigators also conducted an intervention based in proprioceptive exercises and balance tasks to improve functionality.
