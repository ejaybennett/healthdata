(fifthQuint)Improving Mood in Assisted Living Settings.

 Late-life depression is a large, escalating public health problem that often interacts with other health conditions and leads to spiraling disability that simultaneously threatens independence and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and increases health care costs.

 Depression affects 24% of older adults in AL settings, but rates of recognition and treatment are low and underscore the need for alternative depression prevention and treatment methods in AL.

 A novel and promising intervention is a computerized cognitive training program known as Road Tour, which has shown serendipitous benefits for reducing depression symptoms and the onset of suspected clinical depression consistent with Beck's model of cognitive depression.

 As a self-directed, user-friendly "game", Road Tour overcomes common attitudinal and resource-related barriers that impede treatment in AL settings, and holds considerable promise for interrupting the potential downward spiral of depression-related disability for 1 million AL elders.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Road Tour on processing speed, depressive symptoms and suspected clinical depression, and depression-related comorbidities among AL residents in Iowa.

 The investigators will use a two-arm, parallel, RCT comparing Road Tour training to attention control using computerized crossword puzzles among 370 adults 55 years old or older.

 The investigators will actively engage 15-30 AL settings and their associated facilities as study partners who implement the training at their sites and assist with the evaluation process.

 The investigators will help each AL setting develop AL-specific recruitment and enrollment protocols, educate AL staff about the study, and oversee computerized training by participating residents, as well as their family members and AL staff.

 The investigators' three specific aims are to: (1) establish the effect of Road Tour on improving cognitive processing speed in AL; (2) evaluate the effect of Road Tour on reducing depressive symptoms and the risk of onset of suspected clinical depression in AL; and, (3) evaluate the effect of Road Tour on the depression-related health outcomes of anxiety, pain, and HRQoL in AL.

 Participants will receive 10 hours of computerized training over 5-6 weeks, and 4 hours of booster training at months 5 and 11, for a total of 18 hours of training.

 Outcomes are changes in the Useful Field of View (UFOV) test for speed of processing (Aim 1), changes in the 12-item Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CESD-12) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms and suspected clinical depression (Aim 2), and changes in the Short Form 36-item Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Questionnaire (SF-36) for HRQoL, the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) for pain, and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) for anxiety (Aim 3).

 Data will be collected using telephone interviews at baseline, post-training (6-8 weeks), and at 26-weeks and 52-weeks.

 Linear mixed effect models that adjust for the clustering within AL settings will be used with main effects specified for treatment group and time, as well as their two-way interaction.

 This study is the first step in evaluating depression-related outcomes of using Road Tour in AL settings.

 Improving Mood in Assisted Living Settings@highlight

Late-life depression levels are escalating, and include 24% of all tenants of Assisted Living (AL) settings.

 A promising, novel intervention is a computerized visual speed of processing training program known as Road Tour.

 Road Tour has been show to reduce depressive symptom levels and the risk of onset of clinical depression in community dwelling older adults.

 The investigators hypothesize that similar benefits will accrue to residents in AL settings.

 To evaluate this the investigators will use a two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing Road Tour training to attention control using computerized crossword puzzles among 370 adults 55 years old or older who reside in 15-30 AL settings that are partnering with the investigators.

 The investigators hypothesize that Road Tour participants will have improved cognitive processing speed, lower levels of depressive symptoms, lower likelihood of the onset of clinical depression, less anxiety, lower levels of pain symptoms, and better health-related quality of life.

 These outcomes will be assessed at baseline, post-training, six months, and one year.
