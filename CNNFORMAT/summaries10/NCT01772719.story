(secondQuint)Overcoming Chemotherapy Resistance In Refractory Multiple Myeloma With Simvastatin and Zoledronic Acid.

 We hypothesize that the addition of simvastatin and zoledronic acid to bortezomib, thalidomide, melphalan or dexamethasone based regimens will decrease drug resistance when treating refractory multiple myeloma.

 We hypothesize that the addition of simvastatin and zoledronic acid will not increase the chemotherapy toxicity significantly and will be tolerable for patients.

 We believe simvastatin and zoledronic acid have antitumor properties and will contribute to reversal of resistance.

 Treatment will be significantly enhanced when these agents are combined.

The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of simvastatin and zoledronic acid on M-protein and/or free light chains when added to conventional chemotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients.
