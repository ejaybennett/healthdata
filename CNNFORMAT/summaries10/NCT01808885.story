(thirdQuint)Safety Study of Olesoxime in Patients With Stable Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Treated With Interferon Beta.

.

 The primary objective of this study is to characterize the general safety and tolerability of olesoxime (495 mg, od), compared to placebo when administered in combination with Interferon beta over a 24-week treatment period in patients with stable Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis.

 The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of multicenter protocols for measurement of neurodegeneration and remyelination by MRI as well as the plasma exposure to olesoxime (495 mg, od).

 MRI will be performed to all patients to assess effects of olesoxime on brain inflammation as well as to assess measures of brain atrophy, neuronal damage and myelination status at Baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks.

 Safety Study of Olesoxime in Patients With Stable Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Treated With Interferon Beta.

@highlight

This is a 24-week phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter safety study comparing the tolerance profile of olesoxime (495 mg, od) when administered on top of Interferon beta in patients with stable Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis.

 Patients will be randomly allocated to olesoxime (495 mg, od) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.
