(firstQuint)Chlorthalidone Compared to Hydrochlorothiazide on Endothelial Function.

 This is a randomized, double-blind, crossover study to evaluate chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide and their effects on endothelial function in hypertensive patients.

 Subjects will receive chlorthalidone 12.

5 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, and placebo each for 4 weeks with a 1 week washout between study periods.

 Sequence of study drugs will be randomized.

 Flow mediated vasodilatation will be measured at baseline and after each treatment period.
