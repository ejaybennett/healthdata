(firstQuint)Optimized Antiretroviral Therapy During Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in HIV-1 Individuals.

 Determine the feasibility of maintaining optimal ART in HIV-1 infected patients during allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

 The primary outcome is the fraction of patients who maintain any form of anti-retroviral therapy, including enfuvirtide monotherapy, through day 60 post-transplant.

 If patients are unable to take oral anti-retroviral medications, but are able to tolerate subcutaneous enfuvirtide monotherapy this will be considered maintenance of ART.

 Failure to maintain ART will be defined as 24 hours without any anti-retroviral therapy.
