(secondQuint)Sleep and Cytokines During Acute Diverticulitis.

 An increasing number of experimental studies have showed that inflammation can induce disturbances in sleep architecture, mediated by cytokines.

 Sleep is important both in health and disease processes and can affect recovery, morbidity and mortality.

 Studies have been done on sleep disturbances after major and minor GI-surgery but never in relation to none surgical inflammatory diseases, namely acute diverticulitis.

 This study will investigate sleep architecture by Polysomnography and inflammation by levels of pro inflammatory cytokines in plasma.

 Following methods will be applied Device: Polysomnograph - Embla Titanium (Natus Medical Incorporated, USA) Procedure: Plasma cytokines (IL-2, IL-6 and TNF(tumor necrosis factor-alfa) Procedure: Plasma CRP(C reactive protein) and leukocytes.

 Sleep and Cytokines During Acute Diverticulitis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate sleep disturbances during Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis by polysomnography.

 The investigators hypothesis is the inflammation causes REM(rapid eye movement)-sleep reduction and this is correlated with plasma cytokine levels.
