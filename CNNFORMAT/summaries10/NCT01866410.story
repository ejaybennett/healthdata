(fifthQuint)Cabozantinib-S-Malate and Erlotinib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate for efficacy by response rate (RR) when patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation who have progressed following EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy are treated with XL184 (cabozantinib [cabozantinib-s-malate]) and erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine progression free survival (PFS) for combination XL184 (cabozantinib) and erlotinib in EGFR mutation positive patients following progression on erlotinib.

 II.

 Assess overall survival.

 III.

 Evaluate change in tumor growth rate on XL184 (cabozantinib) and erlotinib.

 IV.

 Evaluate type, severity, duration and outcome of toxicities.

 V.

 Correlate outcome with tumor biomarkers such as met proto-oncogene (MET) amplification, T790M mutation, and serum markers of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and MET pathways in a preliminary manner.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) daily and erlotinib hydrochloride PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 1 year and then annually thereafter.

 Cabozantinib-S-Malate and Erlotinib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib-s-malate and erlotinib hydrochloride works in treating patients with previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

 Cabozantinib-s-malate and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Cabozantinib-s-malate may also stop the growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

 Giving cabozantinib-s-malate together with erlotinib hydrochloride may be an effective treatment for non-small cell lung cancer.
