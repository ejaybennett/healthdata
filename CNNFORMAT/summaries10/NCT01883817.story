(firstQuint)Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acid on Cortical Function in ADHD.

 This study aims to determine the effects of 10-week dietary supplementation with the long-chain omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or placebo on prefrontal cortical structural and functional connectivity using several neuroimaging techniques: DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging), 1H MRS(Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy), and fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in psychostimulant-free children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

 It is postulated that DHA supplements will increase brain activation and reduce ADHD symptomatology.
