(thirdQuint)Effectiveness of Continuous Femoral Nerve Block Versus Single Shot Femoral Nerve Block for Pain Control.

 The number of ambulatory procedures has steadily increased over the last decade.

 Postoperative pain is the most common cause of delayed discharge and unexpected admission after ambulatory surgery.

 Knee surgery was identified as one of the procedures associated with the most pain at 24 hours, with a 45% or higher incidence of moderate or severe pain.

 Poor pain control can counteract many of the benefits of ambulatory surgery and can lead to the development of chronic pain.

 Regional techniques have been shown to be effective after ACL reconstruction, allowing faster patient recovery with fewer side-effects than intravenous administration of opioids.

 Different regional techniques have been applied and studied after ACLR.

 Femoral nerve block for ACLR either as a single bolus or as a continuous infusion markedly decreases intravenous analgesic requirements and postoperative pain.

 To the Investigator's knowledge, no study has compared these two techniques after ACLR with patellar tendon graft or allograft.

 Effectiveness of Continuous Femoral Nerve Block Versus Single Shot Femoral Nerve Block for Pain Control@highlight

Both single shot femoral nerve block and continuous femoral nerve block with catheter have been shown to be effective for pain control after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).

 Continuous femoral nerve block may be the more effective of the two in reducing pain scores and opioid consumption for the first 48 hours postoperatively.
