(secondQuint)Ultrasound Guided Core Biopsy vs Fine Needle Aspiration for Evaluation of Axillary Lymphadenopathy.

 Women with suspected or recently diagnosed breast cancer and ipsilateral abnormal appearing axillary lymph nodes underwent fine needle aspiration immediately followed by core biopsy of the same lymph node.

Cytology results from the fine needle aspiration (FNA)and histology from the core biopsy were compared to surgical pathology from axillary node excision to determine if either method of percutaneous node sampling was more sensitive in detecting metastasis.

 Pain during each procedure was also compared.

The study was performed to determine if either ultrasound guided core biopsy or fine needle aspiration of an axillary lymph node has superior sensitivity in detecting metastatic carcinoma from the ipsilateral breast.
