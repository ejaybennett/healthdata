(thirdQuint)Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity and Efficacy of NDV-3A Vaccine in Preventing Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis.

 The purpose of the Phase 1b portion of this study is to compare the NDV-3A vaccine, the NDV-3 vaccine and the placebo head-to-head in the patient population of interest (women with RVVC) to evaluate safety and immunogenicity.

 The study size for comparing safety and immunogenicity (N=15 per group) is based on the dose comparison design used in study NDV3-001 (clinical trials.

gov Identifier NCT01273922).

 The primary purpose of the Phase 2a portion of this study is to further evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the NDV-3A vaccine compared to placebo in a patient population of interest (women with RVVC).

 The secondary purpose is to determine whether the NDV-3A vaccine decreases the recurrence rate of VVC in 18-50 year old women with RVVC when compared to placebo.

 The study size for evaluating efficacy (N=87 per group) is based on assuming a 50% rate of VVC recurrences over the 6 month post-vaccination period in the placebo group and a 50% vaccine efficacy.

 Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity and Efficacy of NDV-3A Vaccine in Preventing Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis@highlight

This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study intended to assess the safety, tolerability and humoral and cellular immune response over a 12-month period after receiving one dose of either the NDV-3A vaccine, NDV-3 vaccine, or placebo.

 In addition, the clinical efficacy of NDV-3A vaccine in lowering the recurrence rate of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) in patients with recurrent VVC (RVVC) will be evaluated relative to placebo.
