(fifthQuint)Real World Expanded Multicenter Study of the MitraClip System (REALISM).

 The EVEREST II REALISM study (REALISM study) is a continued access registry designed for continued data collection on the use of Abbott Vascular's MitraClip System (MitraClip(R) Device) under more "real world" conditions.

 After the completion of enrollment in the pivotal EVEREST II Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) NCT00209274 and EVEREST II High Risk Registry Study NCT01940120, continued access to the technology was warranted to collect additional safety and effectiveness data on the MitraClip(R) Device.

 This continued access study was approved by FDA on November 21, 2008 (G030064).

 There are two arms (High Risk and Non-High Risk) in the REALISM study.

 Patients that did not meet REALISM High Risk or Non-High Risk eligibility criteria were evaluated for consideration for either Emergency Use (EU) or Compassionate Use (CU).

 Enrollment in the Non-High Risk arm of the study concluded on April 14, 2011 and enrollment in the High Risk arm concluded on December 19, 2013.

 REALISM is a prospective, multi-center, study of the safety and effectiveness of an endovascular approach to the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation using the Evalve Cardiovascular Valve Repair System (MitraClip(R) implant).

 Patients with moderate-to-severe (3+) or severe (4+) mitral regurgitation (MR), as determined by the site from a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), were considered for enrollment in this study.

 The TTE and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) are used to assess eligibility criteria for MR severity, valve anatomy and left ventricular parameters.

 Real World Expanded Multicenter Study of the MitraClip System (REALISM)@highlight

Prospective, multicenter, continued access registry of the MitraClip(R) Cardiovascular Valve Repair System in the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation.

 Patients will undergo 30-day, 6-month, 12-month, 36-month and 60-month clinical follow-up.

 The study consists of two arms: a High Risk group (NCT01940120) and a Non-High Risk group (NCT00209274) .

 Patients that did not meet REALISM High Risk or Non-High Risk eligibility criteria were evaluated for consideration for either Emergency Use (EU) or Compassionate Use (CU).
