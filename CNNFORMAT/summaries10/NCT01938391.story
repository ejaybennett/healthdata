(thirdQuint)Tissue Removal Assessment With Ultrasound of THe SFA and Popliteal.

 This study is a prospective, single-arm (non-randomized), post-market study which will enroll up to 25 subjects.

 Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) imaging and angiography will be used to assess procedural outcomes in patients who have symptomatic peripheral artery disease who are treated with the Sponsor's OAS and adjunctive balloon angioplasty.

 An independent IVUS Core Lab will be used to provide adjudicated analyses for IVUS outcomes.

 In clinic follow-up visits will be performed at 2 weeks, 6 months and at 12 months.
