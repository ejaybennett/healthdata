(firstQuint)Non-surgical Treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome by Means of Mechanical Traction.

 This randomized controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of mechanical traction compared to care as usual as a non-surgical treatment for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS).

 Patients diagnosed with CTS are recruited from the outpatient neurology clinic of VieCuri Medical Center in Venlo, The Netherlands.

 They will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group.

 Patients in the intervention group will receive 12 treatments with mechanical traction during six consecutive weeks.

 Patients in the control group will receive care as usual, which can include splinting, a corticosteroid injection, carpal tunnel release surgery or an expectant strategy.

 Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after inclusion.
