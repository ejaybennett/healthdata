(secondQuint)FAST GFR: Pilot Study to Evaluate the Safety of the FAST GFR Test in Patients.

.

 A rapid and accurate measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is important in acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) for assessment of impairment, diagnosis, and prompt treatment.

 FAST BioMedical is an emerging technology company whose mission is to quantify clinically meaning ful physiological parameters that have been difficult or impossible to measure.

 GFR is the most clinically relevant metric for understanding renal function, as it is the rate by which the kidney is able to filter waste products in the bloodstream.

 The FAST mGFR is for direct measurement of GFR that relies on reading the ratio of fluorescent markers attached to different size dextran molecules introduced into the bloodstream.

 The test is intended as an adjunct to current methods utilized to assess kidney function.
