(fifthQuint)Correlation Research of Thioredoxin Reductase in Lung Cancer.

 This is a cooperative research project in Thoracic Surgery Department and Medical Oncology Department of Affiliated Cancer Hospital of xiangya School of Medicine Central South University, and the State Key Laboratory for Natural Medicine and Biomimetic Drugs Perking University.

 The primary objective is to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity using blood and lung cancer tissue and measure thioredoxin reductase messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression using lung cancer and pericarcinomatous tissue in early staged(I~IIIA) non-small lung cancers, to study the correlations of thioredoxin reductase between blood and tissue.

 The secondary objectives are to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity between non small lung cancers and lung benign lesion patients to identify the difference between tumor and lung benign mass.

 Correlation Research of Thioredoxin Reductase in Lung Cancer@highlight

In pre-clinical study the investigators found that the thioredoxin reductase activity of serum harbours huge difference between cancer patients and non-cancer patients, the enzyme activity elevated remarkably among cancer patients, so the investigators hypothesis that this is due to tumor cells loading of the patients, the enzyme activity may harbours huge difference between carcinoma tissues and para-carcinoma tissues in early staged non-small cell lung cancers, and after surgery, the enzyme activity may fall down to a normal level because of removing of tumor.
