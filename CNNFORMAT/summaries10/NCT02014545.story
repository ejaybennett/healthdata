(secondQuint)Evaluation of Lucanthone to Whole Brain Radiation Therapy in Patients With Brain Metastases From Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 Eligible patients for this trial will be randomized to lucanthone or placebo in a ratio of 1:1.

 The treatment will consist of WBRT given in a dose of 30 Gy in ten fractions.

 Lucanthone/placebo will be given as an adjunct to the WBRT on days that WBRT is administered.

 Tumor assessments will be done with a brain MRI.

 Radiological assessments on the tumor will be made periodically throughout the study and will be discontinued at the time of tumor progression.

 Safety will be evaluated for one year during the study period and survival data will be collected thereafter.
