(firstQuint)Targeted Busulfan, Fludarabine, Etoposide Conditioning Regimen for HSCT in Childhood and Adolescent ALL.

.

 Busulfan is a highly toxic drug with narrow therapeutic window used for the conditioning of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

 High exposure is associated with systemic toxicity such as veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and underexposure is associated with graft failure or relapse.

 In this study the investigators plan to improve the outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation by using optimal busulfan dose through pharmacokinetic study.
