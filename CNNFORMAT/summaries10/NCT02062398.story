(firstQuint)BlueWind Medical Reprieve System for the Treatment of PNP.

 The BlueWind Reprieve system is a neurostimulator consisting of an Implant and external components.

 The system is intended for home care use.

 The chronic pain treatment is achieved by an electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve fibers.

 The stimulation is set so that it generates paresthesia in the stimulated area (e.

g.

 foot), reducing the pain sensation and improving the quality of life for the patient.
