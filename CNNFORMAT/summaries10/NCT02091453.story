(fifthQuint)Early Training of Attention After Acquired Brain Injury.

 STUDY METHODS The primary objectives of the study were: 1.

 In the acute stage, to evaluate the effectiveness of APT measured by the changes in performance in the attention measure, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, (PASAT) evaluated by Statistical Process Control 2.

 In the postacute stage, to evaluate and compare effects of Attention process training (APT) vs.

 standard rehabilitation on daily activities and return to work three months and one year after participating in a rehabilitation programme with regard to resource utilisation and health economics.

 STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING The study was conducted in a specialised rehabilitation clinic.

 Several in- and outpatient units on two sites were involved.

 It was a randomised, controlled (www.

consort-statement.

org/?o=1011) study with an open extension and a follow up at three and six months and one year.

 Due to the nature of the rehabilitation procedures, neither patients nor rehabilitation professionals were blinded as to the nature of the intervention, but different professionals conducted assessments and training.

 The study was designed to reflect normal clinical practice while allowing comparison between two rehabilitation approaches.

 Patients in the acute phase (10 were offered antidepressant treatment and were included in the study three weeks after pharmacological treatment had been initiated.

 Further, exclusion was also based on severe memory disorders, neglect, visual field defects and motor disability interfering with participation.

 All patients participated in a comprehensive interdisciplinary brain injury rehabilitation programme.

 After baseline assessment, the participants received 20 hours of attention training, at least three days a week, for a period of 5-6 weeks.

 They were randomly assigned to one of the two intervention programmes: intensive area-specific cognitive training with the APT or activity-based attention training provided by the occupational therapist.

 Evaluation of treatment effects was monitored by pre and post assessment and by repeated assessment by the primary outcome measure at baseline, after every third hour of intervention and post intervention for patients in the acute stage.

 Subacute patients were assessed by pre and post measurements.

 The open-label extension of the study comprised of client-centred standard interdisciplinary rehabilitation.

 Discharge was based on clinical decisions and the participants returned to the clinic for follow-up assessments.

 The APT programme provides a theoretically based, individualised, highly structured intervention of organised assignments at four attention levels: sustained, selective, divided and alternating attention.

 Progress is based on the intensity of training, on continuous feedback promoting motivation and on metacognitive training.

 The APT also includes education in acquired attention deficits and training for generalisation, enabling the transfer of treatment tasks and techniques to self-selected cognitive problems in everyday situations.

 Each session took 45-90 minutes to perform, working with material from APTs I and II.

 Attention training in activities included standard occupational training within an interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme.

 The programme consisted of a) training and the use of compensatory strategies in attention-demanding activities of daily living b) performing independent work with attention-demanding tasks at individual level c) training using computerised tasks, not specifically designed for attention remediation and d) group activities.

 Types of training and time devoted to a specific training procedure were individually registered.

 Inclusion measures were the APT-test and Matrix reasoning.

Cut-off scores were 70% or less on at least two of the five subtests on the APT-test and standard scores of seven and above on Matrix Reasoning.

 Exclusion measures were Barthel Activity of Daily Living, (ADL)-index 50 or less; Alberts test/Line crossing with a cut off score of (3 standard deviations from the mean respectively).

 Data points outside those control limits are considered to be related to special causes of variation, such as effects of treatment.

 The Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) in the primary outcome variable, PASAT was estimated and expressed as the minimum change of the PASAT-diff score that could be considered clinically relevant.

 Parametric methods, Student's t-test and Pearson correlation were used for normally distributed variables on interval level.

 When comparing the two treatment groups, t-tests for independent samples were used and for comparison between pre- post and follow up measures t-tests for dependent samples and analysis of variance were used.

 Skewed or ordinal data were analysed by non-parametric methods: Mann-Whitney U-test for comparison between the treatment groups; Wilcoxon matched pairs test, Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance for comparison of pre- post and follow up measures and Spearman's rank correlation test.

 For post-hoc comparisons we used the Mann-Whitney U-test.

 Fisher's exact test was used for comparison between dichotomized variables.

 Bonferroni corrections were applied to correct for false positives due to the number of analyses.

 The possible effects of randomisation bias were investigated using a linear mixed-model analysis including one within-group factor treatment and one between-group factor.

 Cluster analysis was used for the primary outcome measure to explore and identify patterns of cognitive recovery in the acute phase.

 Two-tailed p-values were used with a critical significance level of 0.

05.

 Health economics resource utilisation was calculated for each treatment arm for participants in both acute and subacute phases.

 Early Training of Attention After Acquired Brain Injury@highlight

Background: To study intensive targeted cognitive rehabilitation of attention in the acute (<4 months) and subacute rehabilitation phases (4 -12 months) after acquired brain injury and to evaluate the effects on function, activity and participation (return to work).

 Design: prospective, randomised, controlled study.

 Methods: 120 consecutive patients with stroke or traumatic brain injury are randomised to 20 hours of intensive attention training by Attention Process Training or by standard, activity based training.

 Progress is evaluated by Statistical Process Control and by pre and post measurement of functional and activity levels.

 Return to work is also evaluated in the post-acute phase.

 Primary endpoints are the changes in the attention measure, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test and changes in work ability.

 Secondary endpoints include measurement of cognitive functions, activity and work return.

 There are 3, 6 and 12-month follow ups focussing on health economics.

 Discussion: The study will provide information on rehabilitation of attention in the early phases after acquired brain injury (ABI); effects on function, activity and return to work.

 Further, the application of Statistical Process Control might enable closer investigation of the cognitive changes after acquired brain injury and demonstrate the usefulness of process measures in rehabilitation.
