(thirdQuint)The Effect of Sensory-enhanced Beverages on Satiety Following Repeated Exposures.

 The study will be a 3-way crossover design: it will assess the impact of a high-energy, sensory-enhanced beverage on energy intake through ad libitum food consumption and subjective feeling of appetite using visual analogue scales (VAS) compared to 2 control beverages following repeated exposures.

 Each participant will consume each beverage 10 times.

 This includes 2 satiety-testing sessions on site at Leatherhead Food Research, and 8 occasions consuming the product as a mid-morning snack during the participants' normal routine.

 Each participant will attend the Nutrition Unit on 6 different occasions (plus one screening visit) before and after repeated exposures to the beverages at home.

 The order in which participants receive the beverages will be counterbalanced and randomised.

 There will be a two-week washout period in which none of the beverages are consumed between the different beverage manipulations.

 Participants will fast overnight before each visit and consume the same evening meal before each test day.

 Participants will be instructed to avoid consuming food or calorific beverages for one hour before or after consuming the beverage.

 Following the last satiety testing day participants will be debriefed and open questions will be asked about experiences of the beverages in a focus group format.

 The Effect of Sensory-enhanced Beverages on Satiety Following Repeated Exposures@highlight

The study will be a 3-way crossover design: it will assess the impact of consuming a beverage enhanced with satiety-relevant properties on subjective ratings of appetite and on energy intake compared with a low energy version with the same sensory characteristics, and a non-sensory enhanced high energy control.

 In addition, saliva samples will be collected at regular intervals for the identification of novel biomarkers of energy intake.
