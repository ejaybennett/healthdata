(secondQuint)A Closed Loop Neural Activity Triggered Stroke Rehabilitation Device.

 The aim of this study is to determine if functional muscle stimulation, in addition to non-invasive neurostimulation through the tongue, directed by electroencephalogram (EEG) output, can increase the extent of stroke recovery on behavioral measures and induce brain plasticity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.

 Forty-four adult stroke patients and 5 healthy controls will be recruited in this study.

The purpose of this research is to determine if two non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, muscle stimulation of the arm and neuro-stimulation through the tongue, can increase the extent of stroke recovery.
