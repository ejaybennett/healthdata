(secondQuint)Acupuncture in Persistent Atrial Fibrillation.

 This is a multicenter, prospective, participant and assessor blinded, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial with 2 parallel arms.

 To evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture, a total of 80 persistent AF participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to active acupuncture and sham acupuncture group.

 Both group commonly take antiarrhythmic medication during study period.

 These patients who are resistant to drug therapy will get a electrical cardioversion.

 After cardioversion, the recurrence rate and duration of atrial fibrillation free time will be evaluated.

 This trial consists of 2 weeks of observation and medical therapy, 2 weeks of acupuncture intervention before EC, EC and acupuncture intervention, 7 weeks of additional intervention, and 5 weeks of follow-up.

 After randomization, participants receive 10 sessions of acupuncture treatments over 10 weeks.

 The outcome is assessed at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 16 week after randomization.
