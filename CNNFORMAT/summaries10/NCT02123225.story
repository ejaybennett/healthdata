(fifthQuint)Is the STOP-BANG Predictive of Worsening OSA in the Early Postop Period in Patients Undergoing TJA?.

 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

 Up to 30% of surgical patients have undiagnosed OSA; however, many patients are unable to obtain a sleep study prior to surgery.

 In recent years the STOP-BANG questionnaire (8 yes-no questions; 3 high-risk OSA) has become one of the most common tools used in the preoperative period to identify patients at high-risk for OSA.

 However, further research is needed to determine if the STOP-BANG is predictive of worsening of sleep apnea parameters in patients undergoing TKA.

 The purpose of this prospective observational cohort study is to determine in TKA patients if the score on the STOP-BANG (3 to 5) is predictive of worsening sleep apnea parameters (AHI, time with SPO2 3 to 5) and the investigators will first compare the groups to identify if there are differences between baseline and postoperative sleep apnea parameters based on the STOP-BANG groups (3 to 5).

 If differences are found the investigators will use multiple regression analysis to determine if the STOP-BANG scores or categories and/or other covariates (i.

e.

, comorbidity index, total morphine equivalents) are predictive of worsening sleep apnea during the first three days after surgery.

 Results of this study may help improve patient safety by allowing us to identify which group of TKA patients with undiagnosed OSA may require more intensive postoperative monitoring and therapy (i.

e, ICU admission, need for continuous end-tidal CO2 monitoring, postoperative positive airway pressure therapy) or change in the analgesic plan.

 Is the STOP-BANG Predictive of Worsening OSA in the Early Postop Period in Patients Undergoing TJA?@highlight

The goal of this study is to determine if the investigators can use the STOP-BANG score to identify those patients at risk for worsening Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) symptoms in the early postoperative period after major surgery.

 Hypotheses: 1.

 - Postoperative sleep apnea parameters will be worse when compared to baseline in patients with higher scores on the STOP-BANG.

 2.

 - A higher STOP-BANG score will be predictive of worsening sleep apnea parameters in patients undergoing Total Knee Arthroscopy (TKA).
