(fifthQuint)A Randomized, Controlled Trial to Determine the Effects of an Exercise Intervention on Physical Activity During Chemotherapy for Patients With Early Stage Breast Cancer.

 This is a prospective, randomized, single institution feasibility trial.

 The efficacy of an exercise intervention during chemotherapy for sedentary breast cancer patients will be tested.

 The investigators goal is to recruit 120 women and men.

 Assuming 20% attrition rate, 96 will be randomized to two arms, comparing patients assigned to a physical activity program plus general health education materials versus patients assigned to receive standard general health education materials only.

 Study measures will be obtained before intervention, at 24 weeks, and at the end of the intervention, approximately week 32.

 A Randomized, Controlled Trial to Determine the Effects of an Exercise Intervention on Physical Activity During Chemotherapy for Patients With Early Stage Breast Cancer@highlight

This study is designed to randomly assign breast cancer patients requiring and agreeing to chemotherapy into two groups.

 One group will be receive an exercise prescription aimed at increasing physical activity by a minimum of 10 MET (metabolic equivalent task) hours per week.

 The other group will not receive a exercise prescription but their activity will be recorded.

 The hypothesis is that participants that are most active will exhibit improved chemotherapy completion rates, improved fitness, less fatigue and lower levels of markers for inflammation in their blood.
