(firstQuint)Phase I Study of Oral DFP-11207 in Solid Tumors.

 The Phase I dose escalation portion of the study has been completed.

 The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been determined.

 The study will now evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of DFP-11207.

 The food effect study is a two-step, two-way crossover design to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of oral DFP-11207 capsules.

 During Cycle 1, oral DFP-11207 capsules are to be taken daily (as a single dose or twice-daily [approximately 12 hours apart]) under fed/fasted conditions.

 After Cycle 1, the food effect study will be completed and patients will continue to take oral DFP-11207 capsules twice-daily (approximately 12 hours apart) for 28 days of a 28-day treatment cycle.
