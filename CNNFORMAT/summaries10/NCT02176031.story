(secondQuint)Phase II Trial of Natalizumab (Tysabri) Plus Prednisone for Initial Therapy of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (aGVHD) of the Gastrointestinal Tract.

 Natalizumab is a drug that was initially discovered as a treatment for autoimmune conditions.

 Natalizumab has been approved for use in patients with Multiple Sclerosis and Crohn's disease.

 In these diseases, the drug works to inhibit dysfunctional immune cells that are responsible for the symptoms seen in these diseases.

 Acute graft versus host disease is caused by a similar dysfunction of immune cells; Natalizumab is thought to inhibit these immune cells, similarly to how it does in Multiple Sclerosis and Crohn's disease.

 In this research study,the investigators are looking to see whether Natalizumab provides additional benefit to patients receiving standard treatment for acute graft versus host disease of the gastrointestinal tract.

 Participants who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to receive Natalizumab.

 - Participant will receive a dose of the natalizumab through intravenous infusion.

 Participants may receive a second dose at Day 28 if they experience a partial response or very good partial response.

 - Scheduled Physical Examination at screening, during the week of first dose and at 28 days, 56 days, 100 days, 180 days and one year.
