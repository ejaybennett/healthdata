(fifthQuint)IntelliCare: Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression and Anxiety (AIM).

 Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder, with up to 10.

3% of the population experiencing the disorder in a given 12-month period.

 The relationship between depression and anxiety has been well documented.

 Depression is a significant predictor of future anxiety, and anxiety is a significant predictor of future onset of depression.

 Indeed, studies find that more than 50% of all individuals with MDD also have a current anxiety disorder.

 Although effective treatments have been developed over the years to address depression and anxiety, the lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences contributes to poor treatment adherence and outcomes.

 We are developing an intelligent treatment system that uses state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application to treat MDD and anxiety.

 Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data.

 The intervention, called IntelliCare, uses a mobile application to continuously collect patient data and adapt intervention content and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system.

 During the pilot study, 200 participants with Major Depression and/or Anxiety will use Intellicare apps for up to 8 weeks and may be invited to provide feedback about their experience at two follow-up time points: weeks 4 and 8.

 All participants will first undergo initial assessments that will include a telephone interview and a series of online questionnaires about their mood.

 Eligible participants will receive up to 8 weeks of access to the IntelliCare system, which consists of apps with lessons and tools designed to teach skills for mood management.

 It is suggested that participants utilize the mobile phone tools every day.

 Each week, participants will receive a brief motivational intervention from a coach.

 This coach will also be available to participants via email throughout the 8 week study.

 We will use data from the pilot study to examine whether IntelliCare is a feasible and effective intervention.

 Data collected will also be used to develop and evaluate machine learning methods which will be used in the subsequent AIM trials.

 IntelliCare: Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression and Anxiety (AIM)@highlight

This study will evaluate a Smartphone intervention for depression and anxiety that uses machine learning to tailor treatment for patients.

 The intervention, referred to as IntelliCare, delivers patient-specific treatment material and motivational messaging via a mobile phone, to help individuals with depression and/or anxiety.

 Information and data received from the patient will inform the tailored treatment approach through machine learning.

 The purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary information on the feasibility and effectiveness of IntelliCare in improving symptoms of depression and anxiety.
