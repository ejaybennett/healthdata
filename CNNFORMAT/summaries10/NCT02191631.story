(secondQuint)Internet-delivered CBT for Adolescents With OCD: A Randomized Controlled Study.

 The primary objective of this study is to test the efficacy of Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) for adolescents (12 - 17 years) with OCD.

 We aim to conduct a randomized controlled study with N = 66 participants.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to ICBT or a wait list condition, either lasting 12 weeks.

 The primary outcome measure is the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS).

 Study participants will be followed up 3 and 12 months after treatment.

 ICBT is expected to yield significantly better symptom reduction than the wait list condition.
