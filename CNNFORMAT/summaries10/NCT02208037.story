(thirdQuint)Novel Approaches for Graft-versus-Host Disease Prevention Compared to Contemporary Controls (BMT CTN 1203).

 GVHD is a complication that can occur after a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.

 The transplant recipient's body is attacked by the newly introduced cells.

 Only about 40% of patients with acute GVHD have durable responses when treated with corticosteroid therapy.

 A strategy that helps fewer people suffer from GVHD, without other adverse effects, would be an effective approach to improve survival after allogeneic transplantation.

 GVHD incidence can be decreased with various treatment plans.

 Early transplants were done using post-transplant methotrexate to prevent GVHD.

 Another drug, cyclosporine, was later shown to work better than methotrexate.

 Then doctors discovered that the combined use of cyclosporine and methotrexate worked even better than either agent alone.

 More recently, other calcineurin-inhibitors, such as tacrolimus have been developed as GVHD prophylactic agents due to favorable toxicity profiles in comparison with cyclosporine.

 Studies have been conducted to compare available treatment combinations for related and unrelated donors.

 The combination of tacrolimus/methotrexate remains a standard for GVHD prophylaxis.

 However, improved GVHD prophylaxis remains a significant clinical need in HSCT.

 The current clinical trial will test three novel GVHD prophylaxis approaches: tacrolimus/methotrexate and bortezomib (Tac/MTX/Bort), tacrolimus/methotrexate and maraviroc (Tac/MTX/MVC) and tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide (Tac/MMF/Cy).

 This randomized Phase II clinical trial will compare each intervention arm with a Tac/MTX control.

 This study will enroll people who have a cancer of the blood or lymph glands and a stem cell transplant is a treatment option.

 The study will take at least two years and will include 270 participants - 90 participants in each of three treatment groups.

 The purpose of this study is to compare three combinations of medications to see whether one or more of them are better than the current standard of care (Tacrolimus/Methotrexate) to prevent GVHD.

 Novel Approaches for Graft-versus-Host Disease Prevention Compared to Contemporary Controls (BMT CTN 1203)@highlight

Acute Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GVHD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

 This study aims to determine if any of three new GVHD prophylaxis approaches improves the rate of GVHD and relapse free survival at one year after transplant compared to the current standard prophylaxis regimen.
