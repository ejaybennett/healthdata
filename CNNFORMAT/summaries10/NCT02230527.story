(thirdQuint)Establishing the Microcirculatory Effects of Ticagrelor on Tissue Perfusion in Critical Limb Ischemia.

 Enrollment into the study will require severe symptomatic CLI without wounds (Rutherford Stage IV) or CLI with concomitant vascular insufficiency wounds (Rutherford Stage V-VI PAD).

 Potential participants will be identified and screened prior to discharge or at the time of the first out-patient visit (within 2 weeks after discharge) after a percutaneous lower extremity arterial angiography with arterial intervention (stent or balloon angioplasty) for the presence of lower extremity vascular insufficiency.

 Participants will be classified as Rutherford Class IV - VI (with or without ulcerations).

 A total of 60 patients will be randomized into 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio (ticagrelor to clopidogrel).

 Patients are placed on clopidogrel after their arterial intervention per standard of care.

 They will remain on clopidogrel up to the time that randomization occurs.

 For patients that are randomized to ticagrelor, the clopidogrel will be stopped.

 Patients will be randomized to either ticagrelor 90mg by mouth twice daily or clopidogrel 75mg by mouth daily.

 Establishing the Microcirculatory Effects of Ticagrelor on Tissue Perfusion in Critical Limb Ischemia@highlight

This is a single center, prospective, randomized, unblinded, open-label, active controlled pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor plus aspirin versus clopidogrel plus aspirin in patients with Rutherford Stage IV to VI PAD that have undergone a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the lower extremities in the past 2 weeks.
