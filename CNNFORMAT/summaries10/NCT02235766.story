(thirdQuint)Corelab Remotely Echocardiographic Imaging Acquisition in Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Candidates.

 CORELAB-CRT is a prospective multi center Italian observational study.

 All echo images and clips will be transmitted by using an integrated satellite transmission system.

 All echo assessments performed in accordance to the centers clinical practice will be also used to investigate the prognostic efficacy of echo parameters in term of response to the cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).

 All commercially available multi-chamber CRT-D devices from any manufacturers are allowed in this observational study.

 Any compatible market released right atrial, right ventricular and left ventricular lead from any manufacturer is allowed.

 The echocardiography device models used to perform echo imaging for all patients participating in this analysis are GE Vivid 7, GE Vivid 9 and GE Vivid I, according to the model used in the clinical practice of the hospital.

Purpose of the observational study is to assess the capability of a satellite tele-echocardiography (STE) system to acquire and transmit echocardiographic images and clips to an echocardiographic core laboratory (ECL) in a real time mode without loss of quality.

 Additionally the prognostic efficacy of specific echo parameters in the cardiac resynchronization therapy response will be evaluated.
