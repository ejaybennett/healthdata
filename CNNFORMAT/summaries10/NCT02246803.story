(fifthQuint)The Assessment of Progression of Paroxysmal AF After CABG.

 This is a single blinded prospective randomized study involving 72 patients with paroxysmal AF and coronary artery disease.

 72 patients are required to have a 80% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, an increase in the primary outcome measure by 10% in the CABG + pulmonary veins isolation group over isolated CABG group.

 Patients are divided into two groups, group I - isolated CABG (36 patients), and group II - CABG and pulmonary veins isolation (36 patients).

 Randomization is conducted by using accidental sampling before operation.

 The blinding process is applied to a patient, who is informed about received coronary artery bypass grafting, but don't know about pulmonary vein isolation.

 Subcutaneous cardiac monitor is implanted to all patients for cardiac rhythm monitoring.

 The Assessment of Progression of Paroxysmal AF After CABG@highlight

The aim of this study is a comparative evaluation of progression of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with coronary artery disease after isolated CABG and CABG combined with pulmonary vein isolation.

 Hypothesis of the study - patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease after CABG in combination with isolation of the pulmonary veins have a better outcomes for the progression of AF compared with patients undergoing isolated CABG.
