(thirdQuint)Effect of Meal Frequency on Glycemic Control of People at High Risk or Diagnosed With Diabetes.

 The effect of meal frequency on diabetes risk markers (e.

g.

 glucose and insulin metabolism) has been studied in several studies so far, both in healthy individuals and in individuals being at risk for diabetes mellitus, with or without concurrent weight loss.

 In addition, few studies have investigated the effect of different meal frequency on glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus under conditions of weight maintenance.

 However, the results regarding the ideal number of meals remain controversial.

 To our best knowledge, there is no study available that has investigated the effect of meal frequency on glucose and insulin metabolism in lean and obese women with PCOS, in lean and obese individuals with hyperinsulinemia and impaired glucose tolerance, and in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, independently of weight loss.

This study investigated any potential associations between two isocaloric diets with different meal frequency (3 meals versus 6 meals) and glycemic control in people at high diabetes risk (lean and overweight/obese women with PCOS, individuals with hyperinsulinemia, individuals with impaired glucose tolerance) and diagnosed with diabetes.
