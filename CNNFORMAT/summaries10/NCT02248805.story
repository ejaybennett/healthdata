(thirdQuint)Phase 1 Study of MGD007 in Relapsed/Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma.

 This is an open-label, multi-center, Phase 1 dose-escalation study to define a MTD, describe preliminarily safety, and to assess PK, immunogenicity, and potential anti-tumor activity of MGD007 in patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.

 In the initial phase of the study, two dose schedules will be assessed in dose escalation, once weekly and once every three weeks administration of single agent MGD007.

 Following the establishment of an MTD, additional patients will enroll in four separate dose expansion cohorts to further optimize the dose and schedule of MGD007 administration.

 In all segments of the study, patients who benefit from MGD007 treatment and continue to meet eligibility may continue treatment in Cycles 2 and beyond.

 Phase 1 Study of MGD007 in Relapsed/Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma@highlight

The primary goal of this Phase 1 study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of MGD007 and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and schedule of MGD007 administered to patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma.

 Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the anti-tumor activity of MGD007 will also be assessed.
