(thirdQuint)Assessing Bioavailability of CoQ10 Supplementation in Burn Patients.

 Based on previous clinical studies and our preliminary preclinical data, we want to test the hypotheses that plasma and intracellular coenzyme Q10 levels are decreased after burn injury and that coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinol) supplementation reverses or ameliorates insulin resistance, metabolic derangements, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased circulating DAMPs in burn patients.

 The aforementioned previous studies and preliminary data warrant a small-scale clinical study to evaluate coenzyme Q10 status, and bioavailability and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinol) supplementation in burn patients.

 Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinol) supplementation could represent a novel, safe and low-cost strategy to improve the clinical outcome of burn patients.

 We are conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study with anticipated enrollment of 50 subjects.

 Adult burn patients with 5% or greater of total body surface area (TBSA) burn at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Burn Center will be approached to consider study participation.

 All enrolled patients will be randomized to receive coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinol) supplementation or placebo.

 Blood samples will be used for evaluation of coenzyme Q10 concentration, mitochondrial DNA copy number, non-mitochondrial DAMPs (e.

g.

, cell-free total DNA), and defective neutrophil migration.
