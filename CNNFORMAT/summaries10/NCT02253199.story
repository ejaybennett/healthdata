(thirdQuint)The Effect of Age on the Median Effective Dose (ED50) of Intranasal Dexmedetomidine for Rescue Sedation Following Failed Sedation With Oral Chloral Hydrate During Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

 About 150 children who were not adequately sedated ( no evidence of adequate sedation within 30 min after administration of Initial dose of chloral hydrate) were stratified into four age groups as follows: 1-6 month, 7 -12 month, 13 -24 month, and 25-36 month.

 The intranasal dexmedetomidine dose was determined by the success or failure of rescue sedation achieved by the previous patients, according to Dixon's up-down sequential allocation method.

 Successful sedation was defined as a MOAA/S(modified Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation) of between 0 and 3.

 The EC50 were estimated from the up-and-down sequences using the method of Dixon and Massey and logistic regression.

 Patients' sedation status, sedation induction time, time to Wake up, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were recorded.

Increasing evidences suggest that dexmedetomidine Pharmacokinetic are different in children.

 We performed a up-down sequential allocation study to determine the ED50 for rescue sedation following sedation failures in children and to investigate age-related differences in the rescue sedation with dexmedetomidine.
