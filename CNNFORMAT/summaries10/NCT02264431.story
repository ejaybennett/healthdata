(fifthQuint)Severe Obesity Outcome Network Cohort (SOON).

 Adult obese patients, attempting a tertiary medical center for the management of their obesity, are asked to participate in a cohort study.

 Data issued from routine clinical practice are collected.

 Medical history and actual medical condition: - Type 2 or type 1 diabetes - Dyslipidemia - Hypertension - Cardiovascular diseases - Steatohepatitis/cirrhosis - Gastric disorders - Nutritional deficiency - Obstructive sleep apnea/Obesity hypoventilation syndrome All patients who do not have a previously known sleep apnea syndrome are evaluated by nocturnal polygraphy.

 Lifestyle and sleep habits, as well as social and economic characteristics, are assessed by questionnaires.

 Patients are asked to provide blood sample to constituate a serum bank and gene bank.

 Patients are asked, if undergoing bariatric surgery, to provide subcutaneous and visceral fat.

 Severe Obesity Outcome Network Cohort (SOON)@highlight

The main objective of the study is to identify the determinant of sleep characteristics of obese patients attempting a tertiary clinical center for obesity management, including bariatric surgery.

 More accurately the questions addressed are: - What are the determinants of the sleep habits (sleep duration, chronotype) and of their evolution - What are the determinants of sleep breathing disorders (sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome) and of their evolution
