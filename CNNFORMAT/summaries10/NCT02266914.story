(firstQuint)Magnetic Resonance Elastography of Cardiac Transplant Rejection.

 Patient will undergo MRE beginning 4-8 weeks post transplant, then with each scheduled cardiac biopsy through 7-8 months post transplant.

 Results of the MRE will be compared against results of the cardiac biopsy to determine if the non-invasive MRE can predict cardiac transplant rejection.
