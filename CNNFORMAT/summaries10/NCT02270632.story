(secondQuint)A Randomized, Placebo-controlled Phase II Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of F8IL10 (Dekavil) in Patients With Active RA Receiving MTX.

 The study is designed to formally demonstrate the superiority of F8IL10 vs placebo and to further evaluate safety and efficacy of two different dosages of F8IL10 when administered to patients receiving MTX.

 Patients will be enrolled and double-blind, parallel assigned (via automated randomization system) in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of three different arms: - Arm 1: placebo + MTX - Arm 2: F8IL10 30 mu g/kg + MTX - Arm 3: F8IL10 160 mu g/kg + MTX F8IL10 or placebo will be subcutaneously injected once a week for 8 weeks.

 Treatment will terminate at the earliest of the following: completion of the 8 weeks of therapy, withdrawal of informed consent, unacceptable toxicity/intolerability of the study drug or need to increase MTX, oral corticosteroids or NSAIDs dosages above baseline levels or need to introduce a new DMARD or biologic therapy to control rheumatoid arthritis activity.

 The study will be conducted in a double blind fashion.
