(secondQuint)Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of Lumason in Pediatric Echocardiography.

 This is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label study that will be conducted at approximately 7-12 sites in the United States, Canada and Europe in pediatric patients with suboptimal LV EBD on non-contrast 2D transthoracic echocardiography with harmonic imaging.

 It is estimated that 92 patients will be enrolled to provide 73 evaluable patients.

 Three cardiologists unaffiliated with enrolling centers (blinded readers), blinded to the patient's identity and clinical profile will independently evaluate the echocardiograms.

 The efficacy analysis will be primarily based on the blinded reader evaluations.

 Imaging conditions will be representative of those used in routine clinical practice and will include LV EBD with harmonic imaging modality.

 One of the sites participating in this study will also be requested to consent a subset of patients for additional blood sampling for analysis of SF6 concentration in blood from a total of 6 patients (3 males and 3 females) in the age group 9 up to 12 years of age and 6 patients (3 males and 3 females) in the age of >12 up to and including 17 years.

 The current study is designed to assess the efficacy of Lumason-enhanced.
