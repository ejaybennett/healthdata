(secondQuint)Lung Volume Change Between Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation by Nasal Pillow and High Flow Nasal Cannula.

 Electrical impedance tomography can effectively monitor the lung volume change in ICU patients who were under mechanical ventilator or noninvasive positive pressure ventilator support.

 Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support by nasal pillow and high flow nasal cannula can improve inspiratory function in extubated patients .

 However, the extent of lung volume change or functional residual volume (FRC) change by using these two devices were never surveyed before in extubated patients.

 The investigators will check end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) ,anterior, medio-anterior, medio-posterior and posterior EELV by electrical impedance tomography after use of these two devices in extubated patients.

The difference of lung volume change will be monitored by electrical impedance tomography before and after use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation by nasal pillow and high flow nasal cannula in post-extubation patients.
