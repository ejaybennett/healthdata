(fifthQuint)Acute Pseudophakic Cystoid Macular Edema Treatment Trial: Intravitreal Ranibizumab Versus Triamcinolone Acetonide.

 1.

 BACKGROUND 1.

1 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Despite improved cataract surgery instrumentation and techniques, the incidence of clinical CME remains 1 - 3% following uncomplicated PE/PCIOL.

 CME remains the most common cause of suboptimal post-operative visual acuity (VA) after uncomplicated PE/PCIOL.

 1% clinical CME incidence represents 30,000 new cases annually in the USA.

 Clinical CME is defined as clinically evident CME, with VA typically 20/40 - 20/200.

 Diagnostic testing can confirm CME by FA leakage and increased CRT on OCT.

 If left untreated, chronic photoreceptor degeneration and irreversible VA loss can occur, even if the macular edema was to eventually resolve.

2 TREATMENT OF PSEUDOPHAKIC CYSTOID MACULAR EDEMA Several treatment options for CME have been investigated, including topical, oral, periocular and intravitreal corticosteroids.

 Corticosteroids inhibit phospholipase A2, inhibiting production of arachidonic acid, precursor of the lipo-oxyenase (LOX) and cyclo-oxygenase (COX) pathways.

 Because corticosteroids inhibit both the LOX and COX pathways, corticosteroids may be expected to be more effective than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in decreasing inflammation.

 However, corticosteroids have side effects, including the potential for increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in susceptible patients, and require additional treatment for secondary glaucoma.

 NSAIDs specifically inhibit COX-2, and therefore avoid potential complications of corticosteroids.

 NSAIDs may be a good option for CME treatment of patients who are known corticosteroid responders.

 However, corneal stromal melting is a rare but serious potential side-effect of topical NSAIDs.

3 RANIBIZUMAB (R) AND PSEUDOPHAKIC CYSTOID MACULAR EDEMA Numerous studies, such as ANCHOR, MARINA, and PIER, have shown that R effectively reduces perifoveal capillary leakage and CMT, when used as treatment for exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

 BRAVO and CRUISE data have shown similar reduction in perifoveal capillary leakage and CMT when used as treatment for retinal vein occlusions (RVO).

 To date, there is no published study reporting efficacy of R monotherapy for acute pseudophakic CME.

 This study will assess R monotherapy, and eliminate any possible confounding effect of prior or concurrent treatment with either corticosteroids, NSAIDs, or both.

 Intravitreal R injections may avoid the potential for IOP elevation common with topical, periocular and intravitreal corticosteroids.

 R would also avoid corneal stromal melting, a rare but serious potential side-effect of topical NSAIDs.

 1.

5 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH RANIBIZUMAB R has been studied in more than 5000 subjects with neovascular AMD in a number of Phase I, I/II, II, III, and IIIb clinical trials.

 Serious adverse events related to the injection procedure have occurred in 6% higher in R-treated subjects than control subjects) were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, vitreous floaters, increased IOP, and intraocular inflammation.

 Although there was a low rate ( 18 years - Treatment naive subjects with a history of uncomplicated PE/CEIOL within 3 months of referral for treatment, and a diagnosis of CME secondary to PE/CEIOL within 1 month of referral for treatment.

 - Best corrected VA 20/40 - 20/400.

 - Spectral domain OCT CMT > 300 microns - Treatment naive subjects with a history of uncomplicated cataract surgery within 12 months of referral for treatment and a diagnosis of CME secondary to cataract surgery within 12 months of referral for treatment.

 - Patients who have received pre- or post-operative topical corticosteroids and/or NSAIDs will have to discontinue such medications for at least 2-4 weeks prior to entering this study.

 - Best corrected ETDRS VA of 20/40 - 20/400.

 - Spectral domain OCT central retinal thickness > 300 microns.

1 Formulation R is formulated as a sterile solution aseptically filled in a sterile, single use 2 mL stoppered glass vial.

 Each single use vial is designed to deliver 0.

05 mL of 10 mg/mL ranibizumab aqueous solution with 10 mM histidine HCI, 10% trehalose dihydrate, and 0.

01% polysorbate 20, pH 5.

5.

 T injectable suspension 40 mg/mL is a single use synthetic corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory action.

 Each mL of the sterile, aqueous suspension provides 40 mg of triamcinolone acetonide, with sodium chloride for isotonicity, 0.

015% polysorbate 80.

 It also contains potassium chloride, calcium chloride (dihydrate), magnesium chloride (hexahydrate), sodium acetate (trihydrate), sodium citrate (dihydrate) and water for injection.

 Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid may be present to adjust pH to a target value 6 - 7.

2 Dosage and Administration a.

 Dosage Patients on R will receive 3 initial injections monthly followed by monthly PRN.

 Patients on T will receive an initial injection followed by PRN injections every 3 months.

 Re-treatment criteria include clinically evident worsening of CME, combined with any of the following: - Any increase in spectral domain OCT CMT - Any observable fluid on OCT - Any qualitatively increased perifoveal leakage/pooling on FA.

 The intravitreal injection procedure will be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions.

5 mL of R will be given by intravitreal injection 3.

0 to 3.

5 mm posterior to the surgical limbus inferiorly.

 Similar technique will be used for T intravitreal injections, with two exceptions: one, a sterile 27-gauge 1/2 inch needle will be used for the intravitreal injection; and two, 4 mg T/0.

1 mL volume will be injected intravitreally.

 Following the intravitreal injection, patients will be monitored for elevation in IOP and for endophthalmitis.

 Patients will be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis without delay.

 Twenty consented patients with acute CME after phacoemulsification cataract surgery with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation (PE/PCIOL) will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with R or T.

 R patients will receive three monthly R injections, followed by PRN dosing.

 T patients will receive PRN injections every 3 months.

 Clinical CME is defined as clinically evident CME, with visual acuity (VA) typically in the 20/40 to 20/200 range.

 Re-treatment criteria will include clinically evident worsening of CME, combined with any of the following: - Any increase in spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (OCT) central macular thickness (CMT) - Any observable fluid on OCT - Any qualitatively increased perifoveal leakage/pooling on fluorescein angiography (FA).

 Patients will be followed monthly through 12 months.
