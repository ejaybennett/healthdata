(secondQuint)Short-term Existential Behavioural Therapy for Informal Caregivers of Palliative Patients: a Randomised Controlled Trial.

 The investigators have developed and pilot-tested a short-term manualised individual psychotherapy, called Existential Behavioural Therapy (EBT), to reduce psychological distress in informal caregivers of palliative patients.

 The investigators propose to conduct a two-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of EBT against usual care for the reduction of distress and the promotion of quality of life.

 Two one-to-one manualised psychotherapeutic sessions will be compared to a treatment-as-usual control group.

Treatment-as-usual includes two supportive sessions.

 The design will be an unblinded RCT consisting of two conditions (EBT and Treatment-as-usual), with assessment at pre- and post-treatment and follow-ups at four weeks and six months.

 The trial will take place in the Clinic of Palliative Care, University of Munich (Klinik und Poliklinik fur Palliativmedizin der LMU Munchen).
