(firstQuint)Blood Pressure Lowering Effect of Supplementation With Korea Red Ginseng Associated With Reductions in Circulating Lp-PLA2 Activity and Lysophospatidylcholines and an Increase in Dihydrobiopterin in Prehypertensive Subjects.

 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on nonobese, nondiabetic and prehypertensive subjects.

 Over a 12 week test period, the red ginseng group (n=31) consumed 10 capsules (total 5g) daily containing red ginseng, while the placebo group (n=31) consumed the same product without red ginseng.

 Fasting plasma metabolomes were profiled using UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry.
