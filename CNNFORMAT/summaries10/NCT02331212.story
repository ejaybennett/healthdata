(thirdQuint)Role of Hyaluronic Acid in Causing Cancer Stem Cell Growth in the Bones of Patients With Breast Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the hypothesis that there are more hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2)+ cells in patients with bone metastasis compared to patients with only local disease.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the hypothesis that cells with HAS2+ and cancer stem cell (CSC)+ (cluster of differentiation [CD]24-/CD44+/epithelial specific antigen [ESA]+) cells will have the most aggressive growth in the bone, using an animal model.

 OUTLINE: Blood and bone marrow samples are collected and analyzed via flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

 Cells are also transplanted into mice and studied.

 Role of Hyaluronic Acid in Causing Cancer Stem Cell Growth in the Bones of Patients With Breast Cancer@highlight

This research trial studies the role of a substance called hyaluronic acid in causing the growth of cancer stem cells in the bones of patients with breast cancer.

 Cancer stem cells are a type of cancer cells that may cause the cancer to spread to other parts of the body.

 Studying samples of blood and bone marrow from patients and animal models in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about whether hyaluronic acid affects the growth of cancer in the bones.
