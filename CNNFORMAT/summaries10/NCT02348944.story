(secondQuint)Biological Variability in Cartilage Specific Biomarkers in Healthy Volunteers.

.

 To assess intra individual biological variability of serum and urinary cartilage specific biomarkers and define the best standardized conditions for blood and urine sampling in the frame of biomarkers dosage.

 Variation factors assessed are: - Fasting condition - Sampling time - Sampling season - Physical activity - Duration and temperature of total blood treatment - Type of blood collection tube.
