 A randomised clinical trial will be used consisting of 34 (17 in each group) athletes undergoing training.

 Both groups will undergo one hour of training three times weekly for six weeks, with one group doing dance training (DT) using the Xbox Kinect and the other doing standard training (ST) using traditional ladder drills.

 Outcomes will be assessed using the Illinois Agility test for agility, sit and reach test for general flexibility, straight leg raise test for hamstring flexibility and the Thomas test for hip flexor extensibility.

This study will examine the effects of six week dance training, using the Xbox Kinect Just Dance 2014 programme, on the agility scores along with general and hamstring flexibility and extensibility of the hip flexor.

 The effects of the dance programme will be compared with those of proven agility training techniques (ladder drills).
