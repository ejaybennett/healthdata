(fifthQuint)Safety and Performance of a Vascular Patch in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Bidirectional Cava-pulmonary Anastomosis.

 Xeltis has developed a medical device for treating pediatric cardiovascular patients requiring RVOT reconstruction.

 Xeltis' mission is to offer 'Solutions for a Lifetime' to cardiovascular patients.

 Xeltis has developed a unique technology based on novel biodegradable bio-materials allowing the regrowth of natural heart valves or blood vessels in patients' bodies from their own cells.

 The principle of Xeltis' COR technology (COR stands for Cardiovascular Organ Regeneration) is to implant a biodegradable prosthesis of a blood vessels that is shaped like the part to be replaced.

 The prosthesis is immediately mechanically functional, while its physiochemical characteristics should enable cell infiltration and tissue formation.

 Tissue is regenerated and functional by the time the polymer is biodegraded.

Xeltis developed biodegradable patch prosthesis, the Vascular Patch Model COR-VP-001, to be used as a vascular patch to augment the pulmonary trunk and pulmonary arteries.

 The prosthesis is immediately mechanically functional, while its physiochemical characteristics should enable cell infiltration and tissue formation.

 The Xeltis Vascular Graft Model COR-VP-001 is specifically designed to improve surgical outcomes by reducing synthetic material related complications and improving hemodynamic characteristics.
