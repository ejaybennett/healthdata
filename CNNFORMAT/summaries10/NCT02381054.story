 Translation, Cross-cultural Adaptation and Validation of PRO-CTCAE for Italian-speaking Cancer Patients@highlight

The purpose of this study is to see if the Italian language version of a questionnaire about symptoms that patients may have during cancer treatment is understandable to Italian speaking patients.

 The questionnaire is called the PRO-CTCAE, and was originally developed at the U.

S.

 National Cancer Institute to help get information about patients' symptoms directly from the patients themselves.

 The Italian version of the questionnaire will be used in future studies to gain a better understanding of patient symptoms.
