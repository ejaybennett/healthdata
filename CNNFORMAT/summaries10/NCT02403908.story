(thirdQuint)Catheter Denervation of Pulmonary Arteries in Treatment of IPAH & SPAH.

 METHODS: Patient population.

 Patients with IPAH and SPAH (defined as a mean PAP >25 mm Hg at rest) not responding optimally to current medical therapy (defined as a reduction of 10 mm Hg (as measured by the Swan-Ganz catheter), and there were no complications.

 The patients will be monitored in the intensive cardiac care unit for at least 24 h after the PADN procedure.

 Commercially available and approved radiofrequency technology for pulmonary vein isolation will be utilized for new clinical indication.

 Peri-procedural medications.

 An intravenous bolus of 5,000 U of unfractionated heparin will be given immediately following the insertion of the venous sheath.

 An additional approximately 2,000 to 3,000 U of heparin will be added if the procedural time exceeds 1 h.

 Following the procedure, oral warfarin will be prescribed and adjusted according to the international normalized ratio to be between 2 and 2.

5 for all patients.

 If there would be contraindications for warfarin, aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) will be prescribed indefinitely.

 Immediately after the PADN procedure, all medications (diuretics, sildenafil, bosentan, beraprost, digoxin etc.

) will be discontinued for 24h.

 Endpoints.

 The primary endpoints will be decrease in mean PAP and pulmonary vascular resistance at 3 and 6 months and improvement of functional capacity by the 6MWT.

 Clinical adverse events (including PA perforation/dissection, acute thrombus formation in the PA, all-cause death, rehospitalization due to PAH, and lung transplantation) will be secondary endpoints and will be assessed by an independent event committee.

 Statistical analysis.

 Continuous variables will be expressed as mean + SD.

 Differences in continuous variables between different time points in the PADN group will be analyzed using paired-sample Student t tests or Wilcoxon signed- rank sum tests, as appropriate nonparametric statistical methods.

 Each patient in the trial will serve as his/her own control before and after PADN and sham group patients as a control group of overall efficacy of the procedure.

 The categorical variables will be compared using the Fisher exact test.

 Statistical significance will be defined as a 2-sided p value < 0.

05.

 All of the analyses will be performed using WinStat statistical software package for Microsoft Excel, version 2009.

 Catheter Denervation of Pulmonary Arteries in Treatment of IPAH & SPAH@highlight

The aim of research proposal is to assess and compare the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency denervation of pulmonary arteries on decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) in 20 patients with IPAH (mean pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHg) and in 20 patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary disease or due to left heart disease not responding optimally to medical therapy.
