(fifthQuint)For Her Heart's Sake STEP Project: A Clinical Trial.

 Cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRPs) have been shown to improve outcomes following a cardiac event.

 Referrals to the CRP are a standard part of the community-based continuing care process within the Winnipeg region, to include automatic referrals for hospitalized patients, based on specific criteria, physician referrals and self-referrals.

 However, fewer women than men are referred to and participate in CRPs in Winnipeg.

 The investigators' study is unique in that the investigators plan to capture those women who may not be ready to change or participate in a traditional CRP.

 While women who are in the pre-contemplative or contemplative stages of change may not be ready to participate in a standard CRP, they may be willing to explore a complementary opportunity: the FHHS STEP Program.

 The overall goal of this project is to provide a collaborative team environment that will engage women; educate, and empower women; and provide women with the necessary personal resources to enable them to take the step towards a cardiac rehabilitation program and a life-long commitment to heart health.

 The investigators' 2-group randomized clinical trial will compare physiological and psychosocial outcomes among women completing a 12-week gender specific introduction to cardiac rehabilitation with non-program attenders.

The goal of the proposed project is to determine if providing an intervention for women who decline the invitation to participate in standard cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRPs) will ultimately result in an increase their participation in CRPs.

This study will evaluate outcomes of patients randomized to the FHHS STEP Program versus by non-STEP Program participants.

 The overall goal is to provide an alternate, introductory program that will engage, educate, and empower women following a cardiac event.

 Providing these women with the necessary personal resources will encourage and enable these women to take the step towards a cardiac rehabilitation program, which, in turn will ideally lead to a life-long commitment to heart health.
