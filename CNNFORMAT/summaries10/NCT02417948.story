(fifthQuint)Improving Sun-Protective Behaviors and Skin Self-Examinations Among African Americans.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess whether an educational brochure and online program will increase sun-protective behaviors among African-American patients who present at the general dermatology clinic.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess whether the educational brochure and online program will improve skills for skin self-examinations among African-American patients who present at the general dermatology clinic.

 OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

 ARM I: Participants receive a skin cancer educational and preventive brochure distributed by the National Cancer Institute and watch a 30-minute online tutorial video called X-Plain about skin cancer, preventative behaviors, and skin self-examinations.

 ARM II: Participants receive an educational brochure as in Arm I.

 After completion of study, participants are followed up at 30 days.

 Improving Sun-Protective Behaviors and Skin Self-Examinations Among African Americans@highlight

This randomized clinical trial uses an educational brochure and online tutorial program to assess sun-protective behavior and skin self-examination among African Americans.

 Skin cancer is very common among African Americans, with a disproportionately high mortality rate.

 Providing a brochure and an online educational program about sun-protective behaviors may encourage African Americans to take preventative measures against skin cancer, help improve early skin cancer detection, determine how far the disease has spread, and plan the best treatment.
