(fifthQuint)MNGIE Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Safety Study.

 Patients who have been identified as having MNGIE by genetic testing and/or reduced thymidine phosphorylase levels will be considered for this study.

 The study team physician will evaluate the condition of the patient and determine if they are eligible.

 An HLA matched donor is necessary for transplantation.

 If a suitable donor is found the transplant process can proceed.

 The patient receives immunosuppressive therapy ( 1 week in the hospital) with subsequent IV transfer of stem cells from the donor.

 The patient remains in the hospital for approximately 1 month to monitor the transplant.

 The patient is required to attend research visits at days 0, 100, 6m, 18m and 24 m.

 MNGIE Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Safety Study@highlight

The purpose of this study is to find out if a stem cell transplant is safe for patients with a very rare disease.

 The stem cell transplant is called AHSCT (for "allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation").

 The rare disease is called MNGIE (for "Mitochondrial NeuroGastroIntestinal Encephalomyopathy").

 Patients with MNGIE will be transplanted with stem cells from an individual who is human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 10/10 matched.

 The purpose of the transplant is the production of thymidine phosphorylase.
