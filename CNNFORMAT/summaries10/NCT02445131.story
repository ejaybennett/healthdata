(secondQuint)Sequential Regimen of Bendamustine-Debulking Followed by CAL-101 and GA101-Induction and -Maintenance in CLL (CLL2-BCG).

 In the CLL2-BCG-trial, a total of 62 patients of an allcomer CLL population (irrespective of physical fitness, previous therapies and prognostic factors) with an indication for treatment will be included.

 Patients will receive 2 cycles of debulking treatment with bendamustine unless contraindications (e.

g.

 refractoriness) are present or a debulking is not indicated due to a low tumor burden.

 Afterwards, 6 cycles of induction treatment with GA101 (obinutuzumab, 3 doses in the first cycle and monthly in cycles 2-6) and CAL-101 (idelalisib, continuously starting in cycle 2) will be applied.

 The primary endpoint overall response rate will be assessed at final restaging (2 months after end of induction treatment).

 Patients benefitting from treatment receive further therapy with GA101 (3 monthly) and CAL-101 (continuously) in a maintenance phase for up to 24 months.

 Maintenance treatment will be stopped in case of achievement of a complete remission and confirmation of MRD (minimal residual disease) negativity in peripheral blood or if unacceptable toxicity or progression occurs.

The CLL2-BCG-trial is a prospective, open-label, multicenter phase-II-trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a sequential regimen of a debulking with bendamustine followed by an induction with GA101 (obinutuzumab) and CAL-101 (idelalisib) followed by CAL-101 and GA101-maintenance in CLL patients
