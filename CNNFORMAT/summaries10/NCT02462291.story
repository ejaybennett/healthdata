(fifthQuint)New Approach for Treatment of Behavioral Disorders in Alzheimer's Disease (Alzheimer's Behavioral and Cognitive Disorders).

 Since Homo sapiens evolved in a natural environment, an intrinsic physiologic and psychological positive reaction to nature has been developed.

 Accordingly, emerging literature highlights the positive effect of therapeutic gardens, as environmental ecological therapy (EET) on the reduction of behavioral disorders (BD) and the preservation of cognitive functions in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

 Despite these promising preliminary studies, limited data are available on the effectiveness of EET in individuals with advanced AD.

 Therefore, the aim of the current trial will be to evaluate the effectiveness of EET on AD symptoms in patients with advanced AD.

 Participants with advanced AD will be selected from among residents of the Alzheimer's care units of the Mons.

 Mazzali Foundation (Mantua, Italy).

 Selected participants will be randomly assigned to a treatment group (TR), or to a control group (CTRL).

 Participants assigned to TR group will perform a program of EET for 2 hours a day, 5 days a week for a total of 6 months.

 Individuals assigned to the CTRL group will be treated with a standard therapy.

 New Approach for Treatment of Behavioral Disorders in Alzheimer's Disease (Alzheimer's Behavioral and Cognitive Disorders)@highlight

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent form of dementia, causing high level of disability with elevated social costs.

 Alternative solutions to the standard pharmacological therapies have been studied in order to reduce the use of medications that frequently generates side effects and worsen patients' quality of life.

 A recent alternative treatment for AD is the Environmental Ecological Therapy (EET) that, with the use of therapeutic gardens, seems to reduce behavioral disorders (BD).

 However, the effectiveness of this approach is still mater of debate.

 Therefore, the aim of this trial will be to analyze the effects of EET, in people with severe AD.
