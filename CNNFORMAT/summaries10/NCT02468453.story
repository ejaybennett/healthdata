(secondQuint)VELOS for the Treatment of Vascular Lesions and Skin Rejuvenation.

 The primary objective of this trial is to collect data from the use of VELOS in clinical practice under a wide range of treatment parameters variability including RF energy, laser fluence, and laser pulse duration for treating each of the vascular disorders.

 This will be conducted by documenting the physician selected treatment parameters, as well as the subjects' clinical clearing response, perception of improvement and sensations, through the study treatments and post-treatment(s) follow-up visits.

 Optional exploratory objectives: Collection of safety and efficacy data of the Velos with DCD cooling and Velos with contact cooling.

 The investigator may opt to include in this study noninvasive measurements of erythema, melanin and texture (which may be performed by eg.

 Chromameter, Mexameter or 3D imaging), and measurements of linear vessel diameters and lesion size.
