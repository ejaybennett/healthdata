(secondQuint)The Utility of Second Generation Colon Capsule Endoscopy in Ulcerative Colitis.

 Consecutive patients with ulcerative colitis will be recruited.

 Second generation colon capsule endoscopy (C2) and conventional colonoscopy will be performed one after another on the same day.

 Colonic mucosal inflammation will be scaled by physicians who review C2 videos and those who perform conventional colonosocpies independently.

 Physicians who review C2 videos and colonoscopists will be blinded to the findings of colonoscopies and C2 videos, respectively.

The accuracy of C2 in evaluating mucosal inflammation will be evaluated, using conventional endoscopy as the gold standard.
