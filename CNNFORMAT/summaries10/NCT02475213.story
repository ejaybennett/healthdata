(fifthQuint)Safety Study of Enoblituzumab (MGA271) in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Refractory Cancer.

 This study is a Phase 1 open-label, dose escalation, cohort expansion, and efficacy follow-up study of enoblituzumab administered intravenously (IV) on a weekly schedule for up to 51 doses in combination with IV pembrolizumab administered on an every-3-week schedule for up to 17 doses.

 The dose escalation phase is designed to characterize the safety and tolerability of the combination of enoblituzumab and pembrolizumab and to define the maximum tolerated or maximum administered dose (MTD/MAD).

 Patients with methothelioma, urethelial cancer, NSCLC, SCCHN, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ovarian cancer, melanoma, thyroid cancer, triple negative breast cancer (TBNC), pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, or prostate cancer will be enrolled in this study phase.

 During the Cohort Expansion Phase, additional cohorts of patients with B7-H3 expressing unresectable, locally-advanced or metastatic melanoma (up to n=16), 2 cohorts of NSCLC (n= up to 20 in each cohort), 2 cohorts of SCCHN (up to n=20 in each cohort) or urothelial cancer (up to n=16) will be enrolled to receive MGA271 in combination with pembrolizumab at the MTD (or MAD) established from the Dose Escalation Phase of the study.

 The efficacy follow-up period consists of the 2-year period after the final dose of study drug.

 All tumor evaluations will be carried out by both Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and immune-related response criteria (irRC).

 Safety Study of Enoblituzumab (MGA271) in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Refractory Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of enoblituzumab (MGA271) in combination with Keytruda (pembrolizumab) when given to patients with B7-H3-expressing melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Urothelial Cancer and other B7-H3 expressing cancers.

 The study will also evaluate what is the highest dose of enoblituzumab that can be given safely when given with pembrolizumab.

 Assessments will also be done to see how the drug acts in the body (pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics) and to evaluate potential anti-tumor activity of MGA271 in combination with pembrolizumab.
