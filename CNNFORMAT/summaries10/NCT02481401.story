 Aim 1 - Pilot, 1st Year: To identify the contextual factors, facilitators and barriers that may impact the implementation of a lifestyle intervention program for adults in Harlem, using qualitative research methods: 1) focus group discussions among a representative cohort of adults; 2) focus group discussions among community leaders; and 3) Pilot studies of feasibility of interventions in the representative cohort of adults.

 Subsidiary Aim 1.

1: To use identified facilitators and barriers to develop a contextually and culturally appropriate model for an adult lifestyle intervention program.

 Subsidiary Aim 1.

2: To implement a pilot intervention of the contextually and culturally adapted program among a sample of parents/caregivers of children in preschools in Harlem.

 The investigators will assess for acceptability and feasibility, and make any necessary modifications prior to the implementation of the cluster-randomized trial.

 This aim will be carried out at 2 preschools in Harlem, NY by including the parents and caregivers of pre-school children.

 The final intervention program that results from this intervention-mapping program will be piloted in parent groups of 10.

 Aim 2 - Randomization, 2nd and 3rd Year: To determine (i) the impact of two intensive lifestyle interventions on promoting and improving healthy behaviors (increased physical activity, smoking cessation etc.

) and biological parameters (lipids, sugar) to lower cardiovascular risk, (ii) the impact of the presence of atherosclerosis on health behaviors and (iii) the impact of the lifestyle interventions on atherosclerosis among approximately 600 asymptomatic at-risk adults.

 Hypothesis: Adults receiving the lifestyle intervention programs will demonstrate a greater improvement in healthy behaviors and biological parameters compared to controls whose intervention has only been received through the Children program.

 Hypothesis: Knowledge of presence of atherosclerosis as defined by 3D US will lead to greater improvement in healthy behaviors.

 Hypothesis: Adults receiving the lifestyle intervention programs will demonstrate a lesser progression or regression of 3-D ultrasound quantified atherosclerosis compared to controls.

 For this aim, the investigators will recruit parents and caregivers of pre-school children from up to twenty schools in Harlem, NY and perform a 2:1 (2 intervention, 1 control) cluster randomization of the schools.

 Those in the "intensive intervention" group will be randomly assigned to one of two interventions- an Intensive Individual Intervention Program" (IIIP) developed through the intervention mapping program described in aim 1 or 'Peer-To-Peer Program - Intervention" (PPPI), refined during that same pilot phase.

 The intervention program will continue for 24 months.

 Assessments will be performed at 6 months (early-effect), 12 months (interim-effect) at the end of the intervention (peak-effect).

 The outcome will be a composite score consisting of a 0-3 scale for behaviors/outcomes related to Blood pressure, Exercise, Weight, Alimentation (diet) and Tobacco (smoking) [Fuster-BEWAT score].

 Participants will also undergo point of care testing for a lipid panel and blood sugar assessment, and a 3-D ultrasound (US) imaging (carotid, ileo-femoral) to assess for presence of atherosclerosis.

 The results of the 3-D ultrasound will be shared with participants to evaluate its impact on behavior change.

 Aim 3 - Sustainability, 4th Year: To evaluate the sustainability of the impact of the two intensive lifestyle interventions on healthy behaviors and biological parameters 12 months after the intervention program ends.

 Hypothesis: Adult caregivers receiving the intensive lifestyle approaches program for two years, will maintain sustainability with an advantage of the two "Intensive Interventional groups" over the control "Traditional Health Education" group.

 All participants will be followed for 12 months after the end of the intervention period and reassess their Fuster-BEWAT Score.

Two Intensive Life Style Intervention Programs in Related Caregivers of Preschool Children Substantial strides have been made in the treatment of acute cardiovascular conditions, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, however, the global burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to rise at an alarming rate.

 Furthermore, despite the abundant data demonstrating a greater burden of CVD in racial/ethnic minorities, and many specific interventions aimed at changing risk factor patterns or behaviors in racial/ethnic minorities, health disparities persist.

 In the present study, the investigators seek to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted and comprehensive lifestyle intervention coupled with atherosclerosis imaging on reducing cardiovascular risk among minority adults living in Harlem, New York.

 The investigators believe that holistic, multi-dimensional individual and peer-to-peer intensive lifestyle interventions involving parents/caregivers of preschool children will be effective in producing favorable change in their behaviors, which will be sustained over time.

 The primary hypothesis of the study is that aggressive lifestyle interventions will be more effective in improving healthy behaviors and biological correlates in at-risk adult parents and/or caregivers of preschool children in Harlem, NY.

 In aim 1, as an initial pilot study, the investigators will identify the contextual factors, facilitators and barriers that may impact the implementation of a lifestyle intervention program for adults in Harlem, using qualitative research methods.

 In aim 2, the investigators will determine the impact of two intensive lifestyle interventions on promoting and improving healthy behaviors and biological parameters to lower cardiovascular risk, the impact of the knowledge of presence of atherosclerosis on health behaviors and the impact of these lifestyle interventions on atherosclerosis among approximately 600 asymptomatic at-risk adults.

 Finally, in aim 3, the investigators will evaluate the sustainability of the impact of the two intensive lifestyle interventions on healthy behaviors and biological parameters 12 months after the intervention program ends.
