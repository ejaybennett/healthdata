(fifthQuint)Testing the Feasibility of Intervening to Optimize Chiropractic Care for Adults With Neck Pain Disorders.

 The aim of this pilot study project is to determine the feasibility of implementing a multifaceted KT intervention to promote the use of multimodal care by chiropractors managing patients with NSNP.

 Design: Cluster randomized controlled pilot and feasibility trial.

 Chiropractors in private practice in Canada will be randomized to receive either a theory-based tailored KT intervention in the experimental group or simply a printed copy of the guideline in the control group.

 Study population and sample size: 30 chiropractors will be recruited from a random, nationally representative sample of 200 chiropractors.

 Each chiropractor will recruit five neck pain patients for a total of 150 patients.

 The design of the KT intervention was informed by the results of a related qualitative study (Theoretical Domains Framework interviews) and consists of a series of three webinars, two online case scenarios, a self-management video on Brief Action Planning (BAP) and a printed copy of the practice guideline (Bussieres et al.

, 2015).

 Primary feasibility outcomes for both chiropractors and patients include rates of: 1) recruitment, 2) study retention, and 3) adherence to the intervention (Tickle-Degnen, 2013).

 A checklist of proxy measures embedded within patient encounter forms will be used to assess chiropractors' compliance with guideline recommendations e.

g.

, exercise and self-care prescriptions, at study onset and at three months follow-up.

 Secondary outcomes include whether or not the chiropractor's recommended multimodal care, scores on measures of behavioural constructs e.

g.

, self-efficacy, knowledge.

 Primary clinical outcomes for patients includes measures of pain intensity and neck pain-specific disability.

 Analyses from this pilot study will focus on generating point estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for parameters of a priori interest (e.

g.

, recruitment, retention, adherence, pain intensity, neck disability index).

 Discussion: The main strength of this study includes its use of a representative sample and randomized controlled design.

 The results of this study will inform the design of a larger cluster randomized controlled trial aimed at confirming the effectiveness and increasing the use of multimodal care by chiropractors managing patients with NSNP.

 Testing the Feasibility of Intervening to Optimize Chiropractic Care for Adults With Neck Pain Disorders@highlight

To assess the feasibility of conducting a larger cluster randomized controlled trial to facilitate the effectiveness of a complex Knowledge Translation (KT) intervention, i.

e.

 implementation of multimodal care, into chiropractic clinical practice, designed to improve the management of patients with Non-Specific Neck Pain (NSNP) disorders.

 To evaluate feasibility, the investigators will ascertain how well participating chiropractors and patients adhere to the study protocol and will solicit feedback from them about the overall usefulness of the content and format of the KT intervention.

 This study will determine planning for the main study and also the outcomes to be used as a primary outcome.
