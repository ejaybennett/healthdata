(secondQuint)Amantadine to Speed Awakening After Cardiac Arrest.

 Amantadine has been used to help patients awaken following traumatic brain injury, but it has not been studied in patients with anoxic brain injury.

 Amantadine is a dopamine agonist and may help with stimulating the brain to awaken.

 The investigators will randomize subjects who remain comatose 72 hours following resuscitation from cardiac arrest to either amantadine or placebo.

 They will be treated with either amantadine or placebo for 7 days.
