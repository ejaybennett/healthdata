(firstQuint)Lung Dose in Patients Treated With Yttrium-90 for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 To calculate the delivered lung dose using quantitative volumetric analysis in a cohort of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who undergo selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with Yttrium-90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere(R))-and compare this analysis to the lung dose estimated by established criteria.

 In addition, this study, will summarize the pre and post-treatment clinical data to describe the URMC Y-90 experience.
