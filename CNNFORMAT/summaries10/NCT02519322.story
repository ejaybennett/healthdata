(fifthQuint)Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Checkpoint Blockade in Patients With Clinical Stage III or Oligometastatic Stage IV Melanoma.

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups.

 This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

 You will have an equal (1 in 2) chance of being assigned to either of the groups: - If you are in Group A, you will receive nivolumab every 2 weeks (+/- 7 days) for a total of 4 doses and then you will have surgery.

 After that, you will receive nivolumab for an additional 6 months.

 - If you are in Group B, you will receive nivolumab (+/- 7 days) and ipilimumab every 3 weeks for 3 doses and then you will have surgery.

 After that, you will receive nivolumab alone for 6 months.

 You and the study staff will know to which group you have been assigned.

 Study Drug Administration: If you are in Group A, you will receive nivolumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Days 1, 15, 29, and 43.

 You will then have surgery.

 After surgery, you will receive nivolumab by vein every 2 weeks (+/- 7 days) for 6 months (13 doses).

 If you are in Group B, you will receive nivolumab by vein over about 1 hour and ipilimumab by vein over about 90 minutes on Days 1, 22, and 43.

 You will then have surgery.

 After surgery, you will receive nivolumab by vein every 2 weeks (+/- 7 days) for 6 months (13 doses).

 If treatment needs to be delayed more than two weeks because of safety reasons, the next dose(s) can be skipped.

 However, once you are able to begin treatment again and the disease appears to be responding, you can remain on the study and can proceed with surgery as planned.

 Study Visits: Group A Before Surgery: On Day 1: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 3 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests On Days 15 and 29: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 6 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for tests of the immune system.

 - You will have a tumor biopsy for biomarker testing on Day 15.

 Biomarkers are found in blood and tissue and may be related to your reaction to the study drug.

 On Day 43: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 3 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests On Day 57: - You will have an EKG.

 - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 6 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and tests of the immune system.

 - You will have a CT scan, PET-CT scan, or MRI to check the status of the disease.

 If the doctor thinks the disease can still be removed through surgery, you will then have surgery in the following week.

 If the disease is no longer able to be treated with surgery, you will be taken off study.

 Your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.

 - If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1/2 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for pregnancy test.

 Group B Before Surgery: On Day 1: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 6 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for tests of the immune system.

 On Days 22 and 43: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 6 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for tests of the immune system.

 - You will have a tumor biopsy for biomarker testing on Day 22.

 On Day 57: - You will have an EKG.

 - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 6 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for tests of the immune system.

 - You will have a CT scan, PET-CT scan, or MRI to check the status of the disease.

 If the doctor thinks the disease can still be removed through surgery, you will then have surgery in the following week.

 If the disease is no longer able to be treated with surgery, you will be taken off study.

 Your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.

 - If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1/2 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for pregnancy test.

 Surgery (All Participants): On Day 57 you will have surgery to remove the disease.

 You will sign a surgery consent form that describes the procedure and its risks.

 Tissue will be collected at time of surgery for research to test for any remaining melanoma cells and to check the status of the disease.

 Study Visits After Surgery for All Participant: Every 2 weeks after you recover from surgery (every time you receive nivolumab): - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 3 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 At the following visits additional tests and procedures will be performed: - At Weeks 10, 22, and 34 after surgery, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will also be drawn for tests of the immune system.

 - At Weeks 12, 22 and 34 after surgery, you will have a CT scan, PET-CT scan, or MRI to check the status of the disease.

 Length of Treatment: You may receive up to 13 doses of nivolumab after you have surgery.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

 End-of-Treatment Visit: When you stop receiving nivolumab , or if you have an intolerable side effect, you will have an end-of-treatment visit.

 The following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 6 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and tests of the immune system.

 - You will have a CT scan, PET-CT scan, or MRI to check the status of the disease.

 Follow-Up Visits: Every 12 weeks after your last dose of drug(s): - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for tests of the immune system.

 - You will have a CT scan, PET-CT scan, or MRI to check the status of the disease.

 The study staff will contact you for follow-up, for up to 2 years after surgery.

 You will be asked about your health status, any anti-cancer therapy you receive (including radiation), and how the disease may be responding to therapy.

 If you need to stop receiving treatment early, the study staff will contact you to check you health status every 3 months until you start a new treatment for melanoma.

 This follow-up contact may be done in-person, if you continue treatment at MD Anderson.

 If not you will be contacted by phone, email or letter.

 Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Checkpoint Blockade in Patients With Clinical Stage III or Oligometastatic Stage IV Melanoma@highlight

You are being asked to take part in this study because you have melanoma that is metastatic (has spread) and you are going to have surgery to remove the disease.

 The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving nivolumab alone or in combination with ipilimumab before and after surgery can help to control metastatic melanoma.

 The safety of these drugs will also be studied.

 This is an investigational study.

 Ipilimumab and nivolumab are FDA approved and commercially available to treat metastatic melanoma.

 It is investigational to give the drugs in combination before and after surgery.

 The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

 Up to 38 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 Up to 32 will take part at MD Anderson.
