(thirdQuint)Does Using a Low Vision Aid Device Improve Quality of Life in Glaucoma Patients?.

 Participants will be expected to attend 2 appointments at Wills Eye (baseline and final visit) and document their daily impression about the use of OrCam, over a 1-month period.

 During the participant's baseline visit, the patient will be trained on how to use the OrCam device by the research assistants.

 The Wills Eye trainer will be trained directly by OrCam before training participants.

 The subject will complete a best-corrected visual acuity assessment (ETDRS) and complete the NEI-VFQ-25.

 They will also read a short printout of an online newspaper article.

 The NEI-VFQ-25 includes a series of 25 questions pertaining to vision or feelings about a vision condition.

 Answers are selected among a numbered list of possible responses, the values of which are ultimately recoded and converted to a 0 to 100 scale so that the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100 points, respectively.

 Items within each subscale are averaged together to create 12 subscale scores.

10 An overall composite score will be calculated by averaging the vision-targeted subscale scores, excluding the general health rating question.

 Participants will read a short article.

 They will be asked to grade their difficulty reading between 1 (unable to read) to 10 (able to read without difficulty).

 The time that will be required to complete the reading of the article will be recorded.

 This task will be performed with best correction - with and without the assistance of the OrCam device.

 After training and baseline visit, the subjects will utilize OrCam daily for one month.

 Each week, subjects will record their thoughts about the device in the log book.

 The log book will be filled by writing or using an audio tape recorder, according to the patient's personal preference.

 The following topics will be addressed: average number of hours using OrCam daily, fields in which vision-related quality of life has improved, fields in which OrCam did not improve vision-related quality of life, problems using OrCam, and general feelings on the device.

 Additionally, a research assistant will call the participants weekly to discuss the topics and address any other concerns.

 After this month-long period, the subjects will return to Wills Eye Hospital to undergo their final assessment.

 Best-corrected visual acuity (ETDRS), NEI-VFQ-25, and the newspaper-reading task will be completed again with and without the assistance of OrCam.

 A satisfaction questionnaire will also be completed in order to assess the subjects' overall feelings on OrCam.

 The audio log books will be analyzed for the listed specific factors and recorded by a research assistant.

To determine the impact of OrCam on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in subjects with advanced glaucoma over 1 month and to assess health-related quality of life using the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire 25 (NEI-VFQ-25).

 To determine the tasks for which the subjects are using the OrCam device and patient satisfaction and to analyze qualitative data from weekly patient logs, in order to determine efficacy of OrCam.
