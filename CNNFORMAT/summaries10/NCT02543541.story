 A Pilot Study of Structured Palliative Care for Patients Enrolled on Phase I Clinical Trials@highlight

The goal of this research study is to find out if providing patients who are enrolled in phase 1 clinical trials with structured supportive care will enable them to continue in the Phase 1 trial longer and improve their quality of life by reducing or treating side effects and by providing emotional and social support to the patient and family.

 The structured supportive or palliative care intervention will be provided by a team of trained specialists which include doctors, nurses, social workers and spiritual care providers.

 The supportive care team will provide treatment to address symptoms, such as pain or anxiety, caused by the cancer itself or from the treatment.

 The team can make referrals to other specialists.

 Such as psychologists or nutritionist, if needed, and can help arrange for services to address home care needs.
