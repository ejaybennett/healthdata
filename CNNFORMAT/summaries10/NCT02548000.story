(thirdQuint)Diabetes Resistance Training Adaptations in Elderly.

 Resistance training may be an interesting strategy to fight diabetes deleterious conditions, as it is known to increase muscle mass and quality, strength, functional capacity, vascular health, and decrease inflammation status and blood lipids, besides leading to improves in glycemic control.

 To test this hypothesis, 42 diabetic patients will be recruited and randomized to two groups that will be evaluated before and after 12 weeks of both intervention or control period.

 The resistance training group will perform all body resistance exercises three times per week, while the control group will perform a stretching session one time per week.

 Diabetes Resistance Training Adaptations in Elderly@highlight

This study aims to verify the effects of resistance training on neuromuscular, vascular and functional adaptations of elderly diabetics type 2.

 Half of participants will be the intervention group that will perform resistance training, while the other half will be the control group that will perform stretching sessions.
