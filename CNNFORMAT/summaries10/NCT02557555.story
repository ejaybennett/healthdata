(thirdQuint)Patient Education on Labor Analgesia Options.

 Many analgesic options exist for laboring parturients, but labor may not be the best time to start informing patients of their options.

 Many patients begin the labor process with a plan in place for their analgesia.

 Unfortunately, internet resources regarding labor analgesia that are available to the lay parturient are poor and often lead to misconceptions about the options and their risks.

 A significant number of patients refuse neuraxial analgesia based on misunderstandings, concerns about the procedure, or a lack of faith in the provider.

 Some women want a "natural childbirth" and/or control over their labor experience.

 Forty-seven percent of minority women feel inadequately educated about anesthesia, are less likely to trust physicians, and are less likely to receive epidurals.

 However, greater than 10% of obese women changed their preference toward epidural analgesia following antenatal consultation.

 Also, 50% of patients planning for analgesia-free labor request neuraxial analgesia after experiencing labor pain.

3 Additionally, the question exists as to the quality of informed consent from a patient undergoing contraction pain and possible sedation from analgesic medications.

 The consensus is that parturients can provide informed consent.

 However, the process of informed consent for labor analgesia is not standardized; the options and risks presented to patients are dependent upon the individual practitioner obtaining the consent.

 Regarding epidurals, patients want to be informed of all risks and complications associated with the procedure.

 The patient's recall of the risks and benefits of the epidural procedure improved by 50% with written material in addition to verbal discussion, and recall improved by more than a factor of five when consent during labor was preceded by antenatal education.

 Parturients want a "pre-operative" visit with an anesthesiologist and have a strong desire for pre-labor education of anesthesia/analgesia options.

 Early antenatal education allows for time to teach, relieves anxiety, develops rapport, and provides opportunities for additional testing, if needed.

 Finally, the timing of epidural placement has not been shown to change outcomes, but when initiated late in the labor process, often other analgesia modalities were used that confounded the analysis of outcomes.

 Therefore, earlier request, which may come with prior knowledge and avoidance of misconceptions, and earlier placement of epidurals may lead to fewer analgesic interventions in the parturient and possibly less morbidity for the patient and fetus.

 The investigators will provide information of available labor analgesia options (epidural, combined spinal/epidural, spinal, remifentanil patient-controlled analgesia, and intravenous opioids) to expecting mothers.

 Using a pamphlet written in English or Spanish disseminated to pregnant women in clinic and upon arrival in the labor and delivery unit, the procedures and their risks and benefits will be explained in simple terms.

 In the Labor and Delivery Unit the patients will have an opportunity to ask questions of the anesthesia care giver regarding the options for analgesia.

 After delivery while on F Green, patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire addressing their thoughts about the pamphlets and their overall satisfaction with their labor analgesia.

 The analysis will focus on the utility and effect of education materials on maternal informed consent for labor analgesia, on maternal choice of analgesia modality, and on maternal anxiety regarding their labor analgesia plan.

 Patient Education on Labor Analgesia Options@highlight

The purpose of this study is to learn how the investigators can better educate pregnant patients about the options open to them for pain relief during labor.

 Patients will receive educational pamphlet during prenatal clinic visit and again on admission to labor and delivery.

 The options for analgesia will be discussed by anesthesia care provider.

 Patient will be asked to complete a survey on the post partum unit.
