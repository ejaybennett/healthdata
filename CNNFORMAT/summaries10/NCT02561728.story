(fifthQuint)Hanger Helmet Study.

 The use of helmet therapy to correct abnormal head shape due to either positional plagiocephaly secondary to pressure on the posterior skull with infant position and furniture use or after minimally invasive surgery for craniosynostosis is currently the treatment of choice at Cincinnati Children's Hospital (CCHMC).

 Helmet treatment in children with positional plagiocephaly is initiated for infants between 4 and 9 months of age (at CCHMC).

 Helmet treatment for children undergoing surgery for craniosynostosis is initiated following endoscopic cranial vault and stip craniectomy surgery after swelling from the surgery has subsided (generally within two weeks of surgery).

 Treatment with helmet therapy has been shown to improve head shape in both patient diagnoses.

 There are two types of helmets available to the investigators' patients (Hanger Helmet and P Pod Helmet) and to date, no research has evaluated whether one helmet type is more efficient in reshaping the skull than the other type.

 The current study seeks to fill this gap in the literature by comparing the outcomes for infants treated with a Hanger Helmet to the outcomes for infants treated with a P Pod Helmet.

 The investigators will measure skull symmetry with a 3dMD camera and take routine cross lateral measurements with a caliper designed for this use.

 Infants participating in the study will be randomized using a computerized program, Minim.

 Hanger Helmet Study@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine a group of patients requiring helmet therapy (either patients with plagiocephaly or post-surgical patients) to compare outcomes of infants treated with the Hanger helmet (Hanger, Inc.

) to outcomes of infants treated with the P Pod Helmet (Lorica Scientific, LLC).

 Currently both helmets are prescribed at CCHMC.

 The investigators' goal is to determine which helmet is more effective in skull remodeling and to standardize the investigators' care for these patient types.
