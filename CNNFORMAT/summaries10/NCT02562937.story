(secondQuint)Reducing Sedentary Behaviour in University Students Using Text Messages.

 Sedentary behaviour (SB) has been linked to many health problems (e.

g.

, type 2 diabetes, heart disease).

 Interventions aimed at office workers, overweight and obese individuals have proven successful in reducing SB; however, no studies have examined university students.

Text message-based interventions have succeeded to aid in smoking cessation and increase both physical activity and healthy eating, but have not been shown to reduce SB.

 Eighty-two university students were randomized into intervention (SB related text messages) or control (text messages unrelated to SB) groups.

 Participants received daily text messages and reported various SBs (i.

e.

, breaks from sitting, standing, light and moderate intensity physical activity) at four time points (baseline, 2, 4 and 6 weeks).

The primary purpose of the current study was to determine whether a text message intervention would increase break frequency and length of break from sitting, time spent standing, and time spent in light and moderate intensity physical activity in university students
