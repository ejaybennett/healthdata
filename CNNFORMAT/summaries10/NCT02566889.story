(thirdQuint)An Efficacy and Safety Study of Infliximab Dose Escalation in Pediatric Participants With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

 This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), prospective (study following participants forward in time), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study of infliximab in pediatric participants with inflammatory bowel disease.

 The study consists of 3 Phases: screening Phase (up to 4 weeks), open-label treatment Phase (56 weeks) and follow up safety Phase (8 weeks).

 The duration of participation in the study for each participant is approximately up to 68 weeks (including screening period).

 Participants' efficacy and safety outcomes will be monitored throughout the study.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether trough serum infliximab concentrations at the time of loss of clinical response will identify pediatric participants with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who would benefit (regain clinical response) from dose escalation above the currently approved dose [5 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg) every 8 weeks (q8wk)] and the safety of that dose escalation.
