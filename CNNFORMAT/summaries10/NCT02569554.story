(secondQuint)PPI And Food Effect Study For PF-06463922 In Healthy Volunteers.

 PF-06463922 is a selective, ATP competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) positive (ALK+) or ROS oncogene 1 (ROS1) positive (ROS1+) receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) that also potently inhibits ALK kinase domain mutations responsible for resistance to crizotinib.

 PF-06463922 is being developed as a novel anticancer agent for the treatment of patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC or ROS1+ NSCLC.

 The current study is a Phase 1, randomized, open label, 4 period, 4 treatment, 4 sequence, crossover study conducted in healthy adult subjects.

 Each subject will receive four single oral doses of 100 mg PF-06463922 as tablets alone, tablets with food, tablets with rabeprazole, and oral solution after overnight fasting with at least a 10 day washout period between each PF-06463922 dose.

 Twenty four (24) subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 20 evaluable subjects who complete all treatments.

 Subjects who withdraw will not be replaced unless the total number of completed subjects falls below 20.
