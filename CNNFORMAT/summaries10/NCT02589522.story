(fifthQuint)VX-970 and Whole Brain Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases From Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Small Cell Lung Cancer, or Neuroendocrine Tumors.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To conduct a phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of twice weekly intravenous (i.

v.

) VX-970 administered concurrent with conventionally fractionated whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), with VX-970 starting 18-30 hours after the first dose of radiation (but prior to the second fraction of radiation).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To estimate the incidence of >= grade 3 delayed neurological toxicity at 2, 4 and 6-months post-completion of whole-brain radiotherapy (for patients without intracranial progression).

 II.

 To estimate the radiological response rates (RR) at 6 months including bi-directional and volumetric measurements of lesion size.

 III.

 To estimate the intracranial 6-month progression-free survival (PFS).

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Changes in dynamic susceptibility contrast enhancement (DSC-magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) perfusion and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI).

 (Group I) II.

 To measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VX-970 levels, tumor VX-970 levels, and pATR T1989, pCHK1 S345 and RAD51 multiplex foci.

 (Group II) III.

 Changes in DSC-MRI perfusion and mean ADC measurements in DWI.

 (Group II) OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970.

 Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

 GROUP I: Patients undergo whole-brain radiation therapy once daily (QD), 5 days a week for 15 fractions.

 Patients also receive ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes twice a week, 18-30 hours after first radiation therapy.

 Treatment continues for 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 GROUP II: Patients receive ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 IV over 60-90 minutes 2-4 hours prior to surgery.

 After surgery, patients undergo whole-brain radiation therapy and receive ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 as in Group I.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months, every 3-4 months for 6 months, then every 6 months for 1 year.

 VX-970 and Whole Brain Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases From Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Small Cell Lung Cancer, or Neuroendocrine Tumors@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 (VX-970) when given together with whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, or neuroendocrine tumors that have spread from the original (primary) tumor to the brain.

 ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.

 Giving ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 together with radiation therapy may be a better treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, or neuroendocrine tumors.
