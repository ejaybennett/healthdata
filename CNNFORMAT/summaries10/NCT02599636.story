(fifthQuint)To Survive After ICU Discharge.

 Material and Methods This observational multicenter study will be done in 21 medical-surgical ICUs.

 We will use Sabadell Score like prognostic scale at ICU discharge and the intensivist will collaborate with the medical team in medical assistance of patients at risk (Sabadell Score 1 and 2).

 Investigators will compare the hospital mortality and the readmission rate with a previous period when this collaboration didn't exist.

 Anticipate results The collaboration of attending intensivist might reduce ward mortality after ICU discharge by 3%.

 To Survive After ICU Discharge@highlight

Many factors before and after ICU stay determine the outcome of patients at ICU discharge, the type of illness, physical dependence and other sequelae can be a trigger for complications in hospital ward which can induce ICU readmission and worse outcome.

 The quality of medical assistance during all the hospitalisation should be guaranteed and many complications or fatal events could be avoidable.

 The objective of the present study is to demonstrate that collaboration between the intensivist and other medical teams in ward can reduce ICU readmission and hospital mortality after ICU discharge.
