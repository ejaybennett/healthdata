(fifthQuint)68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI in Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate 68Ga-RM2 (formerly known as DOTA bombesin or BAY 86-7548) PET/MRI for detection of recurrent prostate cancer after initial therapy in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and non-contributory computed tomography (CT).

 OUTLINE: Patients receive 68Ga-RM2 intravenously (IV) and beginning 45 minutes later undergoing PET/MRI scan.

 The 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI may be repeated at the completion of treatment to evaluate response to therapy, if requested by the treating physician.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24-48 hours and then at 1 year.

This phase II/III trial studies how well gallium (Ga) 68-labeled gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) antagonist BAY86-7548 (68Ga-RM2) positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) works in detecting prostate cancer in patients with negative computed tomography (CT) scan and elevated prostate-specific antigen levels after treatment with surgery or radiation.

 PET/MRI scans take both PET and MRI images at the same time and combine them into a single picture and is used to describe information regarding the function, as well as location and size of a tumor.

 68Ga-RM2, a compound made of a radioactive agent linked to a pharmacological substance that is strongly attracted by a substance made by tumor cells, to detect prostate cancer.

 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI may be able to see smaller tumors than the standard of care contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan
