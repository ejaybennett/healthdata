(thirdQuint)Cardiopulmonary Fitness in Long-Term Survivors of HPV-related Oropharynx Cancers.

 The goal of this study is not to test the impact of a specific intervention, but rather to evaluate the long-term cardiovascular health and quality of life of oropharyngeal cancer survivors using validated survey instruments, cardiopulmonary testing, and measurements of cardiac risk factors.

 Thus, no intervention, other than the assessments will be administered as part of the protocol.

 All participants will have received treatment according to the standard of care or a therapeutic clinical trial in which they may have participated previously.

 We will collect information about prior treatment from the electronic medical record (EMR).
