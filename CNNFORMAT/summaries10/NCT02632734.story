(fifthQuint)The Use of CoreBone Coral Particles vs.

 Cones for Preservation of Alveolar Bone.

 Normally, dentists do not graft the socket after extraction of teeth.

 When they do graft they use particulate graft devices.

The purpose of this study is to examine whether coral particles of 300-450um in comparison to coral cones of 4-5mm wide and 8-10 mm long will preserve alveolar ridge of maxilla or mandible when grafted immediately after tooth extraction.

 Methods: 10 patients adults that are diagnosed for extraction of same tooth number ,each on different side of jaw.

 A non traumatic extraction will be performed, on both sides, sometimes not on same date.

 After extraction, coral device 'CoreBone500' sterile particles will fill the extraction site.

 Usually 0.

3cc will be used.

 On the other side of same jaw 'CoreBone' Cone sterile of 4-5mm width and 8-10mm height will be placed in socket.

 Sutures will be placed and efforts will be put in covering the opening by soft tissues.

 Follow up of the alveolar ridge preservation will be performed using CT at time of grafting and 6 month later.

 Measurements during follow ups will be performed by caliber the width and height of alveolar ridge 2 weeks, 3month and 6 month follow up.

 A clinical follow up of healing soft tissues after grafting and patients complaints of pain will be addressed.

 If any unusual complaints from patients appears the study will be terminated immediately.

 From our preclinical studies no adverse effects were found.

 The analysis of data will be statistically analysed and compared to published data.

 We expect that CoreBone Cones are more effective in ridge preservation.

 The purpose of this study is to examine whether coral particles of 300-450um in comparison to coral cones of 4-5mm wide and 8-10 mm long will preserve alveolar ridge of maxilla or mandible when grafted immediately after tooth extraction.

 The coral grafting devices are processed from Porites corals grown in aquariums, under controlled environment.

 The devices are cleansed and sterilized by gamma irradiation.

 The measurements during follow ups will be performed from CT x rays and measurements by caliber and models.

The width and height measurements from follow up x rays and models.

 The study will be performed on 10 patients, that two parallel teeth are diagnosed to be extracted, in same patient.

The data will be analysed for bone loss and compared to previous published studies.

 Also comparison between two devices will be performed.
