(firstQuint)A Pilot Study Exploring the Efficacy and Safety of Topical Oxybutynin 3% Gel for Primary Focal Hyperhidrosis in Adolescents and Young Adults.

 This study will determine if daily application of topical oxybutynin 3% gel reduces the symptoms of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adolescents and young adults.

 It will also assess the impact of daily topical oxybutynin 3% gel on Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL); determine if daily topical oxybutynin 3% gel has a treatment effect at distant, untreated sites; and assess the local and systemic tolerability of daily topical oxybutynin 3% gel.

 Finally, the study will determine the treatment effect size, if one exists, in order to power a larger, placebo-controlled study in the future.
