(fifthQuint)Effects of a Supplement Derived From Palm Oil on Cholesterol Levels in the Blood.

 Both tocotrienols and tocopherols, whose derivatives are in eight different isoforms, are closely related structurally.

 Tocopherols are generally present in common vegetable oils (i.

e.

 soy, canola).

 However, tocotrienols are concentrated in cereal grains (ie.

 oat, barley, and rye, rice bran), with the highest level found in crude palm oil.

 The development of new cholesterol-lowering agents has been given more and more attention by pharmaceutical companies due to the strong relationship between cholesterol and atherosclerosis.

 Tocotrienols, especially - and -tocotrienols, were shown to be effective nutritional agents to treat high cholesterol in recent research programs.

 In particular, -tocotrienol appears to inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase at a posttranscriptional level and there is some evidence that tocopherols antagonize this effect.

 Therefore, the current study is designed to demonstrate that treatment with a tocotrienol-enriched fraction of palm oil for a three month period will lead to a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol with no effect on HDL cholesterol in patients whose cholesterol level is not adequately controlled in spite of statins.

 This objective will be achieved utilizing a simple three arm randomized placebo-controlled trial in a total of 99 subjects After acclimation to a step I AHA diet and no supplemental vitamin E in the diet, subjects will be given either a placebo capsule or a tocotrienol (120mg or 240mg) capsule in addition to their statin medications.

 Effects of a Supplement Derived From Palm Oil on Cholesterol Levels in the Blood@highlight

Elevated blood cholesterol, and particularly LDL cholesterol, is a risk factor for heart disease.

 Tocotrienols are naturally-occurring compounds in foods that may have beneficial effects on blood cholesterol.

 Tocotrienols are members of the vitamin E family, and are found in barley, oats, rye, coconut oil and rice bran oil, but the richest source of tocotrienols is palm oil.

 Certain of these tocotrienols have been shown to be effective in lowering LDL (or 'bad') cholesterol, with no adverse effects on the HDL (or 'good') cholesterol.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a palm-oil derived tocotrienol supplement on blood cholesterol, and particularly LDL cholesterol, in individuals who are taking statins, and have either elevated or normal cholesterol levels.

 Study subjects will consume a palm-oil derived supplement of tocotrienol for 3 months to determine its effects on LDL cholesterol.
