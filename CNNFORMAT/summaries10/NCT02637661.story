(secondQuint)Earlobe Crease as Risk Factors of Acute Myocardial Infarction in Chinese Population.

 Primary objectives: Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval of binaural earlobe crease as risk factors of AMI.

 Secondary objectives: 1.

 To study the characteristics of different earlobe creases in different gender of the patients with AMI.

 2.

 To analyze the characteristics of earlobe crease in different age groups.

 3.

 To compare the feature of earlobe crease in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction and non ST elevation myocardial infarction.

 4.

 The sensitivity,specificity,positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio of binaural earlobe crease as risk factors of AMI.

 Earlobe Crease as Risk Factors of Acute Myocardial Infarction in Chinese Population@highlight

The purpose of this study is to explore the earlobe crease as a risk factor of acute myocardial infarction (AMI)in the Chinese population, combined with other risk factors, to predict high risk patients with coronary heart disease.
