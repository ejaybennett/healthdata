(fifthQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Vitamin C Infusion in Combination With Local mEHT to Treat Non Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 Phase I and Phase II clinical trial indicated large dose of vitC infusion is safe and can reduce toxic side effects from chemo drugs when it was used synergy with chemotherapy.

 The new technology of modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT),trade name: oncothermia has been proven efficacy in lung cancer with minimal side effects.

The investigators have accumulated some successful cases in the treatment of primary lung cancer by using vitamin C infusion in combination with oncothermia.

 One diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer patient survive beyond 5 years only receiving intravenous vitamin C+ mEHT.

 Based on this, it is necessary to conduct an in-depth study to explore the best treatment protocol for NSCLC patients.

 Safety and Efficacy of Vitamin C Infusion in Combination With Local mEHT to Treat Non Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

This trial studies efficacy and safety of combination of vitamin C infusion with modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) in treatment of non small cell lung cancer patients.

Phase I of this clinical study is to find the tolerable dose and best schedule of the combination of vitamin C infusion and mEHT that can be given to patients with NSCLC.

 Phase II of this study is to learn if the combination of vitamin C infusion and mEHT can help to control NSCLC and improve quality of life.
