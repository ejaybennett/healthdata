(firstQuint)Prevention of Catheter Associated Lower Urinary Infections Using the Oxys Indwelling Catheter.

 This study is an open randomized controlled trial of 4 weeks duration.

 The intervention is a novel urinary catheter with an electromagnetic therapy to prevent catheter associated infections.

 The catheter is used in patients which require longterm urinary catheterization over at least 1 month.

 The endpoint is bacteriological exam and the laboratory is blinded to the therapy status.

 Weekly urinary cultures are drawn and a sonication culture of the catheter tip is performed to detect and characterize the biofilm.

 A colonization rate of >95% is anticipated in the control arm.

 Therefore a 50% reduction in colonization can be detected with 54 patients, a 90% reduction in colonization can be detected with 20 patients with a power of 0.
