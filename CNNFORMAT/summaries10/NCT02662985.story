(fifthQuint)Study of Power Doppler Ultrasound (PDUS) to Measure Response of Secukinumab Treatment in Patients With Active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA).

 This is a 52-week, multicenter, international study consisting of a 2 to 4-week Screening period, a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period (Period 1), a 12-week open-label treatment period (Period 2) and a 6-month open-label extension period (Period 3).

 Treatment Period 1 is a 12-week placebo-controlled, randomized period primarily designed to demonstrate the early and optimal efficacy of secukinumab vs placebo on joint synovitis using PDUS via the GLOESS and global entheseal score after 12 weeks of treatment.

 The main aim of Period 2 is to assess the maintenance or increased magnitude of treatment response on joint synovitis for patients from the original secukinumab groups and to assess the time course of response with secukinumab on joint synovitis in the original placebo group switched to secukinumab from Week 12.

 The main aim of Period 3 (extension period) is to allow patients who respond to secukinumab to extend study treatment up to Week 52 or until commercial drug becomes available, whichever occurs sooner.

This study is designed to leverage the sensitivity of ultrasonography available in clinical practice setting to better describe the time course of response to secukinumab (150 mg and 300 mg) on joint synovitis and enthesitis in PsA patients with an inadequate response to non-biologic DMARDs.

 PDUS changes in joint synovitis will be assessed using the global Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT)-European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) synovitis score (GLOESS) and changes in joint enthesitis will be assessed using the OMERACT enthesitis score.
