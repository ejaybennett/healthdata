(secondQuint)Chronic Effects of Tendon Vibrations on the Neuromechanical Muscular Properties.

.

 These last 10 years, a new idea born: vibrations could have potential effects on muscular reconditioning.

 Researchers have previously demonstrated the effects on plantar ankle flexion, with the increase of the strength, on healthy volunteers.

 Nowadays physicians would like to demonstrate the effects on another muscular group: ankle's dorsal flexors.

 24 sessions are programmed on 8 weeks.

 Moreover, the last results showed a modification of the nervous capacities of the cortical voluntary activation.

 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a great tool to explore the neuromuscular function, at the cortical stage.

 The use of this tool will allow the characterization the effects of the vibration training on the cortical activation state.

 Chronic Effects of Tendon Vibrations on the Neuromechanical Muscular Properties.

@highlight

It is a randomized, controlled clinical trial, in healthy volunteers.

 They are in two groups : the test one will perform the vibration training (1h of Vibrasens 3 times a week, 24 sessions) whereas the control group will not be training.

 The primary outcome is the maximal voluntary strength.
