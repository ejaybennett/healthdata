(fifthQuint)A Study of Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and IPH2201 in Solid Tumors.

 The study consists of 3 parts: dose escalation (Part 1), dose expansion (Part 2), and dose exploration (Part 3).

 Part 1 will evaluate dose escalation of durvalumab in combination with monalizumab in adult subjects with select advanced solid tumor malignancies.

 Part 2 will evaluate further the identified dose of durvalumab in combination with monalizumab from Part 1 in adult subjects with select advanced solid tumor malignancies.

 Part 3 will evaluate dose exploration of durvalumab in combination with monalizumab standard of care systemic therapy with or without biological agent in adult subjects with CRC.
