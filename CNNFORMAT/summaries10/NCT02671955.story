(secondQuint)A Study of Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics of JNJ-61610588 in Participants With Advanced Cancer.

 The purpose of this study is to see if JNJ-61610588 is safe and useful for treating participants with advanced cancer.

 This study consists of up to 4 parts.

 Part 1 will determine what dose of JNJ-61610588 can be given safely to advanced cancer participants.

 Part 2 will look at how participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer respond to a safe dose of JNJ-61610588.
