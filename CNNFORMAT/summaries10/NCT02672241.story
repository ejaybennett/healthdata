(firstQuint)Nimotuzumab in Combination With Radio-chemotherapy for the Treatment of Brainstem Tumor in Children.

 Nimotuzumab (h-R3), a recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of EGFR, which blocks the binding of EGF and transforming growth factor- to EGFR.

 High expression of EGFR protein in glioma has been associated with tumor progression and enhanced tumorigenicity.

 Several clinical trials have demonstrated the anti-tumor effects of nimotuzumab, such as head and neck cancer and esophageal cancer15.

 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of nimotuzumab in combination of radio-chemotherapy for the treatment of brainstem tumors in children.
