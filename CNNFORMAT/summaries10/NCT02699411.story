(thirdQuint)Dry Needling Effectiveness of Patients on Break Anterior Cruciate Ligament.

.

 It carries out a last fifteen days ECA surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

 Twenty individuals in a group to be subjected to a technique of physiotherapy, dry needling were included.

 (Group A).

 Another group of twenty patients treated with conservative treatment performed a stability exercises and proprioception (Group B).

 Forty-six patients will be examined s.

 None had been previously operated by joint instability and all subjects were previously subjected to a diagnostic study by nuclear magnetic resonance before surgery and the diagnosis was confirmed by additional diagnostic testing.

 All patients will be evaluated by a physical therapist and Myofascial Trigger Point (PGM) of the vastus muscle will be evaluated.

 patients using the following variables are evaluated: - Pain: Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used.

 - Stiffness and physical function using the WOMAC scale (The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index.

).

 - Range of motion of the knee joint: Scale ROM.

 - Muscular strength, balance and propiocepcion: Star Excursion by Balance Scale Test.

We will conduct a randomized clinical trial observing forty patients divided into two groups: one group composed of twenty individuals undergoing surgery for ruptured ACL, which perform dry needling of myofascial trigger (PGM) point of the vastus muscle and then perform techniques proprioception (group a); and twenty patients not be treated with dry needling after ACL surgery, using only proprioceptive exercises to the joint (group B).
