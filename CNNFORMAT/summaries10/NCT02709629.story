(fifthQuint)CCT for Older Diabetic Adults.

 Evidence suggests a link between diabetes-related processes and increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults.

 Optimal disease self-management may be key in the prevention of cognitive decline among older diabetic patients, but this may be compromised due to sub-clinical cognitive impairment.

 In the current study, 120 community-dwelling, non-demented participants aged 65 and over, with a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes will be randomly assigned either to an 8-week, home-based individually-tailored CCT program with adaptive difficulty level, and regular performance feedback, or to an 8-week, home-based active control (AC) condition, involving training on a generic CCT program with fixed difficulty level and without performance feedback.

 Both intervention groups also include a range of theory-informed behavior change techniques (BCTs), including self-efficacy management, self-monitoring and goal-setting in order to enhance treatment fidelity, and to maximize treatment compliance and adherence.

 In both groups, participants train approx.

 30 min.

 per day, 3 times per-week for 8-weeks.

 Participants undergo a comprehensive evaluation of all outcomes at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and at a 6-month follow-up, with 1-week booster training completed 3 months from completion of the intervention.

 CCT for Older Diabetic Adults@highlight

The current study examines the efficiency of a home-based computerized cognitive training (CT) intervention targeting older adults with diabetes.

The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of CCT on cognitive and disease management in non-demented older diabetes adults.

 Investigators will also evaluate the effect of the intervention on a range of secondary outcomes, including mood, caregiver burden, self-efficacy, and for a small sub-sample, on brain activity as reflected in changes in task-related blood-flow on fMRI.
