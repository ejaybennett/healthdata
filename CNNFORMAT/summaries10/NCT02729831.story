(secondQuint)Comparative Effectiveness of Decision Support Strategies for Joint Replacement Surgery.

 This study is a 2X2 factorial randomized trial that will examine the comparative effectiveness of different decision support strategies for patients making treatment decisions about hip or knee osteoarthritis.

 Eligible patient subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of two decision aids before their upcoming clinic visit with a participating orthopedic specialist.

 Participating providers are randomly assigned to either usual care or an intervention (a report that includes patients' goals and treatment preferences).

 Patient participants will complete three surveys at different time points: before their orthopedic visit, one week after the clinic visit, and 12 months later.

 Providers will complete a short survey for a subset of patient participants.
