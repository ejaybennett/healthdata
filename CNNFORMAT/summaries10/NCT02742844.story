(secondQuint)Clinical Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety of the IMP in Patients With Non Healing Wounds Originating From Ulcers.

 This is an interventional, single arm, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of ABCB5+ mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on wound healing in patients with chronic venous ulcer (CVU).

 Autologous MSCs will be isolated ex vivo from a small skin biopsy and will be expanded in vitro.

 The IMP APZ2 incorporating the ABCB5+ will then be applied on the wound surface of CVU under local anesthesia.

 Patients are followed up for efficacy for 3 months which allows to distinguish actual wound healing from transient wound coverage.

 The wound healing process will be documented by standardized photography.

 The wound size evaluation will start on the day of the first change of wound dressing.

 The quality of the wound healing process will be assessed on the basis of formation of granulation tissue, epithelialization and wound exudation.

 Pain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated with standardized and validated questionnaires.

 To assess long-term safety of APZ2 an additional follow-up visit at Month 12 post IMP application is included.

 Clinical Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety of the IMP in Patients With Non Healing Wounds Originating From Ulcers@highlight

The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy (by monitoring the wound size reduction) and safety (by monitoring occurring adverse events) of the investigational medicinal product APZ2 after one single application on chronic venous leg ulcer wounds.
