(thirdQuint)Perineural Dexamethasone in Femural Nerve Block After Ligament Reconstruction.

 After Ethics committee approval, 75 patients American Society of Anesthesiologists score (ASA) I-III were randomized at the end of surgery into 3 groups of 25 patients each who underwent femoral nerve block: group A with 20 ml ropivacaine 0,5% and 20 ml lidocaine 1%; group B with 20 ml ropivacaine 0,5%, 20 ml lidocaine 1% and 4 mg dexamethasone; group C with 20 ml ropivacaine 0,5%, 20 ml lidocaine 1% and 8 mg dexamethasone.

 All groups received postoperative analgesia when visual analog scale (VAS) over 3 (by request), with IV Perfalgan 1 g and morphine (loading dose 0.

1 mg/kg and titration until VAS under 3, followed by subcutaneous (SC) administration of 1/2 of total loading dose on demand for the following 24 hours (h) .

 Efficacy was evaluated by the time interval from performing the block until the first analgesic dose required, the total amount of morphine in the first 24 h postoperative, the patient satisfaction and the neurological side effects.

The effect of perineural dexamethasone administered as an adjuvant in prolonging the duration of analgesia continues to be under debate.

 The investigators performed a prospective randomized study to evaluate the effect of perineural dexamethasone in different concentrations in postoperative analgesia in femoral nerve block for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
