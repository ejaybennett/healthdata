(firstQuint)Cerebral Hemodynamics in Sleep Disorders.

 Sleep disorders continue to be the most unrecognized modifiable risk factor for stroke.

 The relationship between sleep disorders and vascular risk factors and stroke has been well-documented but not fully understood.

 The investigators hypothesize hemodynamics impairment to be its potential mechanism.

 It has been reported that sleep-related breathing disorder, a type of sleep disorders, contributed as a risk factor for stroke through hemodynamic and hematologic changes.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between sleep disorders and cerebral hemodynamics.

 The dynamic cerebral auto-regulation (dCA) and Transcranial Doppler (TCD) will be used to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics.
