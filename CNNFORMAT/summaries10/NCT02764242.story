(secondQuint)The Causative Insects in Severe Insect Sting Allergy.

 Insect sting allergy from insects in Hymenoptera is not uncommon.

 The reaction maybe very severe and life threatening.

 To find the cause of insect sting allergy is important in prevention and specific treatment such as immunotherapy.

 The skin prick test and sIgE of these insects may have cross reactions so it is difficult to be interpreted.

 The usage of sIgE recombinant venom allergen can benefit in separate cross reaction and dual allergy reaction.

Study the causative insect by skin prick test and sIgE to wasp, bee and fire ants are important but false positive by crossreactivity can occur.

 sIgE to recombinant venom allergen is proposed to help in finding the causative insect.
