(thirdQuint)Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial With Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator.

 In this study, subjects will be randomized to receive a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator or Conventional Medical Therapy (CMT).

 Randomization will be stratified by enrolling site, in a 2:1 (S-ICD:CMT) scheme.

 Length of follow-up for each subject will be dependent on the date of entry into the study, since all subjects will be followed to a common study termination date.

The MADIT S-ICD trial is designed to evaluate if subjects with a prior myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus and a relatively preserved ejection fraction of 36-50% will have a survival benefit from receiving a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) when compared to those receiving conventional medical therapy.
