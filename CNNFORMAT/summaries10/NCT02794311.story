(thirdQuint)Risk Factors Associated With Binge Drinking Behaviors Among College Students.

 Binge drinking behavior is characterised by speed of drinking on a particular occasion, frequency of drunkenness during the most recent six month period, and the percentage of times getting drunk when drinking.

 The prevalence of weekly binge drinking among European Union drinkers in 2009 was reported to be 28% of the student population, and 33% among all young people aged 15-24.

 The consequences of this behavior are multiple and often dramatic, they include: academic failure, violent acts, rape, domestic or road accidents.

 The study aims to identify vulnerability factors associated with binge drinking.

 The protocol explores the psychological (personality), neuropsychological (executive functions, memory), genetic (snp polymorphisms) and neuro-anatomical (fMRI) patterns associated with binge drinking behavior.

The purpose of this study is to specify the psychological, cognitive, neuro-functional and genetic profile associated with binge drinker behaviors among young adults.

 Results will help identifying more precisely vulnerability factors associated with this pattern of alcohol consumption and guiding prevention efforts.
