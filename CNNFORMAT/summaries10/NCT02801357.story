 This is a Phase 1, open-label, inpatient study in male and female subjects seeking at least a 4 mg reduction of their buprenorphine maintenance dose.

 The purpose of this study is to assess the relative exposures of lofexidine and its 3 major metabolites in subjects tapering from buprenorphine maintenance treatment.
