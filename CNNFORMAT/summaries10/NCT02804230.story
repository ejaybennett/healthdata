(fifthQuint)MR-Guided Focused Ultrasound in the Treatment of Subcortical Lesional Epilepsy.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and initial effectiveness of ExAblate thermal ablation of a subcortical focal epileptic target area in the brain of patients suffering from medication-refractory epilepsy, using the ExAblate transcranial system to produce multiple sonications targeted in the lesion of interest.

 The Investigators will establish the feasibility and collect data to establish the basic safety of this type of treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate its full clinical efficacy.

 The hypotheses tested are that: 1.

 MRgFUS treatment of subcortical lesional epilepsy is feasible and safe, with a low risk of adverse effects as evaluated during the follow-up period.

 2.

 ExAblate treatment of subcortical lesions in patients with subcortical lesional epilepsy reduces the seizure frequency.
