(fifthQuint)The Effects of Using the Empowerment Model Intervention in Primary Total Hip Replacement Surgery Elders.

 Aims.

 To exam the effectiveness of the empowerment education program on primary (self-care self-efficacy and competence) and secondary outcomes (Activities of Daily Life, mobility, depressive mood, and quality of life) for older adults with total hip replacement surgery.

 Background.

 Degenerative arthritis is a common and serious chronic illness that impacts the quality of life of older adults.

 As joints degenerate continuously and the hip has been damaged by arthritis, Activities of Daily Life will be difficult to perform due to severe hip pain and joint stiffness.

 Therefore, hip replacement surgery should be considered, and effective nursing care should be provided to improve the recovery of older adults.

 Design.

 A prospective randomized control trial.

 Methods.

 A trial was conducted from September of 2013 to May of 2014 in two hospitals in northern Taiwan.

 108 participants were randomly assigned to either the empowerment education group or the comparison group.

 The outcomes were collected at the day of discharge (T2), one month after (T3), and 3 months (T4) after the discharge.

 The Effects of Using the Empowerment Model Intervention in Primary Total Hip Replacement Surgery Elders@highlight

Degenerative arthritis is a common and serious chronic illness that impacts the quality of life of older adults.

 Knowledge about the effects of empowerment education program in older adults with total hip replacement surgery are limited.

 As far as the investigators know, this is the first study done using empowerment education intervention to promote total hip replacement patients' self-care.

 This partnership is achieved through active participation to learn as well as sharing their knowledge and experiences with clinicians and patients.

 Furthermore, patients had developed some degree of self-efficacy and improve their depressive mood from the disease related knowledge acquired.
