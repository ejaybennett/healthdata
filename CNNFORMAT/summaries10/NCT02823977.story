(thirdQuint)Ketamine vs.

 Placebo as Adjunctive Therapies for Severe Alcohol Withdrawal.

 The combination of ketamine and dexmedetomidine for alcohol withdrawal is pharmacologically rationale and may provide additive benzodiazepine-sparing effects.

 All subjects will receive benzodiazepine therapy as standard of care.

 The objectives of this randomized, double-blind pilot study of 20 subjects with severe alcohol withdrawal are to a) determine if adding ketamine 0.

5 mg/kg per hour to dexmedetomidine 0.

6 mu g/kg per hour (both agents administered for up to 72 hours) as adjunctive therapies to a symptom-triggered benzodiazepine protocol reduces the dose requirements of conventional sedatives while maintaining patient comfort and safety; and to b) explore whether epinephrine, a marker of autonomic activity, is expressed differently when ketamine is added to dexmedetomidine as adjunctive therapies.

 Ketamine vs.

 Placebo as Adjunctive Therapies for Severe Alcohol Withdrawal@highlight

This study is designed to evaluate the addition of ketamine to dexmedetomidine as adjunctive therapies of severe alcohol withdrawal in medical ICU patients.

 Specifically, this study will assess whether the combination of ketamine and dexmedetomidine reduces the doses of conventional agents used for alcohol withdrawal while maintaining patient comfort and safety and will explore if the combination alters the expression of catecholamines in the serum over time.
