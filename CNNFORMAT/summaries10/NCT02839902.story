(thirdQuint)Exploratory Study of the Effects of Omega-3-acid Ethyl Esters on the Lipid and Lipoprotein Profile in the Blood.

 This study was designed to explore the effects of omega-3-acid ethyl esters on the lipid and lipoprotein profile in the blood in hyperlipidemic patients receiving a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor in comparison with the control group of patients not treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters in an unblinded manner by use of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using highly-sensitive gel filtration columns, which is a technique for analyzing lipoprotein.

 Study participants who gave consent and were assessed as eligible in the eligibility assessment will be stratified by the factors of "fasting triacylglycerol (TG; ) and age () at the start of the screening period" and allocated to either the group treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters or the group not treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters (1:1 ratio).

 Exploratory Study of the Effects of Omega-3-acid Ethyl Esters on the Lipid and Lipoprotein Profile in the Blood@highlight

The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of 8-week treatment with omega-3-acid ethyl esters on the lipid and lipoprotein profile in the blood in hyperlipidemic patients receiving a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor by use of HPLC in comparison with the control group of patients not treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters.
