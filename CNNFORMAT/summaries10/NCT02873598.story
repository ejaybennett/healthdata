(secondQuint)A Dose Escalation Trial of SBRT After Induction Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.

 This is a phase I study, with an expansion cohort, of up to 34 patients to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a 3-fraction regimen of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for locally-advanced pancreatic cancer patients who have not developed distant progression following induction chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) as per standard of care.

 After completion of induction chemotherapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy SBRT will be administered in 3 fractions, every other day, on an outpatient basis.

 Dose escalation will start with dose level 1 (9 Gy x 3 fractions) and increase by 1 Gy per fraction at each dose level, dose level 2 will be 10 Gy x 3 fractions and dose level 3 will be 11 Gy x 3 fractions.
