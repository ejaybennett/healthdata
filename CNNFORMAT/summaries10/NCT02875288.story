(thirdQuint)Trial of Liposomal Versus Plain Bupivacaine in Minimally Invasive General Surgery Procedures.

 The investigators current standard has been to use liposomal bupivacaine routinely for surgical infiltration which was a change from the historical practice of infiltration with lidocaine/bupivacaine, plain bupivacaine or no local anesthetic at all.

 The change was made due to the perceived benefits in analgesia past the 12-24 hours that plain bupivacaine was effective.

 It is not clear, however, that there are statistically significant benefits in terms of reduced narcotic use and length of hospital stay and improved pain control and return of function post-operatively.

 Primary outcomes: The investigators will then measure narcotic use post-operatively as calculated by combining measures of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) use for first 24 hours added to in-patient oral narcotic use (by referencing the electronic medical record (EMR)) as well as out-patient oral narcotic use as reported by patients.

 Subjective pain levels and pain interference scale and physical functioning scale will be evaluated pre-operatively and post-operatively with use of the Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR) developed by the Defense and Veterans Center for Integrative Pain Management (DVCIPM) as a measure of perioperative pain and function.

 Trial of Liposomal Versus Plain Bupivacaine in Minimally Invasive General Surgery Procedures@highlight

Aim: To compare the postoperative outcomes after surgical infiltration with plain bupivacaine compared to liposomal bupivacaine in patients undergoing elective, minimally invasive, general surgery procedures.

 To the investigators knowledge, there are no head-to-head, prospective, randomized, controlled trials of plain bupivacaine versus liposomal bupivacaine to evaluate postoperative pain and return of function.
