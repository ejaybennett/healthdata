(firstQuint)Vincristine Sulfate Liposome Injection (Marqibo) in Combination With UK ALL R3 Induction Chemotherapy for Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults With Relapsed ALL.

 This study will utilize Marqibo(R) as a replacement for standard vincristine in combination with UK ALL R3 induction for children with relapsed ALL.

 The hypothesis is that the incorporation of Marqibo(R) with combination chemotherapy will be safe and feasible.

 In the context of this pilot study, overall outcomes and efficacy will be a secondary objective.

 It is hypothesized that data from this combination may show improved efficacy including, complete remission (CR), minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, and progression free survival (PFS) rates and safety (i.

e.

, neurotoxicity) in comparison to outcomes in historical regimens, including the UK ALL R3 with standard vincristine.
