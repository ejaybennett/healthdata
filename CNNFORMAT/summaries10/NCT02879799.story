(fifthQuint)Family Integrated Care (FICare) in Level II NICUs.

 Every year, about 15 million of the world's infants are born at 1 year) term.

 While parenting education can take many forms from simple leaflets with information to self-modeled video interaction guidance, parenting education that actively engages parents with their infant had the greatest impact on parental and infant outcomes.

 Education that is consistent across care providers is critical to ensure parental belief in the competence of care providers.

 A positive relationship between parents and providers contributes to increased satisfaction with care, and greater willingness by parents to seek further support for the care of their infant.

 Further, health care should be individualized to accommodate sequential clinical phases from admission to post-discharge care of the infant.

 Adapted from existing family-centred care interventions, the Family Integrated Care (FICare) model was developed and pilot tested with preterm infants 35 weeks GA in a Level III NICU at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto.

 The pilot study indicates that FICare is feasible and safe in Canada.

 Compared to 31 matched controls, the 42 infants who received FICare showed increased weight gain and breastfeeding at discharge.

 FICare reduced LOS by approximately 10% (personal communication, Dr.

 S.

 Lee) and mothers reported less stress.

 Based on these promising results, FICare in Level III NICUs is currently being evaluated in a 19-centre, cRCT; Calgary is a control site.

 With success in Level III NICUs, Dr.

 V.

 Shah (co-investigator) is implementing FICare in four Ontario Level II NICUs.

 However, the Ontario study is limited by a pre-test/post-test design.

 Without a randomized controlled train (RCT), evidence of the effectiveness of FICare in Level II NICUs will continue to be plagued by methodological and contextual limitations.

 The aim of this study is to refine and implement FICare in Level II NICUs across Alberta and evaluate it using a cluster RCT (cRCT).

 The investigators hypothesize that compared with standard care, FICare will: (1) decrease LOS (primary outcome); (2) decrease the incidence of nosocomial infections; (3) decrease adverse events (e.

g.

, medication and donor breast milk errors); (4) reduce the number of times infants have feeding suspended (NPO) with concomitant intravenous therapy and/or sepsis workups; (5) reduce readmission and unplanned emergency room and physician visits up to 2 months corrected age (CA); (6) increase parental knowledge, skills, and confidence in caring for their infant at discharge and 2 months CA; (7) increase rates of feeding breast milk and breastfeeding self-efficacy at discharge and 2 months CA; (8) decrease parental psychosocial distress (stress, anxiety, depression) at discharge and 2 months CA, (9) improve healthcare provider satisfaction; and (10) decrease direct and indirect costs because of reduced LOS and readmission.

 The FICare Alberta research study was co-developed in collaboration with Alberta Health Services operational leaders and clinicians.

 Nursing and medical directors at the ten Level II NICUs across Alberta embraced the idea of FICare.

 Buy-in is particularly notable given that sites were aware that they could be randomized to either FICare or control condition.

 The investigators addressed the potential for unanticipated compensatory reactions (i.

e.

, demoralization) by offering delayed implementation of FICare at control sites.

 The investigators discussed development, testing, and execution of the FICare implementation plan, as well as how we can integrate changes for the new model into routine care.

 The investigators learned that several sites were already using some elements of FICare, albeit in an unstructured and unintegrated way.

 If results of FICare show improved outcomes and/or reduced costs, we will assist with implementation and provide training to staff at the control sites.

 Family Integrated Care (FICare) in Level II NICUs@highlight

In Alberta, nearly one in every twelve babies is born too soon (preterm).

 Preterm babies are at greater risk for breathing and feeding problems, as well as infections, than babies born on their due date (full term).

 As a result, parents must leave their preterm babies in the hospital to fully develop and become healthy enough to take home.

 When it is time for discharge, parents are often not ready to look after their baby because they may have limited involvement in the care of their baby in hospital.

 In addition to the distress and costs to parents of having a baby in hospital, health system costs are also increased the longer a baby is in hospital.

 The purpose of this project is to test a new way to integrate parents into the care of their baby through a program called Family Integrated Care (FICare).

 In FICare, parents are educated and supported by nurses to provide care for their baby; nurses and doctors still provide intravenous medications and medical procedures.

 FICare has been tested in Ontario and shows promise as a better model of care for the small percentage of babies born more than 8 weeks early, who have to spend a long time in hospital.

 Now the investigators want to test FICare with the greater percentage of preterm babies who are born 4 to 8 weeks early to see if parents are able to take their baby home sooner, and if their babies are healthier.

 The investigators also want to know if FICare can reduce distress for parents.

 The investigators propose to test FICare in Level II Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) in Alberta by implementing FICare in half the Level II NICUs and comparing the outcomes with the other Level II NICUs who do not use FICare.

 If FICare improves outcomes for preterm babies and their parents, the investigators will implement it in all Level II NICUs.

 In Alberta, the investigators want the best quality care for our most vulnerable babies and their parents.

 This project is aligned with Alberta's Health Research and Innovation Strategy priority of wellness at every age (child and maternal health), and with Alberta Health Services' quality of care goals to increase efficiency, effectiveness, appropriateness, and acceptability of health care services delivery.
