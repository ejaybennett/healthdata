(thirdQuint)Carbohydrates and Gut Hormones After Gastric Bypass Surgery.

 Disaccharides such as sucrose or isomaltulose (also called palatinose) require digestion into monosaccharides (both are digested to glucose and fructose) by enzymes located in the brush border of the small intestine to be absorbed.

 The study will investigate the influence of carbohydrate digestion on gut hormone secretion.

To investigate the secretion of gut hormones, in particular glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), after ingestion of glucose and fructose as separate monosaccharides or combined in the disaccharides sucrose and isomaltulose and the effect of acarbose in gastric bypass operated subjects and BMI-matched controls.
