(fifthQuint)Augmentation of Locomotor Adaptation Post-Stroke.

 The project seeks to establish the optimal configuration of electrodes to change the excitability of neural circuits involved in post-stroke locomotion, identify effective strategies for training a specific locomotor adaptation, and improve adaptations via adjunctive non-invasive brain stimulation.

 Tools to improve neural excitability may increase potential for locomotor skill learning, thereby improving rehabilitation outcomes.

 Non-invasive brain stimulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has recently emerged as a simple to administer, low-cost, and low-risk option for stimulating brain tissue.

 Cortical excitability is increased after application and preliminary results imply a relationship to increases in motor activity in those post-stroke.

 However, inhibition of the contralesional hemisphere is also shown to improve paretic motor output through inhibition of excessive maladaptive strategies, and combining the two electrode configurations may provide additional benefit for locomotor tasks requiring interlimb coordination.

 Furthermore, the effects of tDCS on walking function in conjunction with physical intervention strategies aimed at improving locomotor ability post-stroke are yet unstudied.

 Augmentation of Locomotor Adaptation Post-Stroke@highlight

This project will evaluate two different methods of normalizing the center of mass acceleration (COMa) in individuals post-stroke, specifically focusing on rates and pattern of recovery to analyze walking-specific adaptations as precursors to motor learning.

 In addition, the proposed project seeks to establish the optimal configuration of electrodes to activate neural circuits involved in post-stroke locomotion.

 Once the better method of training COMa and optimal parameters of electrode placement for tDCS are identified, the investigators will evaluate the effects of tDCS on locomotor adaptations during single sessions and over a five-day training period.
