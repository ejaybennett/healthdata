(thirdQuint)JTX-2011 Alone and in Combination With Anti-PD-1 or Anti-CTLA-4 in Subjects With Advanced and/or Refractory Solid Tumors.

 JTX-2011 is an agonist monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the Inducible CO-Stimulator of T cells (ICOS) to generate an anti-tumor immune response.

 This is a Phase 1/2, open label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion, first-in-human (FIH) clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of the ICOS agonist monoclonal antibody JTX-2011 alone and in combination with nivolumab, ipilimumab, or pembrolizumab in adult subjects with advanced and/or refractory solid tumors.

 The study will include a dose escalation phase for single agent and the combination therapies, followed by an expansion phase in specified tumor types for single agent and the combination therapies.
