(secondQuint)Evaluating Clinic- and Community-Based Pain Self-Care Programs for Low-Income Hispanics on Opioids.

 Background and Significance Over the past two decades, opioid analgesic (OA) drugs have been increasingly prescribed for chronic pain despite little to no effectiveness for treatment >6 months.

 In prospective cohorts, OA therapy can worsen pain and disability by promoting a sedentary lifestyle.

 Yet some type of intervention is necessary because chronic pain is not "curable" in a conventional sense so the patient must learn and maintain a lifestyle to increase function, mobility, and cognition despite their pain.

 The safety threat of OAs galvanized the U.

S.

 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop its National Pain Strategy that uses non-pharmacologic approaches to manage pain as the first line management.

 Unfortunately, there are few patient-centered programs to improve function and pain through proactive and daily self-care behaviors that are available to low income, minority patients who are most likely to receive poor quality pain care.

 For low income, predominantly Hispanic patients with chronic pain, investigators will conduct a trial of a non-pharmacologic pain management program delivered in clinic- versus community-based settings.

 The program in both settings will offer similar educational content such as: pain physiology and goal setting as well as training in stretching, strengthening, massage, and mindfulness techniques.

 This program incorporates elements of evidence-based approaches that have been demonstrated to improve outcomes of chronic back and lower extremity musculoskeletal pain.

 However, little is known about how to engage persons with chronic pain in self-care management.

 Therefore, the program tests delivery of this intervention in two different settings: individually in clinic or as a group in a convenient community-based location.

 Objective: For this study, investigators will randomize primary care patients treated for chronic lower extremity or back pain with OAs to a 6-month multimodality non-pharmacologic pain care program that will differ by setting, educator, and individual versus group education.

 In one arm, subjects will receive the pain care program individually by health educator in clinic and, in the second arm, subjects will be taught in groups by experts in a nearby public library.

 Study Design: The investigators will conduct a parallel group, randomized trial of clinic- and community- structured programs to educate and promote pain self-care among low-income, predominantly Hispanic patients aged 35-70 who have received at least two months of OA therapy for chronic non-cancer back and lower extremity pain.

 A total of 90 subjects will be randomized to: 1) a clinic-based self-care program led by a health educator who offers evidence-based pain and self-care education onsite, or 2) a community-based program organized by a community health worker (CHW) assisted by students in physical therapy but with self-care education and training delivered by content experts.

 A low literacy PowerPoint educational program in Spanish or English will be delivered by a trained health educator in clinic for six monthly sessions lasting 30-45 minutes.

 In the community setting, there will be nine, one hour sessions delivered by content experts every 2 weeks for the first three months and then once a month for the last three months.

 To increase availability in the community, the same group session is offered twice a week.

 Sessions include: 1) Orientation to the pain program; 2) Pain physiology exercises/stretching; 3) Stress management and mindfulness; 4) Massage therapy approaches; 5) Nutrition; 6) Sleep hygiene; 7) Relapse prevention; 8) Health literacy (Internet resources); 9) Review and long-term pain self-care strategies.

 In the community setting, participants are able to practice stretching, strengthening, self-massage, and mindfulness techniques with experts.

 In the clinic, sessions are condensed to be delivered in 6 meetings.

 All subjects will be given information to work on personally selected goals through home activities and receive phone/texting support from a health educator (clinic arm) or CHW (community arm).

 Patient progress will be monitored by self-reported logs of activity measures as well as measures taken at baseline, 3- and 6- months assessing physical and mental function, pain and quality of life.

 The investigators hypothesize that patients in both arms of the study will show improvement in the primary outcome of the 5 times sit-to-stand test, which reflects improvement in the critical skill of rising from chairs, cars, and toilets and is associated with improvements in gait speed and overall psychosocial function, as described below.

 These are all validated physical and mental function measures (see below).

 In addition, patient adherence to meetings will be collected to compare implementation of the two programs.

 This trial will offer a valuable foundation for subsequent studies on the effect of multimodality pain self-care programs in helping patients reduce or even avoid reliance on risky OA therapy while achieving desirable functional goals.

 Impact: If either or both of these patient-centered self-care programs improve patient functional outcomes, they can be sustained and expanded through preexisting partnerships with the primary care clinic and library system for future studies targeting reduced reliance on OAs and decreased long-term OA use as the lynchpin of chronic pain management.

 Evaluating Clinic- and Community-Based Pain Self-Care Programs for Low-Income Hispanics on Opioids@highlight

The purpose of this study is to conduct a parallel group, randomized trial of primary care clinic-based and community-based programs to educate and support low-income, Hispanic patients with chronic pain to adopt evidence-based pain self-care behaviors and activities.
