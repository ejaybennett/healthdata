(secondQuint)Ticagrelor Versus Clopidogrel and Eptifibatide Bolus.

 The first 30 minutes of PCI procedure is of outmost importance when plaque ruptures and platelet activation occurs.

 Platelet activation and accumulation causes the formation of blood clots that may cause heart attack.

 As a standard of care, the doctor can prescribe medications such as are ticagrelor, eptifibatide, clopidogrel, to prevent the formation of blood clots.

 100 patients with stable or unstable angina, both male and female, will be randomized to either Group A- Ticagrelor and bivalirudin/heparin or Group B- Clopidogrel, eptifibatide and heparin administrated immediately before PCI.

 Platelet function testing and ECG will be performed.

 Ticagrelor Versus Clopidogrel and Eptifibatide Bolus@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the inhibition of platelet aggregation (i) ticagrelor and bivalirudin/heparin versus (ii) clopidogrel, eptifibatide and heparin in patients with unstable angina undergoing coronary intervention.
