(thirdQuint)Serum Thyroglobulin as a Marker of Iodine Status During Pregnancy.

 Mild iodine deficiency is still a public health issue in many industrialized countries, especially during pregnancy.

 During the last decade there was no monitoring of the iodine status in pregnancy in Hungary.

 Since urinary iodine concentration (UIC) only reflects recent iodine intake and carries limited information on individual existing iodine stores, another biomarker e.

g.

 measurement of serum thyroglobulin concentration, would be useful to gain comprehensive information.

 In the present study, the purpose of the investigation is to compare UIC, UIC normalized to creatinine concentration and serum thyroglobulin as biomarkers of iodine supply in pregnant women in a geographical region where previously iodine deficiency had been found.

 UIC, serum thyroglobulin level and thyroid function are measured, and information about iodine supplementation and smoking before and during pregnancy are recorded.

 Serum Thyroglobulin as a Marker of Iodine Status During Pregnancy@highlight

The purpose of the investigation is to assess iodine status of pregnant women at week 16 of gestation targeting serum thyroglobulin as a biomarker of iodine deficiency.

 The investigators aim to assess whether pre-gestational initiation of iodine supplementation is more advantageous in comparison to supplementation start at the time of pregnancy detection.
