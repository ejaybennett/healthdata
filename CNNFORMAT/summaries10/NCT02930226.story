(firstQuint)Ascending Doses of Autologous FDP vs FFP.

 This is a single-site, single-blind study in healthy volunteers and is designed to assess the safety of infusing ascending doses of reconstituted autologous FDP in 3 fixed-dose cohorts.

 Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive 1 unit of FDP, which is approximately 270 mL.

 Subjects in Cohort 2 will receive 2 FDP units, which total approximately 540 mL.

 Cohorts 1 and 2 are the lower-dose cohorts.

 Subjects will be assigned to these beginning with the lowest dose, Cohort 1.

 In the absence of SAEs or the implementation of protocol stopping rules (SRs), subjects will be assigned to Cohort 2, where the dose is increased to 2 units.

 For both of these cohorts subjects will also be assigned to 1 of 2 single infusion treatment arms.
