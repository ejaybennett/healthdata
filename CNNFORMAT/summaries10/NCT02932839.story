(thirdQuint)Investigating the Neuronal Bases of Epilepsy With Micro-electrode Arrays in Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery.

 Epilepsy is a disease characterized by the tendency to have seizures, which are thought to be due to excessive activity in the neurons of the brain.

 However, it is technically difficult to record the activity of neurons, especially in the brain of human patients.

 Therefore, there are gaps in what scientists know of what exactly goes wrong in neurons during epileptic seizures.

 In this study, an array of micro-electrodes will be inserted into the brain of patients with epilepsy while they are undergoing a clinically indicated assessment with intracranial electroencephalography (EEG).

 The micro-electrode array is able to continuously record the activity of neurons in the human brain.

 In combination with the standard intracranial EEG, the recordings of the micro-electrode array will allow a better understanding of the relationship between epileptic seizures and the activity of neurons.

This study aims to uncover the neuronal bases of epilepsy by recording the activity of single neurons in the brain of patients with epilepsy who are candidates for assessment with intracranial electroencephalography (EEG).

 A micro-electrode array will be inserted into the brain in addition to the standard intracranial EEG electrodes for up to 4 weeks.
