(secondQuint)Ketogenic Diet Adjunctive to Salvage Chemotherapy for Recurrent Glioblastoma:a Pilot Study.

 Diet change by limiting carbohydrates and increasing the proportion of fatty acids and proteins can lead to ketogenic metabolism and might limit energy production in tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth.

 In a pilot of recurrent glioblastoma, ketogenic diet adjuvant salvage chemotherapy was given as interventional group and standard diet adjuvant salvage chemotherapy was given as control group.

 The study examines whether a ketogenic diet adjunctive to salvage chemotherapy can be applied to the patients and may inhibit tumor growth and influence the quality of life of the patients.
