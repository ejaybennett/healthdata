(fifthQuint)Efficacy And Safety Of Bococizumab For Lipid Lowering In Asian Hypercholesterolemia Subjects.

 After providing consent, subjects will enter a screening period of approximately 28 days to verify eligibility for the trial.

 Eligible subjects will be considered enrolled and progress to the Randomization visit.

 Results from screening evaluations will be reviewed and only subjects who continue to meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized.

 Randomized subjects will enter the 12-week treatment period, followed by a 40-week long-term treatment period and a 6 week follow-up, for a total of 58 weeks (approximately 14 months) study participation.

 Subjects will attend clinic visits as shown in the Schedule of Activities.

 Subjects will be randomized to receive either 150 mg Q2wks of bococizumab or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

 Lipid levels will be blinded to the investigator and staff, subject and sponsor.
