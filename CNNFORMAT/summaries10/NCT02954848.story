(firstQuint)Phase 3 Study of TAK-438 (10 mg) in the Treatment of Non-Erosive Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.

 A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study will be conducted to verify the superiority of TAK-438 (TAK-438 10 mg, once daily, 4 weeks) to placebo (placebo, once daily, 4 weeks) in patients with non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (NERD).

 The study consists of a 1-week, single-blind run-in period and a 4-week, double-blind treatment period.

 The participants will receive the study drug (TAK-438 placebo tablet) for the 1-week single-blind run-in period.

 After the run-in period, eligible participants will be randomized into TAK-438 10 mg or placebo treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio.

 The randomized participants will receive the assigned study drug (TAK-438 10 mg tablet or TAK-438 placebo tablet) for the 4-week double-blind treatment period.
