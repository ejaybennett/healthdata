(secondQuint)Dapagliflozin + Saxagliptin in a Basal-bolus Insulin Treatment.

 This will be a phase IV study investigating the efficacy and safety of adding the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin together wih the DPP-4 inhibitor saxagliptin to an intensified insulin treatment regimen.

 Because BOT is superior to BBIT in respect to the development of bodyweight, hypoglycaemia and patient satisfaction in type 2 diabetes, we hypothesize that the combined addition of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin with the DPP-4 inhibitor saxagliptin is effective and safe to revert from a BBIT to a BOT treatment regimen.

To perform a study that investigates the effectiveness of adding the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin + the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor saxagliptin vs placebo to revert from a BBIT regimen to a BOT regimen in patients with type 2 diabetes.
