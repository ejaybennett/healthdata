(firstQuint)A Study of TRK-950 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 This study is a first-in-human study of TRK-950 in patients with advanced solid tumors and is primarily designed to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TRK-950 administered via intravenous (IV) infusion once weekly for 3 weeks every 28 days in Arm 1.

 Once enrollment in Arm 1 was completed, two dose schedules will be evaluated in Arm 2 to determine the dosing schedule.

 Up to six (6) patients will be enrolled respectively.

 In parallel, to determine anti-tumor activity up to six (6) patients will be enrolled in Arm 3.

 Once the dosing schedule has been established in Arm 2, up to 40 additional patients may be enrolled in Arm 4 for confirmation of safety.
