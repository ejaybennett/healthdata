(thirdQuint)Evaluation of NEUROCAP In the Treatment of Symptomatic Neuroma.

 1.

 Device description NEUROCAP(R), a bioresorbable nerve capping device based upon the NEUROLAC(R) nerve guide, is indicated to protect a peripheral nerve end and to separate the nerve from surrounding environment to reduce the development of a symptomatic neuroma.

 NEUROCAP(R) is composed of the same biocompatible, bioresorbable copolyester composing the NEUROLAC(R) nerve guide, Poly(68/32[15/85 D/L] Lactide--Caprolactone) (PLCL).

 2.

 Objective This post-market surveillance study is conducted to provide post market surveillance information regarding long-term performance and ease of use of the Polyganics nerve capping device (NEUROCAP(R)) for reduction of the development of peripheral symptomatic end-neuroma.

 3.

 Study design This post-market surveillance study consists of a cohort study to provide post market surveillance information regarding long-term performance and ease of use of the NEUROCAP(R) for reduction of the development of peripheral symptomatic end-neuroma in the upper and lower extremity.

 Sub analyses will be performed regarding demographics and medical background.
