 A Trial of Acupuncture for Knee Osteoarthritis With Differential Functional Status of Acupoints@highlight

The investigators plan to undertake a rigorous multicentre randomised controlled trial, comparing acupuncture on sensitized acupoints with low/non-sensitive points or no acupuncture (waiting-list), to test if acupuncture on sensitized acupoints may result in improved treatment outcomes in patients with Knee osteoarthritis (KOA).

The current pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility of performing the definitive randomised controlled trial.
