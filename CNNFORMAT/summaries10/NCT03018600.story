(fifthQuint)Continuous Glucose Monitoring on Patients With Active Autoimmune Diseases Following High-dose Predisone Treatment.

 As known to all, the dosage and duration of glucocorticoid influences the glucose levels in different diseases.

 Continuous glucose monitoring becomes a newly effective technology to better understand the glucose level.

 In this study,the investigators enrolled 25 patients with certain active autoimmune diseases during high-dosage glucocorticoid therapy at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.

 It was done by monitoring three-day continuous glucose levels by holding continuous glucose monitoring system underneath the skin, which helped to show a unique picture of fluctuations.

 The participants were divided into two groups according to the glucocorticoid therapy.

 Group 1 enrolled subjects who were newly commenced 1-2mg/kg/day prednisone-equivalent (intravenous/oral methylpredisolone or oral prednisone) for at least five days.

 Group 2 enrolled subjects who had underwent less than 15mg/day prednisone-equivalent glucocorticoid maintenance for at least 3 months but treated with high-dose glucocorticoid for the relapse during the study This finding is useful for the suitable treatment to control the hyperglycemia in young patients.

Glucocorticoid is widely used in clinical treatment.

 Recently, there was research about glucose fluctuations under low-dose and pulse steroid therapy in elderly patients with active autoimmune diseases.

 Through this prospective trial, the investigators wanted to know the blood glucose characteristics under high dosage glucocorticoid (1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) in young patients (30-40 years) with active autoimmune diseases with or without low-dose glucocorticoid maintenance.

 The investigators used continuous glucose monitoring for 72 hours to get a better understanding of the glucose levels.
