(secondQuint)tDCS and Robotic Training in Adults With Cerebral Palsy.

 Therapy consists of 20 minutes of non-invasive, low-level brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS), followed by one hour of shoulder/wrist robotic training.

 Participants will be enrolled in therapy 3 times per week for 12 weeks (or 36 sessions).

 Before and after therapy, participants will receive and assessment of their arm function, as well as an assessment of their brain activity, using electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

 tDCS and Robotic Training in Adults With Cerebral Palsy@highlight

The purpose of this study is to improve arm function in adults with hemiplegic cerebral palsy.

 Participants will receive transcranial direct current stimulation (or sham) in combination with upper extremity robotic therapy.
