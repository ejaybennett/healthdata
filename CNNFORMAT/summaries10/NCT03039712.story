(thirdQuint)Longitudinal Coverage With Evidence Development Study on Micra Leadless Pacemakers.

 Micra CED study is a study of the Medicare beneficiary population implanted with single-chamber ventricular pacemakers, and will be executed by analyzing administrative claims data.

 The study consists of two primary objectives: estimate the: (1) acute overall complication rate and (2) the 2-year survival rate of patients implanted with a Micra leadless pacemaker.

 As part of the secondary objectives of the study, a comparative analysis of Micra leadless pacemakers to single-chamber ventricular transvenous pacemakers will be conducted.

 The analysis will be in CMS claims data and is subject to a central IRB.

 However, individual hospitals are not engaged in research and local IRB oversight is not necessary.
