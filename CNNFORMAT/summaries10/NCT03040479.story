(secondQuint)Pharmacokinetic Single Dose Study of Oral Lasmiditan in Participants With Normal and Impaired Hepatic Function.

 This study will enroll up to 24 participants and will include 2 hepatic impaired participant groups and one group of control participants with normal hepatic function.

 Approximately four participants with mild hepatic impairment will be enrolled first (Group 1).

 To ensure participant safety, following dosing of these first four participants, a safety meeting will take place to review the safety data prior to dosing additional participants.

 After safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) results from the first four participants have been reviewed, an additional four participants with mild hepatic impairment (remainder of Group 1) will be enrolled concurrently with the moderated hepatic impairment group (Group 2).

 Thereafter, matched participants with normal hepatic function (Group 3) will be enrolled.

 All participants will participate in one treatment period and will receive a single dose of lasmiditan in the fasting state.
