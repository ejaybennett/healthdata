(thirdQuint)Cognitive Remediation Augmented With Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS).

 Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a novel, safe, well-tolerated, and low-cost treatment approach that may enhance the benefits of cognitive remediation.

 The application of tDCS is a relatively recent therapeutic development that utilizes low amplitude direct currents to induce changes in cortical excitability.

 To meet this study's objectives, investigators will focus specifically on working memory (WM) in both training and outcome.

 Limiting training to WM exercises will provide the opportunity to test proof of concept for the combined therapies within this shorter two-week time frame, and maximize the synergistic effect by engaging the same regions as targeted by the tDCS.

The proposed study will test the feasibility and tolerability of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) added to a cognitive remediation program in n=100 adults.

 For 20 cognitive remediation sessions, participants will receive 20 minutes of active tDCS stimulation (up to 2.

0 mA, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or DLPFC montage) while they complete the cognitive training tasks.
