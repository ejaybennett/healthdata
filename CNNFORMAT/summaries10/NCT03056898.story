(fifthQuint)Health Professional Dietary Habits and Blood Omega-3 Fatty Acid Concentrations.

 Omega-3s are important for heart, brain, and joint health.

 Most Americans have low levels of omega-3s, especially the long-chain fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in their blood.

 The only way to know blood levels of omega-3s is by measurement.

 The Omega-3 index, a measure of EPA+DHA levels in blood, is determined in a single drop of blood obtained from a finger stick.

 Blood levels of EPA+DHA can be improved by simple dietary changes.

 Twenty-two percent of family physicians report knowing their Omega-3 Index.

 DSM Nutritional Products Inc will announce the "Know Your O" program at the American Association for Family Physicians (AAFP) meeting at the Orlando Convention Center, Orlando FL, Sept 21-23, 2016 and encourage health professionals to visit the DSM booth (#616) and participate in a dietary survey and have their blood fatty acids measured.

 After learning more about the study at the DSM Nutritional Products Inc booth, participants will sign an Informed Consent Form, complete an Omega-3 Index Test Request form, and write their name, date of birth and collection date on an OmegaQuant LLC filter paper.

 Participants will then have a finger stick by a representative from InHouse Physicians, 333 N.

 Randall Road, Suite 140, St.

 Charles, IL 60174.

 Tel (630) 244-0887.

 The Omega-3 Index Test Request, Informed Consent form and Filter Paper with dried blood sample will be stapled together, packaged with all other samples obtained at that location, and shipped by DSM Nutritional Products Inc to OmegaQuant LLC.

 Within 2 weeks of receiving the blood sample, OmegaQuant LLC will email the Omega-3 Test results directly to each participant.

 After removing personal information, OmegaQuant LLC will share blood fatty acid and omega-3 dietary intake results with DSM Nutritional Products Inc for statistical and reporting purposes.

 DSM Nutritional Products Inc will be unable to link data to any individual.

 There are no other obligations for participants.
