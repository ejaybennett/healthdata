(firstQuint)A Study Comparing AC0010 and Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced NSCLC Who Have Progressed Following Prior EGFR TKI.

 This is a phase III, open label, randomized study assessing AC0010 (300 mg, BID) versus pemetrexed/cisplatin (4-6 cycles) in patients with advanced NSCLC, who have progressed following prior therapy with EGFR-TKI.

 Patients must provide a biopsy for central confirmation of T790M mutation positive.

 Eligible patients will be randomized (2:1) into AC0010 group or pemetrexed/cisplatin group.

 Patients in chemotherapy group can cross-over to AC0010 treatment when patients experience disease progression or intolerability of chemotherapy.

 The primary objective of the study is to compare the PFS of AC0010 and pemetrexed/cisplatin.
