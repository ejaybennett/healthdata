(secondQuint)Injection of Autologous Adipose-derived Stromal Vascular Fraction in the Finger of Systemic Sclerosis Patients.

 In patients with systemic sclerosis(scleroderma, SSc), impaired hand function greatly contributes to disability and reduced quality of life, and is insufficiently relived by currently available therapies.

 Adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is increasingly recognized as an easily accessible source of regenerative cells with therapeutic potential in ischaemic or autoimmune disease.

 The investigators aimed to measure for the first time the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of autologous SVF cells local injections in patients with SSc with hand disability.

This study outlines the safety of the autologous SVF cells injection in the hands of patients with SSc.

 Preliminary assessments at 6 months will suggest potential efficacy needing confirmation in a randomised placebo-controlled trial on a larger population
