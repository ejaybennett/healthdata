(fifthQuint)Enhancement of Treatment of Delusions in Schizophrenia Through Neuromodulation.

 Purpose: The objective of this study is to enhance a form of nonpharmacological treatment of delusions in schizophrenia using neuromodulation, and confirm the effect using electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioural measures (Whitman et al.

, in press; Whitman, Minz & Woodward, 2013).

 Specifically, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) will be used to improve the outcome of participation in metacognitive training (MCT) for the treatment of psychosis.

 MCT is a group-based program developed directly from current cognitive neuropsychiatry research findings on schizophrenia and psychosis.

 MCT shares knowledge gained in research labs to help individuals experiencing psychosis become more aware of the thinking patterns involved in their illness.

 The main purpose of the metacognitive training is to help people change the thinking patterns that cause delusions, thereby avoiding relapse into illness or reducing the impact of delusions (Moritz et al.

, 2014).

 tACS is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique in which a weak electrical current is applied to the head in order to change the likelihood of neural firing in a region of cortex under the stimulation electrodes (Antal & Paulus, 2013).

 Hypothesis: Neuromodulation will enhance the benefit of the non-pharmacological treatment program, MCT, in the reduction of severity of delusions in schizophrenia.

 Justification: It is now clear that helping individuals with schizophrenia become aware of the thinking patterns that underlie delusions provides effective tools for countering these thinking patterns (Moritz et al.

, 2013; Mortiz et al.

, 2014).

 The MCT program for treatment of delusions involves experiencing situations where everyday interpretations of reality must be questioned.

 Empirical studies and meta-analyses indicate that MCT is effective, even up to three years after completion of treatment (relative to active control conditions and treatment as usual (TAU)).

 Despite these successes, no treatment of schizophrenia can be considered highly effective, and there is always room for improvement in effect size.

 Neuromodulation can provide this improvement by biasing pathological brain functioning towards a healthy state prior to MCT, enhancing the openness to questioning everyday interpretations of reality, and enhancing the effect of MCT treatment of delusions.

 tACS is almost entirely non-invasive and purely modulatory, changing the likelihood of neural firing in a region of cortex under the stimulation electrodes.

 It is now possible to modulate at different frequencies of oscillation, in accordance with how the healthy brain functions when interpreting reality.

 The proposed research involves application of oscillation-targeted neuromodulation protocols to bias brain functioning towards a state that promotes questioning everyday interpretations of reality, thereby reducing severity of delusions, and enhancing response to a training program for treatment of delusions in schizophrenia by raising insight about the thinking patterns that lead to delusional thought.

 The investigators plan to document the brain changes induced by neuromodulation using performance and EEG measures taken on a decision making task that involves interpretation of reality, and for which performance correlates with the severity of delusions.

 This task involves judging the likelihood that evidence matches a hypothesis, and it has been shown that this judged likelihood increases when patients are strongly delusional.

 The investigators have shown that this task state (i.

e.

, evidence-hypothesis match) elicits an increase in alpha power in the task positive network, and a decrease in beta power the default-mode network (Whitman et al.

, in press).

 This suggests that maximizing the power of the alpha band in the task-positive network should bias the brain towards a healthier state for weighing evidence to test hypotheses about reality, and this can be confirmed with EEG and behavioral measures taken on the aforementioned decision making task, a heightened response to MCT, and a corresponding decrease in the severity of delusions.

 Research Design: Neuromodulation involving tACS will target increasing the power of the alpha band at dorsomedial prefrontal regions, and this is expected to also decrease the power of the beta band in ventro-medial regions.

 This will be confirmed by EEG recordings and source estimation (Whitman et al.

, in press; Whitman, Minz & Woodward, 2013).

 MCT is a four week program with eight one-hour sessions.

 TAU is a four week waitlist control group.

 Sham neuromodulation will involve application of random patterns of low-grade currents to the same brain region as the neuromodulation conditions (Antal & Paulus, 2013).

 Severity of delusions will be measured by the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales in psychosis (PSYRATS) (Haddock et al.

, 1999).

 The behavioral measure of interest is the rating of the match between the evidence and hypothesis, which should decrease as delusions decrease.

 Statistical Analysis: Between-groups (neuromodulation/MCT vs.

 sham/MCT vs neuromodulation/TAU) analyses of variance (ANOVA) will be carried out on change scores computed on behavioral measures and severity of delusions, pre- and post MCT or TAU, under the hypothesis that decreases in the severity of delusion will be greater in the neuromodulation/MCT condition relative to the sham/MCT and neuromodulation/TAU conditions.

 Enhancement of Treatment of Delusions in Schizophrenia Through Neuromodulation@highlight

The proposed study aims to use a form of neuromodulation, known as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), to improve the effectiveness of the metacognitive training (MCT) program for treatment of delusions in schizophrenia.

 tACS is a non-invasive brain stimulation method utilizing weak electrical currents applied to the head to influence neural firing (Antal & Paulus, 2013).

 Brain regions implicated in delusional thinking will be targeted in the hopes of promoting thinking patterns that will allow participants to question delusional beliefs, reducing the severity of delusions and increasing the positive effects of MCT (Whitman et al.

, in press; Whitman, Minz & Woodward, 2013).

 Electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioural assessments will be used to measure treatment effects.
