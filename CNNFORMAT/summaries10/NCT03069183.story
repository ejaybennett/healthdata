(fifthQuint)The Efficacy of Ultrasound-guided Suprainguinal Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block on Early Post-operative Analgesia After Total Hip Arthroplasty.

 The search for the optimal pain treatment strategies is a work in progress.

 As techniques and technology evolve so should our approach for the best analgesic regimen that would minimize unwanted side effects and potential risk and more importantly improve patient satisfaction.

 The literature has supported the use of peripheral nerve blocks for analgesia as well as improved functional outcome after total knee arthroplasty.

 The addition of peripheral nerve blocks for THR has been more controversial, as the only effective nerve block, the posterior approach to the lumbar plexus, is an advanced regional technique with potential for serious complications.

 The application of ultrasound visualization has improved the efficacy of the infrainguinal fascia iliaca block.

 However, ultrasound guided suprainguinal fascia iliaca block has not yet been evaluated clinically in a large trial as a method of providing post-operative analgesia following primary hip arthroplasty.

 The investigators hypothesize that by performing the suprainguinal fascia iliaca block with ultrasound, it will be possible to achieve superior and more reliable analgesia than that obtained using the landmark "2-pop" technique and the infrainguinal blocks.

 The aim of this study is to assess whether the ultrasound guided suprainguinal fascia iliaca block can provide superior early postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty, and minimizing the pain immediately after the resolution of the spinal anesthetic.

 The investigators propose to perform the first triple-blinded RCT examining the early analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided suprainguinal FICB after THR.

 The Efficacy of Ultrasound-guided Suprainguinal Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block on Early Post-operative Analgesia After Total Hip Arthroplasty@highlight

Total hip replacement (THR) is a common and major surgical procedure performed in elderly patients with significant comorbidities.

 Optimizing a patient's anesthetic and analgesic modalities could play a significant role in minimizing the risk of adverse events in the perioperative period and potentially shorten time to discharge and recovery.

 Establishing a safe and effective post-operative analgesic plan is of central importance to successful THR anesthesia care.

 The application of ultrasound visualization has improved the efficacy of the fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB).

 However, ultrasound-guided suprainguinal FICB has not yet been evaluated clinically in a large trial as a method of providing post-operative analgesia following THR.

 The investigators hypothesize that by performing the suprainguinal fascia iliaca block with ultrasound, it will be possible to achieve superior and more reliable analgesia in the first 24 hours than without a block.
