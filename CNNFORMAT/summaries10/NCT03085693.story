(thirdQuint)Impact of Left Atrial Appendage Closure on Physical Capacity.

.

 The monocentric trial deals with the endocrinological changes as a result of closure of the left atrial appendage with a internal closure device.

 Specially, the changes in atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide and their impact on exercise capacity is on focus of the trial.

 The trial is planned as a all comers trial.

 Impact of Left Atrial Appendage Closure on Physical Capacity.

@highlight

Closure of the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation and risk for stroke is a increasing technology leading to exclusion of the left atrial appendage volume from the blood circulation and therefore protects from cardioembolic strokes- It is unclear if the volume reduction of the left atrium leads to a change in exercise capacity or Quality of life.
