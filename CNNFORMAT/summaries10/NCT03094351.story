(thirdQuint)Robot Assisted Thoraco-Laparoscopic Esophagectomy Versus Conventional Thoraco-Laparoscopic Esophagectomy.

 Objective: This study aims to compare the oncological outcomes between robot-assisted thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy and minimally invasive conventional thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy.

 Study design: Randomized controlled parallel-group superiority trial Study population: Patients (age >= 18 and <= 75 years) with histologically proven surgically resectable (cT1b-3, N0-2, M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the intrathoracic esophagus with European Clinical Oncology Group performance status 0, 1 or 2.

 Intervention: 300 patients will be randomly allocated to either A) robot-assisted thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy (n=150) or B) conventional thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy (n=150).

 Patients will receive the following interventions: Group A.

 robot assisted thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy, with gastric conduit formation.

 Group B.

 conventional thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy, with gastric conduit formation.

 Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome is 5-year overall survival rate.

 Secondary outcomes are 5-year disease free survival, 3-year overall survival rate, 3-year disease free survival, (in hospital) mortality within 30 and 60 days, R0 resections, operation related events, postoperative recovery, lymph nodes status, quality of life.

 Follow-up: 60 months after discharge of the last randomized patient.

 Robot Assisted Thoraco-Laparoscopic Esophagectomy Versus Conventional Thoraco-Laparoscopic Esophagectomy@highlight

This is the first randomized controlled study to compare the robot-assisted thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy (RATLE) to minimally invasive conventional thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy (CTLE).

 The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety, risks of the robot-assisted esophagectomy, and to compare the short-term operative outcomes and long-term oncological outcomes between the two surgical treatments.
