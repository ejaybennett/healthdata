(fifthQuint)The Role of Milk Derived Peptides on Glycaemic Control.

 Recent figures estimate 60% of Irish adults are overweight or obese.

 As obesity is associated with the development of insulin resistance, which precedes type 2 diabetes development by decades, novel food based solutions are required to improve glycaemic control and attenuate insulin resistance.

 In the current study insulin resistant individuals will undergo 4 study visits, 1 screening visit and 3 subsequent visits.

 At each of the 3 visits they will receive an oral lipid load consisting of 100mL soya bean oil, followed by either a water control; the hydrolysate being tested or the parent protein from which the hydrolysate was derived.

 After which they will undergo a 4 hour hyperinsulinemic-euglycaemic clamp at each visit to assess their insulin sensitivity.

 The Role of Milk Derived Peptides on Glycaemic Control@highlight

This study aims to ascertain the potential of novel milk derived hydrolysates to improve glycaemic control to promote metabolic health.

 A comprehensive characterisation of the metabolic response to these milk derived hydrolysates will ascertain the effect of the hydrolysates in terms of insulin sensitivity.

 These hydrolysates have been shown to improve insulin resistance in cell and animal models.

 Therefore the investigators aim is to test their efficacy in overweight, insulin resistant individuals at risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
