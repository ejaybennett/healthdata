(secondQuint)First-in-human Study to Evaluate Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Various Doses of BCD-089 in Healthy Subjects.

 IL-6 is a new potential therapeutic target which plays important role in pathogenesis of several autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis.

 BCD-089 is a novel fully human monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor developed by JCS BIOCAD (Russia) which is now on the first step of clinical evaluation.

 BCD-089-1 study is the first-in-human clinical trial which is intended to evaluate tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of BCD-089 when used as a single step-by-step escalating subcutaneous dose in healthy male volunteers.

 During this study it is expected to determine diapason of safety doses of BCD-089 (incl.

 MTD) which thereafter can be evaluated in phase 2 studies.
