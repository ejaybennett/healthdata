 This study has two segments the first is a chart and outcome assessment of patients treated at Clear Passage (CP) with a diagnosis of endometriosis.

 These patients have completed multiple questionnaires as a standard of care for outcome monitoring in the clinic setting, no new data will be collected.

 The second segment is a prospective observational, online questionnaire based study of female subjects with a diagnosis of endometriosis not treated at CP.

 Data on the impact of quality of life (QOL) over time of subjects not treated at CP will be assessed using the same questionnaire used as standard of care in the clinic twice, 30 days apart.

 This will be accomplished using online forms with subjects able to complete the questionnaires with ease via the internet.

 The data obtained from the untreated subjects will allow for reporting of overall impact on QOL in this population, as well as provide a control group for assessment of improvement for manual therapy interventions for patients with endometriosis.
