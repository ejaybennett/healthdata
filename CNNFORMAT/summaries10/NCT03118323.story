(secondQuint)Patients' Willingness-to-pay of Endodontic Treatment.

 Endodontic treatment of teeth with irreversibly damaged pulp aim at the long-term preservation of the affected tooth.

 If contraindications are present and / or a patient refuse endodontic treatment, the extraction of the affected tooth is often necessary.

 The resulting tooth gap might be closed by inserting a dental implant or by placing a fixed dental prosthesis.

 Prior studies have shown that patients' decisions in alternative treatment options depend on a variety of factors.

 Studies on the willingness-to-pay (WTP) are used to compare the monetary value of different therapy procedures.
