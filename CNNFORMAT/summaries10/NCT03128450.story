(secondQuint)A Study To Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Human Neural Stem Cells for Parkinson's Disease Patient.

 h-NSC is a cellular therapeutic consisting of human fetal neural stem cells (h-NSC).

 h-NSC injection will be delivered through nasal way for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

 The study will enroll 12 moderate to severe PD patients to be treated with the cell injection therapy at the same dose.

 The total therapy course will be four weeks,one dose for one week.

 The follow up will be two times within 24 weeks after finishing the treatment.

 The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the cell transplantation by this new delivery way.
