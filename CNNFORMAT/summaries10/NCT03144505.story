(fifthQuint)Comparing Moderate and High-intensity Interval Training Protocols on Biomarkers in Type 2 Diabetes Patients.

 Contemporary exercise guidelines focus on continuous aerobic exercise using mainly moderate intensity exercises.

 However, there is growing evidence that HIIT has the same (or even further) benefits, with lower time commitment.

 This type of exercise has already been tested in T2D patients, using mostly short intervention studies, with significant improvements in relevant outcomes for T2D, such as glucose regulation.

 On the other hand, no study as yet compared the effects of HIIT and MCT (both combining resistance training, RT) in a long-term study design.

 Therefore, this study will use a 12 month randomized control trial to assess the effects of an HIIT combined with RT, and MCT combined with RT, in comparison with a control group (home base program), on glycemic control, inflammatory profile, endothelium function, cardiorespiratory fitness, quality of life, and body composition outcomes, in adult males and females with T2D.

 The sample recruitment is planned to be made using media, mails, and community events.

 Participants can be considered eligible if age is set between 30 and 75 years old, a body mass index lower than 48 kg/m2, and if they have been diagnosed with T2D (according to the ADA criteria).

 Further criteria will be made upon their medical history concerning strokes, advanced neuropathy or retinopathy, and other health conditions that may interfere with this study's protocols or otherwise safe exercising.

 Comparing Moderate and High-intensity Interval Training Protocols on Biomarkers in Type 2 Diabetes Patients@highlight

To overcome the lack of knowledge regarding the relative role of different intensities of aerobic training in adults with type 2 (T2D) diabetes, a 12 month randomized controlled trial will be performed to assess and compare the impact of two exercise groups: 1- high intensity interval training (HIIT) with resistance training; 2- moderate continuous training (MCT) with resistance training; and 3- a standard counseling home based control group; on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as the main outcome, and other selected cardiometabolic, body composition and quality of life markers, as secondary outcomes.

 This investigation aims to increase the current knowledge on HIIT and the related benefits on diabetes control and treatment in a time saving and physiological efficient framework, which will improve the general health and well-being of the diabetes population.

 A total of 105 participants with T2D will be recruited from the Lisbon area (35 control, 35 HIIT, and 35 MCT).

 The investigators hypothesize that high-intensity interval training, compared to moderate continuous training, will optimize the physiological adaptations and quality of life in people with type 2 diabetes.
