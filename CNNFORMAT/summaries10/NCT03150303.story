(fifthQuint)Oral Anticoagulant Peri-procedural Management in Patients Undergoing an Oral Surgery, Implantology or Periodontology.

 Manager Centre de Pharmaco-epidemiologie de l'AP-HP Title Survey about oral anticoagulant peri-procedural management in patients undergoing an oral surgery, implantology or periodontology Acronym PRADICO Investigator Coordinator Isabelle MAHE Number of investigational sites 100 Number of patients 2000 Population Patients receiving oral anticoagulant undergoing an oral surgery, implantology or periodontology Research calendar Duration of inclusions: 1 year Duration of follow up: 30 days Study duration: 13 months Selection criteria Inclusion criteria : Patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant (defined as duration of treatment of at least 1 month) and referred for an invasive procedure (oral surgery, implantology or periodontology) to an oral surgeon member of the SFCO (Societe Francaise de Chirurgie Orale) or a periodontologist member of the SFPIO (Societe Francaise de Parodontologie et d'Implantologie Orale) taking part to the study.

 Each investigator will include 10 patients treated with long-term DOAC, and 10 consecutive patients treated with long-term VKA.

 For the DOAC group, inclusion will be continued until the inclusion of 333 patients for each molecule (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban).

 Non-inclusion criteria : Patients receiving both VKA and antiplatelet agents Patients receiving both direct oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents Objectives Primary aim: To assess the composite rate of thromboembolic and bleeding events occurring within the peri-procedural period, in patients on long-term DOAC and VKA and undergoing an oral surgery, implantology or periodontology.

 Secondary aims : - To identify risk factors for bleeding during the peri-procedural period - To identify risk factors for thromboembolic events during the peri-procedural period - To describe the peri-procedural management of each treatment (VKA or DOAC) - To identify prescribers involved in the possible change of anticoagulant prescription prior the oral surgery - To compare the risk of bleeding on DOAC and on VKA - To compare the risk of thromboembolic complications on DOAC and on VKA - To evaluate the net clinical benefit of DOAC compared to VKA treatment Endpoints Primary endpoint : A composite outcome: the occurrence rate of hemorrhagic and/or thromboembolic events during the peri-procedural period.

 Secondary endpoints : - Incidence of bleeding events - incidence of thromboembolic events - net clinical benefit of DOAC compared to VKA Methodology Prospective observational non interventional multicentric cohort study in adult population under long-term anticoagulant treatment (DOAC or VKA) and undergoing an oral, periodontal or implant surgery, by liberal practitioners or oral specialists at hospital.

 Statistical analysis The occurrence rate of hemorrhagic or thromboembolic events during peri-procedural period will be calculated globally and in each group (VKA or DOAC) as a percentage with 95% CI.

 Oral Anticoagulant Peri-procedural Management in Patients Undergoing an Oral Surgery, Implantology or Periodontology@highlight

Patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant (defined as duration of treatment of at least 1 month of Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DAOC) or Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA)) and referred for an invasive procedure (oral surgery, implantology or periodontology) to an oral surgeon taking part to the study will be included in this prospective observational study.

 The main composite outcome is the occurrence rate of hemorrhagic and/or thromboembolic events during the peri-procedural period (between 5 days before surgery plus 30 days after the invasive procedure).

 0.

 The secondary end-points will consist of identifying risk factors for bleeding during the peri-procedural period, risk factors for thromboembolic events during the peri-procedural period, the peri-procedural management of each treatment (VKA or DOAC), the prescribers involved in the possible change of anticoagulant prescription prior the oral surgery All outcome events will be blindly adjudicated by a central independent adjudication committee.
