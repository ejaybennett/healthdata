(fifthQuint)Cumulative Live Birth Rates After Cleavage-stage Versus Blastocyst-stage Embryo Transfer.

 This is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety between cleavage-stage embryo transfer and blastocyst-stage embryo transfer in IVF/ICSI treatment cycle, taking into account of subsequent vitrified embryo transfers.

Randomization will be performed on day 3 after oocyte retrieval, when no less than 4 embryos are achieved.

 Patients in group A will have 1-2 cleavage-stage embryos transferred.

 Patients in group B will have 1-2 blastocyst-stage embryos transferred.

 If the previous embryo transfer does not result in a live birth, patients would go through cryopreserved cycles until all vitrified embryos were transferred or a first live birth was achieved within the 2-year follow-up duration.

 Those with surplus frozen embryos who do not achieve a live birth should have at least 3 embryos transferred during the 2-year follow-up period.

 Cumulative Live Birth Rates After Cleavage-stage Versus Blastocyst-stage Embryo Transfer@highlight

The aim of this RCT is to compare differences in the efficacy and safety between cleavage-stage embryo transfer and blastocyst-stage embryo transfer in IVF/ICSI treatment cycle, taking into account of subsequent vitrified embryo transfers.

 Subjects with 4 or more transferrable cleavage embryos will be randomized to the cleavage-stage or blastocyst-stage embryos transfer group.

 The primary outcome is cumulative live birth rate (CLBR) per patient until the first live birth from one initiated oocyte retrieval cycle.
