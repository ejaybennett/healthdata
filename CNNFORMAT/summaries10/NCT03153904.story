(thirdQuint)Connecticut Child STEPs.

 This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will investigate the effectiveness of a modular, transdiagnostic treatment protocol for youth with anxiety, depression, trauma, and/or behavioral problems (MATCH-ADTC) in four DCF funded clinics in the state of Connecticut.

 MATCH synthesizes common elements found across dozens of evidence-based treatments into one model that is flexible and responsive to the complex needs of children and families.

 The RCT will evaluate child outcomes following two forms of therapist training in the MATCH model: (1) the 6-day MATCH training only; (2) the 6-day MATCH training plus weekly ongoing case consultation with a MATCH consultant.

 Participating children are between the ages of 7 and 15.
