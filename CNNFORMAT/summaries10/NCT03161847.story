 OPMD patients will undergo a screening evaluation and testing to confirm the participants carry the OPMD mutation.

 Subjects fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled and followed prospectively at regular intervals to determine the natural history of this disease.

 Measures of muscle function and swallowing will be made at baseline and at follow-up visits to measure natural clinical progression.
