(firstQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Jinshuibao Capsule on Diabetic Kidney Disease.

 Autoimmune Diabetes Mellitus (AIDM) is a subtype of diabetes mellitus caused by autoimmune destruction of beta cells in the islet, including Type 1 diabetes and Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA).

 Insulin has been used as a routine therapy for AIDM to alleviate the hyperglycemic status, yet cannot effectively prevent the progressing destruction of beta cells or preserve its function.

 GLP-1 analog Liraglutide has been tested in large-scale clinical trial to prove its various benefits for beta cells and glucolipid metabolism in T2D and obesity patients.

 However, its clinical application in AIDM is not well-defined so far.

 The aim of this study is to investigate the potential use of Liraglutide on glycemic control in AIDM.

 Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) is one of the most important microvascular complications of diabetes and is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease.

 Intensive glycemic and blood pressure control, combined with renin - angiotensin system blocking therapy (including ACEI and ARB drugs), has to a certain extent, delayed the progression of DKD, but still cannot completely block its development.

 Cordyceps sinensis is a traditional Chinese medicine and Jinshuibao Capsule is its artificial preparation, with the effect of renoprotection.

 However, its clinical application in diabetic kidney disease is not well-defined so far.

 The aim of this study is to investigate the potential use of Jinshuibao Capsule on microalbuminuria in T2DM.
