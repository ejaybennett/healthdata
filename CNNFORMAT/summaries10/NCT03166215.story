(firstQuint)Study of TAK-935 as an Adjunctive Therapy in Participants With Developmental and/or Epileptic Encephalopathies.

 The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-935.

 TAK-935 is being tested to treat people who have developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathies.

 This study will look at safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of people who take TAK-935.

 Study drug will be administered in a double-blind manner in Part 1 and in an open-label manner in Part 2.

 The study will enroll approximately 20 participants.

 Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups in Part 1-which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - TAK-935 low/ medium/ high dose - Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient Participants will receive placebo or 100 milligram (mg) TAK-935 tablets, orally or through stable G-tube/PEG tube, twice daily, in Part 1 (Day 1) and dose will be increased to 200 mg (Day 11) and to 300 mg (Day 21).

 All participants who complete the double-blind treatment period in Part 1 will have the option to continue directly into the Open-Label treatment period in Part 2 where they will receive 200 mg TAK-935 tablets, orally or through G-tube/PEG tube, twice daily and dose will be increased to 300 mg tablets, orally, twice daily (Day 41).

 This dose level will be maintained until the final visit (Day 85) for the dose de-escalation phase.

 This multi-center trial will be conducted North America.

 The overall time to participate in this study is 121 days excluding screening period of 30-41 days.

 Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and a follow-up phone call will be conducted on Day 91 and at the end of the 30-day follow-up period (Day 121), participants will return to the clinic for a follow-up assessment.
