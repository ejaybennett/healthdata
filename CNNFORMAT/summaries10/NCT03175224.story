(firstQuint)CBT-101 Study for Advanced Solid Tumors and c-Met Dysregulation.

 This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, 2-part study with a Dose Escalation Segment and Dose and Disease Expansion Cohorts study of CBT-101, a c-MET inhibitor, to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and dose limiting toxicities for CBT-101, and to obtain preliminary efficacy and target engagement data, in subjects with advanced malignancies and c-Met dysregulation.

 c-MET dysregulation will be determined from historical results by molecular pre-screening evaluations to determine eligibility of enrollment for both the Dose Escalation Segment and Dose and Disease Expansion Cohorts.

 However, in the Dose and Disease Expansion Cohorts, the c-MET historical results will be confirmed by a central laboratory retrospectively, but will not be a determinant for study entry.

 Dose escalation will occur in three subject cohorts until a protocol defined dose limited toxicity (DLT) occurs and a tentative maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 At the tentative MTD or RP2D, at least 16 additional subjects for each stated tumor type (renal cell carcinoma, advanced gastric carcinoma (including gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma), and a biomarker driven basket of tumors with c-MET dysregulation will be assessed to further evaluate toxicity and preliminary efficacy.

The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended dose of CBT-101 in individuals with advanced solid tumors and c-MET dysregulation.
