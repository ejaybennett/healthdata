(firstQuint)Investigational TMS Treatment for Depression.

 While transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an FDA approved treatment for depression, a growing and converging database suggests the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) may be even more critical to the neurobiology of depression and antidepressant treatment response.

 This study will compare the efficacy of high frequency transcranial madntic stimulation on these two sections of the brain.
