(thirdQuint)Effect of RAS Blockers on Chronic Kidney Disease Progression in Elderly Patients With Non Proteinuric Nephropathies.

 STUDY DESIGN: Open, multicentre, prospective, parallel-group, randomized controlled study comparing the effect of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) vs standard antihypertensive treatment without ACEI, in the progression of renal disease in elderly patients with non-proteinuric 3-4 stage chronic renal disease.

 Elderly patients (> 65 years) with moderate-severe non-proteinuric chronic renal disease (estimated Glomerular Filtrate Rate between 19-59 ml per minute per 1.

73 m2 using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration Group equation) and urine-creatinine rate < 30 mg/g, will be included.

 They will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ACEI or standard antihypertensive treatment.

 Patients will be followed up for 3 years.

 Effect of RAS Blockers on Chronic Kidney Disease Progression in Elderly Patients With Non Proteinuric Nephropathies@highlight

This study evaluates the effect of renin-angiotensin blockers on chronic kidney disease progression in elderly (>65 years old) patients with non-proteinuric nephropathies.

 Half of the patients will receive angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, while the other half will not receive them.

 Renal function, proteinuria and cardiovascular events will be follow up during a three year period.
