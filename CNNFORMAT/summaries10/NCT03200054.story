(fifthQuint)Postpartum Adherence Clubs for Antiretroviral Therapy.

 South Africa is implementing the policy of universal initiation of lifelong ART in all HIV-infected pregnant women regardless of CD4 cell count or disease stage ("Option B+") and given the high antenatal HIV seroprevalence, HIV-infected pregnant women represent the largest group of patients initiating ART in primary care facilities.

 However, there are few well developed models of service delivery to support implementation.

 There are particular concerns regarding the postpartum period, with multiple studies indicating high levels of non-retention in care and/or inadequate adherence to treatment postnatally.

 Adherence Clubs (ACs) are an innovative but untested model of care based on chronic disease management strategies that emphasize social support, adherence to treatment and retention in care, rather than intensive clinical management, as the most important determinant of long-term health outcomes in stable patients in chronic care.

 ACs have preliminarily been shown to to result in virologic outcomes that are similar to routine clinic services in patients stable on ART.

 The investigators are conducting a pragmatic, randomised controlled trial to evaluate two different strategies for delivering HIV care and treatment services during the postpartum period to HIV-infected women who initiated ART during pregnancy.

 Participants will be allocated to receive ART care at either local adult ART clinics, following the current standard of care, or the community-based adherence club system.

 Postpartum Adherence Clubs for Antiretroviral Therapy@highlight

South Africa is implementing the policy of universal initiation of lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) in all HIV-infected pregnant women regardless of CD4 cell count or disease stage ("Option B+").

 There is a recognised need for innovative models of service delivery to support adherence and retention in care in this group, particularly during the postpartum period.

 The investigators are conducting a pragmatic randomised control trial to compare virological outcomes 24 months postpartum in two models of service delivery for provision of HIV care and treatment services postpartum in women who initiated ART during pregnancy: local adult ART clinics and community-based adherence clubs.
