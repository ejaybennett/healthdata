(fifthQuint)Cognitive Training and Neuroplasticity in Mild Cognitive Impairment.

 In this clinical trial, investigators will evaluate if systematic cognitive training can improve cognitive performance in participants with memory loss.

 This study is for those who have demonstrated difficulty with memory.

 It will evaluate the effects of Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT) for improvement in everyday cognitive and function status, in addition to long-term changes in brain networks over an 18-month period.

 In this study, participants will be randomly assigned to Training Group 1 or 2; therefore, one will have a 50% chance of being assigned to CCT, and a 50% chance of being assigned to Crossword Puzzle Training (CPT).

 During the 18- month period, participants will be asked to come to the Memory Disorders Clinic at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) for a screening evaluation, and if eligible, will return for five follow-up visits at Weeks 12, 32, 52, and 78.
