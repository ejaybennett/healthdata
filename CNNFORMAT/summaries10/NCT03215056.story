(fifthQuint)Methoxyflurane Analgesia for Paediatric Injuries.

 This is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo controlled study in children and adolescents aged 6 to less than 18 years presenting to an ED requiring analgesia for acute pain, with visual analogue scale (VAS) score of 60 to 80 mm associated with minor trauma.

 In the context of the current study, minor trauma refers to "a non-critical and non-limb threatening physical wound or injury of the tissues", such as, soft tissue injuries, fractures of the extremities, burns, penetration by foreign bodies, lacerations, dislocation, contusions, etc.

 This study will include screening and enrolment, followed by treatment and day 14 2 day safety follow-up post treatment.

 The procedure for screening and enrolment including obtaining consent/assent is to occur on the same day.

 The expected duration for each patient in the study is up to 16 days.

 The clinician/research nurse must ascertain that the patient has not been pre-medicated with an analgesic within 5 hours (8 hours if diclofenac and 10 hours if oral morphine) prior to arrival at the ED or enrolment into this study.

 Eligible children and adolescents will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio (220 eligible patients; 176 children and 44 adolescents) to have 110 patients per treatment arm (44 children aged 6 to 8 years, 44 children aged 9 to 11 years and 22 adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years).

 Eligible patients will receive either methoxyflurane or placebo from the PENTHROX(R) inhaler in a 1:1 ratio.

 Pain scores will be assessed using the VAS or Wong-Baker FACES(R) Pain Rating scale in younger children who cannot utilise the VAS tool.

 Initial pain scores to establish study eligibility will be measured at two consecutive time points, at least 5 minutes apart, as screening pain score and validation pain score.

 After randomisation, baseline (time 0) pain score will be recorded.

 If the baseline pain score falls outside the range of 60 to 80 mm on the VAS or 6-8 on WBF, the patient will be withdrawn from the study (randomised but not treated).

 Patients who have a pain score between 60 and 80 mm on the VAS or 6-8 on WBF at screening, validation and baseline (time 0) will be eligible to receive treatment.

 Following enrolment and initial assessments, the research nurse will assist the patient to selfadminister ten successive inhalations of PENTHROX(R) (methoxyflurane) or placebo.

 The research nurse, the treating clinician and the patient will be blind to the treatment administered.

 Patients/parents/legal guardians will be advised that rescue medication will be available immediately on request at any time during or after the completion of the treatment.

 The rescue medication to be used will be at the discretion of the blinded clinician.

 The rescue medication is dependent on the standard practice at the participating site.

 For the purpose of being all inclusive, rescue analgesia will be intranasal fentanyl, intranasal diamorphine, intravenous morphine or oral morphine.

 Methoxyflurane Analgesia for Paediatric Injuries@highlight

This is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of methoxyflurane (Penthrox(R)) for the treatment of acute pain in children and adolescents from 6 to less than 18 years of age (presenting to an Emergency Department with minor trauma).

 It is conducted as part of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) agreed with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

 The study aims to provide evidence under blinded controlled conditions that Penthrox is safe and effective in patients aged 6 to less than 18 years presenting to ED with pain associated with minor trauma.
