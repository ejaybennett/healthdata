(firstQuint)OpenGo Sensor Insole in Open Wedge HTO.

 Forty patients who are planned for open wedge HTO with deformity in the proximal tibia will be included in the study.

 The open wedge HTO will be performed in the well known biplanar technique and the TomoFix plate will be used as fixation plate.

 To analyze the peak pressure and if the patients are able to reassemble the partial weight bearing/ the full weight bearing the OpenGo Sensor Insole (Moticon) will be used during the first 12 weeks after surgery.

 In addition, x-rays will be analyze for the alignment and angles and clinical scores will be gathered to investigate patient reported outcomes.
