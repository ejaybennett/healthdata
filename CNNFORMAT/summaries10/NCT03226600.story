(firstQuint)OrACELL vs.

 Connective Tissue in Miller Class 3 Defects.

 Twenty-four non-smoking, healthy patients, with 2mm or greater facial gingival recession at a minimum of one site that classified as a Miller Class I, II, or III recession defect were included.

 Patients were randomly assigned to either control (CTG) or OrACELL cent (test) groups, which were treated with identical surgical techniques.

 All root coverage clinical parameters were evaluated at baseline, 3-, and 6-months.
