(fifthQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of JNJ-42847922 as Adjunctive Therapy to Antidepressants in Adult Participants With Major Depressive Disorder Who Have Responded Inadequately to Antidepressant Therapy.

 The study will investigate the antidepressant effects of a range of doses of JNJ-42847922 (seltorexant) (versus placebo), as adjunctive treatment to antidepressant drugs for treatment of MDD, and will assess the safety and tolerability of JNJ-42847922.

 The study will be conducted in 3 phases: a screening phase (up to 4 weeks), a double-blind treatment phase (6 weeks), and a post-treatment follow-up phase (2 weeks).

 Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, and biomarker evaluations will be performed in the study at defined timepoints.

 The duration of the study will be up to approximately 12 weeks (84 days).

The purpose of this study is to assess the dose-response relationship of 2 doses of JNJ-42847922 before interim analysis, and potentially 3 doses based on interim analysis results, compared to placebo as adjunctive therapy to an antidepressant drug in improving depressive symptoms in participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who have had an inadequate response to current antidepressant therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI); and to assess the safety and tolerability of JNJ-42847922 compared to placebo as adjunctive therapy to an antidepressant in participants with MDD.
