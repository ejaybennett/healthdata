(firstQuint)Assessment of Cardiac Fixation During PET Using a New Drug Within Amyloid Cardiac Injuries.

.

 Hypothesis had been performed that PET with 18F-Flutemetamol (Vizamyl(R)) could lead an early diagnostic.

 Indeed, this tracer had been recently used to highlight inter-cerebral beta-amyloid plaques on patients with Alzheimer Disease.

 Because this labelling is performed on amyloid deposits, this tracer would lead to view and to quantify amyloid deposits within cardiac amyloid injuries.

 Results of this PET will be combined with scan examinations for a better anatomic tracking.

@highlight

To estimate distribution's parameters of 18F-Flutemetamol (Vizamyl(R)) fixation on myocardium for patients with amyloid cardiac injuries.
