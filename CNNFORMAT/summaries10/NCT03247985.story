(thirdQuint)Tacking Mesh Versus Self-fixating Mesh for Inguinal Hernia Repair.

 Participants will be placed into two groups.

 One group of participants will have mesh tacked into place for their hernia repairs.

 The other group will have self-fixating mesh into place.

 Both groups will have a piece of mesh that will widely cover the hernia defect.

 Before surgery, the participant will be asked to rate discomfort on a 0-10 scale.

 Zero stands for no pain and 10 is the worst pain they can imagine.

 Investigators will record information about general medical condition, medications and activity level.

 During the operation information will be recorded about the pain medicines the participant may receive.

 In the recovery room the participant will be asked to rate their pain on the 0-10 scale and more information will be recorded about any additional pain medicines that they may receive and assess activity level.

 Following surgery, Investigators will contact the participants by survey to obtain more information about pain level, medication use, and activity level.

 Tacking Mesh Versus Self-fixating Mesh for Inguinal Hernia Repair@highlight

Investigators are testing whether tacking mesh or self-fixating mesh used for inguinal hernia repair makes any difference in short-term pain or return to normal activities following the operation.

 Other studies have shown no significant difference in hernia recurrence rate when metal tacks are not used to hold the mesh in place.
