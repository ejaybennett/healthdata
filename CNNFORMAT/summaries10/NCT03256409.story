(fifthQuint)Bar and Ball Joint Overdentures Surface Roughness and Microbial Adherence.

 Adherence mold and yeast and mesophyll aerobe to BOD and BJOD, Surface roughness (Ra), and Statistical Analyses Microbial populations have been controlled in the saliva at initial time and adherence at 30 to 180 days after the overdentures in the mouth.

 The saliva sample was obtained from the patient in a sterile sputum collection bottle through a sterile solution.

 The overdenture samples were extracted and processed for analysis.

 Each sample was submerged in 1/4 sterile Ringer and subjected to vigorous ultrasound shaking.

 From each of the microbial suspensions, successive dilutions were made to determine the total number of viable microorganisms present.

 Total count of mold and yeast and total count of mesophyll aerobe were performed.

 The surface roughness of BOD and BJOD was determined with the rugosimeter the Mitutoyo Surfest SJ-301(R) (Mitutoyo Corporation Inc.

, Kanagawa, Japan), through a displacement force of 4mN and of the tray to 0.

5 mm/s and back to 1 mm/s (Murtra and Arcis,1999).

 The roughness profile Ra was evaluated and determined in microns (um) through five readings for each of the samples in the study respectively.

 The results of BOD and BJOD were compared for the determination of Ra and the adherence of mold and yeast and mesophyll aerobe.

 For this, we used the statistics Shapiro-Wilk, T and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient to determinate the relationship between the study variables.

 Bar and Ball Joint Overdentures Surface Roughness and Microbial Adherence@highlight

The aim of the study was to compare the surface roughness (Ra) of the implant retained mandibular bar overdenture (BOD) and the implant retained mandibular ball joint overdenture (BJOD) in jaw and its relation with the adhesion of molds and yeasts and mesophyll aerobe, in time 30 to 180 days in mouth.

 Five systems titanium bar CARES(R) and synOcta(R) Straumann(R) Dental Implant System, Holding AG Inc.

, Basel, Switzerland (BOD); and five systems joint ball Klockner(R) Implant System; Soadco Inc.

, Escaldes-Engordany; Andorra (BJOD), were used in two parallel groups of five participants, in an essay to simple blind person.

 To 30 to 180 days they were withdrawn and they were evaluated the Ra (Mitutoyo Surfest SJ-301(R) Mitutoyo Corporation Inc.

, Kanagawa, Japan) and the adhesion of microorganisms (CFU/ml).

 To 180 days (P = 0.

723) differences exist as regards the adhesion of mold and yeast and mesophyll aerobe, being major in BJOD.
