(thirdQuint)Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for the Treatment of OPD.

 Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either SBRT or no SBRT at a ratio of 2:1 (SBRT : no SBRT), with all patients continuing to receive background treatment with TKI therapy as clinically indicated and as per standard care.

 Patients randomised to receive SBRT will receive a dose and fractionation schedule dependent on OPD lesion site and proximity to critical normal tissues.

 All patients will be seen 8 weeks post randomisation, then 3 monthly in line with routine care.

 HALT aims to assess whether in patients with mutation positive advanced NSCLC the use of SBRT to 3 sites of OPD with continuation of TKI improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared with continuation of TKI alone.

HALT is a phase II, randomised multi-centre study with integrated seamless continuation to phase III trial following acceptable safety and feasibility assessment.

 HALT aims to recruit 110 patients with mutation positive advanced NSCLC with oligoprogressive disease (OPD) following initial response to a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI).
