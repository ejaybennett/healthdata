(fifthQuint)Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for Motor Symptoms in Psychiatric Disorders.

 Psychomotor slowing may occur in major psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorders or schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

 It refers to slowing of fine motor skills, motor planning and gross motor behavior.

 In major depression and schizophrenia, psychomotor slowing is associated with alterations of premotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia.

 This randomized, sham-controlled, prospective trial will test, whether 15 sessions of rTMS in 3 weeks may ameliorate psychomotor slowing in schizophrenia or major depression.

 Eligible participants will be randomized to one of four arms:.
