(firstQuint)Effects of Acute Intermittent Hypoxia on Sensory Function in Healthy Adults.

 Despite the strong results of motor studies, the affects of AIH on sensory function has not been established.

 We will use a commercially-available hypoxicator that can be programmed to achieve a targeted level of arterial oxygen saturation.

 We plan to compare 3 previously published protocols that have generated motor facilitation (and a sham condition) to characterize and effects on sensory function in healthy adults.

 Effects of Acute Intermittent Hypoxia on Sensory Function in Healthy Adults@highlight

Exposure to acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) can facilitate of motor output but no studies of sensory effects has been reported.
