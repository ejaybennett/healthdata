(firstQuint)Cd11b and Cd56 as Prognostic Markers in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 1.

 CD11b expression level is a prognostic biomarker for AML patient.

 CD11b positivity could predict a poor prognosis for AML patients.

 2.

 CD56 antigen expression, an inexpensive, easy to detect and reproduce index, is closely related to the prognosis of AML patients.
