(secondQuint)Evaluation of a Novel Medical Device to Facilitate Gel Instillation During Change of Long-term Urinary Catheters.

 This is a randomized, open label, controlled, parallel group study, which comprises one visit that includes: assessment for eligibility, randomization to one of two treatment alternatives, followed by the actual intervention and evaluation of outcomes.

 The interventions are either change of catheter according to the regional standard procedure (the comparator group) or change of catheter with the additional use of the novel device to facilitate gel instillation and a slightly modified procedure (the experimental group).
