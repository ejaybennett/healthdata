(firstQuint)A Study of EGF816 and Gefitinib in TKI-nave EGFR-mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 This research study is a Phase II clinical trial.

 Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease or patient population.

 "Investigational" means that the drug or drugs are being studied and have not been approved together for patients.

 The FDA (the U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration) has approved gefitinib as a treatment option for EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer.

 The FDA has not approved EGF816 as a treatment for any disease at this time.

 In this research study, the investigators are studying the safety and efficacy of the combination of the study drugs EGF816 and gefitinib.

 Both EGF816 and gefitinib are inhibitors which target a specific mutation in cancer and may stop tumors growing and multiplying.
