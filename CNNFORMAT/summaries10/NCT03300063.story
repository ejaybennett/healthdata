(firstQuint)Treating Sleep Apnea Induced Hypoxemia With Oxygen in Acute Stroke Patients.

 Acute stroke patients will be tested for nocturnal hypoxemia using overnight oximetry.

 Those with evidence of hypoxemia will be randomized into two groups.

 One group will receive standard medical care.

 The other group will receive standard medical care as well as receiving low flow oxygen during sleep.
