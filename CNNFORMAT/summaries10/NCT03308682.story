(fifthQuint)177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors.

 Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that can develop anywhere in the body and arise from neuroendocrine cells throughout the endocrine system.

 The most recent NCCN guidelines for unresectable and metastatic NET recommend somatostatin analogues as first-line treatment, but do not recommend a particular treatment sequence for the remaining therapies.

 Radiolabeled somatostatin analogue therapy, also known as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy has become a well-accepted treatment for patients with well to moderately differentiated unresectable or metastatic NETs and disease progression after first-line treatment.

 However, a major problem in the therapeutic use of 177Lu-Dotatate has been its short half-life and fast rate of clearance.

 This study was designed to investigate the safety, dosimetry and preliminary effects of a long-lasting radiolabeled somatostatin analogue 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE in patients with advanced metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.
