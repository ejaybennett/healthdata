(thirdQuint)The Effect of Probiotics on Maintenance of Health in Pregnancy and Infants.

 Throughout pregnancy women undergo many biological changes, including alterations in their microbiota.

 These infections can exacerbate pregnancy complications and increase the risk of preeclampsia and preterm birth.

 The present study aims to evaluate the potential effects of perinatal use of probiotics on the number of diagnosed viral, bacterial and fungal infections in pregnant women and on the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy.

 Potential infections include but are not limited to influenza/colds, bacterial vaginosis, mastitis, candidiasis, urinary tract infection and gingivitis.

 Additionally, the benefits of probiotic intake by the mother on the infant during pregnancy and breastfeeding will be evaluated.
