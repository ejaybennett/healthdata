(thirdQuint)Periodontal Therapy in Thalassemia Major Patients.

 Treatment modalities in patients with thalassemia include long-term transfusion therapy, iron chelation, splenectomy, allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation and supportive measures.

 Attempts to downgrade the systemic proinflammation and thereby reducing the morbidity of the disease warrants investigation in patients with -thalassemia (TM-).

 In blood disorders, as with most other diseases, achieving and maintaining inflammatory homeostasis is essential and necessary for survival.

 Both TM and gingival diseases cause increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the body fluids.

 Moreover, higher prevalence of gingival diseases is reported in children with TM.

 With oral hygiene maintenance and care, down-regulation of the systemic burden of the disease might be attained which will subsequently aid in achieving reduced morbidity in children with TM.

 Both the groups will receive non surgical periodontal therapy (scaling and root planing) with the chlorhexidine containing adjunct in the form of a mouthrinse.

 Additionally, they will be taught standard tooth brushing technique (Fones technique).

 Participants will receive both verbal instructions and practical demonstrations.

 Periodontal Therapy in Thalassemia Major Patients@highlight

The study aims to evaluate the effect of local non surgical periodontal therapy on the systemic pro-inflammatory markers in the -thalassemia (TM-) patients with chronic periodontitis and systemically healthy demographically matched controls with chronic periodontitis.

 Both groups will receive non surgical periodontal therapy.
