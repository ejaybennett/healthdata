(fifthQuint)Investigation of a Novel Integrated Care Concept (NICC) for Patients Suffering From Chronic Cardiovascular Disease.

 Background: Cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally and represent a major economic burden on health care systems.

 Positive effects of disease management programs have been shown for patients with heart failure (HF).

 Remote monitoring and telemonitoring with active intervention are beneficial in atrial fibrillation (AF) and therapy resistant hypertension (TRH), respectively.

 For these patients, the investigators have developed a novel integrated care concept (NICC) which combines telemedicine with intensive support by a call center, an integrated care network including in- and outpatient care providers and guideline therapy for patients.

 Methods: The aim of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of NICC over guideline therapy alone.

 The trial is designed as open-label bi-center parallel-group design with two groups.

 Patients will be included if they are either inpatients or if they are referred to the outpatient clinic of the hospitals by their treating physician.

 Randomization will be done individually with stratification by cardiovascular disease (AF, HF, TRH), center and admission type.

 Primary endpoints are based on the 1-year observation period after randomization.

 The first primary endpoint is the composite endpoint consisting of mortality, stroke and myocardial infarction.

 The number of hospitalizations form the second primary endpoint.

 The third primary endpoint is identical to the first primary endpoint plus cardiac decompensation.

 Adjustments for multiple testing are done using a fall back strategy.

 Secondary endpoints include patient adherence, health care costs, quality of life and safety.

 A sample size of 2930 gives 80% power at the two-sided 2.

5% test-level for the first primary endpoint.

 The power for the second primary endpoint is 99.

8% at this sample size, and it is 80% with 1086 patients.

 Discussion: This study will inform care providers whether quality of care can be improved by an integrated care concept providing telemedicine through a 24/7 call center approach.

 We expect that cost of the NICC will be lower than standard care because of reduced hospitalizations.

 If the study has a positive result, NICC is planned to be immediately rolled out in the state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania.

 The trial will also guide additional research to disentangle the effects of this complex intervention.

 Investigation of a Novel Integrated Care Concept (NICC) for Patients Suffering From Chronic Cardiovascular Disease@highlight

Cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally and represent a major economic burden on health care systems.

 The investigators have developed a novel integrated care concept (NICC) which combines telemedicine with intensive support by a call center, an integrated care network including in- and outpatient care providers and guideline therapy for patients with heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF) or therapy resistant hypertension (TRH).

 The aim of the study is to show that NICC is preferable over guideline therapy alone.

 The investigators aim at including approximately 2930 patients who are either inpatients or referred to the outpatient clinic of the participating hospitals by their treating physician.

 The study will thus inform care providers whether quality of care can be improved by an integrated care concept providing telemedicine through a 24/7 call center approach.
