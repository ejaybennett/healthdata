(thirdQuint)Changes of Macular Pigment and Parameters of Eyes After YAG Laser Treatment in Cases With Capsule Opacification.

 This clinical trial was conducted following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

 The local authorized clinical trials ethics committee approved the protocol and consent forms (Afyon Kocatepe University Clinical Trials Ethics Committee, 2011-KAEK-2 2017/172).

 Between 2015 and 2016, 38 pseudophakic participants ranging from 45 to 65 years of age and previously undergone cataract surgery, no prior Nd: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy and pan-retinal laser photocoagulation (PRP), were enrolled in this study.

 Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) diagnosis of patients undergone cataract surgery at least 2 years ago were diagnosed by refractive surgery and retina specialists at ophthalmology department of Afyon Kocatepe University.

 Requirements of Nd:Yag laser posterior capsulotomy of each participants were decided by consensus of 3 ophthalmologists.

 After providing information to patients about the disease and treatment, patients predicted to show adherence to treatment, were enrolled in the study.

 Detailed ophthalmological examinations of all subjects were performed prior to Nd: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy intervention.

 Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was evaluated and converted from Snellen to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units for easiness in statistical analysis.

 Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured by using Goldmann applanation tonometer (AT900(R), the Haag-Streit Diagnostics, Essex, England).

 Biomicroscopic and fundus findings (by using SuperField NC(R) non-contact slit lamp lens, Volk optical, OH, USA), and gonioscopy (by using Volk(R) G-4 Four-mirror glass gonio lens, OH, USA) of patients were examined by using slit lamp biomicroscopy (SL-D701(R) slit-lamp biomicroscope, Topcon, Tokyo, Japan).

 Anterior chamber parameters of cases with PCO were measured by using anterior segment module of optical coherence tomography (OCT) (The Spectralis(R), Heidelberg Engineering, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany).

 Measurements of IOP and anterior chamber parameters, visual acuity and gonioscopy examinations were performed before pupil dilatation; then, at least 7 mm pupil dilatation was achieved using 1% tropicamide and 2.

5% phenylephrine eye drops at ten-minute intervals.

 Slit-lamp and fundus examinations, and measurements of central macular thickness (CMT), choroidal thicknesses (CTs) and MPOD were performed after maximal pupil dilatation.

 According to biomicroscopic examination 3 ophthalmologists with consensus agreed Nd: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy requirement for each case with PCO.

 Proposed procedure, including risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with all subjects, and all participants signed of informed consent form.

 Patients had only mild to moderate PCO were enrolled in this study to reduce obstacles to measurements.

 Participants who had false-negative acuity predictions because of diffuse PCO, poor pupillary dilation, poor patient posture at the slit-lamp examination, poor patient cooperation, senility, illiteracy, communication problems, nystagmus, tremor, and fatigue were excluded in this study.

 CMT and CTs were measured by using OCT (The Spectralis(R) OCT2 Module, Heidelberg Engineering, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany).

 Enhanced depth imaging-OCT (EDI-OCT) mode of same device was used to measure CTs.

 CTs were recorded as subfoveal CT (SCT), nasal CT (NCT) and temporal CT (TCT) represent under the fovea, 3 mm nasal to the fovea and 3 mm temporal to the fovea respectively.

 MPOD measurements were subsequently made by using luminance differential thresholds test (Color perimetry technique) (MonPack System, Metrovision, Perenchies, France).

 After measurements a refractive surgery specialist carried out Nd: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy interventions to patients who were decided to applying Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy (Laserex Tango, Ellex Medical, SA, Australia).

 Proparacaine hydrochloride 0.

5% eye drop (Alcaine(R), Alcon Laboratories, TX, USA) applied to the cornea before the procedure as topical anesthetic for the use of contact lens.

 Abraham contact lens (Ocular Abraham Iridectomy YAG(R), Ocular, WA, USA) was used during procedure to stabilize the eye, accurate focusing, and to improve the laser beam optics.

 The minimal amount of energy necessary to obtain breakdown and rupture the capsule as possible was aimed and applied during procedures.

 Applied energy range from 1 to 2 mJ/pulse opened all capsules in this study.

 Firstly, cruciate opening was created beginning superiorly near the 12 o'clock position and progressing downward toward the 6 o'clock position.

 Shots were then placed at the edge of the capsule opening, progressed laterally toward the 3 and 9 o'clock positions.

 The laser intentionally focused posterior to the capsule to avoid IOL marks.

 Free-floating fragments were avoided because they might remain and cause additional retinal effects.

 Patients that demonstrated free-floating fragments, visually significant pits and cracks in interventions were removed from study because of potentials to influence measurements.

 Patients that experienced large fragments in laser treatment were also excluded because of fragments may settle against the endothelium or angle structures.

 Applied total energy, total number of shots and total duration were recorded for each eye.

 After Nd: YAG laser intervention all subjects were followed up for 4 hours in terms of increased IOP and severe acute anterior chamber inflammation.

 IOPs were remeasured at 1st and 4th hour.

 Subjects' eyes had IOP of 27 mmHg or more, and aqueous flares of 2+ or more were not included in this study.

 Brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic suspension (Azopt(R), Alcon Laboratories, TX, USA) twice a day and ketorolac tromethamine 0.

4% ophthalmic solution 4 times a day (Acular LS(R), Allergan, Inc.

 CA, USA) treatments were started to all subjects and used for a week.

 All examinations and measurements were repeated and recorded at 1st week, 1st and 2nd month.

 All patients were told to continue their normal diet and no participants were used supplements containing carotenoid during study period.

 Changes of Macular Pigment and Parameters of Eyes After YAG Laser Treatment in Cases With Capsule Opacification@highlight

It has been hypothesized that potential effects of laser Nd: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy may affect macular pigment as well as choroidal thickness, macular thickness and anterior chamber parameters, so it was aimed to investigate possible effects of Nd: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy on macular pigment optical density, choroidal thickness, macular thickness and anterior chamber parameters in cases with posterior capsule opacification in this study.
