(secondQuint)Pilot Study Comparing Ventilation Modes During CPR With Mechanical Compression Device.

.

 Mechanical compression devices are applied to grant continuous chest compressions and consequently blood flow during CPR (cardiopulmonary rescuscitation).

 Current guidelines, however, are lacking guidance of the optimal ventilation strategy in such scenarios.

 This may lead to lung injuries caused by high pressure levels in the chest while applying compression and ventilation simultaneously or hypoventilation.

 Consequently, this pilot study assesses iwhich ventilation mode is optimal.

 Patients will be assigned randomly to one of the three ventilation modes (Volume controlled, BiPAP-ASB, CPAP).

 Ventilation parameters will be continuously monitored for 15 minutes while blood gas analyses are taken as well.

 Further secondary outcome parameters will be assessed, e.

g.

 hospital mortality.

 Pilot Study Comparing Ventilation Modes During CPR With Mechanical Compression Device.

@highlight

Comparison of three ventilation modes (volume controlled, BIPAP and CPAP) during cardiopulmonary re-suscitation with a mechanical compression device in the emergency room.

 Primary aim is to assess mean ventilation volume in the first 15 minutes after randomization.
