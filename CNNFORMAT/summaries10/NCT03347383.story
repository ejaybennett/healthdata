(fifthQuint)Clinical Trial Investigating the Combination Therapy With Luminor DCB and iVolution Stent in TASC C and D Femoropopliteal Lesions.

 The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate, in a controlled setting, the long-term safety and efficacy of the combination therapy with the Luminor DCB and the iVolution stent post CE-certification and according to the indications of the Instructions for use (IFU) with focus on the treatment of TASC C and D femoropopliteal atherosclerotic lesions.

 Patients will be selected based on the investigator's assessment, evaluation of the underlying disease and the eligibility criteria.

 The patient's medical condition should be stable, with no underlying medical condition which would prevent them from performing the required testing or from completing the study.

 Patients should also be geographically stable, willing and able to cooperate in this clinical study and remain available for long-term follow-up.

 A patient is considered enrolled in the study after obtaining the patients informed consent, if there is full compliance with the study eligibility criteria and after successful guidewire passage through the study target lesion.

 Prior to the index procedure the following tests and clinical data will be collected: informed consent for data collection, demographics, medical history, medication record, physical examination, clinical category of chronic limb ischemia (Rutherford category) and resting ankle-brachial index (ABI).

 During the procedure, the vascular access can be achieved to the investigator's standard clinical practice.

 After successful lesion passage, diagnostic angiography of the lesion area and distal run-off is performed and angiographic measurements (vessel diameter, percentage stenosis and lesion length) are collected.

 All inflow-limiting lesion will be treated according to the investigators standard clinical practice before treatment of the target lesion.

 Pre-dilatation of the target lesion is mandatory with the Oceanus balloon.

 After pre-dilatation, a least one Luminor DCB will be inflated and at least 1 iVolution stent will be deployed at the target lesion.

 At the physician's discretion, post-dilatation can be performed.

 No other adjunctive therapies (atherectomy, laser) are allowed.

 The complete femoropopliteal vasculature should be treated in one single session, staged interventions are not allowed.

 All outflow-limiting lesions must be treated according to the hospital treatment standard.

 The regular follow-ups are necessary to monitor the condition of the patient and the procedure.

 Patients will be invited for a follow-up visit at 1, 6 and 12 months after the index procedure.

 The following data will be collected during these follow-up visit: medication record, physical examination, rutherford categorization, ABI and color flow doppler ultrasound.

 study investigates the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy with the Luminor drug coated balloon (DCB) and the iVolution stent in the treatment of TASC C and D femoropopliteal lesions.

 An expected total of 100 patients will be treated in the scope of this study.

 The lesion is located within the native superficial femoral artery and/or the popliteal artery.

 Prior to dilatation with the Luminor DCB, pre-dilatation with the Oceanus balloon is mandatory.

 After dilatation with the Luminor DCB, stenting with the iVolution stent need to be performed.

 Post-dilatation can be performed according to the physician's discretion.

 Patients will be invited for a follow-up visit at 1, 6 and 12 month post-procedure.

 The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is defined as the freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 12 months.

 Secondary endpoints include primary patency rate at 6 and 12 months, freedom from clinically-driven TLR at 6 months, clinical success at 1, 6 and 12 months and freedom from serious adverse events at pre-discharge, 1, 6 and 12 months follow-up.
