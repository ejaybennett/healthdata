(firstQuint)Comparison of Extubation Time Between Total Intravenous Anesthesia With Spinal Anesthesia for Cardiac Surgery.

 This study compares the time needed to extubate of two anesthesic techniques, 1) Total Intravenous Anesthesia guided by Bispectral Index (BIS), 2) Spinal Anesthesia with minimal opioid dose for cardiac surgery.

 Identify the best anesthesia technique to do ultrafast track extubation can minimize the risk of infection associated.
