 To determine the effect of an MBSR training program for patients with low-risk chest pain associated with anxiety on mental health (longitudinal GAD-7 scores, quality of life (PROMIS Global Short Form), and ED resource utilization (return ED visits).

 The working hypothesis is that early referral to MBSR will help patients better regulate their thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations related to their anxiety symptoms and have a significant positive effect on patient-centered outcomes such as mental health, quality of life as well as decreased ED resource utilization.

 To this end the investigators will randomize patients identified via a two step process (HEART Score 9 to usual care referrals versus MBSR.

 The investigators will then follow these participants for outcomes including change in GAD-7 scores, PROMIS Global Short Form, ED utilization among other outcomes at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.
