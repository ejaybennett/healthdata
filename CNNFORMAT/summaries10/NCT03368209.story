(firstQuint)Noninvasive Glucose Measurements - Database and Calibration Compilation.

 This trial constitutes three subprotocols: "The OUH protocol", "The Home 1 protocol" and "The Home 2 protocol" The investigation was initiated to collect spectral raman data paired with validated blood references.

 In the OUH protocol, capillary blood was analysed by ABL 800 Flex blood gas analyzer by Radiometer.

 In the Home 1 protocol, references were obtained by the finger pricking procedure from HemoCue (Radiometer).

 In the Home 2 protocol, HemoCue measurements were conducted along with continuous monitoring using Dexcom G4/G5 device (Dexcom) or FreeStyle Libre (Abbott) The data was collected from diabetic patients and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) readings were obtained from all subjects.

 Noninvasive Glucose Measurements - Database and Calibration Compilation@highlight

This study collected spectral raman data from diabetic patients.

 Data was paired with validated capillary references as well as CGM/FGM readings.

 Data was used to develop models for glucose prediction.
