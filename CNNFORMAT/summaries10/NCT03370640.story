(firstQuint)Study Assessing the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of SEP-363856 in Japanese Male and Female Subjects With Schizophrenia.

 This is an ascending multiple oral dose, open-label study assessing the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of SEP-363856 in male and female subjects with schizophrenia.

 Subjects will have up to two visits, including a screening visit, and a 17-day in-clinic period.

 Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day -4 to start or complete a taper/washout of their prior antipsychotic medication(s) under the supervision of the Investigator.

 On Day 1, after subjects have successfully completed the taper/washout of prior medication, subjects will be administered SEP 363856, and dosing with SEP 363856 will continue once-daily for 10 days in-clinic dosing.

 From Day 11 through Day 13, inclusive, subjects will be restabilized on their adequate antipsychotic medication(s) before clinic discharge on Day 14.

 Some subjects may require a longer restabilization process based on Investigator judgment.

 Subjects who discontinue the study prior to Day 13 will require an in-clinic stay for 3 days (or longer based on Investigator judgment) for restabilization on prior medications.
