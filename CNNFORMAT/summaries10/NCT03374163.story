(firstQuint)Effect Of Intravenous IntralipidTherapyon Pregnancy Outcome in Women With History of Recurrent Implantation Failure Undergoing Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection-Embryo Transfer Cycle: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

 the aim to evaluate the effect ofempiricintralipidinfusion therapy on pregnancy outcomes in patient withunexplained recurrentimplantation failure (RIF) undergoIntracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

 A total of 142 patients with history of unexplained RIF3 or more cycles were included in the study.

 Patient were randomized into two groups, study group (n=71) and control group (n=71).

 The study groupreceivedintralipid 20%infusionon the day of embryo transfer (ET) and a second dose on the day of pregnancy test.

 The control group underwent ET without intralipidinfusion.
