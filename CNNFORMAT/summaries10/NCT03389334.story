(firstQuint)Massage on Pain Levels, Range of Motion, and Muscle Strength in Unilateral Lower Limb Amputees.

 There are no other studies that address the effects of massage therapy as a treatment option for lower limb amputees suffering from lower back pain or the effects this has on muscle performance and/or range of motion.

 In addressing the physical, psychological, and social needs of a person living with limb loss, there should be a consideration for a multidisciplinary approach that could potentially include massage therapy as a fundamental standard of care.

 Therefore, the purpose of this graduate student research study is to test whether myofascial release massage can improve lower back pain levels in lower limb amputees and consequently improve quality of life and other measurable variables such as range of motion and muscle strength.
