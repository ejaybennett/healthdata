(secondQuint)BIS of Sedation Depth During Flexible Bronchoscopy.

.

 Fentanyl is opioid receptor agonists.

 It is a fast-acting, short duration and potent analgesics.

 Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is mostly used in the diagnosis and therapy in the respiratory disease.

 As we know, there has not pain nerve in the lung.

 People will not feel pain when they are in FB.

 If fentanyl will be effective in FB? Our study will observe the effect of conscious sedation in FB with fentanyl or without fentanyl.
