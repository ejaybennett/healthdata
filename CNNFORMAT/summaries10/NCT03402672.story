(thirdQuint)AWAITS: A Web-based E-health Application for Active Illicit Opioid Users.

 The pre-post study of AWAITS will: 1) assess the acceptability of AWAITS as measured by participant feedback about the intervention; 2) test the impact of AWAITS on knowledge about opioid overdose, as measured by the OOTAS; 3) assess the proportion of participants who accept a list of local MAT treatment providers; and 4) test the impact of AWAITS on interest in being tested for HCV/HIV.

 The acceptability of AWAITS will be assessed with a feedback form which includes questions about how helpful the intervention was (scale of 1-4), what the patient liked most and least about the intervention, and any suggestions for improving it.

 The average (and standard deviation) for the rated helpfulness of the intervention will be derived and the qualitative data about what they liked most and least about the intervention and suggestions for improvement will be tabulated.

 Pre-/post-changes in the percent of correct knowledge assessment items (i.

e.

, about overdose and MAT) and interest in HCV/HIV testing will be analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

 The proportion of participants accepting a list of local MAT treatment providers will be calculated.
