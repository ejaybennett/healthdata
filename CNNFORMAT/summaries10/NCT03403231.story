(fifthQuint)INcreasing Veteran EngagemeNT to Prevent Diabetes (INVENT).

 There is tremendous national enthusiasm for translating and disseminating efficacious strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

 Yet, little attention has been devoted to how the investigators can better leverage the processes through which patients receive information about prevention of T2DM to better engage them in such prevention.

 Further, despite efforts to disseminate structured programs, many patients at high risk for developing T2DM may still be unable or unwilling to access them.

 In these cases, increasing patient engagement in individually directed lifestyle change or pharmacotherapy is critical.

 Strategies developed in the fields of behavioral economics and health psychology hold significant promise for improving Veteran engagement in each of these approaches.

 To date, however, these strategies have rarely been translated into real-world settings where they could benefit Veterans.

 This novel work will address this critical gap and could transform communication with Veterans about prevention in ways that will improve their health outcomes.

 The following 5 strategies will be implemented in the weekly messages that study participants will receive: (1) tailoring to aspirations in life; (2) implementation intentions; (3) preference checklists; (4) urgency framing; (5) social norms.

 The investigators will implement these strategies alone and in combination in a 16-arm factorial design experiment.

This study will evaluate a VA MyHealtheVet Secure Messaging intervention that uses different intervention messaging strategies designed to increase engagement in behaviors to prevent type 2 diabetes.

 The investigators will enroll 144 eligible Veterans into a 12-week MyHealtheVet Secure Messaging intervention.

 Eligible Veterans include those who are currently using MyHealtheVet secure messaging, meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, and have received an HbA1c test within the last 6 months that meets the ADA/CDC classification for prediabetes.

 Study participants will be surveyed about their engagement in behaviors to prevent TDM2 and mediators of this engagement.

 After completing a baseline survey, participants will be randomly assigned to receive different novel presentations of information about ways to prevent T2DM through both Secure Messaging and US Mail.

 The investigators will test the 5 presentations that each: (1) represent an innovative approach from behavioral economics or health psychology with great promise to increase engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM among patients with prediabetes; and (2) have not been tested in this setting.
