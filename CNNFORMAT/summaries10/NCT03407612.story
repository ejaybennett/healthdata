(thirdQuint)Outcomes of CPM Usage Following Arthroscopic Acetabular Labral Repair.

 Subjects undergoing primary hip arthroscopy for acetabular labral repair were randomized to determine whether they would receive a CPM.

 Those subjects receiving a CPM were instructed to use it for 4-6 hours daily throughout the first two postoperative weeks.

 The total number of pain medications and average pain scores over the two weeks, as well as Hip Outcome Score Activity of Daily Living (HOS ADL) scores at standard time points were compared via a two sample t-test and intention-to-treat analysis.

 Outcomes of CPM Usage Following Arthroscopic Acetabular Labral Repair@highlight

The purpose of this study is to measure whether CPM (continuous passive motion) usage improves outcomes following arthroscopic hip surgery that includes labral repair.

 Investigators tested the hypothesis that CPM usage reduces pain levels and pain medication use and improves function in individuals who undergo hip arthroscopy.
