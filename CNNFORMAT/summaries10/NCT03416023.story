(firstQuint)Safety, Performance and Durability of the TIES Implant in Patients Requiring a Permanent Ileostomy.

 This is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm clinical study that will assess the safety, performance and durability of the TIES(R) transcutaneous titanium implant in patients requiring a permanent ileostomy (a surgical procedure that involves connecting the small intestine to the skin to create an opening).

 The Transcutaneous Implant Evacuation System (TIES(R)) is a medical device designed to enable continence control for patients who would otherwise need to wear an ileostomy bag.

 Eligible subjects will undergo a conventional ileostomy procedure under general anaesthesia and have the TIES(R) Port implanted.

 To date, the TIES(R) has been evaluated in 11 patients in 2 clinical studies.

 This study aims to collect more data that will assess performance, durability, safety and the impact that the TIES(R) has on a patient's quality of life.

 The study will enroll 50 patients across Europe that require a permanent ileostomy, including patients with ulcerative colitis, familial adenomatous polyposis coli or other diseases such as Crohns disease.

 Study subjects are expected to participate for approximately 1 year following surgical placement of the TIES(R) Port.

 Participation will involve a screening period, surgical implantation of the device (in-patient) and scheduled follow-up assessments out to 1 year post implant.
