(thirdQuint)Quantitative Analysis of Global Proteome in Bone Samples From Patients With Osteoporotic and Nonosteoporotic Fracture.

 OBJECTIVES: 1.

 Establish the iron content in bone specimen in patients with hip fracture.

 2.

 Explore the correlation of BMD and differentially expressed proteins.

 OUTLINE: 1.

 Collect human bone specimens from patients with osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic Fracture.

 2.

 Provide a repository for storage of tissue and make these specimens available for approved projects by laboratory-based investigators.

 3.

 Collect clinical data on these patients including bone mineral density.

 4.

 To examine the bone iron content using ICP/MS.

 5.

 Investigate the differentially expressed proteins through quantitative analysing the global proteome of osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic fracture bone specimens.

 Quantitative Analysis of Global Proteome in Bone Samples From Patients With Osteoporotic and Nonosteoporotic Fracture@highlight

RATIONALE: Collecting and storing bone samples from patients with osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic fracture to quantitatively analyze the differentially expressed proteins to further explain the relationship between bone iron content and bone mineral density (BMD).

 PURPOSE: This research study is looking at changes of iron content and differentially expressed proteins in bone samples from patients with osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic.
