(thirdQuint)Alleviation by Fisetin of Frailty, Inflammation, and Related Measures in Older Women.

 To the researchers' knowledge, there are no published studies utilizing Fisetin in alteration of frailty markers.

 Several studies involve use of Fisetin for its anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects in animal models.

 Fisetin may reduce oxidative stress, alleviate hyperglycemia, and improve kidney function.

 No one has evaluated the biologic markers of inflammation and frailty in older postmenopausal women.

 The researchers plan to evaluate markers of frailty and markers of inflammation, insulin resistance, and bone resorption while maintaining bone formation in older postmenopausal women.

This is a pilot study to evaluate whether targeting inflammation will help reduce markers of insulin resistance inflammation, bone resorption and physical dysfunction in elderly women with gait disturbance.

 Positive results of this study would lead to the development of a larger clinical trial examining the effects of this intervention on age-related dysfunction.
