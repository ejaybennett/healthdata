(firstQuint)PRELOOP Trial: Synthetic Versus Biological Mesh for Prevention of Incisional Hernia After Loop-ileostomy Closure.

 Incisional hernia after loop-ileostomy closure may be an underestimated problem.

 Research on both biological and synthetic mesh in this context is scarce and no randomized controlled trials comparing meshes exist.

 The aim of this study is to compare Parietene Macro and Permacol in prevention of incisional site hernia after temporary loop-ileostomy reversal after anterior resection and TME for rectal cancer.
