(fifthQuint)Single Session of tACS in a Depressive Episode.

 Participants will report for a study visit and will review and sign a consent form.

 Participants will complete several clinical assessments and also take a urine drug test and urine pregnancy test (if applicable).

 Eligibility will be re-assessed by the investigators before the participant moves on to the next phase.

 If the participant still qualifies, the participant will first be fitted with two 5x5cm electrodes placed over F3/F4 (10-20 measurement system) and one 5x7cm electrode placed over Cz, along with ECG electrodes as well as a respiration belt.

 In addition, the participant will have a 128-channel EEG net placed on their head.

 Participants will provide a saliva sample to assess for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which may affect how the participant's brain responds to stimulation.

 Once the participant is fitted with this equipment, the participant will complete a 2-minute resting state EEG with the participant's eyes closed, then a 5-minute resting state EEG with the participant's eyes open.

 Following these recordings, participants will provide a saliva sample and respond to additional questionnaires.

 Immediately following this, the participant will receive 40 minutes of stimulation (tACS or sham tACS) with simultaneous EEG, ECG, and respiration recorded.

 During this stimulation, participants will sit comfortably upright and awake.

 After stimulation has completed, participants will provide an additional saliva sample and respond to additional questionnaires.

 Once completed, participants will then complete an additional 15-minute resting state EEG with the participant's eyes open.

 Finally, participants will respond to a blinding questionnaire to assess if the participant thought that the participant received stimulation.

 Once complete, the participant will leave.

 This session is estimated to last about 4 hours.

 Single Session of tACS in a Depressive Episode@highlight

Purpose: Investigating the effects of non-invasive transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on healthy participants and participants with mood disorders.

 Participants: 30 males and females, ages 18-65, with depressed mood; 30 healthy males and females, ages 18-65, free of neurological or psychiatric conditions.

 Procedures: This is a single visit study with two stimulation conditions (tACS and sham tACS).

 The session will begin with clinical assessments (behavioral inhibition and behavioral activation scales (BIS/BAS), the structured clinical interview for the DSM-5 (SCID), and the hamilton-depression rating scale 17 item (HDRS17)), followed by a 7 minute resting state EEG (2 minutes eyes closed, 5 minutes eyes open), followed by the stimulation session (40 minutes of tACS or sham tACS), followed by an additional 5 minute resting state EEG.

 An additional 10 minutes of EEG will be collected following this 5 minute resting state (2 minutes segments, with 30 second breaks).

 The stimulation will involved 40 minutes of transcranial alternating current stimulation, 2mA in amplitude and 10 Hz frequency.
