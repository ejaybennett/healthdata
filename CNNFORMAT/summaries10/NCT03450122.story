(fifthQuint)Study of Adoptive Immunotherapy Using Autologous CD8+ NY-ESO-1-Specific T Cells and the NY-ESO-1 Immunostimulatory Agents LV305 or CMB305 For Patients With Sarcoma.

 Leukapheresis (Apheresis): If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, some of participant's blood cells will be collected by leukapheresis.

 For this procedure, participant will need to stay seated in a chair and keep both arms still for up to 4 hours.

 During this process, participant's blood will flow into the machine and then directly back into participant's bloodstream through the second line.

 Blood will be drawn from 1 arm through a catheter (needle and tube) connected to the leukapheresis machine.

 Inside the machine, the white blood cells will be separated from the rest of the blood cells and collected in a sterile bag.

 Then, the rest of the blood cells will be returned through a catheter to your other arm.

 A blood thinner called citrate will be added to the blood as it enters the machine in order to lower the risk of participant's blood clotting in the machine.

 If participant cannot tolerate the leukapheresis procedure, this blood may be drawn by vein (like a regular blood draw).

 Researchers may also used white blood cells previously collected from participant when and if participant consented to take part in protocol PA14-0138.

 The blood will be sent to the laboratory where the T cells will be grown.

 It will take about 6-8 weeks for participant's T cells to grow in the laboratory.

 It is possible that participant will need to have a central venous catheter (CVC) placed for this procedure.

 A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while participant is under local anesthesia.

 Participant's doctor will explain this procedure to participant in more detail, and participant will be required to sign a separate consent form.

 It is possible that participant's T cells may not grow and then cannot be infused back into participant.

 If this happens with participant's cells, the study doctor will talk to participant about options available to participant.

 One option may be that participant will have another leukapheresis procedure done and another attempt is made to make the changed T cells.

 Study Groups: Participant will be assigned to a study group (also called a Cohort) depending on when participant enrolls in this study: - If participant is in Cohort 0, participant will receive modified T cells.

 - If participant is in Cohort 1, participant will receive modified T cells and LV305.

 - If participant is in Cohort 2, participant will receive modified T cells, LV305, and CMB305.

 Study Drug and T cell Administration: Participant will have 1 infusion of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide) before participant receives participant's changed T cells.

 The chemotherapy will help participant's body get ready to receive participant's changed T cells.

 Negative days are the days before participant receives the T cells and positive days are the days after participant receives the T cells.

 Day 0 is the day participant receives the T cells.

 On Day -2, participant will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 30-60 minutes.

 On Day 0, participant will receive the modified T cells by vein over about 60 minutes.

 Participant will be admitted to the hospital for the infusion, and participant's study doctor will tell participant for how many days participant will remain in the hospital after participant receives the changed T cells.

 Participant will be watched closely for 24 hours after participant's T cell infusion to check for any reactions.

 Starting within 6 hours after the modified T cell infusion and then 2 times each day after that for 14 days, participant will receive aldesleukin as an injection into participant's skin around participant's abdomen.

 Participant will be taught how to give these injections.

 If participant is in Cohort 1, participant will receive injections of LV305 on Days 1, 22, 43, and 64.

 If participant is in Cohort 2, participant will receive injections of LV305 on Days 1, 14, 43, and 70.

 Participant will also receive injections of CMB305 on Days 29, 57, and 85.

 Participant will also be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects.

 Participant may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

 Length of Study: Participant will receive the T cells 1 time.

 If participant is in Cohort 1 or 2, participant may receive injections of study drug for up to 85 days after the T cell infusion.

 Participant will have study visits for up to 168 days after the T cell infusion.

 Participant will be taken off study if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions.

 Study Visits: Within 2 weeks before you receive the T cells: - Participant will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 5 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in participant's body.

 This routine blood draw will include a pregnancy test if participant can become pregnant.

 - Participant will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease.

 On Day 0: - Participant will have an EKG before the infusion.

 - Participant will have a physical exam before the infusion.

 - Blood (about 5 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in participant's body.

 On Days 1 and 3, blood (about 5 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in participant's body.

 Beginning with Day 7, participant will have study visits every week for the first 12 weeks (until Day 84), then every 4 weeks for the next 12 weeks (until Day 168).

 At these visits: - Participant will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 5 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in participant's body.

 - Between Day 35 and 42 and again between Day 77 and 84, participant will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease.

 If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will return to the clinic every 8 weeks after the last visit or as often as the doctor thinks is needed.

 Blood (about 5 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in participant's body.

 Blood (about 5 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn every 3 months for routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in participant's body and a CT scan will be done to check the status of the disease, for up to 24 months after the end of treatment, unless the disease gets worse or participant begins a new treatment.

 Study of Adoptive Immunotherapy Using Autologous CD8+ NY-ESO-1-Specific T Cells and the NY-ESO-1 Immunostimulatory Agents LV305 or CMB305 For Patients With Sarcoma@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if it is safe to give modified, or changed, T cells (called CD8+ NY-ESO-1T cells) alone or in combination with LV305 and CMB305 to patients with sarcoma.

 Researchers also want to learn if this combination can help to control the disease.

 T cells are a natural type of immune cell.

 The changed T cells used in this study will be participant's own that can be changed in a laboratory and designed to "kill" some types of cancer cells.

 This is an investigational study.

 Modified T cell infusions are not commercially available or FDA approved.

 Additionally, neither LV305 nor CMB305 are FDA approved or commercially available.

 It is investigational to give the combination of modified T cell infusions, LV305, and CMB305 to sarcoma patients.

 The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

 Up to 18 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
