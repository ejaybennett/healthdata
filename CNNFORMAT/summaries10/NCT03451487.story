(firstQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Acetaminophen and Its Toxic Metabolites With 2 Formulations (Panadol and SafeTynadol) in Healthy Volunteers.

 Acetaminophen (AAP) is the most popular used analgesic/ antipyretic drug with serious hepatotoxic adverse effects; suicidal or unintentional overdose of AAP-induced hepatotoxicity.

 Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is thought contribute to the responsible reactive metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone (NAPQI) of AAP overdose-induced hepatotoxicity.

 Pharmaceutical excipients are inactive ingredients that are added to a pharmaceutical compound.

 The objective of this study was to investigate the possible response of Panadol(R) (AAP alone) and SafeTynadol(R) (AAP with various selected excipients combination) formulations, while observing the AAP toxic metabolites (AAP-Cys) circumstances change in healthy volunteers.

 According to the current safety data, could be potentially develop hepatotoxicity-free AAP new formulation drug.
