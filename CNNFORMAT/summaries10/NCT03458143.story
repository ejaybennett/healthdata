(secondQuint)Respiratory Depression During an Analgosedation Combining Remifentanil and Ketamine in TCI for Oocyte Retrieval.

 The actual protocol for conscious sedation during oocyte retrieval in at the Erasmus hospital (Brussels) consists of Remifentanil in TCI-mode, with premedication by Midazolam.

 However, episodes of bradypnaea with or without desaturation are still common.

 The primary objective is to observe if with the addition of ketamine, it is possible to significantly reduce the dose of Remifentanil, in order to avoid episodes of respiratory depression caused by the opioid.

 The secondary outcomes measured, will be the pain levels experienced by the patient, the sedation level, and the satisfaction of the patients after the procedure.

This study evaluates the effect of the addition of ketamine to a conscious sedation protocol including remifentanil during oocyte retrieval.

 The investigators will have 2 groups with different target effect site concentrations, namely 150 ng/ml and 200 ng/ml.
