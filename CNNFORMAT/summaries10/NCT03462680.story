(fifthQuint)GPR109A and Parkinson's Disease: Role of Niacin in Outcome Measures.

 Inflammation plays a central role in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology [1] as evidenced by the presence of microglia in the substantia nigra in post-mortem samples [2] as well as activated microglia and cytokines in clinical and animal studies [3].

 The use of non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was found to reduce the risk of PD [4].

 The investigators recently identified an anti-inflammatory receptor GPR109A that is upregulated in PD [5].

 Niacin has a high affinity for this receptor, suggesting that it (niacin) may play an important role in reducing inflammation in PD.

 The investigators also found that individuals with PD have a chronic niacin deficiency [5].

 Using seed funding from the local PD chapter, the investigators obtained pilot data which suggested that restoring the deficiency via over-the-counter (OTC) supplementation reduced inflammation and decreased the severity of the disease symptoms [6].

 In this VA-funded study, the investigators will determine the effect of 6 months' OTC niacin supplementation on inflammation (as assessed in the blood and spinal fluid) and severity of the PD symptoms.

Inflammation plays a central role in Parkinson's disease.

 The use of anti-inflammatory drugs was found to reduce the risk of PD .

 Niacin may play an important role in reducing inflammation in PD.

 The investigators also found that individuals with PD have a chronic niacin deficiency .

 The purposes of this study are to (1) examine the blood, urine and spinal fluid of persons with Parkinson's to look for evidence of inflammation and; (2) whether 6 months of vitamin B3 supplements may reduce the inflammation and/or improve symptoms.
