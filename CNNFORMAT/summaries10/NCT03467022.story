(fifthQuint)Alcohol Abuse or Alcohol Withdrawal: Risk of Latent Scurvy.

 This study aims to examine: 1.

 the level of plasma vitamin C for patients that volunteered for alcohol withdrawal.

 Measurement of vitamin C plasma level will be performed as soon as possible after the agreement as the discussion with the physician could lead to a change in dietary habits.

 It will be performed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (Cerba Laboratory, F-Cergy Pontoise) according to Lee et al.

 2.

 the correlation between plasma vitamin C level and clinical signs of scurvy, especially signs of latent scurvy like tiredness, leg pain, gums involvement, previously loss of healthy teeth.

 These signs will be recorded in a structured questionnaire during the first consultation, before knowing the laboratory result patient.

 All patients who are smoking will perform systematic otorhinolaryngology examination in search of cancer.

 Other reasons for weakness will be searched by clinical anamneses, body examination, blood probe and abdominal ultrasound examination.

 3.

 the decrease or disappearance of tiredness and/or purpura and/or gums involvement will be studied after vitamin C supplementation in patients whose vitamin C plasma determination is under normal levels and that don't have another explanation for their tiredness.

 Patients will be evaluated after receiving 1 g oral vitamin C for at least three months.

 Ethical considerations The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the clinic and was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

 Informed consent was obtained before entry study and each participant agreed to pay for the plasma vitamin C determination.

 Dissemination findings Findings for the present study will be reported in manuscripts that will be submitted for publication to a leading medical or nutrition journal in a appropriate field (i.

e.

alcoholism, nutrition).

 In addition, findings will be presented as abstracts, posters and presentations at conferences.

 Alcohol Abuse or Alcohol Withdrawal: Risk of Latent Scurvy@highlight

Scurvy, or latent scurvy, may be underestimated in developed countries, but continue to be described, often as case report.

 Little is known about the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency in a specific population as withdrawal alcoholics and about his possible consequences, latent scurvy.

 In an observational study, the investigators will evaluate prospectively the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency in alcoholic withdrawal patients, its correlation with latent scurvy, mainly tiredness and weakness, and the evolution of the latter at three months after oral vitamin C supplementation.
