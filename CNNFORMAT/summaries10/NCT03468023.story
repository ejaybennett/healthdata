(firstQuint)Short vs Long Arm Cast for Distal Radius Fractures: the Verona Trial.

 The choice of cast length in conservative management of distal radius fractures still represents a much debated controversy.

 Classic teaching was to immobilize the elbow to reduce risk of secondary displacement; however, short arm casts are felt to be equally effective with less complications and higher patient comfort.

 There is currently no conclusive evidence for or against immobilization of the elbow in patients treated with cast immobilization.

 Short vs Long Arm Cast for Distal Radius Fractures: the Verona Trial@highlight

This study prospectively compares the performance of an above-elbow cast (long arm cast) and a below-elbow cast (short arm cast) to maintain reduction in conservatively managed distal radius fractures.
