(firstQuint)PK,PD, Safety and Tolerability of Multiple Dose Regimens of MT-3724 With Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin for the Treatment of Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (MT-3724_NHL_002).

 This is a multi-center, open-label two-part study evaluating the safety and tolerability of MT-3724 in combination with GEMOX in relapsed or refractory CD20 positive B-cell Lymphoma patients.

 Part 1: (MT-3724 Dose Escalation) Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MT-3724 in combination with standard treatment of GEMOX Part 2: (MTD Expansion Cohort) Confirm the safety and tolerability of the MTD of MT-3724 from Part 1 in the MTD Expansion Cohort, where MT-3724 will be given at the MTD in combination with GEMOX.

 In addition, the PK, PD, immunogenicity and tumor response at the MTD of MT-3724 in combination with GEMOX will be more thoroughly evaluated in Part 2.

 It is anticipated that up to 64 patients will be enrolled.

 Treatment will continue for up to four 28 day cycles (approximately 4 months).

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MT-3724 in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) in subjects with relapsed or refractory CD20-positive B-Cell NHL.
