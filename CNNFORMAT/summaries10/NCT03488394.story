(secondQuint)Gene Therapy With Modified Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cells for the Treatment of Patients With Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I, Hurler Variant.

 Pediatric patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I will be treated with genetically modified autologous hematopoietic stem cells collected from mobilized peripheral blood (or bone marrow if mobilization is not feasible) and transduced with IDUA lentiviral vector encoding for the human -L-iduronidase gene.

 Patients will be followed for 1 year after gene therapy; after 1 year follow-up they will be asked to enroll in a long term study in order to monitor the safety and efficacy of the gene therapy treatment for up to 8 years.
