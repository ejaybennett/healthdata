(secondQuint)Compliance Feasibility Study for Remote Phase 2 Cardiac Rehabilitation.

 In spite of the fact that cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial to patients who have had a cardiac event, such as a heart attack, only 5% of eligible patients complete this program.

 Some of the reasons cited include limited facility access, travel time and cost.

 We are testing the hypothesis that cardiac rehab compliance will be greater if patients are offered the opportunity, and associated technology, to perform cardiac rehab anywhere.

 Compliance Feasibility Study for Remote Phase 2 Cardiac Rehabilitation@highlight

This study evaluates the compliance of patients in a Phase 2 (outpatient clinic based) cardiac rehabilitation program, who are offered the opportunity to perform the rehab remotely (e.

g.

 at home, not at the clinic), using a remote monitor and smart-phone application.
