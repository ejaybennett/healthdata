(secondQuint)Comparing Different Suturing Techniques on the Post-operative Morbidity After Removal of Impacted Mandibular Third Molar.

 Third molar surgeries are mostly associated with pain, swelling and limited mouth opening, referred to as post-operative morbidity.

 Wound closure technique is an operative factor which is associated with reduced post-operative morbidity.

 In the total wound closure, the mucoperiosteum is hermetically sealed whereas in the partial wound closure, a window or opening is left to allow for secondary healing.

 This study therefore compares the effect of partial and total wound closure techniques after surgical extraction of impacted mandibular third molar teeth in reducing the swelling and limited mouth opening.

 Comparing Different Suturing Techniques on the Post-operative Morbidity After Removal of Impacted Mandibular Third Molar@highlight

This study compares the effect of two types of suturing techniques in the postoperative swelling and mouth opening after surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molar.

 total wound closure will be performed in one group of participants while partial closure will be performed in the other group.
