(secondQuint)Prediction of WMH in Migraine Using a BOLD-CVR Map.

 A whole-brain map of CVR will be created in patients with migraine and normal controls.

 Hypercapnic stimuli for CVR will be delivered by prospective end-tidal CO2 targeting device.

 Hemodynamic responses will be determined by BOLD signal changes using fMRI.

 WMHs will be determined by high-resolution 3D FLAIR imaging.

 Patients and controls will undergo serial MRIs with 1 year interval.

 Associations between areas of reduced CVR and consequent WMH development will be tested in both patients and controls.

 Prediction of WMH in Migraine Using a BOLD-CVR Map@highlight

Brain white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are prevalent in migraineurs, of which the mechanism is still unclear.

 The investigators aimed to test the spatial association between areas with reduced cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to hypercapnic stimuli and consequent development of WMHs.
