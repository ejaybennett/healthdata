(secondQuint)Impact of Budesonide Irrigations on Patients With Chronic Rhinosinusitis and Impact on Sinus Surgery Rates.

 Patient who meet eligibility requirements will be given the opportunity to use a budesonide saline rinse twice daily for 90 days.

 At the completion of this therapy, their clinical situation will be reassessed and patients will either proceed to surgery or not.

 If eligible patients choose not participate, they will be offered surgery up front.

 The study will be assessing symptom scores using the SNOT-22 validated patient reported symptoms score, CT scans, and other measures.

 The study hypothesizes that a significant portion of patients that otherwise would have progressed to surgery will no longer need to have surgery based upon improvements in their overall symptoms scores after using budesonise irrigations.
