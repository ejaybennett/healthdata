(thirdQuint)The Size of Pelvic Hematoma Can be a Predictive Factor for Angioembolization.

 Background: Unstable pelvic fracture with bleeding can be fatal, with a mortality rate of up to 40%.

 Therefore, early detection and treatment are important in unstable pelvic trauma.

 We investigated the early predictive factors for possible embolization in patients with hemodynamically unstable pelvic trauma.

 Methods: From January 2011 to December 2013, 46 patients with shock arrived at a single hospital within 24 h after injury.

 Of them, 44 patients underwent computed tomography (CT) after initial resuscitation, except for 2 who were dead on arrival.

 Nine patients with other organ injuries were excluded.

 Seventeen patients underwent embolization.

 A single radiologist measured the width (longest length in axial view) and length (longest length in coronal view) of pelvic hematoma on CT scans.

 Demographic, clinical, and radiological data were reviewed retrospectively.

 We investigated the early predictive factors for possible embolization in patients with hemodynamically unstable pelvic trauma.

 The purpose of this study was to predict the necessity of embolization and the timing of angiography using CT scans.
