(secondQuint)A Study of CNSA-001 in Primary Tetrahydrobiopterin Deficient Patients With Hyperphenylalaninemia.

 Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, tryptophan hydroxylase, fatty acid glycerylether oxygenase, and nitric oxide (NO) synthase.

 Primary tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency (PBD) is caused by deficiency of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTP-CH), 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), or sepiapterin reductase (SR) that impairs the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) or by defects in BH4 recycling (pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase [PCD] or dihydropteridine reductase [DHPR] deficiency).

 Study PBD-001 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, randomized, open-label, intra-patient dose titration study designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary evidence of efficacy of CNSA-001 in male and female patients with hyperphenylalaninemia due to PBD.

 Study PBD-001 will enroll patients with defects in de novo biopterin biosynthesis due to PTPS or recessive GTP-CH deficiencies.

 Approximately 6 to 10 patients will be enrolled in this study at 5 to 6 study centers.

 Patients will be screened for participation.

 Eligible patients who are taking BH4 [Kuvan(R) (sapropterin dihydrochloride)] will discontinue the medication following screening and will remain off this medication during the entire study.

 Patients will receive treatment with CNSA-001 for a total of 14 days (i.

e.

, two 7-day treatment periods separated by a 3- to 4-day washout).

 Patients will be randomized into one of 2 cohorts, with each cohort assessing 2 dose levels of CNSA-001 via intra-patient titration.

 Initially, only adult patient(s) (18 years) will be enrolled.

 After the first adult patient(s) have completed the study, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety and pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data, including preliminary efficacy, for the adult patient(s).

 If the data display no safety issues and provide for the prospect of clinical benefit in patients 12 to 12 years).

 A Study of CNSA-001 in Primary Tetrahydrobiopterin Deficient Patients With Hyperphenylalaninemia@highlight

The PBD-001 study has been designed to demonstrate the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of CNSA-001 in reducing blood phenylalanine concentrations in adult and adolescent patients with hyperphenylalaninemia due to primary tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency.
