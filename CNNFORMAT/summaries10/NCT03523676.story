(secondQuint)Use of Red Cell Distribution Width for Prediction of New-onset Atrial Fibrillation in Critically Ill Sepsis Patients.

 This study was done retrospectively on sepsis patients admitted to intensive care units.

 data will be retrieved from patient medical records.

 The primay end point will be occurrence of new-onset AF during ICU stay.

 The secondary outcomes will be 28-day mortality.

 The presence of anisocytosis or RDW variations has been classicaly used as a test for iron deficiency anemia.

 Increasing evidence points to its potential as a predictor for various conditions such as heart failure , malignancy, ischemic heart disease and sepsis.

 Study investigators will examine the relationship between RDW levels and incidence of atrial fibrillation in critically ill sepsis patients as well as 28-day mortality.

 Use of Red Cell Distribution Width for Prediction of New-onset Atrial Fibrillation in Critically Ill Sepsis Patients@highlight

Red cell distribution width variations are increased in a variety of medical conditions such as congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, critical illness, and cardiac arrest , and is a predictor of mortality in the general population.
