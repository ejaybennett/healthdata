(firstQuint)Impact of a Printed Decision Aid on Cataract Surgery Choice.

 Shared decision making is increasingly recommended to facilitate quality care, but there is a lack of cataract surgery decision aid in clinical practice.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a cataract surgery decision aid for cataract patients with different levels of health literacy.

 We will conduct a randomized controlled trial for cataract patients aged 50-80 years.

 We will randomly assign participants to either the intervention using a decision aid booklet or the one using a usual cataract booklet.

 The primary outcome is informed choice (defined as adequate knowledge and consistency between attitudes and intentions) 2 weeks after intervention.
