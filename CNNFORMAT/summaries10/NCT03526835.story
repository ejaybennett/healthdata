(thirdQuint)A Study of Bispecific Antibody MCLA-158 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 Study Design: This open label, multicenter, first-in-human study consists of 2 parts.

 Part 1 is a dose escalation to find the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of MCLA-158 studying patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

 Part 2 is a dose expansion cohort studying MCLA-158 in colorectal cancer and other solid tumor indications.

 In the dose escalation part, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with up to 4 lines of prior therapy in the metastatic setting including oxaliplatin-based and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, with or without an anti-angiogenic and with or without an anti-EGFR if RAS wild-type (RASwt).

 In the expansion part, MCLA-158 will be administered at the RP2D in metastatic colorectal patients and selected non-colorectal indications in advanced solid tumors.

 The expansion part will further characterize the safety, PK, immunogenicity and preliminary antitumor activity of single-agent MCLA-158 will be in all patients, and retrospective biomarker analyses including EGFR and LGR5 status will be performed.

 The study consists of three periods: Screening (up to 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug); Treatment (first dose of study drug with treatment cycles of 28 days); and Follow-up (through 30 days after the last dose and and quarterly checks for survival data up to 12 months).

 A Study of Bispecific Antibody MCLA-158 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors@highlight

This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center, multi-national, dose escalation, single agent study to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of MCLA-158 in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

 The study will assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, immunogenicity, and anti-tumor activity of MCLA-158 in mCRC and other advanced solid tumors.
