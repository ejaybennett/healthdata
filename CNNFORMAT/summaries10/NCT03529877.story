(secondQuint)Allogeneic ABCB5-positive Stem Cells for Treatment of Epidermolysis Bullosa.

 This is an interventional, single arm, non-randomized, open label, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of the IMP allo-APZ2-EB in patients with RDEB.

 Patients will undergo treatment with the IMP (three repeated intravenous applications) and will be followed up for efficacy for 12 weeks.

 To assess long-term safety of allo-APZ2-EB one follow-up visit at Month 12 post IMP applications is included.

 Determination of the EB linked symptoms and quality of life will be assessed by using the EBDASI score, the iscorEB, the change in pain and itch perception, and patient's quality of life in EB.

 The wound healing process will be documented by photography.

The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy (by monitoring overall improvement of EB symptoms) and safety (by monitoring adverse events) of three doses of allo-APZ2-EB administered intravenously to patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).
