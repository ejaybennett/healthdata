(fifthQuint)Improving Outcomes for Emergency Department Patients With Alcohol Problems.

 The objective of the study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of an alcohol peer-mentor intervention starting in the ED, combined with a continuing 6-session program of post-ED strengths-based peer mentorship to facilitate reduction in hazardous drinking, and linkage and engagement in primary and/or specialty alcohol treatment services and mental health care, if needed.

 Project Methods: The study will screen Veterans Affairs (VA) ED patients for hazardous drinking.

 Those screening positive and who enroll in the study will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) Alcohol Peer-Mentor (APM) intervention (n=225), or 2) Brief Advice (BA) comparison condition (n=225).

 Stratified random assignment to conditions will be by sex and presence of AUD (yes/no) defined as a score of 14 for men and 10 for women on the AUDIT.

 Randomization will proceed in blocks of 10.

 All participants will also receive written community resource information.

 Participants randomized to the APM condition will receive peer support to reduce hazardous drinking, and those who meet alcohol use disorder criteria will be coached by the peer and will assist in a warm handoff linkage to addiction treatment.

 Improving Outcomes for Emergency Department Patients With Alcohol Problems@highlight

The investigators will conduct a study to examine the impact of an alcohol peer-mentor intervention starting in the emergency department (ED) combined with 6 peer booster sessions to reduce hazardous drinking and facilitate primary/specialty care use compared to enhanced usual care.

 Approximately 450 Veterans with hazardous drinking behaviors will be randomized to one of these two conditions.

 Follow-up assessments will occur at 3-, 6-, and 12-month post-randomization.
