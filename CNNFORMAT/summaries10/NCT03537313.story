(firstQuint)Vaginal Douching and Painting in Women Who Underwent Total Abdominal Hysterectomy.

 Total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) is the most common gynecologic operation worldwide.

 The two most common complications after TAH are febrile and infectious morbidities, incidence varying between 5 and 50 percent.

 After performing TAH, vaginal canal must be breached and closed to be blind-pouch stump.

 Routing vaginal douching at the night before and on the morning of the surgical date, and intra-operative painting are routinely practiced.

 However, no good quality of evidence base supports the effectiveness of vaginal douching and painting in preventing febrile and infectious morbidities after TAH.
