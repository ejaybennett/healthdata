(fifthQuint)Restricted Fluid Therapy in Colorectal Surgery.

 Aim: To show the effect of a restrictive fluid regime compared to a standard regime by the frequency of complications in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

 Background: Previous studies have risen suspicions of fluid balance, and especially a large amount of water and NaCl administration, can be a significant factor in developing postoperative complications (1,2).

 In 1990 in Critical Care Magazine, Lowell et al.

 described that patients who in transferring to intensive therapy had an increased weight of > 10% of their preoperative weight, had a significantly higher mortality rate of 31,6% than patients with an increased weight of 1/2g/kg, Tiopental 3-4 mg/kg and Rocuronium (Esmeron) 0.

6 mg/kg (all doses are modified according to each patient's needs and cardiovascular condition).

 Anesthesia is maintained with Isoflurane 0.

2-0.

4% end-tidal concentration in oxygen / atmospheric air (inspiratory oxygen concentration 30-35%).

 The neuromuscular block can be reverted with glycopurron / neostigmine when needed.

 Hypotension Diagnosis and Treatment: See Appendices 3a and 3b (reverse).

 The anesthetic form can be adapted to the individual department's routine.

 5.

 Perioperative fluid treatment: During operation, fluid is submitted and recorded according to Appendix 3a and 3b.

 Liquid status is made at the end of anesthesia.

 6.

 Monitoring: Standard anesthesia monitoring as recommended by Danish Anesthesiological Union (ecg, NIPB (if necessary invasive BT), CVP, SpO2, etCO2, temperature, hourly diuresis, neuromuscular block).

 All patients will be given a CVK routinely after the initiation of anesthesia, and central venous pressure (CVP) is measured until the patient is discharged from the recovery ward.

 Arterial blood gases and hematocrit are checked immediately after the anesthesia is initiated, immediately after arriving at the recovery ward and before the patient is transferred to the surgical ward, as well as for clinical needs.

 7.

 Surgery: The patient is operated according to the department's routines.

 During the surgery, a nutritional feeding tube is inserted in the duodenum (Compat Stayput(R) (Sandoz) nasoduodenal nutritional feeding tube, 9 French), for postoperative enteral nutrition.

 If the nasoduodenal tube can't be brought to the duodenum, it is placed in the ventricle.

 If this placement causes nausea, the tube is removed and the patient will consume nutrition according to ability by mouth.

 Antibiotic prophylaxis, bowel cleansing, physiotherapy, etc.

 according to the usual guidelines of the respective departments.

 Before closing the wound, the surgeon must assess the appearance of the intestine with respect to fluid status on a scale of 1-4: 1 = normal, 2 = allusive edematous, 3 = edematous, 4 = trickling edematous.

 (See Appendices 3a and 3b).

 8.

 Postoperative fluid treatment and nutrition during the day of operation: Fluid recordings are continued from the end of the anesthesia, on the recovery ward and for the rest of the day of operation according to Appendices 4a and 4b.

 On the day of operation, 600 ml of Nutri-concentrated 75 is given in the feeding tube.

 Nutri-concentrated 75 contains 200 kcal and 7.

5 g protein per 100 ml.

 A normal need of vitamins and minerals is covered by administration of 1000 ml per day.

 9.

 Fluid treatment and nutrition in the following days: In the 1st to 3rd postoperative days Nutri-concentrated 75, 1000 ml / day is administered.

 Thereafter no nutritional supplement is given.

 The fluid regime in the restrictive group is mainly assessed based on the patient's weight, ability to drink independently and blood samples.

 The standard regime follows the department's usual postoperative regime.

 10.

 Postoperative analgesia: As a basis, epidural infusion of the standard mixture of Bupivacain-Morfin (5 mg Morfin + 250 mg Bupivacain in NaCl to the volume of 100 ml) is given, 4-8 ml/hour.

 If needed, epidural bolus injection of Bupivacain may be supplemented with 0.

25% or 0.

5%, 4-8 ml.

 In addition to the epidural treatment, i.

v.

/i.

m Morphine 5-10 mg p.

n.

 can be administered.

 If there are no contraindications, Paracetamol or NSAID can be administered (peroral, i.

v.

 or rectally).

 The epidural painrelief is continued postoperatively for a maximum of 4 days, after which the epidural catheter is removed.

 In case of a need for analgesics hereafter, then opioid is given by mouth or i.

v.

/i.

 as well as PCM and/or NSAIDs.

 Postoperatively care-scores and mobilization (Appendix 6), admission time and resource consumption (Appendix 7) incl.

 outpatient visits are registered.

 All registrations are sent to and collected by the coordinating project doctor/nurse who also makes sure a reminder is mailed to the patient, scheduling a postoperative checkup 4 weeks after the surgery.

 Treatment-requiring postoperative complications within the first four postoperative weeks are registered (see Appendix 8).

 The patient attends a check-up in the project, along with with a possible routine 4-week check-up in the outpatient unit.

 Statements: The two groups are expected to be comparable due to the randomization and stratification, but after inclusion of 2 x 12 and 2 x 24 patients, respectively, an interim statement is made without breaking the code to ensure equal distribution in the two groups.

 The perioperative flow and weight balance of the two groups is compared to non-parametric statistics, Mann-Whitney test.

 We chose a significance level of 5%.

 The postoperative care score and mobilization are compared between the groups, and significance calculations are performed for the two groups.

 To reduce the number of calculations, the area under the curve (AUC) is used.

 Hospitalization time, complications demanding treatment, resource consumption and possible mortality is also calculated for the two groups.

 Here, the Mann-Whitney test is also used with a 5% significance level.

 The outpatient checkups will take place either as a routine checkup or in the free time of project doctors, and thus do not put any strain on the departments.

 Ethics: Participation in the project is voluntary and is subject to informed consent.

 This can be withdrawn at any time without further explanation, and without this affecting the patient's treatment in any way.

 There is no risk associated with participation in the project, but discomfort associated with additional blood sampling for the project, no more than 4-5 times.

 However, these blood samples will preferably be taken from the CVK, so the patient avoids being stabbed unnecessarily.

 In the long term, a treatment benefit is possible and this appears to outweigh the discomfort mentioned above.

 The project is registered with the Scientific Ethics Committee (multicenter study) and Registry Audit in accordance with applicable guidelines.

 All person-identifiable data, incl.

 blood / tissue samples is destroyed after the project is completed.

 Laymans Summary: Fluid treatment during colon or rectal surgery.

 Aim: To investigate whether a specially controlled fluid treatment regime compared with the department's standard regime may reduce the number of complications developed after surgery on the colon and rectum.

 Background: Previous studies have suggested, that the fluid balance and, in particular administration of water and salt might be a major factor in the development of postoperative complications such as breathing difficulties, bowel disorders and infections.

 In a study (1), which examined the value of nutritional supplements soon after the operation, it was found that patients who developed severe complications were in a positive fluid balance with body weight increase before the complication became known.

 It has also been described (2), that patients transferred to the intensive care unit with complications after gastrointestinal surgery have a much higher risk of dying, if there is a fluid accumulation of more than 10% of the body weight than if the fluid accumulation is less than 10%.

 Whether this is the result of excessive fluid administration or that especially sick patients accumulate fluids for other reasons has not been investigated.

 It is known that early nutrition after surgery reduces the number of infections after surgery on the intestine (1), as well as it is known that blood transfusions increase this risk.

 Method: Multicenter study, where 2 x 70 patients scheduled for colon or rectal surgery are included after informed consent.

 They are randomly distributed for treatment with one of the two above-mentioned fluid regimes.

 In both groups, free consumption of food and drink is allowed after surgery, and a supplement of a dietary intake through a feeding tube is given during the first days.

 Blood tests are taken daily, preferably the same routine blood tests, and fluid balance, weight and possible complications are recorded.

 Ethics: Participation is voluntary and the survey is conducted in accordance with the Helsinki II Declaration.

 All person-identifiable data will be deleted after the end of the trial.

 Discomforts for the patient: Blood sampling and outpatient visit 4 weeks after surgery.

 There is no risk associated with participating in the project.

 Economy: Financial support is applied for through the Research Council.

 There are no special interests associated with the survey.

 Addendum to the protocol written during the patient inclusion and before the trial was completed.

 Hypothesis: Both too little and too much fluid administered intravenously may be harmful to the cardiac function (low oxygen supply and congestion) and cause cardiovascular complications: cent Postoperatively developed arrhythmias, AMI, pneumonia, pulmonary congestion, postoperatively developed pleural exudate, pulmonary edema or ARDS.

 Both too little and too much fluid administered intravenously may be harmful to tissue healing (low oxygen supply and interstitial edema) and cause complications related to tissue healing and infection: cent Infections of the wound, bursting of the wound (superficial and deeper), leakage from the anastomosis and separation of stoma.

 Randomization: The investigating surgeon or anesthesiologist perform the randomization by opening consecutively numbered opaque envelopes.

 The randomization is stratified for each center and for colonic and rectal surgery the latter by opening an envelope with highest number for rectal surgical patients, and with lowest number for colonic patients.

 Blinding: Specialist surgeons reading the medical journals censored for all information about randomization group, fluid therapy given or bodyweight measurements will perform a blinded assessment for the primary outcome.

 Two doctors will evaluate each patient file, and in case of disagreement, a third will decide the outcome.

 Plan for analysis: An intention to treat analysis will be performed for the primary outcome for all patients included in the trial whether or not they met a post randomization exclusion criterion, and therefore did or did not receive the allocated treatment.

 A per protocol analysis will be performed for the primary outcome for all patients fulfilling the in- and exclusion criteria whether or not they adhered to the protocol.

 Subgroup analysis will be performed for the patients with Major-, Minor-, Cardio-pulmonal- and tissue-healing complications.

 Restricted Fluid Therapy in Colorectal Surgery@highlight

This is a protocol for a trial carried out from 1999 to 2002.

 At that time, surgical patients received a large volume of intravenous saline during operations on the colon or the rectum, often so much fluid that their bodyweight increased by 4-6 kilograms.

 We hypothesized that a restricted fluid regimen could prevent the development of cardiopulmonary complications and improve wound healing including the healing of an anastomosis of the gut.

 We designed a clinical randomized assessor blinded multi centre trial comparing a restricted fluid regimen to a standard fluid regimen, the difference being the volume of saline administered to the patients.

 Patients undergoing surgery on the colon or the rectum were included after informed oral and written consent.

 The restricted regimen aimed at zero-fluid balance with allowance for a body weight increase of 1 kg.

 The standard regimen was a bit "dryer" than the actual standard; our patients in the standard group received saline causing a body weight increase of only 3-4 kg.

 The fluid therapy started at midnight the day of operation, went on through the operation and continued on the wards until discharge.

 The patients were encouraged to eat and drink as much and as soon as possible after the operation.

 The primary outcome was the number of patients who died or suffered a complication measured within 30 days of surgery.

 We looked at all complications, but especially heart and lung complications and complications related to the healing of wounds and anastomosis.

 The patients was examined in the out patient clinic after 30 days, and in addition blinded assessors were reviewing the medical files for registration of postoperative complications.

 The results are published in The Annals of Surgery 2003;238(5)641-48.

 The restricted regimen nearly halved the number of patients with complications, and heart and lung complications were allmost eliminated.

 Other investigators confirmed the results, and a more restricted approach to fluid therapy to surgical patients has been implemented world wide.
