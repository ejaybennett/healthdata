(thirdQuint)Study of Colonization of Strains L.

Plantarum and L.

Brevis in the Product AB-DENTALAC Chewing Gum.

 The study will follow a randomized, double-blind, split-mouth, placebo-controlled design with two groups in parallel, for the evaluation of two different posology models (daily consumption of probiotic gum, with or without previous professional oral cleaning).

 Probiotics have recently been used to combat oral diseases (plaque control, caries, halitosis, etc.

), as a non-invasive natural therapy.

 To assess whether the daily consumption of AB-DENTALAC gum allows the colonization of strains L.

plantarum and L.

brevis in the oral microbiota, and to confirm the absence of side effects.

 1.

 Number of patients to be treated:40 2.

 Number of visits per patient:2 The study will determine the index of plaque, gingival index and depth of the bag as a measure of oral health.

 The presence of Lactobacillus in the samples collected by qPCR will also be quantified.

 The patient will benefit from a buccal revision and control by a periodontist for 6 weeks.

 It will also help subsequent patients to obtain a better treatment (if the results are significant).

 No harm is expected to participate, it is a minimal risk study, with non-invasive exploratory tests and a product suitable for human consumption and marketed more than 3 years ago in Europe.

 The potential patients to participate in the study will be healthy patients, so if they do not wish to participate they will not need alternative treatment.

 The objective of the study is to see if the probiotic is able to colonize the mouth in healthy patients, it is not a study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product.

 If there is any serious adverse effect (something totally unexpected being a product with probiotic strains QPS), the patient will be advised to stop taking the product immediately.

 It is not anticipated that the use of any additional treatment is necessary.

 The promoter will provide all the necessary material for the study: 60 cases of chewing gum placebo, 60 cases of chewing gum with probiotics and cleaning material (toothbrush and toothpaste) for all patients.

 The evaluation of the colonization capacity will be determined by comparing the groups but analyzing participant by participant and not as a whole.

 The comparisons will be made by Student's T or nonparametric test, considering a P <0.
