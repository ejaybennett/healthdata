(secondQuint)MyoStrain CMR Testing of Ischemia With Low Levels of Stress.

 This prospective, single center study evaluates the MyoStrain SENC CMR Imaging System for the detection of myocardial ischemia and viability during conventional Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) wall motion stress testing.

 Patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease and scheduled for cardiac catheterization will be consented for inclusion in the study and evaluated during stress testing with low dose Dobutamine as the stressor agent.

 Data obtained with the MyoStrain SENC CMR Imaging System will be for observational purposes and will not be used to alter patient management.
