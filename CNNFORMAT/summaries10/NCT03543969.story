(thirdQuint)Adaptive BRAF-MEK Inhibitor Therapy for Advanced BRAF Mutant Melanoma.

 Vemurafenib and cobimetinib are already U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma; however, melanoma often develops resistance to these drugs over time, and the tumors start to re-grow.

 Investigators will use the participant's LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) levels obtained from routine blood work, along with CT scans to decide when to hold or resume their study treatment.

 Investigators hypothesize that this type of dosing schedule with vemurafenib and cobimetinib may potentially delay the time to progression and re-growth of their melanoma.

This is a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of using adaptive intermittent dosing of vemurafenib and cobimetinib in BRAF mutant patients with elevated baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

 The purpose of this study is to determine whether an intermittent adaptive dosing of vemurafenib and cobimetinib may be superior to standard, continuous dosing with these study drugs.
