(firstQuint)The Efficacy of Alirocumab for Thin-cap fIbroatheroma in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease Estimated by Optical Coherence Tomography.

 The investigators investigate to evaluate the efficacy of alirocumab for vulnerable plaque.

 The investigators enrolled the patient with standard statin therapy who were detected vulnerable plaque by optical coherence tomography, and categorized into two group; the patients with alirocumab and rosuvastatin were categorized alirocumab therapy group, and the patients with rosuvastatin alone were categorized standard statin therapy group.

 The investigators compare these two group for outcomes.
