(thirdQuint)Identifying Young Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients at Risk for Herpes Zoster.

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.

 A recent national survey from the CDC estimates that the prevalence of IBD in the United States (US) is nearly 3.

1 million cases.

 IBD is often associated with debilitating symptoms, hospitalizations, decreased quality of life, frequent procedures and/or surgery.

 Treatment options include immunosuppressive therapies, such as corticosteroids, immunomodulators (thiopurines and methotrexate) and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) agents.

 Although they are effective in achieving clinical remission and decrease the risk of complications, they also increase the risk for serious infections, including herpes zoster (HZ).

 The primary goal is to study those patients with IBD who are thought to be at the highest risk for HZ reactivation by evaluating cell mediated immunity (CMI) to VZV.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients under the age of 50 can have a greater risk than the general population above age 50.

 IBD patient are commonly treated with immunosuppression that increases the risk for Herpes Zoster.

 A new HZ vaccine is available that could decrease the risk of HZ in IBD patients.
