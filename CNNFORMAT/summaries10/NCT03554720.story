(fifthQuint)RSA of the ATTUNE Knee System: RCT Comparing Traditional Vs Enhanced-Fixation Device Designs.

 This is a multi-centre, randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty.

 In this study, the investigators propose to randomize 50 subjects to receive either the standard Attune PS TKA (n=25) or the enhanced fixation Attune S+ PS TKA (n=25) and follow them for a period of 2 years post-operatively.

 The primary outcome of the study will be stability of fixation of the tibial baseplate as measured by model-based RSA.

 Secondary outcomes will be to determine the functionality of patients after surgery using self-reported questionnaires.

 RSA of the ATTUNE Knee System: RCT Comparing Traditional Vs Enhanced-Fixation Device Designs@highlight

The principal objective of this study is to compare migration patterns between the Attune and Attune S+ PS knee systems using model-based RSA over the first 2 post-operative years.

 Secondary objectives include; comparison of 2-year migration values against published thresholds for adequate short-term fixation, quantify changes in functional and health status of subjects following surgery and compare between study groups, and assess occurrences of complications following surgery.
