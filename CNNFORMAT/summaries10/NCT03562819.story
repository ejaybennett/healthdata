(thirdQuint)Study to Evaluate Concordance of Detecting EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) Mutation by Circulating Tumour Free DNA Versus Tissues Biopsy in NSCLC (Non-small Cell Lung Cancer).

.

 This is a multicentre, prospective, study of EGFR mutation status in advanced NSCLC patients (locally advanced and/or metastatic disease) with adenocarcinoma histology proposed to be conducted at 15 sites from different geographical regions across India.

 The study targets to enrol 268 patients over a period of 6 months.

 The study will enroll patients with histologically confirmed, systemic treatment naive adenocarcinoma metastatic cancer (stage IV).

 This will be a single visit study.
