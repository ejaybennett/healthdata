 The trial will randomize 12 clinics within the Henry Ford Health System to two arms.

 The first arm will be comparison clinics that continue to use existing team-based strategies for hypertension management.

 The second arm will be intervention clinics.

 These clinics will have enhancements to existing team-based hypertension management.

 The first enhancement is clinical decision support based in the electronic health record.

 The second enhancement is improved protocols to implement telehealth prescribing that is nurse-led.

 The trial will enroll participants through an urban emergency department.

 Participants will be assigned to one of these 12 clinics and continue study activities for 1 year.

 Clinicians at the clinics will manage blood pressure.

 Study specific visits will occur at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

 Primary outcome assessment is 12 months.
