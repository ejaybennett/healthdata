(thirdQuint)Response Surface Pathway Design With Two Interventional- and One Response Variable in Estimating Minimum Efficacy Dose.

 15 GERD patients, divided in three design-level with three, five and seven patients.

 The study was performed as a two-dimensional randomized, between-patient RSP designed multicenter study with two interventional- and one response variable.

 The interventional variables "Number of OMT's" and "Treatment Interval" with common response variable formed two independent one-dimensional randomized between-patient RSP studies.

 The response variable was the percent reduction in sum of the five GERD score from baseline.

 Three GERD patients were allocated on the first design level given six OMT with five days' interval.

 Based on results obtained in the first and second design level, five patients were included to the second design level and seven to the third.

 Response Surface Pathway Design With Two Interventional- and One Response Variable in Estimating Minimum Efficacy Dose@highlight

Response Surface Pathway (RSP) design was previously developed for dose-finding studies with one interventional and one response variable, but RSP to higher dimensions is requested.

 The aim of this study is to introduce and evaluate the RSP design with two interventional and one response variable exemplified by estimating Minimum Efficacy Dose (MED) of Osteopathic Manual Therapy (OMT) in treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
