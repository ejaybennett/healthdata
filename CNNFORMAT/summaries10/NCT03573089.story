(thirdQuint)Pragmatic Randomised Trial of High Or Standard PHosphAte Targets in End-stage Kidney Disease (PHOSPHATE).

 Hyperphosphataemia is highly prevalent in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and associated with increased mortality risk.

 The Clinical Practice Guidelines suggest lowering elevated phosphate levels towards the normal range (level 2C suggestion).

 However, trial data demonstrating that treatments that lower serum phosphate will improve patient-centred outcomes are lacking.

 The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that compared to a liberal serum phosphate concentration target of 2.

0 to 2.

5 mmol/L, lowering of serum phosphate towards the normal level (1.

50 mmol/L) with phosphate binders reduces the risk of fatal or non-fatal major cardiovascular events in ESKD patients receiving dialysis.

 The secondary objectives are to test the hypothesis that intensive lowering of serum phosphate towards the normal level with phosphate binders would improve physical health, fatigue, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, and pruritus; and be cost-effective.

 In this pragmatic, multinational, randomised controlled large simple trial, a total of 600 (of the 4600 global study) adult ESKD patients receiving dialysis will be randomised to either to lower (1.

50 mmol/L) or liberal (2.

0-2.

5 mmol/L) serum phosphate target.

 The choice and dose of phosphate binders will be at the treating physician's discretion and local practice to achieve and maintain serum phosphate concentration within the required target range according to randomisation.

 The primary endpoint is the composite endpoint of fatal or non-fatal major cardiovascular events.

 The secondary outcome measures will be the quality of life using the Short-Form 36 instrument, pruritus scale and health care resource utilisation and costs.

During end-stage kidney disease, clinical guidelines suggest reducing elevated phosphate levels in the blood.

 However, the effect of lowering blood phosphate levels on important patient-centred outcomes has never been tested.

 This trial will evaluate whether compared to high levels, lowering blood phosphate levels would reduce death or major events due to heart disease, improve physical health, and be cost-effective.
