(fifthQuint)A Phase I Comparative Blinded Trial of Several HIV-1 Derived Immunogens in Infected Individuals With >= 500 CD4 Cells/mm3.

 Before large clinical trials of anti-HIV vaccines are undertaken, it is important to determine whether there are significant advantages to any one of the vaccines currently offered for such studies.

 Patients are randomized to receive one of four vaccines or one of two placebo controls.

 The vaccines are: rgp 120/HIV-1IIIB, rgp 120/HIV-1MN, rgp 120/HIV-1SF, and env 2-3.

 The two control immunogens are aluminum hydroxide (alum) and BIOCINE Placebo Vaccine 2 (MF-59 adjuvant emulsion in citrate buffer).

 Patients are vaccinated at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, and 36.

 If significant benefit is seen among vaccine patients, then placebo patients may receive vaccination with one of the immunogens producing an immune response.

 A Phase I Comparative Blinded Trial of Several HIV-1 Derived Immunogens in Infected Individuals With >= 500 CD4 Cells/mm3@highlight

PRIMARY: To compare the immunogenicity and safety of each of several HIV-1 derived immunogens versus control in HIV-infected individuals with CD4 counts greater than or equal to 500 cells/mm3.

 SECONDARY: To determine whether significant advantages to any one vaccine exist.

 Before large clinical trials of anti-HIV vaccines are undertaken, it is important to determine whether there are significant advantages to any one of the vaccines currently offered for such studies.
