(thirdQuint)Sodium Salicylate in Treating Patients With Advanced Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.

 OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the safety, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of sodium salicylate in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome; newly diagnosed, relapsed, or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia; or relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

 - Define biologic characteristics that influence the likelihood of a clinical response to this drug in this patient population.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sodium salicylate twice a day.

 Intrapatient dose escalation or de-escalation is permitted.

 Treatment continues for up to 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

 Responding patients may continue to receive sodium salicylate beyond the 6-week period.

 Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia are followed until the end of therapy.

 Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome are followed until death or progression to leukemia.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of sodium salicylate in treating patients who have advanced myelodysplastic syndrome , acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
