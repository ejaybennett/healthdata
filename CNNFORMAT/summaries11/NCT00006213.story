(secondQuint)BMS-214662 in Treating Patients With Acute Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, or Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of BMS-214662 in patients with acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase.

 II.

 Determine any preliminary evidence of antileukemia activity of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

 Patients receive BMS-214662 IV over 1 hour weekly for 4 weeks.

 Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-214662 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 10 months.
