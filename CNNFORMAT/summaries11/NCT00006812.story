(secondQuint)Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of capecitabine in patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.

 - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in this patient population.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily for 14 days.

 Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12 months.
