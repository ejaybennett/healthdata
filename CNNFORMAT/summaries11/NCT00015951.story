(thirdQuint)Bevacizumab, Cytarabine, and Mitoxantrone on Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancers.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the clinical effectiveness of bevacizumab, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone in patients with poor-risk hematologic malignancies.

 - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

 - Determine whether this regimen can induce cell apoptosis in these patients.

 - Determine the effects of bevacizumab on coagulation profiles in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously over 72 hours on days 1-3, mitoxantrone IV over 30-60 minutes on day 4, and bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on day 8 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients achieving partial or complete remission may receive a second course of therapy beginning approximately 30 days after the completion of the first course.

 Patients are followed until death.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-3 years.

 Bevacizumab, Cytarabine, and Mitoxantrone on Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancers@highlight

RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

 Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for hematologic cancer.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bevacizumab combined with cytarabine and mitoxantrone in treating patients who have hematologic cancer.
