(fifthQuint)Paclitaxel, Folic Acid, and Lometrexol in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II study dose of lometrexol and paclitaxel when combined with folic acid in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

 - Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

 - Determine the plasma concentrations of lometrexol and paclitaxel and relate their pharmacokinetics to toxicity outcome in these patients.

 - Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of lometrexol and paclitaxel.

 Patients receive lometrexol IV over 30-60 seconds immediately followed by paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1.

 Patients also receive oral folic acid beginning 7 days before lometrexol/paclitaxel and continuing for 14 days.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Doses of lometrexol and paclitaxel are escalated sequentially.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of lometrexol and paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 Six to twelve additional patients are treated at the recommended phase II study dose (dose immediately preceding the MTD).

 Patients are followed every 3 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-42 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Paclitaxel, Folic Acid, and Lometrexol in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Folic acid may protect normal cells from the side effects of chemotherapy and may increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

 Lometrexol may stop the growth of tumors by blocking one of the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth.

 Combining chemotherapy with folic acid and lometrexol may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel, folic acid, and lometrexol in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
