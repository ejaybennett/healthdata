(secondQuint)Survival Study Of Oncophage vs.

 Observation In Patients With Kidney Cancer.

 Primary Objective: - The primary objective of this study is to determine whether subjects randomized to receive adjuvant HSPPC-96 after surgical resection of locally advanced renal cell carcinoma at high risk of recurrence, have improved recurrence-free survival as compared to subjects with no adjuvant treatment.

 Secondary Objective: - Determine whether subjects randomized to receive HSPPC-96 have improved survival as compared to subjects with no adjuvant treatment.

 - Further characterize the safety profile of HSPPC-96.
