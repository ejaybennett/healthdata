(secondQuint)Positron Emission Tomography Before Surgery in Evaluating Women With Primary or Recurrent Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) as compared to conventional imaging in determining the extent of disease in women with primary or recurrent breast cancer.

 - Determine how often clinical management and operative intervention plans for patients are altered based on these FDG-PET scan findings.

 - Determine whether FDG-PET results in more accurate detection of disease in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 IV.

 Approximately 1 hour later, patients undergo positron emission tomography imaging.

 Some patients may undergo a repeat scan in 4-6 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: (50 with primary disease and 50 with recurrent disease) will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.

 Positron Emission Tomography Before Surgery in Evaluating Women With Primary or Recurrent Breast Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Imaging procedures such as positron emission tomography (PET) may improve the ability to detect the extent of breast cancer.

 PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to study the effectiveness of PET to detect the extent of breast cancer in women who have primary or recurrent breast cancer.
