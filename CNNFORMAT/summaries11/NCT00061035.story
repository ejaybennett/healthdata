(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Transgenic Lymphocyte Immunization Vaccine in Subjects With Prostate Adenocarcinoma.

 The goal of the study is to determine the safety, feasibility, and tolerability of transgenic lymphocyte immunization (TLI).

 In this process patient's lymphocytes are rendered transgenic for a gene coding for selected portion of telomerase an enzyme expressed in the vast majority of cancer cells.

 Transgenic cells are then returned to the patient to produce an immune response targeted at cancer cells expressing telomerase.

 The Phase 1 trial will evaluate TLI in patients with advanced, androgen-independent prostate cancer with metastases confined to lymph nodes or bones.

Dr.

 Frederick Millard, MD, Associate Clinical Professor at the UCSD Cancer Center, will be conducting a 12-week study in advanced prostate cancer patients.

 The study will be held at the UCSD Medical Center and will test an experimental investigational gene therapy vaccine designed to make the patient's immune system react against telomerase, an enzyme expressed in prostate cancer cells.
