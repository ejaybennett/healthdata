(firstQuint)Treatment Response to Rehabilitation in Patients With Schizophrenia.

 Patients with schizophrenia often suffer neurocognitive impairment and psychosocial and vocational difficulties.

 This study will help identify those patients most likely to benefit from existing behavioral treatments and provide clues for how to modify treatments for those who do not benefit.

 Two studies will be conducted.

 The first will investigate the relationship of symptoms and neurocognitive variables at study entry to psychosocial and vocational status 2 years later.

 The second study will investigate the relationship of symptoms and neurocognitive variables at study entry to treatment response in patients assigned to either a cognitive remediation track or a computer skills track as part of their rehabilitation treatment.

 Both the cognitive remediation and computer skills training programs will last 4 to 6 months.

 Participants will be assessed pre- and post-treatment.

 Neuropsychological, psychosocial and vocational status will be measured.
