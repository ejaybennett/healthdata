(secondQuint)Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer That Did Not Respond to Iodine Therapy.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the all-measurable-disease response rate in patients with iodine-refractory locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer treated with gefitinib.

 Secondary - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

 Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
