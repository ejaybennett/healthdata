(secondQuint)Association Between Systemic Exposure of Atorvastatin and Metabolites and Atorvastatin-induced Myotoxicity.

 A 24 hour pharmacokinetic investigation of atorvastatin and metabolites will be performed in 15 patients with a history of atorvastatin -induced myotoxicity.

 The possible link to relevant mutations in SLCO1B1, CYP3A5 and MDR1 will be also be investigated.
