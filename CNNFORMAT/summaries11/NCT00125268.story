(thirdQuint)Near Infrared Light for the Treatment of Painful Peripheral Neuropathy.

 Pain is a very common symptom, between 65-80%, in patients with peripheral neuropathy.

 This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of monochromatic near infrared photoenergy therapy (MIRE) in the treatment of pain in axonal peripheral neuropathy.

 This will be compared with a placebo (sham) device.

 The MIRE is a FDA approved, drug-free, non-invasive, medical therapeutic device that uses near-infrared light emitting diodes to deliver monochromatic near infrared photoenergy (MIRE) through contact with the skin.

 The effect of MIRE is believed to increase local blood circulation by dilating vessels and to reduce pain by decreasing local swelling and inflammation.

 MIRE is also thought to increase local levels of nitric oxide (NO) which may decrease pain levels.

 Study subjects will receive treatment with the device or the placebo device 3 times per week for 4 weeks.

 Response will be measured during and after the treatment period.

 Near Infrared Light for the Treatment of Painful Peripheral Neuropathy@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if near infrared light therapy is effective in decreasing pain in patients with painful peripheral neuropathy.

 The hypothesis of the study was that the percentage of subjects with at least 40% improvement in visual analog scale score for pain after 4 weeks of treatment is higher for Monochromatic Near-infrared Photoenergy (MIRE) treatment than for sham treatment.
