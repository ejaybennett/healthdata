(secondQuint)Study of the Effects of Dopaminergic Medications on Dopamine Transporter Density in Subjects With Parkinson's Disease.

 This is a multi-center, open-label study of short-term treatment with levodopa or cabergoline on striatal DATscan uptake in early Parkinson's disease.

 Approximately 120 Parkinson's disease subjects will be randomized to receive either carbidopa/levodopa, cabergoline or no treatment during a twelve week period.

 Subjects will undergo SPECT imaging with DATscan at screening and after 12 weeks.

 After twelve weeks carbidopa/levodopa and cabergoline treatment will be withdrawn and all subjects will undergo SPECT imaging with DATscan after 8 weeks (20 weeks after baseline).

This study investigates whether there is a change in 123iodine-2ss- carbomethoxy-3ss-(4-iodophenyl) tropane ([123I]ss-CIT) uptake after short-term treatment with levodopa compared to either dopamine agonist or placebo.
