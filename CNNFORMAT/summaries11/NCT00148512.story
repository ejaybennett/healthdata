 This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, five parallel groups efficacy and safety exploratory of tesofensine versus placebo in levodopa treated Parkinson patients with motor fluctuations.

 Patients will be treated either with one of the 4 doses of tesofensine (0.

125mg, 0.

25mg, 0.

50 mg or 1.

0 mg) or with placebo, once daily, over 14 weeks.

 The two co-primary efficacy endpoints are the change in off-time and the change in the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II+III total score Study Hypothesis: The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between placebo and tesofensine.

 The alternative hypothesis is that treatment with tesofensine is superior to treatment with placebo.

 Comparison(s): For the primary comparison between tesofensine and placebo, change in percentage off-time during waking hours will be based on reports from patient's diary (completed at day -3 and day-2 prior to the study visits) and change in the UPDRS II+III will be based on UPDRS II averaged for on and off periods and UPDRS III evaluated at on periods during the study visits.
