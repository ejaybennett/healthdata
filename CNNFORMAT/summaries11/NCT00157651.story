(firstQuint)Access II - Trial of Warfarin to Prevent Malfunction of Haemodialysis Catheters.

 Patients with end-stage renal disease receiving or about to initiate hemodialysis are randomized to receive either adjusted dose warfarin to achieve an INR of 1.

5-1.

9 or adjusted dose placebo within 72 hours of hemodialysis catheter placement.
