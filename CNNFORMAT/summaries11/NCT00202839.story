(fifthQuint)Peg-Intron/Ribavirin in G 1 HCV for Non-Extended Versus 24 Week Extended Treatment After 24 Weeks (Study P04144)(COMPLETED).

 This is an open-label, randomized, comparative, multicenter study for evaluation of PegIntron/Ribavirin therapy in the efficacy and safety in adult subjects with a diagnosis of compensated chronic hepatitis C (HCV-RNA+) (Genotype 1).

 This is a 48-week study, for which all subjects should participate in the Pilot Treatment Program and complete 24 weeks treatment.

 To avoid a treatment gap, subjects who will be screened and eligible subjects will sign informed consent prior to the end of the Pilot Treatment Program.

 After completion of the Pilot Treatment Program, all eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to either study group.

 Subjects in the 24-Week Treatment arm will be followed-up without study medication for 48 weeks; subjects in the 48-Week Treatment arm will be continuously treated for another 24 weeks and all subjects in the 48-Week Treatment arm will be followed for another 24 weeks after completion of the treatment period.

 Subjects in both arms will be evaluated at screening, randomization, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 36 and 48 weeks after randomization.

 Peg-Intron/Ribavirin in G 1 HCV for Non-Extended Versus 24 Week Extended Treatment After 24 Weeks (Study P04144)(COMPLETED)@highlight

This is an open-label, randomized, comparative, multicenter, 48-week study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in adult subjects with a diagnosis of compensated chronic hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus (HCV)-ribonucleic acid (RNA) positive) (Genotype 1).

 All subjects will complete 24 weeks of treatment, termed the Pilot Treatment Program, after which all eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups.

 One group will be followed for an additional 48 weeks without study medication, while the other will be continuously treated for an additional 24 weeks and then followed for another 24 weeks without study medication.

 Sustained virologic response, defined as undetectable HCV-RNA in serum at the end of the follow-up period, will be measured along with other outcomes.
