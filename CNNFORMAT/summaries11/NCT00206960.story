(fifthQuint)Dopaminergic, Functional, Structural, and Cognitive Disturbances in First-episode Schizophrenia.

 31 neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients and 25 matched controls were recruited from the greater Copenhagen area.

 The patients were randomized to treatment with either low doses of the typical antipsychotic compound, zuclopenthixol, or the atypical drug, risperidone.

 Patients and controls were examined at base-line and patients were re-examined after 3 months of treatment.

The study has resulted in two finish Ph.

 We are at present conducting a five-year follow-up study of the same cohort of patients and controls and plan a ten-year follow-up as well.

 The follow-up studies focus on brain structure (MRI), brain function, information processing, and psychopathology.

 We will correlate changes in structure and function to treatment, but no interventions (pharmacological or otherwise) are planned.

 Dopaminergic, Functional, Structural, and Cognitive Disturbances in First-episode Schizophrenia@highlight

We wanted to compare dopamine D2 receptor activity, brain structure, brain function, sensory gating and cognition in neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients and matched healthy controls.

 Additionally, we wanted to examine the effects of 3 months of treatment with either low doses of a typical or an atypical antipsychotic compound on the same functions.

 The hypotheses were that schizophrenic patients suffered from disturbances in brain function and structure, information processing, and extrastriatal D2 receptor activity, and that these disturbances would be related to each other and to psychopathology.

 Additionally, we expected the atypical compound to have an effect on some of the disturbances in information processing, and that the atypical compound - in contrast to the typical drug - would show extrastriatal over striatal selectivity.
