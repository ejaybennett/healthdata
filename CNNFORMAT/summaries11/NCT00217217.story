(thirdQuint)Low Field Magnetic Stimulation Treatment for Bipolar Depression.

 An initial study using proton echo-planar magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (EP-MRSI) in bipolar depressed individuals was associated with reports of improved mood.

 These studies employed oscillating magnetic fields similar to those used in functional MRI (fMRI), but which differ from the usual fMRI scan in field direction, waveform frequency, and strength.

 As the abbreviation EP-MRSI is used to describe several relatively common MR sequences, the specific potential clinical procedure being used is referred to as low field magnetic stimulation or LFMS.

 Following these initial results, investigators are conducting studies to determine the critical variables in both subjects and treatment for optimal response.

 Studies are also underway to characterize the response of specific depression symptoms, the degree of response, and the duration of response.

 Low Field Magnetic Stimulation Treatment for Bipolar Depression@highlight

Individuals with bipolar depression who had a particular kind of brain imaging reported improved mood after the imaging.

 This effect may be linked to the changing magnetic fields used during these magnetic resonance imaging studies.

 The current studies are designed to further explore the important parameters of this effect and to clarify the degree and duration of the mood effects.
