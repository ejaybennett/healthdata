(secondQuint)The Effect of Feldenkrais Lessons on Walking and Balance.

 The Feldenkrais Method is an educational process which involves exploration of novel movement sequences that lead to expansion of the movement repertoire.

 This Method has been used with the aim of improving balance and mobility in several studies, and has been compared to the benefits of Tai Chi for improving balance in older adults.

 The current study investigates the effects of a 10 week series of Feldenkrais movement classes on gait parameters as measured on an instrumented gait mat, a balance test of stepping and turning (the Four Square Step Test) and a questionnaire about balance confidence (the Activites Specific Balance Confidence scale.
