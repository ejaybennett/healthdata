(firstQuint)Measurement of Bite Force in Humans.

 This clinical trial consists of two parts.

 We will first use the bite fork in normal volunteers to evaluate its test-retest and inter-rater reliability.

 We will then use the bite fork in subjects with differing endodontic diagnoses and compare these results with the standard clinical diagnostic test (percussion).
