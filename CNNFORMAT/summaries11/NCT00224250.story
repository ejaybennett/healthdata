(firstQuint)Ultrasound Study of the Uterine Healing Process After Cesarean Delivery.

 We are recruiting women who are presenting for their first (primary) cesarean delivery.

 They will be randomized to one- or two-layer myometrial closure at the time of their cesarean delivery.

 Ultrasound will be used to serially assess the myometrial thickness and myometrial remodeling process.

Our hypothesis is that there is no difference in the healing process in those women who have a one- or two-layer uterine closure at the time of cesarean delivery.
