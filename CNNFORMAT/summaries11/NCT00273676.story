(thirdQuint)Study on Costs and Safety of Early Conversion From Intravenous to Oral Antibiotic Treatment in Patients With Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia.

 Study design A multi-center, randomized open label clinical trial was performed in 2 university medical centers and 5 teaching hospitals in the Netherlands.

 The study was approved by the medical ethics committees of all participating hospitals and all patients provided written informed consent prior to enrollment.

 After inclusion in the trial, treatment allocation was established through an independent central randomization center.

 Stratified randomization per center was based on computer generated tables.

 Patients were either randomized to the intervention group, where clinically stable patients were switched from IV to oral antibiotics on the 3rd day of hospitalization to complete a total of 10 days antibiotic treatment, or to the control group, who received a standard regimen of 7 days of intravenous therapy.

 Clinical stability was defined as respiratory rate 90% or arterial pO2>55mmHg, hemodynamically stable, > 1oC decrease in temperature in case of fever, absent mental confusion and the ability to take oral medication 10.

 Antibiotic choices were left to the discretion of the attending consultant and were based on Dutch treatment guidelines 20.

 Patients Adult patients (age 18 or above) with severe CAP admitted to general hospital wards were eligible for inclusion in the study.

 Pneumonia was defined as a new or progressive infiltrate on a chest X-ray plus at least two of the following criteria: cough, sputum production, rectal temperature > 38oC or 10.

000/mm3, or >15% bands), C-reactive protein > 3 times the upper limit of normal, positive blood culture or positive culture of pleural fluid.

 21 Severe pneumonia was defined as Fine class IV or V or fulfilling the ATS-criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia.

 The absolute difference in cure rate including 95% CI was calculated.

 Equivalence was rejected if the lower limit of the CI exceeded -10%.

 Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

 Differences in continuous variables were presented as absolute differences with their corresponding 95% CIs.

 Dichotomous data were compared with chi-square statistics.

 Alike cure rate differences in proportions were presented including 95% CIs.

 For cost-calculations, arithmetic means of both study groups were compared.

 The uncertainty surrounding the cost-calculations was evaluated by means of standard bootstrap techniques.

 27 Ultimately, the balance between costs and effects was compared for both strategies and incremental costs per therapy failure averted at 28 days were calculated.

 The uncertainty surrounding the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was again evaluated by means of bootstrapping.

 Study on Costs and Safety of Early Conversion From Intravenous to Oral Antibiotic Treatment in Patients With Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia@highlight

Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia are included Half of the patients are treated with a 3 day course of intravenous antibiotics, followed, when clinical stable, by a course of oral antibiotics.

 Efficacy of this treatment is compared to a standard course of 7 days of intravenous antibiotics, which treatment is assigned to the other half of patients.

 Outcomes measured are clinical cure and costs.
