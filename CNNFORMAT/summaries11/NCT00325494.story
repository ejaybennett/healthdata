(secondQuint)A Study of MORAb-009 in Subjects With Pancreatic Cancer, Mesothelioma, or Certain Types of Ovarian or Lung Cancer.

 MORAb-009 is a high-affinity monoclonal antibody raised against human mesothelin, a membrane glycoprotein thought to be involved in cell adhesion and tightly associated with a range of cancers.

 It has been shown that mesothelin is over-expressed in pancreatic cancers, mesotheliomas, and ovarian or mesothelin-expressing ovarian or non-small cell lung cancers, while showing little expression in normal tissues.

 Preclinical experiments indicate that MORAb-009 is a potentially useful anti-cancer agent.

 This clinical trial is being performed to determine the safety of MORAb-009 in subjects with mesothelin-expressing tumors, as well as to establish serum pharmacokinetics of the antibody, and to assess tumor antigens that may serve as predictors of a response to MORAb-009.

 A Study of MORAb-009 in Subjects With Pancreatic Cancer, Mesothelioma, or Certain Types of Ovarian or Lung Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to establish the safest doses of an investigational drug called MORAb-009 in subjects with pancreatic cancer, mesothelioma, or certain types of ovarian or lung cancer.

 MORAb-009 is a monoclonal antibody that is directed to an antigen on the surface of these cancers.
