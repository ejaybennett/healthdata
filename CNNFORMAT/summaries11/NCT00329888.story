(secondQuint)Comparison of Papillary Balloon Dilatation Vs.

Sphincterotomy for Lithotripsy in Difficult Sphincterotomy or Distal CBD Tapering.

 Endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation is an alternative to endoscopic sphincterotomy for treating bile duct stones: - easier and as effective.

 - a higher risk of pancreatitis.

 Conditions including periampullary diverticulum, prior EST, Billroth-II anastomosis, or distal CBD tapering pose difficulty in EST and lithotripsy with increased risk of complications.

 Whether EPBD or EST is superior in efficacy or safety under such circumstances is not clear.

Compare endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation vs.

 endoscopic sphincterotomy for bile duct stones in: - when sphincterotomy is difficult (periampullary diverticulum, prior sphincterotomy or Billroth II anastomosis) - when there is distal CBD tapering.
