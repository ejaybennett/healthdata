(fifthQuint)Comparison of Central Venous Catheters With Silver Nanoparticles Versus Conventional Catheters.

 RATIONALE Central venous catheter (CVC) infections are one of the major causes of infections acquired in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

 About 25% of bloodstream infections recorded in ICUs are secondary to proven catheter-related infections and up to 80% of the so-called primary bacteraemia may be caused by catheters.

 Pittet et al.

 have estimated that nosocomial bloodstream infection, irrespective of its source, was associated with an overall 35% attributable mortality and a prolonged hospital stay of 32 days, including 8 days in the ICU.

 Prevention of catheter-related infections is a priority for infection control programs.

 Clear preventive measures include strict barrier precautions during insertion and careful aseptic techniques during subsequent manipulations of catheters.

 Other preventive measures, including the use of catheters specifically designed to inhibit microbial colonisation, such as antimicrobial-coated catheters, are not universally accepted or recommended for routine use, also due to their high cost.

 Previous trials have demonstrated a 50% risk reduction of infection rates when using antiseptic-coated catheters; however, their efficacy in reducing catheter related bloodstream infections is still unclear.

 A new generation of silver nanoparticle impregnated CVCs (Logicath AgTive(R), Medex Medical INC.

, UK), has become recently available, but no clinical trial documenting their activity in preventing microbial colonization of catheters has been carried out so far.

 In this study, we want to assess the ability of this new generation catheters to prevent short-term (10mm; presence of induration or purulence); c) presence of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome or of symptoms characterizing severe sepsis; d) Presence of other documented infection ; e) other intravascular devices in place or inserted each day; f) dressing changes; g) Results of blood and catheter-tip cultures, and of other clinically significant microbiological samplings; h) antibiotics administered.

 Microbiological data Blood cultures will be obtained when temperature is > 382 or 5C.

 Diagnostic samples of any other suspected infection foci will be taken as clinically indicated.

 Upon catheter removal, the intravascular catheter tip will be cultured using the semi quantitative culture described by Maki et al.

 (Maki DG, Weise CE, Sarafin HW.

 A semiquantitative culture method for identifying intravenous-catheter-related infection.

 N Engl J Med 1977;296:1305-1309).

 This technique involves rolling of the catheter distal tip on Agar plate and reading the high-density colonization on a semiquantitative culture (more than 15 colonies on each plate).

 Inclusion Criteria Patients will be eligible when insertion of a central venous catheter (CVC) at a new site (subclavian or internal jugular) has to be planned for therapy or monitoring of at least 3-day duration.

 Exclusion Criteria Age below 18 years and all patients with a history of failed catheterization attempts or the need for catheterization at a site of previous surgery, skeletal deformity, or scarring.

 Data analysis A Clinical Evaluation (Adjudication) Committee composed of the two coordinating investigators (Prof.

 Massimo Antonelli and Prof.

 Gianfranco Donelli) and the statistician (Dr.

 Andrea De Gaetano) will assess, blindly with respect to the randomization group, the evaluability of catheters and the classification of all episodes of bloodstream infection and of catheters having a positive culture, according to the above definitions.

 Catheters will be excluded from the analysis when insertion fails.

 Catheters that have not been adequately followed-up until the time of removal (transfer to another unit or hospital) will be censored on the last day of follow-up in the ICU and classified by the Committee as infected or uninfected, using the data available up to the last day of follow-up and any bacteriological data subsequently received.

 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY Adverse Events Complications of the procedure will be classified according to a Complications Diagnosis Dictionary.

 Text comments will be added to the recordings as appropriate.

 Descriptive analysis of the complications as well as comparison of complication rates (overall and by family of most frequent complications) will be obtained.

 STATISTICS Sample Size and Power Computation The catheter-related infection rate was estimated at 10% in the conventional catheter group.

 Assuming a 50% relative reduction (to 5%) in the silver impregnated CVC treated group, the number of patients needed (or equivalently the number of patients enrolled, assuming an attrition rate of 10%) for each treatment group in order to reach the desired statistical power is reported below, assuming a Type I error level of 0.

05 and depending on the significance level and the number of tails of the statistical test.

 Two-tailed tests will be considered throughout.

 A power of 80% will be considered sufficient.

 Therefore, 472 patients per group should be enrolled.

 Comparison of Central Venous Catheters With Silver Nanoparticles Versus Conventional Catheters@highlight

Bloodstream infections are common in Intensive Care Units (ICUs).

 The need of a central venous line increases the risk of bacteremia and central venous catheter (CVC) related infections.

 The use of catheters coated and/or impregnated with different antimicrobial agents has been proposed to reduce the risk of such infections.

 However, results obtained so far did not reach enough clinical relevance to consider these medicated catheters as a valid alternative to the conventional ones.

 The aim of this comparative randomized study is to assess the ability of recently developed silver ion-releasing central venous catheters in preventing associated infections in comparison with the conventional ones.

 Experimental groups are defined as follows: - Group A: patients treated with standard, triple lumen, non medicated catheters - Group B: patients treated with triple lumen catheters impregnated with silver nanoparticles
