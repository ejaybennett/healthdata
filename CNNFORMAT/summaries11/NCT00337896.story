(thirdQuint)T and B Cell Response to Avian Flu Vaccine.

 A human vaccination trial involving influenza A/H5N1 vaccine with different adjuvants is being conducted in a healthy adult population aged 18-64 years (DMID 04-062) to test the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N1 vaccine when given with either alone (no adjuvant), or given along with either alum or MF59.

 Two doses of the vaccine/adjuvent will be administered day 0 and day 28.

 This study is linked to DMID protocol 04-062.

 This protocol is a substudy to collect additional blood samples to specifically evaluate the cell-mediated immune responses generated from the vaccine.

 Primary goals of this study are 1) to establish reproducible, functional cell-mediate immune response assays to evaluate the magnitude and functional capacity of B cells, NK cells and T cells responding to monovalent subvirion H5 influenza vaccine 2) to evaluate the percent of subjects demonstrating B cell, NK cell, CD8+ and/or CD4+ response.

 The secondary goal of this study is to examine and compare the adjuvant effect of Alum or MF59 compared to no adjuvant on cell mediated immune responses.

 T and B Cell Response to Avian Flu Vaccine@highlight

The purpose of this substudy study is to evaluate the types of cells involved in fighting infection to the A/H5N1 (avian flu virus) vaccine.

 A maximum of 30 healthy adults ages 18-64 years, enrolled at Stanford University Hospital and participating in another clinical trial (DMID Protocol 04-062) will be enrolled into this substudy to collect additional samples of blood for testing before and approximately one week after each vaccination.
