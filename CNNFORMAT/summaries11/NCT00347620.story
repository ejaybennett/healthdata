(thirdQuint)Improving Vision and Quality of Life in the Nursing Home.

 The purpose of this project is two-fold: 1.

) to establish the psychometric properties of the Nursing Home Vision-Specific Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) instrument, and; 2.

) to evaluate the responsiveness of this instrument.

 Responsiveness will be assessed in two independent preliminary prospective intervention evaluations.

 The first responsiveness evaluation will involve a new spectacle intervention and the second will involve first eye cataract surgery.

 In addition, we will examine the association between the responsiveness of this instrument, and changes in visual functioning measures and other demographic variables.
