(thirdQuint)External Beam Radiation With Intratumoral Injection of Dendritic Cells As Neo-Adjuvant Treatment for Sarcoma.

 Patients were treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) combined with experimental intratumoral injection of dendritic cell (DC).

 Patients received 5,040 centigray (cGy) EBRT in 28 equal fractions.

 Radiation was delivered 5 days per week (Monday-Friday).

 DCs (10^7 cells) were injected intratumorally three times on the second, third, and fourth Friday during the course of radiation.

 One additional DC injection was given several days before surgery to assess DC migration.

 Tumors were surgically resected 3-6 weeks after the completion of EBRT.

 External Beam Radiation With Intratumoral Injection of Dendritic Cells As Neo-Adjuvant Treatment for Sarcoma@highlight

This is a Phase II study using a combination of external beam radiation with intratumoral injection of dendritic cells (white blood cells) as neo-adjuvant treatment for patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcoma.

 The purpose was to determine if an injection of the patient's own immune related white blood cells into their tumor would strengthen the immune system to fight against their cancer.
