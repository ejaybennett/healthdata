(fifthQuint)STAR-AF:Substrate Versus Trigger Ablation for Reduction of Atrial Fibrillation Trial.

 Interventions: Patients will be randomized to either wide circumferential pulmonary vein isolation ("trigger") or ablation of high-frequency, fractionated electrograms during AF ("substrate"), or a hybrid approach combining trigger and substrate.

 Both techniques will be performed with NavX mapping system and a standardized ablation catheter.

 Endpoint of PVI will be isolation of all four PVs documented by circular catheter.

 Endpoint for substrate-based ablation will be termination and noninducibility of AF.

 Up to 2 procedures will be allowed within 6 months.

 A 2 month blanking period will be allowed after each procedure during which early recurrences will not be counted.

 Outcomes: - Recurrence of atrial fibrillation or other atrial tachycardia at 3, 6, and 12 months post-initial procedure.

 - Recurrence will be defined by symptoms and/or ECG/Holter data showing AF > 2 mins - Occurrence of adverse events in each group post-procedure.

 - Quality of life assessment at 6 and 12 months post-initial procedure.

 Followup: - 3, 6, and 12 months post-initial procedure.

 - Clinical data, ECG, Holter, loop recorder at baseline and at each visit.

 - QOL at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months post-initial procedure.

 STAR-AF:Substrate Versus Trigger Ablation for Reduction of Atrial Fibrillation Trial@highlight

Patient Population: Patients with AF that is symptomatic and refractory to at least one antiarrhythmic medication.

 Patients must have AF that is paroxysmal (>4 episodes within 6 months, two episodes >6 hours within 1 year) or persistent (sustained episode <6 months terminated by cardioversion or drug).

 Purpose: To compare a trigger-based technique (pulmonary vein isolation) to a substrate-based technique (high-frequency, fractionated EGMs) to a combined approach for AF ablation
