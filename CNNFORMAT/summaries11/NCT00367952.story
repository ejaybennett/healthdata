(firstQuint)A Long Term, Safety Study of Apricitabine in HIV-infected Subjects.

 An ongoing study (AVX-201) is examining the safety and efficacy of apricitabine compared to 3TC in HIV patients who are failing therapy containing 3TC and have the presence of the M184V mutation in reverse transcriptase.

 This extension study (AVX-201E) is available to patients who complete the AVX-201 protocol.

 Patients will continue to receive apricitabine open label for a further 96 weeks (making a total of 144 weeks from starting AVX-201) in addition to an optimised background.

 Safety markers and efficacy markers will be followed.
