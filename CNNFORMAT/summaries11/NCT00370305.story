(thirdQuint)11-HSD1 and Metabolic Syndrome.

 The PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone (R) increases insulin sensitivity, which is comparable to the effects of a reduction in 11ss-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11-HSD1) activity in animal models.

 We therefore aimed to investigate whether rosiglitazone-induced insulin sensitivity is associated with changes in 11-HSD1 activity in different tissues in subjects suffering from impaired glucose tolerance.

 Furthermore the metabolic and hormonal effects of PPAR gamma stimulation by rosiglitazone will be analysed in those tissue samples.

 11-HSD1 and Metabolic Syndrome@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether the insulin sensitizing effects of rosiglitazone were accompanied by changes in 11ss-HSD1 expression and activity in different tissues.

 Furthermore the metabolic and hormonal effects of PPAR gamma stimulation by rosiglitazone will be analysed in several tissues.
