(thirdQuint)Observational Data Collection of Surgical Outcomes in the Treatment of Vaginal Prolapse With AMS Products.

 The Prolapse Registry was an observational study of patients who were implanted with AMS devices for the surgical repair of female pelvic prolapse.

 The registry followed patients post-operatively for up to 2 years and collected demographic, clinical, surgical, safety, and patient outcomes data.

 The registry was a web-based system in which surgeons entered patient information with regard to their prolapse surgery.

 All information entered was de-identified (no names, no date of birth, no date of surgery, etc).
