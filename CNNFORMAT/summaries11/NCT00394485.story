(firstQuint)Tiotropium + Procaterol vs Tiotropium + Placebo in COPD Patients.

 This study aims to determine the efficacy and safety of tiotropium plus procaterol in comparison to tiotropium plus placebo in Filipino patients seen in Manila, with moderate COPD.

 After a 1-week wash-out period, 6-minute walk test, and St.

 George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) will then be administered prior to a run-in period of 1 week wherein all patients will be started on tiotropium alone.

 The patients will then be randomly allocated to either of the two arms for a two-week treatment, followed by one week washout, and crossed-over to the other treatment for another two weeks.

 The procaterol or placebo dose is given 2 hrs after the tiotropium dose.
