(fifthQuint)Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) for Neuropathic Pain of Back or Lower Extremity.

 The conventional implantation of the spinal cord stimulator calls for dual percutaneous leads placed at T8-T9 vertebral levels.

 Recently published studies as outlined in a letter to the editor of Neuromodulation suggest that a "well placed single lead will generally perform better than a dual lead.

" Furthermore, anecdotal reports suggest that lead placement at T7 will capture axial back pain with greater success compared to lead placement at alternative sites.

 This study aims to achieve better pain treatment and paresthesia coverage by placing a single lead at T7.

 Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) for Neuropathic Pain of Back or Lower Extremity@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and patient preference for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) using the Precision device with the electrode array placed at T7 versus placement at T8.

 Eligible patients will have chronic intractable pain in the back or lower extremities and will have independently elected SCS as the next line of therapy.

 There is some anecdotal evidence that the coverage of the paresthesia resulting from T7 placement is preferable to that obtained by the more commonly used T8 placement but there has been no study to support this observation.
