 Ten adult patients with severe angina pectoris with or without heart failure and no therapeutic alternative will undergo screening and be treated with an injection of Angiogenic Cell Precursors (ACPs), contained in VesCell (TM).

 250 ml of blood will be drawn from the patient and from this blood sample progenitor cells will be generated and differentiated into ACPs.

 The product will be administered into the obstructed coronary arteries using a catheter.

 Following injection, patients will be hospitalized for 24-48 hours in intensive care and later as required by their medical condition.

 Patients will return for follow up testing at one, three and six months following treatment.
