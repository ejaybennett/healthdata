(secondQuint)Phase II Study of PX-12 in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.

 In a Phase I trial, PX-12 demonstrated anti-tumor activity and pharmacodynamic activity across a wide dose range.

 At higher doses, one side effect of the agent was a garlic-like odor of an expired metabolite.

 This study is being conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy, biologic activity (inhibition of PX-12 target thioredoxin-1) and effects of the expired metabolite at two dose levels of PX-12.

 This study will determine if the efficacy and biologic activity achieved at either of the two dose levels is sufficient to proceed to further studies without pushing to the maximally tolerated dose.
