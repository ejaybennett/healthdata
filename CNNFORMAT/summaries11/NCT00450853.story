(thirdQuint)Randomized Crossover Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Subcutaneous Versus Intravenous Granisetron in Cancer Patients.

 5-HT3 antagonists are one of the mainstays of antiemetic treatment and they are administered either intravenously or orally.

 Nevertheless sometimes neither administration route is feasible, such as in patients unable to admit oral intake managed in an outpatient setting.

 Our objective is to evaluate the bioavailability of subcutaneous granisetron.

Patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy will be randomized to receive granisetron 3 mg either subcutaneously or intravenously in a crossover manner during two cycles.

 Blood and urine samples will be collected after each cycle.

 Pharmacokinetics of SC and IV granisetron will be prospectively compared.
