(firstQuint)Comparison of Acetaminophen With Codeine and Ibuprofen for Children With Injuries.

 We conducted a randomized, double-blinded equivalence trial.

 Pediatric Emergency Department patients 5-18 years of age with acute extremity pain received acetaminophen-codeine (1 mg/kg as codeine) or ibuprofen (10 mg/kg).

 They provided Color Analog Scale pain scores at baseline and at 20, 40, and 60 minutes after medication administration.

 The primary outcome measured was the difference in changes in pain score at 40 minutes, compared against a previously described minimal clinically significant change in pain score of 2 cm.

 Additional outcomes included need for rescue medication and adverse effects.
