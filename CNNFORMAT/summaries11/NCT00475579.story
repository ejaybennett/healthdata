(secondQuint)Endotracheal Tube With Polyurethane Cuff and Subglottic Secretion Drainage.

 Subglottic secretions accumulated above the endotracheal cuff may progress, descending along the channels within folds of the cuff wall, to the lower respiratory tract causing VAP.

 Subglottic secretion drainage (SSD) appears to be effective in preventing VAP, primarily by reducing early-onset pneumonia; but it may not prevent late-onset pneumonia.

 We set out the hypothesis that using an endotracheal tube incorporating, besides of a subglottic secretion drainage lumen, a polyurethane cuff (which reduces channel formation and fluids leakage from the subglottic area) it should be also possible to reduce the incidence of late-onset VAP.

Patients mechanically ventilated using an endotracheal tube with a subglottic secretion drainage lumen and a polyurethane cuff may develop lower ventilator-associated pneumonia than using a conventional endotracheal tube
