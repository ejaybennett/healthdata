(secondQuint)Clinical Proposal for the Comparison of Intraperitoneal Anesthetic to Injected Local Anesthetic.

 The research objective is to compare our standard post-operative port site injection of 0.

5% bupivacaine against pre-incisional port site injection of 1% lidocaine against the instillation of streamed bupivacaine 0.

5% against the instillation of aerosolized 0.

5% bupivacaine as it relates to post-operative analgesia usage and pain scale scores.

 The null hypothesis will be that there is no difference between the four arms of the study in regards to pain score and analgesia usage.
