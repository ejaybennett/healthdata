(secondQuint)The Mechanism of Melanocyte Self-Assembly on Biomaterials and the Functional Analysis.

 Vitiligo is a chronic disease that causes loss of melanocyte and pigment of the skin.

 Traditional treatments for vitiligo including topical corticosteroids and phototherapy lead to limited clinical effects.

 Autologous melanocyte transplantation is another way to treat vitiligo.

 However, the effect is largely affected by whether cultivated melanocytes are successfully uptaken by vitiliginous skin.

 The aim of this study is to survey the self-assembly on biomaterials and functional analysis.

 In the long run, this study may provide a better way for treatment of vitiligo.

 The Mechanism of Melanocyte Self-Assembly on Biomaterials and the Functional Analysis@highlight

The aim of this study is to survey melanocytes in the ability of self-assembly on biomaterials and functional analysis in vitro.

 Also, this study may provide a better way for treatment of vitiligo after understanding the functional aspects of melanocytes.
