(fifthQuint)Clinicopathological and Molecular Correlation of Acrochordon in Relation to Human Papillomavirus Infection.

 Acrochordon, also called soft fibroma, skin tag or fibroepithelial polyp, is a common cutaneous disorder characterized by a polypoid growth composed of fibroblasts in a loose collagenous stroma, sometimes with proliferation of blood vessels.

 They appear as soft, skin-colored or light brownish skin tumors.

 Three types of lesions may occur, (1) multiple small, furrowed papules, especially on the neck and in the axillae, (2) single or multiple filiform smooth growths in various locations, and (3) solitary bag-like pedunculated growth, seen most commonly on the lower trunk.

 Most regard them as a sign of cutaneous aging.

 The presence of human papillomaviruses (HPVs), especially the mucosal types, has been demonstrated in acrochordon.

 Our previous experience on HPV typing of skin tags also confirms this finding.

 Though HPV is a ubiquitous virus, the presence of mucosal type HPV in non-mucosal sites is exceptional.

 This investigation is trying to correlate the clinicopathological and HPV molecular typing of acrochordons.

 A better understanding of acrochordon and its relation to HPV infection may improve the ability to prevent and treat.

 Clinicopathological and Molecular Correlation of Acrochordon in Relation to Human Papillomavirus Infection@highlight

Acrochordon, or soft fibroma, is a common benign skin tumor which is generally regarded as a sign of cutaneous aging or as a reaction to friction since it occurs in the intertriginous areas.

 Recent studies have shown the presence of human papillomaviruses, especially the mucosal types, on some of the intertriginous lesions.

 This study is to analyze the different clinical presentations of acrochordon and correlate them with pathologic and molecular human papillomavirus findings.

 Further goal is to improve the ability to differentiate acrochordon and its possible prevention and treatment.

 Also, it may have an implication on the transmission and prevention of cervical carcinoma.
