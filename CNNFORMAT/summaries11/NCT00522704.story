(secondQuint)Correlation Between Access Blood Flow and Extracorporeal Blood Flow.

 Accesses that show a large (>15%) decrement over time in vascular access blood flow are associated with a high risk of thrombosis.

 Serial measurements of vascular access blood flow predict access thrombosis.

 At the moment, the measurement of access flow is time consuming, operator dependent, so that it cannot be done with every treatment.

 We hypothesized that extracorporeal blood flow at pressure of -200 to -260 mmHg in arterial line has correlation with access blood flow and this can be used to estimate access blood flow.

 Correlation Between Access Blood Flow and Extracorporeal Blood Flow@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if Effective Extracorporeal Blood Flow(eEBF) has correlation with Access Blood Flow (Qa), when eEBF adjusts with Dynamic Arterial Line Pressure (DALP) in patients with Arteriovenous fistulae in hemodialysis treatment.
