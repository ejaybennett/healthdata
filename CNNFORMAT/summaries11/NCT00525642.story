(fifthQuint)Study of Suitable Schedule of Docetaxel,Anthracycline and Cyclophosphamide in Adjuvant Therapy of Beast Cancer.

 In this national wide study, women with node positive operable breast cancer are eligible for inclusion.

Patients were designed to randomize to six cycles of adjuvant TAC (Taxotere(R) 75mg/m2, doxorubicin 50mg/m2 or epirubicin 60mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2), and four cycles of T(100mg/m2), followed by 4 cycles of AC(doxorubicin 60mg/m2 or epirubicin 75mg/m2 ,cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2).

 Prophylaxis with G-CSF was allowed for two arms when febrile neutropenia occurred in the first cycle of the study treatment.

 The second endpoint of this study is disease free survival.

 The primary objective is to compare the disease free survival rate and safety profiles of the above mentioned two arms.

 Study of Suitable Schedule of Docetaxel,Anthracycline and Cyclophosphamide in Adjuvant Therapy of Beast Cancer@highlight

Anthracycline based regimens followed by a taxane (CALGB-9344 trial and NSABP-B28) or reversed (MD Anderson Adjuvant Trial) has already accepted as adjuvant therapy for node positive breast cancer.

 Also in this group of patients, data from BCIRG-001 trial had shown that six cycles of adjuvant TAC (docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) is superior to standard FAC (5-FU, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide ) combination in terms of both disease free and overall survival, while associated with a higher rate of febrile neutropenia.

 Then question arose whether it is better to use docetaxel and anthracycline in combination or sequence.
