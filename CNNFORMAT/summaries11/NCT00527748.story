(firstQuint)Foot and Ankle Range of Motion (Stretching) Apparatus.

 The purpose of this study is to assess how effective a new device is in increasing range of motion and reducing stiffness in the foot and ankle of patients with acquired flatfoot, patients with plantar fasciitis, and those suffering from stiffness after cast removal or other lengthy immobilization.

 Project will utilize a physical therapist to measure range of motion and stiffness when patients are consented.

 Patients will be re-measured at six weeks following use of the device to assist in stretching ankle and foot muscles, and again at 10 weeks for final stiffness and range of motion assessment.

Range of motion at ankle joint and subtalar joint will be assessed before and after utilization of ARM device.

 The changes in range of motion will be recorded and compared to literature.
