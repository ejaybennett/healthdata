(thirdQuint)Evaluating PN 400 (VIMOVO) in Reducing Gastric Ulcers Compared to Non-steroidal Antiinflammatory Drug (NSAID) Naproxen.

 Objectives: Primary: To demonstrate that PN400 is effective in reducing the risk of gastric ulcers in subjects at risk for developing NSAID-associated gastric ulcers.

 Secondary: - To determine if PN400 is effective in reducing the risk of duodenal ulcers in subjects at risk for developing NSAID-associated ulcers - To compare upper gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects treated with PN400 versus naproxen as measured by scores on the Severity of Dyspepsia Assessment (SODA) instrument and the Overall Treatment Evaluation - Dyspepsia (OTE-DP) - To compare heartburn symptoms in subjects treated with PN400 versus naproxen - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PN400 and naproxen.

 Evaluating PN 400 (VIMOVO) in Reducing Gastric Ulcers Compared to Non-steroidal Antiinflammatory Drug (NSAID) Naproxen@highlight

This study uses a randomized, double-blind, controlled design to demonstrate that PN400 (esomeprazole and naproxen) is more effective in reducing the occurrence of gastroduodenal ulcers, dyspepsia, and heartburn in subjects at risk for developing NSAID-associated gastric ulcers compared to naproxen alone.
