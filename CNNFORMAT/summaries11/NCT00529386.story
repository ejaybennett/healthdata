(secondQuint)Botox for Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS).

 This is a blinded prospective randomized design comparing the efficacy and safety of intraprostatic Botox vs.

 intraprostatic lidocaine injection, with an optional open label extension.

 Men with a clinical diagnosis of chronic nonbacterial prostatitis/CPPS will be treated with intraprostatic Botox cent or 1% lidocaine and followed for 12 weeks (primary efficacy analyses), and 24 weeks (long term follow-up) for responders.

 An open label extension will be offered to non-responders.

 A total of 40 males will be enrolled.

 There will be seven (7) research clinic visits and two phone contacts: Visit 1 (screening), Visit 2 (baseline/treatment), Visit 3 (2-week safety evaluation - clinic contact), Visit 4 (4-week safety evaluation - phone contact), Visit 5 (6-week interim efficacy/safety), Visit 6 (12-week primary endpoint evaluation), Visit 7 (14-week clinic follow up), Visit 8 (16 week phone contact) and Visit 9 (24-week clinic close out).
