(firstQuint)A Clinical Study Comparing the Inflammatory Response of the Ex-Press Mini Shunt to Trabeculectomy.

 The purpose of this study is to quantify the degree of post-operative inflammation in eyes which have undergone either trabeculectomy filtering surgery or Ex-Press mini shunt insertion.

 Early intraocular pressure control and postoperative complications will also be noted.
