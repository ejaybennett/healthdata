(fifthQuint)CerviPrep for Applying Topical Gemcitabine to the Cervix in Treating Patients With Primary Endometrial, Cervical, or Ovarian Epithelial Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the efficacy of the CerviPrep cent device in delivering topical gemcitabine hydrochloride to the cervix Secondary - To document any side effects directly attributed to local administration of gemcitabine hydrochloride.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo application of topical gemcitabine hydrochloride directly to the cervix using the CerviPrep cent drug delivery device during routine hysterectomy.

 Uterine vein and peripheral blood samples are obtained periodically to measure local and peripheral gemcitabine hydrochloride concentration levels in the blood.

 Local gemcitabine hydrochloride concentration levels are also measured in uterine tissue samples obtained from the surgical specimen after hysterectomy.

 Patients complete a self-reported symptom diary for the first 7 days after surgery for assessment of local and systemic side effects associated with topical administration of gemcitabine hydrochloride.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 2-4 weeks.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Using the CerviPrep cent drug delivery device to apply topical gemcitabine to the cervix may be an effective way to kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well CerviPrep cent works in applying topical gemcitabine to the cervix in treating patients with primary endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, or ovarian epithelial cancer.
