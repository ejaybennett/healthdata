(secondQuint)Treatment of Anal High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (HSIL) Through Use of a Chinese Herbal Topical Cream.

 The purpose of this study is to test a new noninvasive topical cream, AIJP (Arnebia Indigo Jade Pearl), for treatment of precancerous anal lesions in order to prevent their progression to anal cancer.

 AIJP is a topical Chinese herbal cream that has been specifically designed to treat people with the cancer precursor lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV).

 In general, HPV infection is a key factor in development of cervical, anal and vulvar cancers.

 People with HIV are especially vulnerable to develop anal cancer associated with HPV.

 It is known that prior to development of anal cancer a person develops a precancerous condition known as a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).

 Treatment of the HSIL can prevent progression to anal cancer.

 Current therapies for HSIL and anal cancer are highly invasive.

 A new effective noninvasive topical therapy for precancerous HSIL could have a high impact on prevention of anal cancer.
