(firstQuint)Genetic Polymorphisms of Interleukin-1B and TNF-A and HBV-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 Hepatitis B virus (HBV)infection is the major risk factor for chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

 Host immunogenetic factors contribute to HBV-associated liver damage and/or carcinogenesis.

 Variant cytokine alleles, including tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-)and interleukin-1(IL-1), might contribute to interindividual difference in inflammatory responses and account for heterogeneous disease outcome of infectious disease.

 By detecting polymorphisms of IL-1 and TNF-,this study aims to find the effects of cytokine gene polymorphisms(and their interaction) on susceptibility and severity of HBV-related HCC.
