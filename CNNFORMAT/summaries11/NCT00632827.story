(firstQuint)Treatment of PTCL With Aggressive Induction Therapy Followed by Autologous SCT Using Denileukin Diftitox (Ontak).

 This protocol proposes first to increase the proportion of patients who achieve adequate initial disease control and are able to proceed to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in first complete or partial remission.

 It administers intensive and novel induction therapy.

 Two cycles of GND (gemcitabine, vinorelbine, Doxil) will be used followed by two cycles of augmented dose CHOP (Cyclophosphamide) plus high-dose MTX.

 Patients will be restaged after two cycles of GND to assess response to GND alone and again after the second cycle of augmented CHOP/high-dose MTX.

 Those achieving a remission status will receive intensive consolidation with HDAC/etoposide followed by stem cell mobilization.

 A five-day course of denileukin diftitox (Ontak) will be administered at and will serve as an in vivo purge.

 This will be followed by autologous stem cell transplant.

 Those not achieving partial remission or better following the four induction courses will receive 2 cycles of denileukin diftitox(Ontak) for 5 days.

 Those achieving partial remission or better to this regimen will go on to consolidation/mobilization and autologous stem cell transplant.

 Post-transplant, denileukin diftitox will also be used as an additional module of therapy.

This study examines the use of denileukin diftitox (Ontak) for patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma who are candidates for autologous stem cell transplants.
