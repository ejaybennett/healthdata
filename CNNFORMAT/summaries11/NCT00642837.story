 Rheumatic disease is a chronic disease, which can result in a functional disability and impaired HRQOL.

 Because of this chronic pain, patients with rheumatic disease have lower scores on HRQOL than general population.

 A several studies have indicated Ultracet as an add-on treatment to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) for osteoarthritis(OA) pain, fibromyalgia pain and chronic low back pain significantly improved HRQOL, compared with placebo.
