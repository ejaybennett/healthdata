 Cerevisiae Expressing Mutant Ras Protein, as Consolidation Therapy Following Curative Treatment for Stage I-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) With Tumor Sequence Confirmation of K-ras Mutation.

 NSCLC is the deadliest form of human cancer, killing approximately 150,000 people a year in the United States.

 The best treatment for NSCLC is surgical resection.

 For patients with inoperable or unresectable NSCLC chemotherapy and radiation is used as first line therapy.

 This is a consolidation therapy trial evaluating GI-4000 in subjects with NSCLC treated with curative intent who are disease free at their first post-treatment restaging assessment.

 These subjects must also have a ras mutation.
