(thirdQuint)Safety of Cat-PAD in Cat Allergic Subjects.

 This study is designed as a two centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, escalating single dose study in up to 88 cat allergic subjects.

 Cohorts of 8 subjects will be enrolled.

 Each cohort will undergo screening 14-28 days before treatment and a baseline challenge for EPSR and LPSR to cat allergen injected into the arm 7 days before treatment.

 On the treatment day, subjects will be injected either intradermally (into the skin) or subcutaneously (under the skin) with a single dose of Cat-PAD or placebo and safety observations made for 8 h.

 After 21 days, subjects will again have cat allergen injected into the arm and the EPSR and LPSR will be recorded.

 The dose of Cat-PAD will be increased in successive cohorts, provided that the previous dose tested was well tolerated.

 Safety of Cat-PAD in Cat Allergic Subjects@highlight

Cat allergy is an increasingly prevalent condition, affecting 10-15% of patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma.

 Cat-PAD is a novel, synthetic, allergen-derived peptide desensitising vaccine, currently being developed for the treatment of cat allergy.

 This study will investigate the safety of Cat-PAD administered as increasing single doses.
