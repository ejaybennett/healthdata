(thirdQuint)Detection of Latent Tuberculosis in Hemodialysis Patients.

 This prospective study includes all adults aged over 18 years of age who accept to be included in the study and provided written informed consent.

 All patients are under long term hemodialysis for chronic renal failure.

 They are subjected to a questionnaire including history of contacts with tuberculosis (TB), prior treatment for TB, history of prior tuberculin skin testing, history of BCG vaccination, country of origin, trips or prolonged stays in high incidence areas, smoking history, and medications.
