(secondQuint)Safety and Tolerability Study of Transscleral Iontophoresis by the EyeGate II Drug Delivery Device System.

 This is a single center, randomized, single-masked, comparative group, safety and tolerability study of single dose levels of citrate buffer delivered through transcleral iontophoresis administered via the EyeGate(R) II Drug Delivery System.

 The current study will also determine the safety and tolerability of the dose ranges of transcleral iontophoresis from 2 mA through 7 mA and will determine the safety and tolerability of the application of the Eyegate II system on the eye for time ranges of up to 10.

5 minutes.
