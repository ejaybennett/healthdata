(fifthQuint)Single DermaVir Immunization in HIV-1 Infected Patients on HAART.

 This study enrolled nine HIV-infected adult subjects in three sequential dose cohorts.

 All had durable suppression of HIV-RNA on HAART over the previous 6 months and CD4 count over 300 cells/mm3.

 Subjects, received on study Day 0 a single DermaVir immunization: - Low dose: 0.

1 mg pDNA, 0.

8 mL DermaVir administered under two DermaPrep patches.

 - Medium dose: 0.

4 mg pDNA, 3.

2 mL DermaVir administered under four DermaPrep patches.

 - High dose: 0.

8 mg pDNA, 6.

4 mL DermaVir administered under eight DermaPrep patches.

 Subjects were on study for a total of 28 days followed by a post-treatment safety follow-up for 48 weeks.

 HAART was not interrupted.

 All subjects completed the 28-day treatment and 48 weeks safety follow up phase.

 Single DermaVir Immunization in HIV-1 Infected Patients on HAART@highlight

- DermaVir is a plasmid DNA-containing synthetic nanomedicine.

 It is administered topically with DermaPrep to target Langerhans cells.

 Langerhans cells with DermaVir migrate to lymph nodes and express HIV-like particles that induce immune responses to kill HIV-infected cells.

 - Hypothesis: Single DermaVir immunization is safe and immunogenic measured by induction of HIV-specific precursor/memory T cell responses.

 - GIHU004 was a phase I dose escalation study conducted in Hungary.

 It evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of three dosing regimens of topical DermaVir immunization for the treatment of HIV-infected individuals on fully suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
