(secondQuint)Therapeutic Effect of Two Fluoride Varnishes on White Spot Lesions: a Clinical Study.

 The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of two varnish formulations (G1 = NaF, 2.

26%F, G2 = NaF, 2.

71% F + CaF2) on the remineralization of white spot lesions (WSL).

 The sample was composed of 15 (7- to 12-year-old) children with 45 active WSL in anterior permanent teeth.

 The children were randomly divided in two groups providing 22 lesions for G1 and 23 for G2.

 The children were submitted to weekly varnish applications 4 times.

 The WSL were evaluated twice: baseline and on week 4.

 Maximum lesion dimensions (mesial-distal and incisal-gingival) were measured in millimeters and classified in four grades of size.

 WSL were also recorded assessing lesion activity by one calibrated examiner.

 The Pearson chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used (P 0.

01).

 It can be concluded that after 4 applications the two varnish formulations tested produced similar clinical effects indicating the reduction and the control of carious activity in most WSL.

 Therapeutic Effect of Two Fluoride Varnishes on White Spot Lesions: a Clinical Study@highlight

The study hypothesis is the difference in therapeutic effect of two varnish formulations (G1 = NaF, 2.

26%F, G2 = NaF, 2.

71% F + CaF2).

 These products are commercially available in the Brazilian and international market and they are used for dental caries as white spot lesions control.
