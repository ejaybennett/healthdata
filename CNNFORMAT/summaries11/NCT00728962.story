(fifthQuint)A Study of Osseotite Certain Prevail Implants Used to Support Short Fixed Bridges With Immediate Occlusal Loading.

.

 This is a prospective, observational study in which all the patients will have implants placed and a provisional prosthesis attached within 24 hours of implant surgery.

 Each restorative case will consist of a posterior short span fixed bridge of four implants or less.

 The final prosthesis will be placed within five months or implant placement surgery.

 Overall success will be determined on the basis of procedural success, prosthesis success, and implant success.

 A Study of Osseotite Certain Prevail Implants Used to Support Short Fixed Bridges With Immediate Occlusal Loading.

@highlight

This prospective, multicenter study evaluates the performance of the Osseotite Prevail implant when to support a short fixed bridge with immediate occlusal loading, providing the patient with the use of a temporary prosthesis until the final prosthesis is made.

 Study (null) hypothesis: This is an observational study in which no concurrent control group will be observed.

 Results of the study will be compared with the performance of other Osseotite implants from published Osseotite multicenter studies.
