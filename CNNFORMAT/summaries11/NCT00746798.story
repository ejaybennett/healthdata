(firstQuint)Safety and Immunogenicity Study of ChimeriVax West Nile Vaccine in Healthy Adults.

 Currently, the only method of prevention of West Nile infection is control of the mosquito vectors associated or avoidance of mosquito bites, which has proven largely ineffective.

 Developing a safe, effective vaccine and making it widely available will enhance the prospects of prevention and control of this disease.

 In addition, natural infections with the YF virus and WN virus are more severe in the elderly.

 Therefore, a study among healthy older subjects or those with well controlled chronic diseases will provide data to determine a ChimeriVax-WN02 vaccine dose that is immunogenic and well tolerated.
