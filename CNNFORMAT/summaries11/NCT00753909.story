(firstQuint)Paclitaxel, Carboplatin Plus Bevacizumab in Pretreated, Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 The addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel plus carboplatin in the 1st line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) provided a survival benefit.

 There are patients with NSCLC who have not received bevacizumab and have relapsed after 1st and/or 2nd line therapy.

 The evaluation of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in such patients is justified.

 The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin, administered every two weeks, has a favorable toxicity profile.

 This study will evaluate the addition of bevacizumab to a biweekly regimen of paclitaxel and carboplatin as 2nd or 3rd line therapy for NSCLC.
