(fifthQuint)A Prospective, Open, Non-randomized Phase I/II Study of Therapeutic Angiogenesis in Diabetic Patients With Critic Ischemia of Lower Limbs While Administering Positive CD133 Mobilized With G-CSF.

 A total of up to 20 diabetic patients with critic ischemia of lower limbs will be included in the study.

 Patients will be administered with CD133+ cells, that previously have been obtained of their peripheral blood after mobilization with G-CSF The study is divided in three phases: Pre-treatment (previous 4 weeks of CD133+ cells mobilization).

 Treatment (cells mobilization, CD133+ transplant, 24 hours after infusion visit, 4, 12 and 24 weeks after transplant visits) Follow-up (9 and 12 months after transplant visits).

The primary objective is to analyze the safety and efficacy of CD133+ cells, obtained from peripheral blood in the treatment of diabetic patients with critic ischemia in lower limbs.

 The secondary objectives are: - To determine the safety of the intramuscular administration of CD133+ cells that have been mobilized from peripheral blood.

 - To determine the CD133+ capacity to increase the re-vascularization at lower limbs in diabetic patients with critic ischemia in the lower limbs.

 - To evaluate the patient global health condition using the notified results of the SF-36 questionnaires completed by patients
