(firstQuint)Prospective Pilot Study of Pre-Transplant Thymoglobulin Administration in Living Donor Renal Transplant Recipients.

 We will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of administering Thymoglobulin(R) induction pre-transplantation in renal allograft recipients.

 Patients receiving pre-transplant Thymoglobulin will be evaluated for acute rejection (Banff '97 criteria), survival, and safety at 6 months.

 Overall the use of Thymoglobulin induction pre-transplantation will be safe and effective.
