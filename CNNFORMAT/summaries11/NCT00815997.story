(secondQuint)Novel Angioplasty Using Coronary Accessor.

 Prerequisites for TRI were a sufficiently pulsating radial artery and presence of an ulnar pulse with a sufficient palmar arch, as evidenced by the absence of digital ischemia according to the Allen's test.

 Exclusion criteria for the current study included planned use of a cutting balloon, rotational atherectomy, directional coronary atherectomy, and intravascular ultrasound, which were not compatible with 4-Fr catheter.

 Patency of the radial artery after TRI will be evaluated by pulsation of the radial artery, and frequencies of which will be compared between those receiving 4Fr vs 6 Fr coronary interventions.

To investigate the advantage of using a 4Fr guiding catheter over a 6 Fr, frequencies of radial artery occlusion after transradial coronary intervention (TRI) will be evaluated.

 Radial artery occlusion rate in 4 Fr TRI group is expected to be not more than that in 6Fr groups.
