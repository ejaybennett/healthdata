(firstQuint)Local Paclitaxel Delivery for SFA Disease.

 Treatment of superficial femoral artery atherosclerosis with percutaneous techniques is hindered by high restenosis rates.

 Paclitaxel inhibits restenosis in coronary arteries, and a few studies suggest it may be effective in reducing restenosis rates in peripheral arteries.

 The investigators hypothesize that delivering paclitaxel through an irrigating catheter will be superior in preventing restenosis.
