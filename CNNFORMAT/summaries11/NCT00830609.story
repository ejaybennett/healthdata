 High Dose Versus Standard Dose of Ribavirin in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C, Genotype 3@highlight

The rate of sustained virological response (SVR) in patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 3, high viral load and without rapid virological response (RNA-HCV negative at week 4) is low.

 Standard of care of these patients include treatment with weekly peginterferon plus 800 mg/day of ribavirin (RBV).

 Extended treatment to 48 weeks does not provide more clinical benefit than the standard duration.

 The main hypothesis is that higher dose of ribavirin may be better in terms of SVR than the standard dose.
