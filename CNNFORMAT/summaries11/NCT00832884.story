(secondQuint)The Safety of Intravenous Lacosamide.

 Lacosamide tablets and intravenous formulations were both approved in the United States in the fall of 2008.

 Lacosamide is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizure disorder in patients' age seventeen years and older.

 A parenteral dosage form of Lacosamide is desirable for patients who are temporarily unable to take medication orally.

 The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of IV Lacosamide in children with epilepsy, ages 4 to 35 years, who are either unable to take oral medication, or whom parenteral administration of IV Lacosamide is desirable.
