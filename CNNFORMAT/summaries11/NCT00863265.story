(thirdQuint)Phytosterols, Ezetimibe, and Cholesterol Metabolism.

 The investigators will perform a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover feeding study in 25 subjects with greater than ideal levels of LDL cholesterol who do not require anti-cholesterol drug treatment.

 Subjects will consume a baseline diet provided by a feeding center that is deficient in phytosterols for three periods of 21 days separated by 7-day washout periods.

 Treatments will be given in random order During period B placebo phytosterols and placebo ezetimibe will be given; during period C placebo phytosterols and active ezetimibe will be given; during period A active phytosterols and active ezetimibe will be given.

 Study endpoints are fecal cholesterol excretion and percent cholesterol absorption determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and circulating LDL cholesterol.

 Phytosterols, Ezetimibe, and Cholesterol Metabolism@highlight

Phytosterols and ezetimibe each reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption by 30-55% but appear to have different mechanisms of action.

 The investigators' hypothesis is that phytosterols and ezetimibe given together will block cholesterol absorption in an additive fashion.

 In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial the effects of placebo, ezetimibe treatment and ezetimibe plus phytosterol treatment will be measured.
