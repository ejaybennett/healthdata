(firstQuint)Effects of Etravirine on Endothelial Function in HIV-uninfected Adults: A Pilot Study.

 We hypothesize that in HIV-uninfected subjects, etravirine 200mg twice daily for four weeks will have no effect on endothelial function.

 The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of etravirine 200mg twice daily given for four weeks on endothelial function, measured as flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, in HIV-uninfected subjects.

 Secondary objectives include determination of the effects of etravirine 200mg twice daily given for four weeks on safety measures, lipid fractions, HOMA-IR, blood pressure, inflammatory parameters, and endothelial activation parameters.
