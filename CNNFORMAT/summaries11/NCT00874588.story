(secondQuint)Peptide Vaccine Targeting to Cancer Specific Antigen Combined With Anti-angiogenic Peptide Antigen in Treating Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 URLC10 and CDCA1 have been identified as cancer specific molecules especially in non small cell lung cancer using genome-wide expression profile analysis by cDNA microarray technique.

 We have determined the HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides derived from these molecules.

 We also tend to use the peptides targeting to tumor angiogenesis.

 VEGF receptor 1 and 2 are essential targets to tumor angiogenesis, and we identified that peptides derived from these receptors significantly induce the effective tumor specific CTL response in vitro and vivo.

 According to these findings, in this trial, we evaluate the safety, immunological and clinical response of those peptides.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immune response and clinical response of different doses of HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides URLC10, CDCA1, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 emulsified with Montanide ISA 51.
