(firstQuint)Assessment of Colonic Permeability by Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy.

 Increased intestinal permeability has been shown significant in many gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and recently irritable bowel syndrome.

 The conventional test methods of permeability is sugar absorption test which is neither reliable and practical.

 Confocal laser endomicrosopy is a newly developed device which allows in vivo and real time observation of gastrointestinal mucosa.

 In our preliminary study we found that the commonly used contrast agent, fluorescein sodium shew differences of leakage into colonic crypt lumen among different patients.

 The fluorescein leakage might be due to abnormal colonic permeability, so we planed to compare the fluorescein leakage under confocal laser endomicroscopy with conventional sucralose absorption test.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of confocal laser endomicroscopy in assessment of colonic permeability against conventional sugar absorption test.
