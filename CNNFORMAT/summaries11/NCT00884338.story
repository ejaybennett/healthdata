(secondQuint)Cognitive Function After Stem Cell Transplantation.

 Patients (n = 60) will be randomized to an exercise or a control group.

 The randomization will be stratified for allogeneic or autologous blood stem cell transplantation.

 Patients in the exercise group will carry out an endurance training consisting of walking on a treadmill at a speed corresponding to 80% of the maximum heart rate.

 The exercise program will be carried out 3 times weekly for 8 weeks.

 Patients in the control group will receive counseling about exercise and behavioural techniques to reduce fatigue, but they will not participate at a structured exercise program.

 Physical performance (VO2max), cognitive function, mood and quality of life will be evaluated at recruitment and after 8 weeks.
