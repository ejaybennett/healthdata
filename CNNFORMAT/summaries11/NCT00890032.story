(thirdQuint)Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients Undergoing Surgery for Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the feasibility and safety of an autologous brain tumor stem cell messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-loaded dendritic cell vaccine in adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

 Secondary - To assess humoral and cellular immune responses to vaccination.

 - To compare the proportion of vaccinated patients alive at 6 months from the time of surgery for recurrent tumor with matched historical cohorts.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo surgical resection of tumor.

 Tumor tissue samples are collected to isolate brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) and for extraction and amplification of BTSC-specific mRNA.

 Within 4 weeks after surgical resection, patients undergo leukapheresis over 4 hours to generate dendritic cells (DCs).

 Patients also undergo leukapheresis at 1 week after the third vaccination and then at least every 3 months as needed for generation of additional DCs.

 Patients receive autologous BTSC mRNA-loaded DC vaccine intradermally once weekly for 3 weeks and then once monthly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

 Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients Undergoing Surgery for Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme@highlight

RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells and dendritic cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy in treating patients undergoing surgery for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
