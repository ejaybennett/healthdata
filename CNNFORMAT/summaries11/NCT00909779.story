(secondQuint)Safety Study of Arformoterol Tartrate Inhalation Solution in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Subjects.

 This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, outpatient, safety study to evaluate the long-term safety of arformoterol 15 mcg twice daily (BID) in the treatment of subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD.

 The administration of arformoterol in subjects with moderate to severe COPD will not result in a meaningfully greater incidence of respiratory death and COPD exacerbation -related hospitalizations compared to placebo (nebulized saline and non-long-acting beta2-agonist [LABA] COPD standard of care treatments).
