(fifthQuint)Palliative Radiotherapy (RT) for Liver Metastases (Mets) and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)(COLD 4).

 The liver is one of the most common sites with tumour involvement, including both primary and metastatic disease.

 Gastrointestinal tumours, breast, lung and melanoma are the most common primary sites for hepatic metastases.

 Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with over 600,000 new cases diagnosed per year.

 It is the third most common cause of cancer related death.

Although, predominately a disease in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, the incidence of HCC is increasing in North America.

 The use of radiation in unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas, as well as hepatic metastases, for palliation is uncommon in clinical practice.

 This may be because there is a prevailing perception that radiation to the liver will inevitably lead to radiation induced liver disease (RILD).

 However, several single institution, predominantly retrospective studies, have demonstrated effective palliation for locally advanced HCC as well as hepatic metastases with minimal toxicity.

In this study, palliative radiotherapy (RT), delivered in one fraction of 8Gy, will be given to symptomatic patients who are not candidates for radical treatment.

 We hypothesize that palliative RT will provide symptomatic relief to a large fraction of the patients, with both primary and metastatic disease.

 We also expect minimal toxicities at this treatment dose.

 Palliative Radiotherapy (RT) for Liver Metastases (Mets) and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)(COLD 4)@highlight

Palliative radiotherapy is radiation treatment given to help reduce pain or discomfort, or other symptoms related to cancer.

 This is used commonly for cancer that has spread to the bones and brain, and for many other primary cancers that are too advanced to be cured, including lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and head and neck cancer.

 The benefits of palliative radiotherapy for advanced liver cancer have not been well studied.

 This study is designed to help to see whether palliative radiation therapy is effective in controlling pain, discomfort or other symptoms related to liver cancer, and how this therapy Phase II Trial of Palliative Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Hepatic Metastases might affect the quality of life of patients receiving such therapy.

 This information will help the doctors understand if there are specific conditions under which radiation therapy is more effective and worthwhile, and how it may affect the quality of life for patients who have locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic metastasis.
