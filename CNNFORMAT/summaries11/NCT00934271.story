(firstQuint)Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy in Patients With Acromegaly.

 An audit was done on 34 patients with acromegaly (consecutive cohorte) treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in Rigshospitalet/National University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.

 All patients had MR control regularly to monitor tunour control, and biochemical control assessed by growth hormone measurements during an oral glucose tolerance test.

 Furthermore all other pituitary axes were tested for sufficiency and concomitant medication likewise registered.

 The 7 year interim analysis demonstrated an acceptable tumour control and biochemical remission profile, and most patient had subsequent withdrawal of somatostatin analogue- and growth hormone receptor antagonis therapy.

 The observational study will continue with a new update in approx 2 years.

Hypothesis: Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is a safe therapy for treatment of patients with acromegaly in terms of both tumour control and biochemical remission
