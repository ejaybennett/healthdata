(thirdQuint)A Study of Patients With Major Depressive Disorder and Residual Apathy.

 Apathy is reported by up to 30% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and is hypothesized to be a treatment emergent adverse effect associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication.

 While there is currently no consistent method for treating apathy among psychiatrists, it has been proposed that switching MDD patients to antidepressant medications containing both serotonin and norepinephrine, such as duloxetine, may reduce the incidence and severity of apathy in these patients.

The purpose of this study is to provide a comparison of the apathy, depression, and functional outcomes associated with switching to duloxetine or escitalopram in patients who have previously responded to treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for major depressive disorder and who have residual apathy in the absence of depressed mood.
