(secondQuint)Study to Evaluate the Diagnostic Value of a Combined Molecular Breast Imaging/ Breast Tomosynthesis Modality.

 The purpose of this pilot study is to obtain preliminary data on a new way of imaging the breast that combines the benefits of a 3-D anatomical technique (Digital Tomosynthesis) with those of a functional imaging technique (Molecular Breast Imaging).

 Combining data from these 2 modalities would provide co-registered functional and anatomical information on the breast, in the same way that PET/CT does today in oncology.

 This should greatly facilitate the evaluation and biopsy of lesions seen on MBI but occult on conventional mammography.
