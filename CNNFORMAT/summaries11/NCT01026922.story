(fifthQuint)Use of an Ambulatory Capsule to Characterize Gastrointestinal Pressure Patterns in Children.

 ADM is a standard procedures used in children, but it has some limitations and disadvantages.

 Manometry studies involve placing catheters in the nose and are often poorly tolerated by children.

 Also, placement of the catheter requires sedation or anesthesia, the manometry test lasts several hours and involves ingestion of a meal which many children find difficult when having a catheter in their nose.

 The reason we are conducting this study is because we would like to find a new, less invasive, equally informative test for understanding gastrointestinal motility.

 The SmartPill GI Monitoring System uses a capsule, about the size of a large vitamin or PillCam capsule, which is swallowed and passed through the stool.

 While in the GI tract, the capsule measures the acidity (pH) and pressures, and these measurements are used to determine how long it takes for food to leave the stomach.

 Pressure and pH information are sent by the capsule to a receiver that the patient will either wear on the belt or keep within 2 feet.

 The receiver stores data collected about the pH, temperature, and pressure inside the GI tract.

 The SmartPill GI Monitoring System has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in adults but not in children.

 Use of an Ambulatory Capsule to Characterize Gastrointestinal Pressure Patterns in Children@highlight

This study will test a new medical device called the SmartPill GI Monitoring System, which is now used to diagnose gastric motility disorders in adults, in children.

 The study will compare the SmartPill capsule findings to antroduodenal manometry (ADM), which is a standard procedure currently used for the evaluation of gastric and duodenal motility in children.

 The ADM studies will be done for clinical purposes and only if recommended by the patient's gastroenterologist.

 The research portion of the study is limited to the use of SmartPill.
