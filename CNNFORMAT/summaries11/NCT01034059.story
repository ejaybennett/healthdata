(thirdQuint)Assessment of sTREM-1 as a Diagnostic Marker in Patients With Neutropenic Fever.

 Patients with hematological malignancies developed neutropenia after chemotherapy.

 We checked the serum level of sTREM-1 in patients with neutropenic fever.

 Those patients were classified to 2 groups: documented infection or low likelihood of infection.

 Their sTREM-1 level was measured and was compared with other biomarker such as CRP and procalcitonin.

 The value of sTREM-1 for diagnosis of infection in patients with neutropenic fever was thus evaluated.

 Assessment of sTREM-1 as a Diagnostic Marker in Patients With Neutropenic Fever@highlight

The soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) was an established biomarker useful for infection in non-neutropenic patients.

 In this study, we tested sTREM-1 in the patients with neutropenic fever.

 Pro-calcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also measured.

 We planned to investigate and explore the role of sTREM-1 in early diagnosis of infection in patients with neutropenic fever.
