(secondQuint)Laparoscopic Revision Gastric Bypass for Inadequate Initial Weight Loss.

 There is lack of standardization of primary and revisional bariatric surgery compounded by a scant long-term outcome data.

 The treatment of inadequate weight loss, weight recidivism, and most severe technical complications after primary bariatric surgery remains refractory to non-operative treatment.

 Failure rates have been reported up to 20% and 35% for the morbidly obese (MO) and super obese (SO), respectively at 2 to 3 years after surgery.

 The indication for further surgical intervention remains controversial, as does what type of revisional procedure, both operative and endoscopic, to recommend.

 Furthermore, there is no standardization of the limb lengths, pouch size or the use of prosthetic reinforcement.

 Therefore the approach to these patients must be as individualized as their original operations.

 We formally analyze our experience with all laparoscopic revisional strategies for Inadequate Initial Weight Loss after failed Roux-en-Y gastric bypass(RYGB).
