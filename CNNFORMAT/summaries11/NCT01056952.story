(secondQuint)Physiologic Effects of High Flow Nasal Therapy in Patients With Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (OPTIFLOW).

 The administration of a known concentration of oxygen is an important part of routine care of the patient admitted in intensive care unit for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

 A new high flow oxygen delivery system (Fisher and Paykel Health care) has been developed (Optiflow).

 The system used a heated humidifier and heated breathing circuit via a nasal interface.

 High flow nasal therapy (Optiflow) is associated with the generation of significant positive airway pressure in healthy volunteers.

 Positive expiratory pressure may have a number of benefits in respiratory failure which include improved ventilation/perfusion matching with improved oxygenation, reduced airways resistance and reduced work of breathing.

 Moreover high flow nasal therapy may improve oxygen administration by decreasing oxygen dilution, decreasing death space and using high levels of humidification.

The aim of the study is to assess, in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, the short term physiologic effects of the high flow oxygen nasal therapy (Optiflow), in term of inspiratory muscle effort, gas exchange, comfort and dyspnea
