(fifthQuint)Volar Locked Plating Versus Bridging External Fixation.

 We have designed a randomized, prospective study for comparison of volar locked plating versus Hoffman II bridging external fixation supplemented by K-wire fixation in patients with comminuted distal radius fractures, AO/OTA type C2 & C3.

 On the basis of power analysis a total of 140 patients are to be included in this project.

 The follow-up period is 2 years and evaluation is based on x-ray analysis, grip strength, range of movement, pain and various tools to measure quality of life and satisfaction with the treatment (EQ-5d, SF-36, Quick-DASH).

 Volar Locked Plating Versus Bridging External Fixation@highlight

A randomized, prospective comparison of volar locked plating versus Hoffman II bridging external fixation supplemented by K-wire fixation in patients with comminuted distal radius fractures, AO/OTA type C2 & C3.

 Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in using volar plates compared to Hoffman II bridging external fixation supplemented by K-wire fixation in patients with comminuted distal radius fractures, AO/OTA type C2 & C3 as evaluated by a Quick-DASH score at 24 months follow-up.
