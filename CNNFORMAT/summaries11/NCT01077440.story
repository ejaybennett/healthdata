(thirdQuint)Presence of Donor-Derived DNA in Semen Samples From Cancer Survivors Who Underwent Donor Stem Cell Transplant.

 OBJECTIVES: - To examine semen samples from male survivors of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the presence of donor-derived DNA.

 OUTLINE: Semen samples are collected and assessed by flow cytometry and PCR.

 DNA samples are compared to previously analyzed DNA extracted from survivor and donor.

 Samples are also analyzed for sperm concentration, motility, morphology, and viability.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of semen from cancer survivors in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 PURPOSE: This phase I research study is looking at the presence of donor-derived DNA in semen samples form cancer survivors who underwent donor stem cell transplant.
