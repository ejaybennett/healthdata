(secondQuint)Biliverdin Reductase A in Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection.

 1.

 To analyze biliverdin reductase (BLVRA) expression in the liver of HVC infected patients undergoing liver biopsy followed by standard antiviral treatment (peg-interferon plus ribavirin combination therapy) and patients with other forms of liver diseases undergoing liver biopsy as controls.

 2.

 To analyze BLVRA expression in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) of therapeutically naive HCV patients, during/after standard antiviral therapy and healthy controls.

 3.

 To analyze BVLRA genetic polymorphisms both in HCV infected patients and healthy controls.

In this project, the investigators aim to study the role of biliverdin reductase A (BLVRA) in HCV infected patients prior and during/after standard antiviral therapy in association with viral clearance, disease progression and treatment response and in comparison with healthy subjects.
