(thirdQuint)Methadone Versus Placebo in Spine Fusion.

 Hypothesis: 1.

 We hypothesize that 0.

2 mg/kg of methadone will result in decreased postoperative hydromorphone consumption compared to hydromorphone alone in opioid naive patients or patients who are taking less than the equivalent of 15 mg IV morphine a day undergoing lumbar interbody fusion.

 2.

 We hypothesize that the incidence of opioid related postoperative side effects will not be increased by the administration of methadone in the operating room.
