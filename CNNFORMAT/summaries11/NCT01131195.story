(fifthQuint)Metronomic Therapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer.

.

 OBJECTIVES: - To determine if bevacizumab and paclitaxel versus bevacizumab, metronomic cyclophosphamide, and capecitabine as first-line therapy causes less medication-related adverse events in women with HER2-negative metastatic, locally advanced, or recurrent breast cancer.

 - To compare quality of life (QOL) in patients treated with these regimens.

 - To replicate previous findings of better QOL in patients with complete response or partial response versus stable disease for 6 months or greater.

 - To determine the predictive value of baseline QOL for the duration of a meaningful change in QOL of patients treated with chemotherapy.

 - To determine the associations between the QOL endpoints, selected health economics, and clinical endpoints.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to tumor response (measurable vs evaluable disease), WHO performance status (0 or 1 vs 2), and center.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and paclitaxel IV on days 1, 8, and 15.

 Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 - Arm II: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15, oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-28, and oral capecitabine 3 times a day on days 1-28.

 Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaire (BL-QA) and health economics questionnaires (BL-HEA and EQ-5D) at baseline, during, and after completion of study therapy.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.

 Metronomic Therapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer.

@highlight

RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways.

 Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

 Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 It is not yet known whether bevacizumab is more effective when given together with paclitaxel or cyclophosphamide and capecitabine in treating patients with breast cancer.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying the side effects of giving bevacizumab together with paclitaxel and to see how well it works compared with giving bevacizumab together with cyclophosphamide and capecitabine as first-line therapy in treating women with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic breast cancer.
