(thirdQuint)MRI of Therapeutic Intervention in Postmenopausal Osteoporosis.

 The overall design is to determine and compare the effect of teriparatide and of zoledronic acid on trabecular architecture by magnetic resonance imaging of the midshaft tibia.

 Post-menopausal women, aged 60 or older with osteoporosis and/or at increased risk of fracture, will be randomized to receive either teriparatide or zoledronic acid.

 Trabecular microarchitecture, biomechanical parameters and bone mineral density will be examined at 0 and 12 months at 3T MRI.

 MRI of Therapeutic Intervention in Postmenopausal Osteoporosis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to apply a novel advanced magnetic resonance imaging methodology to evaluate the response to drug intervention involving two treatment arms of postmenopausal participants with osteoporosis, randomized into either a teriparatide (Forteo cent ) or zoledronic acid (Reclast cent ) group.
