(secondQuint)Effectiveness of Nutritional Supplementation in Preventing Malnutrition in Children With Infection.

 Anorexia due to infection might lead to weight loss.

 In many settings total recovery is problematic what might result in a permanent lower weight.

 A short period high quality food supplementation could improve weight gain after an infection.

 A complete high quality food will be tested, but also micronutrients alone as there is no information on what children with an infection exactly need as a supplement.

 Children aged 6-59 months presenting with diarrhoea, malaria or lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) are provided for 2 weeks with - RUTF supplement (Plumpynut(R)) of 500 kcal/day - Multi-micronutrient powder (MNP) - Placebo to MNP The followup period is 6 months.

 Anthropometric indicators and morbidity are assessed monthly.

 Participants are invited to attend the study clinic if any signs of disease are noticed.
