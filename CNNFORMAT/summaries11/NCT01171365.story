(firstQuint)Small Particle Steroids in Refractory Asthma.

 We have identified a group of patients with refractory asthma who have ongoing eosinophilic airway inflammation despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids.

 Traditional inhaled steroids have a relatively proximal airway distribution which may lead to inadequate treatment of the distal airways.

 We aim to demonstrate that a steroid inhaler with a smaller particle size which targets the distal airways can be a useful additional treatment option in this group of patients.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether an inhaled steroid with a small particle size can be an additional treatment option in patients with refractory eosinophilic asthma.
