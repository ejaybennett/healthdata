(secondQuint)Drug Eluting Balloon Angioplasty for Dialysis Access Treatment.

 In total 40 patients already diagnosed with hemodynamically significant stenosis of the dialysis AVF or AVG (including venous outflow lesions), programmed to undergo percutaneous transluminal angioplasty by our department, will sign informed consent and will be randomized to either receive DEB (Paclitaxel eluting balloon), or conventional balloon therapy.

 The protocol includes the description of patient's demographics (age, gender,dialysis access details, risk factors) and procedural details, as well as immediate results and long-term follow up.
