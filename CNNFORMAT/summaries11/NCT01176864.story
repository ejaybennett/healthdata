(secondQuint)Double- Versus Single-balloon Enteroscopy for Obscure Small-bowel Bleeding.

 Th e double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) system, developed by Dr Yamamoto, was presented for the fi rst time in Japan in 2001.

 The system has become established throughout the world for diagnostic and therapeutic small-bowel examinations, and it is now used universally in routine clinical work.

 Another balloon enteroscopy system was recently introduced in which only one balloon is attached at the tip of the overtube; the method is therefore known as SBE.

 SBE is a simplification of the double balloon method, and its value has already been confirmed for difficult colonoscopies.

 The question of whether similar results can be achieved with the single balloon method in the more complex situation of the small bowel has not yet been answered.

Double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is now an established method for diagnostic and therapeutic small-bowel endoscopy.

 Single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE) has been introduced to simplify the technique.

 A prospective randomized study was carried out to compare the two methods in obscure small bowel bleeding
