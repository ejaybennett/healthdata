(fifthQuint)A Research Trial of Aralast in New Onset Diabetes (RETAIN).

 Researchers are interested in conducting this study to assess whether Aralast NP (AAT, Alpha-1 Antitrypsin ) will help slow the progression of T1DM.

 Part I of this study has two parts:-1a and -1b: Part 1a (Complete): An open-label, dose-escalation, PK, PD and safety study.

 Participants receive 12 intravenous (IV) infusions of Aralast NP.

 Infusions 1 through 6 are administered at 45 mg/kg/wk and infusions 7 through 12 are administered at 90 mg/kg/wk.

 Part Ia consists of two groups: - Subjects aged 16 - 35 years at enrollment with new-onset T1DM - Subjects aged 8 -15 years at enrollment with new-onset T1DM.

 Part 1b (study terminated prior to subject enrollment): An open-label, dose-escalation PK, PD and safety study in which participants receive 12 infusions of Aralast NP.

 Infusions 1 through 6 are administered at 90 mg/kg/wk and infusions 7 through 12 are administered at 180 mg/kg/wk.

 Part Ib consists of two groups: - Subjects aged 16 - 35 years at enrollment with new-onset T1DM - Subjects 8 - 15 years at enrollment with new-onset T1DM.

 Participants in Part Ib do not roll over into Part II (Refer to NCT01183455).

 A Research Trial of Aralast in New Onset Diabetes (RETAIN)@highlight

The drug Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT, Aralast NP) is being tested in this study as an anti-inflammatory drug (a medication that decreases inflammation, which is part of the body's normal ability to fight infection and respond to injuries) that affects the cells thought to be involved in the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM, T1D).

 All subjects enrolled in this study have new-onset T1DM (diagnosis of T1DM within 100 days of Visit 0; T1DM diagnosis fulfilling American Diabetes Association standard T1DM criteria).

 The focus of Part I of this trial (NCT01183468) is pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety.

 Upon completion of Part I, including a satisfactory safety review, enrollment in Part II (NCT01183455, Phase II Clinical Trial) will begin.
