(thirdQuint)n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA) Supplementation in Young Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

 Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a chronic condition affecting young women of reproductive age.

 Long-term, safe and efficacious treatments are needed for women with this condition, and dietary therapy may have an important role in its treatment.

 LC n-3 PUFA have been shown to be potent biological regulators, involved in the amelioration of many of the adverse metabolic risk factors which are often present in women with PCOS.

 The aim of this study was to explore the impact of LC n-3 PUFA on fasting and post-prandial lipid metabolism, as well as on the hormonal profile of women with PCOS.

 n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA) Supplementation in Young Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)@highlight

This is a dietary intervention study designed to assess the impact of long chain (LC) n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

 Considering that LC n-3 PUFA have been reported to have a beneficial affect on many of the adverse metabolic and hormonal aspects of PCOS, it was hypothesised that dietary supplementation with LC n-3 PUFA would have a beneficial therapeutic impact.
