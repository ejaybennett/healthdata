(secondQuint)A Trial to Evaluate the Impact of Lung-protective Intervention in Patients Undergoing Esophageal Cancer Surgery.

 Large tidal volume are known risk factor of acute lung injury.

Mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume has been shown to attenuate lung injuries in critically ill patients.

Esophagectomy surgery need a relatively long time of one-lung ventilation.

 A normal tidal volume of two-lung ventilation should be a large one when exerted to one lung.

 We hypothesized that low tidal volume ventilation during one-lung ventilation could decrease incidence rate of postoperative acute lung injury and mortality.

 A Trial to Evaluate the Impact of Lung-protective Intervention in Patients Undergoing Esophageal Cancer Surgery@highlight

The purpose of this trial is to determine whether low tidal volume during intraoperative one-lung ventilation could decrease the incidence rate of postoperative acute lung injury compared to "normal" tidal volume.
