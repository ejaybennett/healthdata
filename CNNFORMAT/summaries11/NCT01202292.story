(fifthQuint)Group Motivational Intervention in Overweight/Obese Patients.

.

 The global mortality caused by cardiovascular disease increases with weight.

 The Framingham study showed that obesity is a cardiovascular risk factor independent of other risks such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and smoking.

 Moreover, the main problem in the management of weight-loss is its maintenance, if it is achieved.

 We have designed a study in two geographically separated groups, one of which would receive the group motivational intervention, and the other one would receive the usual follow up.

 Group Motivational Intervention in Overweight/Obese Patients.

@highlight

The overall goal of IMOAP study is to assess whether the efficacy of the healthcare professionals' usual practices, together with a motivational group intervention (delivered by a nurse trained by an expert psychologist), is more effective than an isolated traditional intervention on weight loss and its maintenance in overweight and obese patients.

 Furthermore, the study will evaluate whether this result has a positive impact on quality of life, changes in eating habits, and a reduction in the associated cardiovascular risk factors and overall cardiovascular risk.
