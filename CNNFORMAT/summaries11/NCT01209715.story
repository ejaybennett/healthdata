(fifthQuint)Effect of an Inhaled Glucocorticoid-long-acting Beta Adrenergic Agonist on Endothelial Function in COPD.

 To test the premise and to characterize the time dependence of the responses, the investigators propose the following two aims: 1.

 To determine the effect of a medium dose glucocorticoid/long-acting beta-agonist preparation (250 1/2g fluticasone plus 50 1/2g salmeterol) administered for 3 weeks on inhaled albuterol and sub-lingual NTG induced vasodilation in the bronchial artery, as assessed by Qaw in stable glucocorticoid-naive COPD patients, and to re-assess the responses after a 3 week glucocorticoid/long-acting beta-agonist washout period.

 2.

 To determine inhaled albuterol and sub-lingual NTG-induced vasodilation (Qaw) before, and 30 min and 120 min after a single medium dose of an ICS (220 1/2g fluticasone) in stable glucocorticoid- naive COPD patients.

 For both aims, the protocol design will be placebo-controlled and double-blind.

 For the second aim, only fluticasone pretreatment will be possible because the salmeterol component of the fluticasone/salmeterol combination preparation could influence albuterol responsiveness irrespective of any glucocorticoid effect.

 The timing of the endothelial function measurements in the long-term glucocorticoid/long-acting beta-agonist protocol and single dose ICS protocol is based on the past experience with ICS on airway vascular function.

 Single dose effects were seen within 15-30 min and waned by 90 min (25,26), while long-term treatment effects were no longer seen 3 weeks after ICS withdrawal (16).

 Effect of an Inhaled Glucocorticoid-long-acting Beta Adrenergic Agonist on Endothelial Function in COPD@highlight

In the present study, the investigators wish to address the effect of a glucocorticoid/long-acting beta-agonist preparation on endothelial function in COPD patients who do not currently smoke (ex-smokers) by measuring endothelium-dependent (albuterol response) and endothelium-independent (NTG response) vasodilation in the bronchial artery, reflecting endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation (drug-induced increase in Qaw, Qaw).

 With this approach the investigators will test the hypothesis that in stable ICS-naive COPD patients, endothelium-dependent vasodilation is restored with a glucocorticoid/long-acting beta-agonist preparation, presumably resulting from the glucocorticoid component.
