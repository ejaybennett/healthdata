(secondQuint)A Pilot Trial of Acute N-Acetylcysteine Effects on Working Memory and Other Cognitive Functions in Schizophrenia.

 Working memory impairment in Schizophrenia is produced by deficiencies of feedback inhibition of glutamate release, due to low cysteine-glutamate antiporter activity.

 Because of this mechanism, we are interested in whether acute administration of N-Acetylcysteine will improve performance of patients with schizophrenia on a battery of cognitive tasks utilized to test working memory and other cognitive domains, versus placebo.

 This pilot study will utilize a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover design.
