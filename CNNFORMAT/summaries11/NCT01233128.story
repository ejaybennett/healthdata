(secondQuint)Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) & LOC387715/HTRA1 Polymorphism in Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy.

 This is a retrospective comparative case series comprised of 70 patients being treated for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy with intravitreal ranibizumab injections and 112 control subjects.

 Patients were genotyped for the LOC387715 (rs10490924), HTRA1 gene (rs11200638), and VEGF (rs3025039 and rs833069)polymorphism using Real-Time polymerase chain reaction.

 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) & LOC387715/HTRA1 Polymorphism in Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy@highlight

This study is to investigate whether there is an association of the LOC387715/HTRA1 and vascular endothelial growth factor polymorphism with response to treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab injections for patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.
