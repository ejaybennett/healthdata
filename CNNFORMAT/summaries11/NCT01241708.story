(secondQuint)Tandem Auto Stem Cell Transplant With Melphalan Followed by Melphalan and Bortezomib in Patients With Multiple Myeloma.

 Many patients with multiple myeloma receive 2 stem cell transplantations within a few months of each other as part of their treatment.

 Usually the drug Melphalan is used for both transplants.

 Bortezomib is a drug that is used for treating multiple myeloma and has been used in combination with melphalan for stem cell transplantation for patients with multiple myeloma.

 The purpose of this trial is to study the effects of doing 2 transplants, first using melphalan and second using melphalan and bortezomib.

 The trial is aiming to find out if adding the Bortezomib to the second transplant will increase the chances of staying in remission longer.
