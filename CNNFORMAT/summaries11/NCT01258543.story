(thirdQuint)Osteopathic Evaluation on Patients With Non-specific Back Pain: An Inter-examiner Reliability Study.

 Back pain is one of the leading causes of consultation for rehabilitation.

 Establishing a diagnosis in the initial patient assessment is essential to choosing a specific treatment plan for that patient, regardless of the type of therapy the patient chooses to pursue.

 Evidence based medicine is the current gold standard for most manual-therapy professions, and there has been a great deal of research performed in an attempt to give credibility to the one tool that all manual therapy professions share in common: palpation.

 Few studies have been able to demonstrate an acceptable rate of inter-examiner reliability for palpation.

 This study will combine a global testing regime, consensus training for evaluators, and access to history of injury with symptomatic subjects to verify the inter-examiner reliability of an osteopathic evaluation on patients with chronic, non-specific low back pain.

 Osteopathic Evaluation on Patients With Non-specific Back Pain: An Inter-examiner Reliability Study@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether two osteopathic evaluators with less than 5 years experience will be able to determine the same location and nature of the primary lesion(s) or restriction(s)in patients with chronic non-specific back pain using a global osteopathic evaluation approach.
