(firstQuint)Alternate Dosing Regimens of BG00012 in Healthy Volunteers.

 Preclinical safety margins for BG00012 allow for a maximum daily dose of 720 mg daily.

 The study will use a variety of clinical scales, including a flushing scale derived from a validated questionnaire [Norquist 2007], to better understand the safety and tolerability of several doses and dosing regimens of BG00012 up to a total daily dose of 720 mg.

 The etiology of BG00012-induced flushing will be assessed by collecting relevant biomarker data and the impact of ASA on flushing will be evaluated.

 Assessments relating to GI symptoms will also be performed.
