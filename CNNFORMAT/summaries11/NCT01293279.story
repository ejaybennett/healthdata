(secondQuint)HCV (Hepatitis C Virus) Viral and Host Genotyping (IL28B, Interleukin 28B) in China.

 A sample of 1000 Han ethnic Chinese male or female who are 18 years old with a recent confirmation of anti-HCV-antibody positive and HCV RNA positive but antiviral treatment naive from 28 university affiliated hospital in China.

 The primary objective of this study is to estimate the distributions of HCV Viral genotyping(ie, genotype 1 through 6 and their known subtypes), and host genotypes, both inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) gene, and IL28B.

 This study also collects other data including patients' demographic and clinical characteristics.

 There is no active antiviral treatments and no follow-up in this study.
