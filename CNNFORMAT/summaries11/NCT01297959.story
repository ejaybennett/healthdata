(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Safety of E-101 Solution for Preventing Surgical Site Infections After Colorectal Surgery.

 The purpose of this standard-of-care, pivotal Phase 3 study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical E-101 Solution after direct application into the principal surgical incision in the prevention of superficial and deep incisional surgical site infections (SSI) within 30 days after elective colorectal surgery.

 The study is intended to support a target indication statement of: "E-101 Solution is indicated for the prophylaxis of incisional surgical site infections following elective colorectal surgery".

 E-101 Solution is comprised of the active ingredients of glucose oxidase (GO) and porcine myeloperoxidase (pMPO) that produce coupled reactions after the addition of glucose substrate.

 The hypothesis is that E-101 Solution topically applied directly into the principal incision is safe and significantly reduces the incidence of incisional SSI compared to placebo topical application.

 (The principal surgical incision is 5cm and < 35 cm used as a hand port, colorectal specimen extraction port, or extracorporeal manipulation port depending on the specific colorectal surgical approach.
