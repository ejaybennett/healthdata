(secondQuint)Project PARIS: Parents and Residents in Session.

 A specific patient and family centered care module will be implemented in the context of an existing training rotation.

 This module includes a meeting between resident physicians (trainees) and parents of previously hospitalized children (members of the Family Faculty in our institution), monitored by a senior faculty member.

 Patient and family centered care will be discussed using predefined, manual-driven guidance.

 This meeting is followed by a discussion with the faculty member to identify core components of family-centered care as exemplified in the parent interview.

 Project PARIS: Parents and Residents in Session@highlight

The study seeks to implement and test a novel approach to teach pediatric residents about patient and family-centered care (PFCC).

 The approach calls for a supervised meeting between a family member of a previously hospitalized child and a resident in the context of a pediatric residency rotation.
