(firstQuint)Screening for Liver Fibrosis by Using Non-invasive Methods in Patients With Diabetes.

 A Prospective Study.

 Patients with diabetes are at risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) leading to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.

 However, liver fibrosis screening in this large population needs non-invasive methods.

 Recently, FibroScan was shown to be a good method for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD patients.

 We examined the efficacy of a screening strategy with a noninvasive fibrosis biomarker (FibroTest) and transient elastography (FibroScan) in patients with diabetes.
