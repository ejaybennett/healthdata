(thirdQuint)TAP Block: Does Volume Make a Difference?.

 Pain from a surgical incision happens in most patients.

 During the perioperative period, the use of the TAP block has been shown to reduce pain scores, opioid consumption and sedation scores.

 Also, there is a trend towards a reduction of post-operative nausea and vomiting.

 The aim of the block is to reach the distal nerve endings of the abdominal wall from T6 to L1 dermatomes using ultrasound guidance with a single shot of ropivacaine at different volumes.

 Currently, there is consensus about optimal procedure-specific volumes and local anesthetic concentrations for lumbar TAP blocks.

 This is a pilot study and the purpose being is it feasible to do a large scale clinical study to determine the influence of increasing the local anesthetic volume.

 TAP Block: Does Volume Make a Difference?@highlight

Patients who have abdominal surgery will experience pain from the incision.

 The lumbar TAP block is a procedure used to reach the nerve endings in the abdominal wall so that there is a reduction in pain after surgery.

 Using ultrasound guidance, a solution of ropivacaine will be injected after surgery.

 The aim of this study is to determine the effect of changes in the volume of the injection.
