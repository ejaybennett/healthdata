(fifthQuint)Efficacy Study of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Children and Adolescents With Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder.

 The syndrome of ADHD affects 5-6% of the children and adolescents worldwide.

 The hallmarks are inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity.

 Due to parent's fear of significant adverse effects caused by stimulant or non-stimulant therapy a high degree of children with ADHD remains untreated.

 Recent observational studies showed that ADHD is often associated with decreased nutritional status of certain PUFAs, zinc and magnesium which might be due to metabolic disturbances in the case of fatty acids.

 First interventional studies revealed that a supplementation of these nutrients may affect ADHD-related disorders and might improve certain clinical parameters, such as concentration.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a nutritional supplement or placebo once a day for the duration of 84 days.

 Participants will come in for the assessment of ADHD symptoms, compliance and the assessment of secondary outcome variables.

 Side effects will be monitored continuously and also assessed by rating scales.

 Efficacy Study of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Children and Adolescents With Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder@highlight

This study will determine the nutritional efficacy of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) in combination with zinc and magnesium, in children and adolescents diagnosed with Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

 The nutritional efficacy has to be proven in agreement with the German "Verordnung uber Diatetische Lebensmittel (DiatV)" and the corresponding European Directive 1999/21/EC.

 This objective is reached by performing a placebo-controlled supplementation study with a main efficacy criterion which is also being used in pivotal studies of stimulant and non-stimulant drugs, i.
