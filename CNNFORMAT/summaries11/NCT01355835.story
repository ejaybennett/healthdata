(fifthQuint)Combined STN/SNr-DBS for the Treatment of Refractory Gait Disorders in Parkinson's Disease.

 A composite 'axial score' including the major clinical and anamnestic items on gait, posture and balance function from UPDRSII (items 13-15) and UPDRS III (items 27-31) constitutes the primary outcome measure.

 Secondary outcome measures include specified clinical and anamnestic assessments on freezing of gait, balance, quality of life, non-motor symptoms, impulsivity, impulse control and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

 The aim of the present trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of combined stimulation on subthalamic and nigral electrode contacts [STN+SNr] in refractory hypokinetic gait disturbances compared with [STNmono] (active comparator).

 The results will clarify, whether the combined [STN+SNr] stimulation improves otherwise refractory gait disturbances in PD.

 Combined STN/SNr-DBS for the Treatment of Refractory Gait Disorders in Parkinson's Disease@highlight

12 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and refractory gait disturbances under best individual subthalamic nucleus stimulation and dopaminergic medication will be included into this randomised double-blind cross-over two-armed clinical trial.

 The treatment consists of two different stimulation settings using (i) conventional stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus [STNmono] and (ii) combined stimulation of distant electrode contacts located in the subthalamic nucleus and caudal border zone of STN and substantia nigra pars reticulata [STN+SNr].
