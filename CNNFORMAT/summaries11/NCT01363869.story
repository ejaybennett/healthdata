(secondQuint)Effects of Green Tea on Level of Serum Uric Acid in Healthy Individuals.

 Elevated serum uric acid is related to the risk of development of gout, the most common inflammatory arthritis in men.

 Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is one of the uric-lowering agents commonly used in patients suffering from recurrent and chronic gout.

 Nevertheless, its use is limited by adverse effects and serious allergic reaction in some patients.

 Green tea is one of the most frequently consumed beverages, particularly in Japan.

 Green tea contains high level of catechins, in which Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant compound among other types of catechins.

 Antioxidant effect contributes to various potential health benefits of green tea.

 Several in-vitro studies have found that green tea inhibits xanthine oxidase activity and subsequently decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) and uric acid production.

 We therefore would like to investigate the hypouricemic effects of green tea.

 The study consists of three periods with a total duration of four weeks.

 The first week is the control period.

 The following two weeks is the interventional period and the last week is the follow up period.

 Thirty healthy participants will be randomly assigned into three experimental groups, receiving 2 gm/day, 4 gm/day and 6 gm/day (in capsule, two times after meal) of green tea extract during interventional period.

 Blood and urine samples will be taken at the beginning and at the end of each study period.

 Effects of Green Tea on Level of Serum Uric Acid in Healthy Individuals@highlight

Green tea has been extensively investigated for several potential health benefits.

 Previous studies have suggested that green tea may lower serum uric acid level in human.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate uric-lowering properties of green tea in healthy individuals.
