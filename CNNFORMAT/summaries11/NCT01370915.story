(fifthQuint)Perioperative Administration of Pregabalin for Pain After Septoplasty.

 Pregabalin is used for the treatment of neuropathic pain and has shown analgesic efficacy in postoperative pain.

 The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin for reducing postoperative pain in patients after septoplasty.

 Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups to receive either pregabalin (Lyrica(R), Pfizer, Inc.

) or placebo (vitamin complex).

 According to their assigned study group, patients received either pregabalin (75 mg) or placebo twice, one hour before surgery and 12 hours after the initial dose.

 The assessment of pain and side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, headache, dizziness, sedation, and blurred vision, were made at one, six, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively.
