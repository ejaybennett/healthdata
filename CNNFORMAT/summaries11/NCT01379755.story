(firstQuint)Comparison of Stability and Outcomes in Single-radius Femoral Component for Total Knee Arthroplasty.

 Recently, femoral designs based on a sagittal single radius were designed to allow better mid-flexion stability and extensor function after total knee arthroplasty.

 The purpose of this study was to compare mid-flexion stability and clinical outcomes in patients that received TKA using either a single-radius femoral design or multi-radius femoral design.
