(firstQuint)Blood Pressure Lowering Effect of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation.

 Hypertension is a major risk factor for development of several vascular complications and is common world wide.

 Drug treatment is often necessary to achieve adequate blood pressure reduction but blood pressure control in studied countries is unsatisfactory low.

 Reasons for failure in treatment are several.

 Among others reasons intolerable side-effects may prevent successful treatment irrespective of the number of drugs.

 Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) constitutes no risk of interaction with pharmacological agents and previous studies have reported blood pressure reduction.
