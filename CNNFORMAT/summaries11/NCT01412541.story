(secondQuint)Moxy Drug Coated Balloon vs.

 Standard Balloon Angioplasty for the Treatment of Femoropopliteal Arteries.

 The Moxy Drug Coated Balloon is indicated for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of obstructive de novo or non-stented restenotic lesions in native femoropopliteal arteries up to 15 cm in length and 4.

0 to 6.

0 mm in diameter.

 This study will randomize approximately 476 patients who will receive either the Moxy balloon or standard balloon angioplasty at 55 global investigational sites.

 Subjects will be blinded to treatment until 12 months and will participate in long term follow-up for 5 years.
