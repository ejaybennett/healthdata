(fifthQuint)Cardiovascular Function in Adult Survivors of Childhood Malignancies.

 Incorporation of anthracyclines into chemotherapy protocols has improved the survival of children with solid tumours and haematological malignancies.

 Nonetheless, longitudinal studies have implicated the absence of a safe anthracycline dose that is free of cardiotoxicity.

 Substantial risk for cardiovascular disease has been shown recently in large cohorts of adult survivors of childhood and adolescent survivors.

 Serial monitoring of cardiac function is hence of paramount importance in childhood cancer survivors for early detection of myocardial damage and timely institution of interventions.

 The optimal monitoring of cardiac function in the long term in these at-risk patients remains to be established.

 Novel noninvasive imaging modalities including echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance allow interrogation of myocardial deformation and fibrosis, while circulating biomarkers are increasingly used to monitor the cardiac status in heart failure patients.

 Additionally, genetics of heart failure are increasingly unveiled.

 Cardiovascular Function in Adult Survivors of Childhood Malignancies@highlight

Anthracyclines have been used commonly to treat children with solid tumours and haematological malignancies and have led to their increased survival.

 Nonetheless, anthracycline has the side effect of cardiotoxicity.

 The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of anthracycline therapy on heart deformation and fibrosis, heart-vessel interaction, usefulness of circulating biomarkers in the assessment of heart function and potential genetic predisposition to heart failure in adult survivors of childhood cancers.
