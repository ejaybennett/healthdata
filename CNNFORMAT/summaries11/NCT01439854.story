(thirdQuint)Study of Dapagliflozin on Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Impaired Insulin Signaling/Action.

 "Glucotoxicity" has been implicated as a cause of insulin resistance and impaired beta cell function in T2DM.

 Abundant support for the glucotoxicity hypothesis has been provided by in vivo and in vitro studies in animals, but a rigorous test of this hypothesis in man is lacking.

 The investigators propose to test the glucotoxicity hypothesis by chronically reducing the plasma glucose in type 2 diabetic subjects (T2DM) with an inhibitor of renal glucose transport, dapaglifozin, and examining the effect of restoration of normoglycemia on mitochondrial function and insulin signaling/sensitivity.

 Lastly, the investigators will test the "glucolipotoxicity" hypothesis, which states that the toxic effects of elevated plasma FFA on insulin sensitive tissues (i.

e.

, muscle) are magnified in the presence of concurrent hyperglycemia.

 Thus, high glucose levels increase malonyl CoA, which inhibits CPT I, leading to accumulation of FACoA/DAG, which impair mitochondrial function and inhibit insulin action.

 Study of Dapagliflozin on Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Impaired Insulin Signaling/Action@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of the chronic treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with dapagliflozin on: (1) mitochondrial gene function/expression and insulin signaling/action and (2) oral glucose tolerance and beta cell function.

 Dapagliflozin is a potent, highly specific inhibitor of renal glucose transport [SGLT2].
