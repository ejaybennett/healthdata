(firstQuint)Pilot Study of Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) to Treat Metastatic Liver Cancer & Cholangiocarcinoma.

 Single-arm pilot clinical trial.

 Patients will be subjected to irreversible electroporation (IRE) as the sole treatment of nodules not considered treatable by resection or thermal ablation.

 This pilot study was designed to study the feasibility and safety of treatment as an alternative therapeutic IRE in the treatment of neoplastic nodules in the liver, with particular reference to metastatic liver cancer and cholangiocarcinoma, where the current therapeutic arsenal is inadequate or counter-indicated.

 To perform the IRE procedure the IRE NanoKnife cent System (AngioDynamics) will be used.
