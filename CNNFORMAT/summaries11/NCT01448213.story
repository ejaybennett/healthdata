(secondQuint)Comparison of Two Steroid Regimens to Prevent Transplant Rejection After Corneal Transplant (DMEK).

 Graft rejection is one of the leading causes of cornea transplant failure.

 To help prevent rejection, corticosteroid eye drops are used after transplant surgery.

 The steroid eye drop dosing regimen varies from surgeon to surgeon, because no studies have been done to determine the optimum dosing regimen.

 Comparison of Two Steroid Regimens to Prevent Transplant Rejection After Corneal Transplant (DMEK)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare two different commonly used steroid dosing regimens after Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) transplant surgery.

 The investigators hope to determine if one is more effective at preventing rejection or if both are equally effective.
