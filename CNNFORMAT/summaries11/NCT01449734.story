(thirdQuint)Family Satisfaction (FS) in the Intensive Care Unit.

 Family members who visit patients on the ICU (intensive care unit) are not just onlookers.

 They experience the process of care along with their loved ones.

 Increasingly, the satisfaction of family members with ICU care, decision-making and information, and their empowerment to contribute towards patient care as near relatives, is being perceived as an important aspect of the general quality of ICU care.

 Family satisfaction is assessed using the 34-item FS-ICU questionnaire which was recently validated for German-speaking participants.

 The aim of this pilot survey is to identify opportunities for improvement of family satisfaction.

 The investigators therefore want to assess family satisfaction using a questionnaire that was specially developed for this setting and recently validated for German-speaking participants.
