(secondQuint)R230C and C230C Variants of ABCA1 and Glyburide Response.

 Specific objectives: 1.

 In patients with type 2 diabetes stratified by the existence of the risk alleles (R230C/C230C) or the wild variant (R230R) of ABC-A1, compare the changes resulting from the treatment with glibenclamide on following continuous variables: - Fasting glucose - Percentage reduction - Hemoglobin A1c, - Cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol - Weight 2.

 In patients with type 2 diabetes stratified by the existence of the risk alleles (R230C/C230C) or the wild variant (R230R) of ABC-A1, compare the changes resulting from the treatment with glibenclamide on following binomial variables: - Number of cases that reach fasting plasma glucose lower than 110 mg/dl - Number of cases that reach an HbA1c less than 7%.

 R230C and C230C Variants of ABCA1 and Glyburide Response@highlight

The objective of the study is to know if the R230C and C230C variants of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene are associated with a smaller glucose lowering effect compared to the wild type allele (R230R) in patients with type 2 diabetes.
