(firstQuint)Virtual Integrated Environment in Decreasing Phantom Limb Pain.

 Nearly all traumatic limb amputees will experience cognizance of a phantom limb and perceive a vivid impression that their lost limb is not only fully present, but also painful.

 The John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Virtual Integration Environment (VIE) is a highly flexible and adaptable virtual reality system that allows patients to observe movement of a 3D virtual arm.

 Using the VIE, recorded signals from the residual limb will be correlated to the desired motion of the phantom limb.

 We hope to correlate the consistency of these patterns with PLP to determine if increased control of the phantom limb leads to decreased PLP.

The purpose of this study is to determine if observing a virtual arm decreases phantom limb pain (PLP) in upper extremity amputees.
