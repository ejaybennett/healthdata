(firstQuint)Effect and Cost Evaluation of a Multifaceted Approach With a Patient-centredness Questionnaire in Fertility Care.

 Besides traditional outcomes as (cost)-effectiveness and safety, the Institute of Medicine calls patient-centredness as an independent outcome indicator to evaluate quality of healthcare.

 Nevertheless, within fertility care there is great variation in the delivery of patient-centred care and room for improvement.

 The effects of a multifaceted approach on patient centredness and quality of life will be determined by a baseline and after measurement.

 Three questionnaires will be used to measure patient centredness (Patient Centredness Questionnaire-Infertility), Quality of Life (FertiQoL) and risk factors of emotional maladjustment(SCREENIVF).

 The multifaceted approach consists of: 1)audit and feedback, 2) educational outreach visits, and 3) patient-mediated interventions.

 During one year the multifaceted approach is performed followed by an after measurement with the same questionnaires.

 The effects and costs of the multifaceted approach will be determined.

 Process evaluation will be performed to investigate feasibility and to study wether and to what extend patients and professionals used and appreciated the elements of the multifaceted approach.
