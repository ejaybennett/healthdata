(thirdQuint)Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer Treated on ECOG-E1395 and ECOG-E3301.

 OBJECTIVES: - To investigate the association between biomarkers (HPV tumor status and ERCC1 expression) and clinical outcomes in a population of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer.

 - To develop the ability to select patients likely to respond to therapy and to avoid treatment with ineffective therapies, especially since these therapies have substantial toxicity.

 - To estimate response and survival rates of HPV-negative and -positive patients in each study.

 (exploratory) OUTLINE: Tumor HPV status is determined by in situ hybridization (ISH) and all samples also undergo immunostaining for p16.

 ERCC1 expression is evaluated with AQUA, a quantitative IHC analysis.

 Samples are classified into two categories based on their biomarker status: HPV tumor status (negative versus positive), and ERCC1 expression level (low versus high).

RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

 PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer treated on ECOG-E1395 and ECOG-E3301.
