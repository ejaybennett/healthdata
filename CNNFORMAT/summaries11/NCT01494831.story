(secondQuint)Randomized Control Trial of Group Intervention With Former War-affected Boys in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

 To the best of the author's knowledge this is the first group-based mental health or psychosocial intervention developed specifically for psychologically distressed former child soldiers.

 While CBT is the modality with most empirical evidence for treating war-affected young people, this is the first evaluation with child soldiers specifically.

 Former child soldiers and war affected 'street boys' (aged 13-17) in eastern DRC, will be screened for symptoms of psychological distress and then randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a waiting-list control.

 The treatment groups will receive a 15-session manualised, culturally-adapted, TF-CBT intervention.

 This includes psycho-education, relaxation, affect modulation, cognitive processing and constructing a trauma narrative.

 After treatment and post-testing, the waiting-list controls then begin their intervention.
