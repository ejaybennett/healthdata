(thirdQuint)Clinical Trial With Vinflunine as Maintenance Therapy in Metastatic Urothelial Cancer.

 Vinflunine is a drug recently approved in Europe for the treatment of advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer after platinum-failure.

 It has proved to improve the survival results compared with the best suportive care.

 In adition, the tolerability was favourable, specially for not leading appearance of neuropathy nor other cumulative toxic effects.

 In this study, it is proposed to test the feasibility, in terms of tolerability and efficacy of monotherapy with vinflunine in patients who, after completing the first-line cisplatin-based treatment for Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Urothelial Tract (CCTU), have reached a stabilization or objective response.

 In order to have an adequate control group in the proposed design will be a phase II trial in which one group will receive standard management (follow-up until progression disease).
