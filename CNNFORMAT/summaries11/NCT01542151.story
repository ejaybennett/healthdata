(thirdQuint)Effects of Sleep, Fatigue, and Timing of Post-dates Inductions Among Nulliparas.

 Randomized clinical trial of first-time pregnant women requiring post-dates induction (induction after 40 weeks gestation).

 Women will be randomized to a labor induction time in the morning or the evening.

 On hospital admission once women have signed the study consent, they will complete sleep questionnaires and a fatigue assessment.

 Fatigue and sleep time assessments will subsequently done by the study subject every 4 hours until women enter active labor.

 At the onset of active labor, assessments will stop.

 Labor outcomes and patient satisfaction will be obtained once women deliver.

 Effects of Sleep, Fatigue, and Timing of Post-dates Inductions Among Nulliparas@highlight

This randomized clinical trial will examine if there are any differences between post-dates inductions (inductions after 40 weeks of pregnancy) begun in the morning compared to the evening for first-time mothers.

 Sleep and fatigue measures will be measured to see if they differ by time of induction.

 Other measures will include the rate of births within 24 hours of admission, length of labor, use of labor analgesics, and method of delivery.
