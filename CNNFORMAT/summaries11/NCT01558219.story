(thirdQuint)Second-line Chemotherapy in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.

 The objective of this study is to explore new, biweekly schedule of cabazitaxel in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients.

 A previous study has shown that the biweekly administration of docetaxel in 1st line setting of mCRPC is better tolerated than docetaxel administered every three weeks.

 Also, the efficacy of biweekly docetaxel was better than three-weekly docetaxel and biweekly dosing presented a significant overall survival benefit (ASCO 2011, Kellokumpu-Lehtinen et al.

 As the occurrence of neutropenia in the TROPIC trial was rather high, the hypothesis is to reduce the incidence of severe adverse events by administrating cabazitaxel more frequently, yet maintaining the same dose intensity as in every three weeks dosing schedule.

 This study is designed to evaluate the safety of biweekly cabazitaxel for the treatment of 60 patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients previously treated with docetaxel containing regimen.
