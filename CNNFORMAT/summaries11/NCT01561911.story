(secondQuint)A Phase I Study of the Chimeric Anti-CD40 Monoclonal Antibody ChiLob 7/4 to Treat Advanced Malignancies Refractory to Conventional Anti-cancer Treatment.

 The primary objective of the study is to establish the safety and maximum tolerated dose of Chi Lob 7/4.

 In line with other established antineoplastic, chimeric monoclonal antibody therapies such as Rituximab, Chi Lob 7/4 will be given by slow intravenous infusion once every week for a total of four weeks.

 This treatment regimen will facilitate early, rapid and dose dense administration of antibody to a patient group with advanced malignancy refractory to conventional treatment.

 The starting dose for each infusion of Chi Lob 7/4 will be 0.

5mg (giving a total dose per patient of 2mg divided over 4 weeks).

 Escalation from one treatment dose level to another will only be permitted when at least 3 patients have completed treatment without dose limiting toxicity.
