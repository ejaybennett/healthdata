(fifthQuint)Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Antiviral Activity of ABT-267 in HCV Infected Subjects.

 An open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of ABT-267 as monotherapy for 2 days, followed by ABT-267, ABT-450 with ritonavir (ABT-450/r) and ABT-333 plus ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy for 12 weeks in treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of multiple, ascending doses of ABT-267 (also known as ombitasvir) administered as two-day monotherapy followed by ABT-267 in combination therapy with other direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) ABT-450 with ritonavir (ABT-450/r) and ABT-333 (also known as dasabuvir) plus ribavirin (RBV) in patients with chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis.
