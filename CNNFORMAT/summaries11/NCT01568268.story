(firstQuint)Therapeutic Efficacy and Safety of Palonosetron in Treatment of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting.

 Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a frequent complication of surgery, which can produce subject discomfort with medical and economic consequences.

 This study was designed to evaluate the treatment efficacy and safety of palonosetron for the subjects who undergo gynecologic or simple laparoscopic surgery.

 As the previous studies of palonosetron evaluated only the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), there was no evidence-based guideline of palonosetron for treatment of PONV.

 The aim of the present study is to evaluate the treatment efficacy and safety of palonosetron for the patients who undergo laparoscopic gynecologic, abdominal or other surgery under general anesthesia.
