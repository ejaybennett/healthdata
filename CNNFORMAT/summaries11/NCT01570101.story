(firstQuint)European Sapheon Closure System Observational ProspectivE (eSCOPE) Study.

 This is a post market, observational study of closure of the great saphenous vein "GSV".

 Efficacy and safety (adverse events) will be compared to appropriate literature reports to determine if the results of the treatment of reflux disease with the Sapheon Closure System are consistent with or better than the expectations of the medical community for alternative treatments, specifically Laser Thermal Ablation and Radiofrequency Ablation.

 Additional comparison points may include measurements of pain and/or length of time to return to work.
