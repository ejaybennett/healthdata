(secondQuint)Bananas as an Energy Source During Exercise: a Metabolomics Approach.

 Trained cyclists (N=14) completed two 75-km cycling time trials (randomized, crossover) while ingesting BAN or CHO (0.

2 g/kg carbohydrate every 15 min).

 Pre-, post-, and 1-h-post-exercise blood samples were analyzed for glucose, granulocyte (GR) and monocyte (MO) phagocytosis (PHAG) and oxidative burst activity, nine cytokines, F2-isoprostanes, ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), and metabolic profiles using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

 Bananas as an Energy Source During Exercise: a Metabolomics Approach@highlight

This study compared the acute effect of ingesting bananas (BAN) versus a 6% carbohydrate drink (CHO) on 75-km cycling performance and post-exercise inflammation, oxidative stress, and innate immune function using traditional and metabolomics-based profiling.
