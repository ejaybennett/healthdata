(secondQuint)Desmopressin for Improving Nocturnal Enuresis in Patients After Radical Cystectomy With Bladder Reconstruction.

 We will prospectively assess the utilization of Desmopressin in improving nocturnal enuresis in patients after radical cystectomy with orthotopic bladder reconstruction.

 Patients after radical cystectomy with neobladder reconstruction will be given Desmopressin 0.

1 mg once a day for a duration of one month.

 Before beginning treatment patients will be given the NNES-Q questionnaire to assess severity of nocturnal enuresis.

 At the end of treatment, the same questionnaire will be given to all patients to assess if nocturnal enuresis improved.

 Sodium levels will be tested before treatment, 2 weeks after beginning treatment and at the end of treatment.
