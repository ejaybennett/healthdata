(firstQuint)Nicotine Related Brain Activity: The Influence of Smoking History and Blood Nicotine Levels.

 phMRI was used to evaluate brain activity in response to 1.

5 mg/70 kg intravenous nicotine or saline.

 The nicotine and saline were administered on different visits.

 The time courses of individual subjects' nicotine levels were used as regressors to assess neural activity relating to the infusions.

 The influence of Smoking history and physiological measures on the response to nicotine were also investigated.
