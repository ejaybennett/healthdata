(fifthQuint)Phase II Dose-ranging Study of Pyronaridine/Artesunate in Adults Patients With Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria.

 The study is designed as a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, parallel group,dose-finding study of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a three day regimen of the combination of pyronaridine/artesunate in the ratio 3:1.

 Pharmacokinetics of pyronaridine will be estimated in a separate sub-study.

 Patients will be recruited from between 5 to 7 study sites and will be randomised to one of 3 treatment groups: Group A: pyronaridine+artesunate PA (PP 6 mg/kg + AS 2 mg/kg) Group B: pyronaridine+artesunate PA (PP 9 mg/kg + AS 3 mg/kg) Group C: pyronaridine+artesunate PA (PP 12 mg/kg + AS 4 mg/kg) Randomisation is planned to be balanced within each study site across all 3 study groups in pre-assigned treatment blocks.

 Patients who withdraw early for any reason will not be replaced.

 Patients will ideally be hospitalised for at least 4 days and will be required to remain in the vicinity of the trial site for a minimum of 7 days from start of treatment, or when fever and parasite has been cleared: 2 negative readings (fever and/or slide) taken 8 hours apart plus another negative (fever and/or slide) 24 hours later.

 The patient is to return to the study site, or to make themselves available, for all scheduled weekly follow up visits until discharge at Day 42.

 Patients will remain in the study for 42 days following first dosing (D0).

 In the case of adverse events reported and unresolved at visit Day 42, patients will be followed up for a further 30 days, or until resolution of event.

 Phase II Dose-ranging Study of Pyronaridine/Artesunate in Adults Patients With Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria@highlight

This is a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, parallel group, dose-finding study of the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a three day regimen of the combination of pyronaridine/artesunate in the ratio 3:1.

 The primary trial objective is to determine the clinical effective dose of orally administered pyronaridine/artesunate (3:1 weight/weight) ratio in the treatment of patients with acute uncomplicated P.

 falciparum malaria using the PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at Day 28 as primary endpoint.

 Secondary trial objectives are to determine the safety of once daily dosing for three (3) days of pyronaridine+artesunate (3:1) combination in male and female patients with uncomplicated P.

 falciparum malaria and to explore possible ethnic differences in safety or efficacy in the two regions: South East Asia and Africa
