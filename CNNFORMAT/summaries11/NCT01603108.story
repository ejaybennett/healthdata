(fifthQuint)Rifaximin to Prevent Recurrent HCV-Related Fibrosis After Liver Transplant.

 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common chronic liver infection and remains the leading indication for liver transplantation (LT).

 Although LT is a cure for cirrhosis of the liver, it does not always cure HCV infection or reinfection of post-transplanted liver.

 Post-LT recurrent HCV can lead to accelerated liver fibrosis.

 Chronic exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gut-derived bacteria has shown to be at elevated levels in patients with cirrhosis due to HCV compared to normal controls.

 Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that LPS contributes to cause of liver fibrosis, specifically in patients with post-LT recurrent HCV, and this effect maybe modified with the poorly absorbed antibiotic, rifaximin, which alter the gut flora of the patients.

The purpose of this study is to determine if the administration of a poorly-absorbable antibiotic (rifaximin) for the first three months after liver transplant will reduce the amount of fibrosis (or scarring of the liver) in liver transplant patients with recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) by lowering serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a protein in blood that comes from the bacteria in intestines and may cause scarring in the liver.

 Approximately 60 subjects will participate in this study.

 Subjects will be part of the study for approximately 1 year post transplant.
