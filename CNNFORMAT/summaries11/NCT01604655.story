(firstQuint)ProspEctive First Evaluation in Chest Pain Trial.

 Currently, physicians can either choose a stress test or a CT scan of the heart to evaluate patients admitted with with chest pain.

 Very little is known about which test provides the best information to physicians, positively impacts patients medical care, and decreases future hospital admissions and testing.

 To study this the investigators are randomizing patients admitted to our hospital with chest pain to a stress test or coronary CT angiography.

 The investigators will then follow these patients for a 2 year period.
