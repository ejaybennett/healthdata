(firstQuint)Wet Macular Degeneration Study to Compare Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab to Aflibercept.

 The purpose of this study is to examine the use of Aflibercept in patients who have been previously treated with Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab for exudative macular degeneration.

 Specifically, we will examine its effect on macular degeneration, measured by SDOCT (Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography) and ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) visual acuity.

 This will be a prospective study with patients to receive an intravitreal injection of Aflibercept at the time of treatment.
