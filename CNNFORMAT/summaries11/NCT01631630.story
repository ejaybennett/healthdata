(fifthQuint)Role of Proinflammatory Signaling in Alcohol Craving.

 Objective: The objective of the present study is to evaluate the role of proinflammatory signaling in alcohol craving.

 The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y (PPARy) agonist pioglitazone, which modulates glial activity, will be used as an experimental treatment.

 Guided imagery auditory scripts will be used as an established set of stimuli to induce craving.

 Low dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration which activates proinflammatory signaling will be used as a novel challenge, and evaluated for its ability to provoke alcohol craving.

 If LPS in fact induces alcohol craving, the present design will allow evaluation of whether pioglitazone can inhibit this response.

 Study population: Up to 60 subjects will be recruited for a target accrual of 50 completers.

 Subjects will be aged 21-65 years, with alcohol dependence as their primary complaint, and without other serious medical or psychiatric conditions.

 They will be admitted to the NIAAA research inpatient unit at the NIH Clinical Research Center (CRC) through one of the screening protocols (05-AA-0121 Assessment and Treatment of People with Alcohol Drinking Problems ) or 14-AA-0181 "Unit and Clinic Evaluations, Screening, Assessment, and Management") which provides basic assessments and standard withdrawal treatment if needed.

 Design: Following inclusion, subjects will undergo interviews for construction of guided imagery scripts, and these scripts will subsequently be used as stress-, alcohol- or neutral condition associated stimuli.

 Subjects will be randomized to pioglitazone (n=25; final dose: 45mg/daily) or identically looking placebo (n=25).

 Following at least two weeks of treatment, subjects will undergo three sessions of guided imagery, on separate days and in a counter-balanced order, exposing them to the personalized stress-, alcohol- or neutral condition associated auditory scripts, respectively.

 During the final week, subjects will undergo two challenge sessions, a minimum of five days apart, with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or placebo, in counterbalanced order.

 Outcome measures: Subjective ratings of mood, anxiety and craving will be obtained twice weekly throughout the study.

 During the challenge sessions that utilize psychological stimuli or LPS, subjective ratings of craving for alcohol, as well as ratings of negative emotions will be obtained.

 Lumbar puncture will be performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained to determine the effect of pioglitazone on levels of proinflammatory cytokines.

 Neuroendocrine, psychological and physiological measures will be collected for exploratory purposes.

 An fMRI scan will be obtained to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone on BOLD signal in response to emotionally salient visual cues.

 Role of Proinflammatory Signaling in Alcohol Craving@highlight

Background: - Drinking too much alcohol can injure cells in the body.

 Inflammation is the body s reaction to injured cells.

 Studies show that inflammation can cause cravings for alcohol.

 Researchers want to see if pioglitazone, a drug that decreases inflammation, can reduce alcohol craving.

 If so, it might help develop new ways to help alcoholics with craving.

 Objectives: - To see if pioglitazone can reduce alcohol craving.

 Eligibility: - Adults between 21 and 65 years of age who are alcoholic and have been drinking within the past month.

 Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

 Blood samples will also be collected.

 - All participants will have inpatient treatment at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center for the 5 weeks of the study.

 They will have standard treatment for alcoholism during their inpatient stay.

 - Half of the people in this study will have pioglitazone.

 The other half will have a placebo.

 - Participants will have different studies during their stay.

 These studies will include the following: - Personalized audio recordings of stressful, alcohol-related, and neutral events to monitor mood - Imaging studies to test alcohol cravings - Questionnaires about mood and alcohol cravings - Lumbar puncture to collect spinal fluid - Inflammation test to see if the study drug can block alcohol cravings - After the end of the 5-week study, all participants will be offered follow-up outpatient care through the Clinical Center, or referral to outside treatment.
