(secondQuint)High-Dose Stereotactic Radiation for Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess treatment related gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity for patients who undergo SBRT for localized prostate cancer.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Follow quality of life after SBRT using Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) and American Urological Association (AUA) scores.

 II.

 Assess biochemical control after high-dose SBRT.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo 5 fractions of prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy over 10-12 days with at least 40 hours between each fraction in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1.

5, 4, 8, and 12 months, every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually thereafter.

 High-Dose Stereotactic Radiation for Prostate Cancer@highlight

This clinical trial studies high-dose stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in treating patients with low-, intermediate-, or high-risk localized prostate cancer.

 SBRT may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue
