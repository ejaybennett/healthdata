(secondQuint)Efficiency of XELOX Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Gastric Cancer.

 The patients of gastric cancer have been divided into two parts in random.

The test group receive perioperative chemotherapy (XELOX) six cycles and the control group administrate the same program after operation.

 The two groups have the same staging and eligibility criteria.

The 3 year disease-free survival (DFS) rate and 5 year overall survival (OS) rate maybe the last evaluation standard.

 Efficiency of XELOX Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Gastric Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that capecitabine/oxaliplatin as perioperative chemotherapy is superior or not to operation directly for locally advanced gastric cancer in terms of 3 year disease-free survival (DFS) rate.
