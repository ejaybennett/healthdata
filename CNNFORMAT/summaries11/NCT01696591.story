(fifthQuint)The Long-Term Safety and Efficacy Follow-Up Study of Subjects Who Completed the Phase I Clinical Trial of Neurostem-AD.

 This is a long-term follow up study of the earlier part of the phase I, during which the safe and effective dose(safety) of NEUROSTEM(R)-AD was determined for implantation into the brains of subjects with Dementia of the Alzheimer's type.

 Subjects with Dementia of the Alzheimer's type, who signed the informed consent form and meet the eligibility criteria, were implanted with a single dose of NEUROSTEM(R)-AD, hUBC-MSCs, into the brain.

 The subjects were hospitalized for 5 to 10 days following the surgical implantation and were observed for acute adverse events: Gradient echo MRI within the the 24 hours post-op, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, chest x-rays within Day 2.

 On Day 14, DLT was assessed, and the subjects were followed up on the safety and disease progression of dementia (of the Alzheimer's type) for 12 weeks post-implantation.

 In this part of the study, the subjects described above will be followed-up for upto Month 24, and 3 additional subjects with comparable demographics and disease characteristics as the treatment group (refer to Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria) will be enrolled as a control group, followed up for 3 months and compared with the treatment group for various indicators of the disease progression.

 The Long-Term Safety and Efficacy Follow-Up Study of Subjects Who Completed the Phase I Clinical Trial of Neurostem-AD@highlight

The purpose of the study is to determine the long-term safety and exploratory efficacy of NEUROSTEM(R)-AD, administered via an open brain surgery to subjects with dementia of the Alzheimer's type, who were eligible for and enrolled in the earlier part of the phase I.

 Aside from the subjects who completed the earlier part of the Phase I, 3 additional subjects with comparable demographics and disease characteristics as the treatment group will be enrolled into a control group, followed-up for 3 months, and compared for various disease progression indicators with the treatment group.

 The hypothesis is that NEUROSTEM(R)-AD is safe and effective in the treatment of dementia of the Alzheimer's type.
