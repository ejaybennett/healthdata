(thirdQuint)Fox Investigation for New Discovery of Biomarkers.

 BioFIND is a two-year observational clinical study designed to discover and verify biomarkers of Parkinson's disease (PD).

 BioFIND is collecting clinical data and biospecimens, including blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in a population of 120 well-defined, moderately advanced PD subjects and 120 healthy controls.

 BioFIND will follow standardized data acquisition protocols to ensure that tests and assessments conducted at multiple sites can be pooled.

 Data and samples acquired from study participants will enable the development of a comprehensive Parkinson's database and biorepository, which will be available to the scientific community to conduct research on novel PD biomarkers.

 Fox Investigation for New Discovery of Biomarkers@highlight

This is an observational, multi-center study to assess clinical features and biologic biomarkers in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients compared to healthy controls (HC).

 The primary objective of this study is to discover clinical and biologic markers of PD for use in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies.
