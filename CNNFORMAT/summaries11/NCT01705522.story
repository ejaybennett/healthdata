(secondQuint)Multimodal Approach in IBD Patients.

 Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of IBD will be prospectively assessed on a yearly basis in order to assess relapse risk factors.

 Disease activity will be assessed using the Mayo score for UC patients and CDAI for Crohn's disease and endoscopic activity will be assessed using the Mayo endoscopic subscore for UC patients and the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease for CD patients.

 Serum and fecal biomarkers will be obtainted at each study visit (C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin).

 Data about current and past medication for IBD will also be gathered.
