(firstQuint)Effect on Orencia (Abatacept) on the Apoptosis of T Cells, B Cells and APC Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis.

 Orencia may regulate apoptosis and apoptosis related genes in vivo in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patient's cells.

 To date, no studies have been performed to evaluate the effect of Orencia on apoptosis in RA patients.

 Primary: To determine the effect of Abatacept in the apoptosis of T cells, B cells and antigen presenting cells (APC) in RA patients at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.

 Secondary: To evaluate the association between the changes in apoptosis to changes in disease activity measures (DAS28/ESR) over 6 months of treatment with subcutaneous injection of abatacept.

 Effect on Orencia (Abatacept) on the Apoptosis of T Cells, B Cells and APC Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis@highlight

This proposal will test the hypothesis that Orencia affects apoptosis and apoptosis related genes/biomarkers in vivo in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
