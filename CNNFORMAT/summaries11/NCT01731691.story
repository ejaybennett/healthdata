(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy of (1Proteinase Inhibitor, 1PI) in HIV Disease.

 This study protocol is designed to investigate the benefit of a well-tolerated, FDA approved biological product that has been extensively used in a different patient population.

 For more than 20 years, 1proteinase inhibitor (1PI or 1antitrypsin) therapy has been the standard treatment for people with insufficient 1PI blood levels.

 This disorder, also known as 1antitrypsin deficiency, was previously thought to be caused only as an inherited trait due to the gene PIzz.

 Recent evidence shows that it can also be an acquired disease.

 Specifically, individuals with HIV-1 disease have been found to have severely low 1PI blood levels (Bristow et al.

, 2001; Bristow et al.

, 2010; Bristow et al.

, 2012).

 Many people with the inherited version of 1PI deficiency eventually develop emphysema, and among individuals with HIV-1 disease, 90% have acquired 1PI deficiency.

 Whether they go on to develop emphysema is still unresolved.

 HIV-1 infected individuals are the first patient population identified so far in which severe 1PI deficiency is acquired through infection rather than being inherited.

 It was found that a decrease in 1PI blood levels is directly correlated to a decrease in CD4 lymphocytes (Bristow et al.

, 2001; Bristow et al.

, 2012): In a pilot study to determine whether 1PI therapy might benefit the CD4 counts in HIV-1 infected patients (Clinicaltrials.

gov NCT01370018), HIV-1 patients with infection-related 1PI deficiency received weekly 1PI therapy (120mg/kg) for a period of 8 weeks and results were compared with those of patients having the inherited version of 1PI deficiency who were simultaneously receiving weekly 1PI therapy (60mg/kg).

 None of the patients in the study had ever previously received 1PI therapy.

 It was found that CD4 cells rose to normal levels following 2 weeks of intravenous 1PI therapy with no adverse effects observed in the HIV-1 patients (n=3) or the control group of HIV-1 uninfected, 1PI deficiency patients (n=2).

 The new crop of CD4 cells were functional, capable of fighting infection, and appeared to be generated from bone marrow-derived stem cells (Bristow et al.

, 2010).

 As a bonus, it was found in the HIV-1 patients that LDL levels (bad cholesterol) decreased and HDL levels (good cholesterol) increased {Bristow et al.

, in review).

 The information gained from the initial pilot study will be incorporated into this study design to further characterize the mechanism of lymphocyte renewal and to increase the number of patients observed.

 Only minor modifications to the pilot protocol are proposed including the sample size, addition of volunteers not receiving therapy, and a double-blind design: Ten (10) HIV-1 infected patients will be dosed with PROLASTIN(R)-C (Grifols Therapeutics Inc.

), five (5) will be dosed with placebo, and five (5) uninfected volunteers not receiving therapy will be monitored.

 It has been observed that CD4 counts and cholesterol levels are correlated and that there is cyclic variation in individuals with and without HIV.

 To examine whether there are differences due to HIV infection in cyclic variation of CD4 counts, cholesterol levels, and other values monitored during this study, five (5) volunteers, who do not have HIV, will be included in the study for blood collection only.

 In a previous study, we determined that in individuals with abnormally low active 1PI levels, CD4 counts exhibit sinusoidal cycling with 23 day periodicity.

 Wave form appearance of CD4 cells with a peak every 23 days is a pattern that is indicative of adult thymopoiesis.

 We showed that in response to 1PI therapy, HIV infected and uninfected individuals exhibited an increased CD4 counts axis of oscillation, but no change in periodicity.

 In contrast, one uninfected individual who was not receiving therapy, exhibited no change in the axis of oscillation, but periodicity was 27 days.

 Human adult thymopoiesis is not well characterized, and based on these results, we have two hypotheses.

 One hypothesis is that in response to 1PI therapy, thymopoiesis will increase, manifested by an increased axis of oscillation and increased numbers of recent thymic emigrants.

 In the proposed study, we will perform weekly TREC analysis which measures recent thymic emigrants and is definitive for thymopoiesis.

 We will test whether the changes in TREC numbers corresponds with changes in the CD4 counts axis of oscillation in HIV infected individuals receiving 1PI therapy as compared with HIV infected individuals with abnormally low active 1PI levels not on 1PI therapy, and HIV uninfected individuals with normal active 1PI levels not on 1PI therapy.

 The second hypothesis is that in individuals with abnormally low active 1PI levels, the periodicity of CD4 counts is shorter than in individuals with normal active 1PI levels.

 Although we will measure periodicity in only 5 individuals with normal active 1PI levels and 15 with abnormal active 1PI levels, this will allow us to determine whether active 1PI is a linear determinate of periodicity or whether there are other variables that regulate periodicity.

 In an 8-week study, only 2 periods can be observed.

 Thus, following an 8-week regimen of therapy, one study subject may be asked to continue for a second 8-week regimen of therapy to allow the observation of 5 periods.

 In addition to these two primary hypotheses regarding CD4 counts, we have found that HDL and LDL levels are linearly dependent on the balance of active and inactive 1PI levels (manuscript in review).

 This phenomenon is due the transport of HDL and LDL by CD4 cells.

 We found that in HIV infected individuals with abnormally low active 1PI and abnormally high inactive 1PI, HDL and LDL increased or decreased differently from individuals with normal active 1PI.

 Based on these results, our hypothesis is that in HIV infected individuals with abnormally low active 1PI receiving 1PI therapy, LDL levels will decrease and HDL levels will increase as active 1PI levels increase in contrast to HIV uninfected individuals with normal active 1PI levels not on therapy and in contrast to HIV infected individuals with abnormally low active 1PI levels not on therapy.

 Prolastin-C treatment will be given weekly for eight (8) to sixteen (16) weeks by intravenous infusion.

 Blood will be collected immediately prior to each infusion.

 As in the previous study, complete blood count, lymphocyte phenotype, extended lymphocyte phenotype, lymphocyte function; HIV-1 viral load, lipid levels, blood chemistry, and markers of inflammation will be measured.

 The present study will also include measurements for HIV-1 tropism and markers for recent thymic emigrants.

 Safety and Efficacy of (1Proteinase Inhibitor, 1PI) in HIV Disease@highlight

Our primary objective is to further characterize the mechanism by which alpha-1PI regulates CD4 counts.

 HIV-1 infected patients will be initiated on PROLASTIN(R)-C (Alpha-1 Proteinase Inhibitor [Human], Grifols Biotherapeutics Inc.

) or placebo.

 Uninfected volunteers will be untreated and will be monitored for comparison.
