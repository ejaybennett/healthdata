(secondQuint)Glucose Metabolism Disorders and Metabolic Syndrome Before and After Primary Hip and Knee Replacement.

 Glucose metabolism disorders (diabetes and pre-diabetes) and metabolic syndrome are common in joint replacement recipients.

 Improved physical activity following joint replacement could lead to better glucose control in diabetes and ameliorate impaired glucose and cholesterol levels.

 In this study patients previously recruited to "Perioperative Hyperglycaemia in Primary Total Hip and Knee Replacement" study are being followed-up for one year in order to analyze if joint replacements have an effect on these metabolic abnormalities.

 In addition, the effect of glucose metabolism disorders on occurrence of persistent pain after surgery is analyzed.

 Glucose Metabolism Disorders and Metabolic Syndrome Before and After Primary Hip and Knee Replacement@highlight

Osteoarthritis patients undergoing primary hip and knee replacement are followed-up and changes in their glucose metabolism and other metabolic parameters (obesity, cholesterol levels) are examined.

 Persistent postoperative pain is examined as secondary outcome.
