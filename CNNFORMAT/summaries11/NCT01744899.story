(thirdQuint)Soleus H-Reflex in Different Sitting Postures.

 Participants were assigned to two groups (prolonged sitting group and controls) based on their daily sitting duration with 15 participants in each group.

 The outcome measures were recorded during erect, slumped and slouched sitting postures.

 The differences between the two groups and the three sitting postures in the outcome measures were examined for statistical significance.

 Soleus H-Reflex in Different Sitting Postures@highlight

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of prolonged sitting duration and three different sitting postures (erect, slumped, and slouched sitting postures) on spinal nerve root function by measuring the soleus (SOL) H-reflex amplitude.

 In addition, the pressure under the ischial tuberosities during the three sitting postures were assessed and correlated with the SOL H-reflex amplitude.
