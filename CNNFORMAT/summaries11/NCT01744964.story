(secondQuint)Apomorphine Effects on Experimental Pain.

 Healthy volunteers (n=105) participated in this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial.

 Heat pain threshold and intensity, cold pain threshold, and the response to tonic cold pain (latency, intensity, and tolerance) were evaluated before and for up to 120 min after the administration of 1.

5 mg apomorphine/placebo.

 A polymorphism (DAT-1) within the dopamine transporter gene (SLC6A3) was investigated.

 Apomorphine Effects on Experimental Pain@highlight

The aims of this study were to assess the effects of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on experimental pain models in healthy subjects and to explore the possible association between these effects and a common polymorphism within the dopamine transporter gene.
