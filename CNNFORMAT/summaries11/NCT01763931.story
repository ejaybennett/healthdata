(firstQuint)DIG-HIF1 Pharmacodynamic Trial in Newly Diagnosed Operable Breast Cancer.

 Breast cancer cells grow in a low oxygen environment called hypoxia.

 The body normally controls the amount of oxygen in cells with what is known as HIF-1, hypoxia inducible factor 1.

 HIF-1 helps cancer cells grow in low oxygen environments; therefore, if this function can be blocked, it may make it harder for breast cancer cells to grow.

 Digoxin is a drug that has been shown to block HIF-1 in lab studies.

 The investigators want to learn if it blocks HIF-1 in human breast cancer tissue.

 This will be done by comparing the tumor tissue from your original diagnostic biopsy to tissue that is taken at the time of surgery.

 The investigators will also be comparing tumor tissue of patients who are not randomized to take digoxin.
