(fifthQuint)Effects of Newly-Initiated QUAD Therapy on Aortic/Coronary Inflammation in ART-Nave Infected Patients.

 Patients with HIV are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease than healthy subjects.

 Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has greatly increased the lifespan of HIV+ patients, but their risk of CVD remains higher than normal.

 Previously, it has been shown that compared to healthy control subjects, ART-treated HIV+ patients have more atherosclerotic plaque inflammation in the aorta.

 This study is intended to determine whether atherosclerotic plaque inflammation/vulnerability is increased in ART-naive HIV+ patients and whether these parameters can be improved through 6 months of newly-initiated QUAD/Stribild therapy.

 Additionally, the study will determine whether indices of immune dysregulation and lipid dysfunction are increased in ART-naive HIV+ patients and whether these parameters can also be improved through 6 months of newly initiated QUAD/Stribild therapy.

The main aims of this study are to determine whether: a) ART-naive HIV+ subjects have increased artherosclerotic plaque inflammation/vulnerability, b) newly-initiated QUAD/Stribild therapy will decrease plaque inflammation/vulnerability in these subjects, and c) QUAD/Stribild therapy will improve indices of immune dysregulation and lipid dysfunction as a mechanism of improved plaque inflammation/vulnerability.

 Parameters of lipid and immune function will also be assessed in healthy control subjects, for comparison.
