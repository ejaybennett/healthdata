(secondQuint)Anal Motor Function in Fecal Incontinence.

 Measurment of anorectal function is traditionnaly made using manometric device composed of perfused or ballon catheters.

 This allows the recording of anorectal pressure on 2-3 sites.

 Recently, high resolution manometryu devices using > 36 pressure channels have been developped.

 The investigators therefore aim to evaluate the usefullness of the high resolution manometry in patient with fecal incontinence in terms of feasability and diagnosis accuracy.

Traditionnal measurment of anorectal function is perfomed with manometric device using 2 to 3 pressure sensors.

 The investigators aim to evaluate the usefulness of high resolution manometry to measure anorectal motility
