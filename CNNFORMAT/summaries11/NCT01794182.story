This is a randomized, multi-center, prospective, double blind study.

 The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of RP-1127 compared to placebo in subjects with a severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke who are likely to develop malignant edema.

 This objective will be addressed by comparing the proportion of RP-1127 treated patients and placebo treated patients with a Day 90 modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 4 without decompressive craniectomy (DC).
