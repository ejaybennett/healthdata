(firstQuint)Women's INternational Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Registry.

 WINTAVI is an international, multi-centre, prospective, observational registry.

 The purpose of this study is to collect 'real-world' data regarding the clinical utility of all commercially available Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) devices for percutaneous aortic valve implantation in female patients with severe Aortic Stenosis (AS) requiring treatment.

 Data collected in this study will provide additional information on the understanding of the safety and device performance in a 'real-world' setting and how to best treat patients with severe AS.

 This will include Quality of Life questionnaires (KCCQ).
