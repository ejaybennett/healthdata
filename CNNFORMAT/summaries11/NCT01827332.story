(firstQuint)Effect of Oxytocin on Craving and Therapy Response.

 Oxytocin has been shown to promote trust, social bonding, and calmness; however, its potential additive effects with a therapy intervention have not been explored in marijuana-dependent individuals.

 In the proposed study, the impact of intranasal oxytocin on therapy effectiveness and marijuana use outcomes following a brief therapy intervention will be investigated.

 It is hypothesized that oxytocin administration (vs.

 placebo) will improve treatment satisfaction and decrease marijuana use.
