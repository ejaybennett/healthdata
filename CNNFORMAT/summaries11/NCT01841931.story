(thirdQuint)Buprenorphine Treatment: A Safe Alternative for Opioid Dependent Pain Patients.

 The study will utilize sublingual buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain patients with co-occurring opioid dependence.

 Adult male and female chronic pain patients with co-occurring opioid dependence/disorder, being treated at MMC will be enrolled in a home induction procedure.

 Subjects will be switched from their current opioid pain medication to buprenorphine/naloxone to assess whether buprenorphine is at least as effective, if not more effective, as other opioid medications in controlling their pain while simultaneously improving their psychological distress, functional status, and other aspects of patients' lives.

 We will utilize a home induction procedure, and maintain subjects on this oral medication for a duration of 6 months.

 During this period.
