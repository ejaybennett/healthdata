(fifthQuint)PEACE: Pediatric Antifungal Comparative Effectiveness.

 This study is a multicenter, national and international, prospective observational comparative effectiveness study.

 The primary aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of echinocandin versus amphotericin B or triazole antifungal therapy for pediatric invasive candidiasis and for invasive candidemia.

 The primary effectiveness endpoint for study aim 1 is the comparison of global response at 14 days of antifungal therapy between antifungal therapeutic classes.

 The secondary effectiveness endpoints for study aim 1 are comparative effectiveness of the 1) global response to antifungal therapy after 30 days and 2) all-cause mortality at 30 days.

 The secondary aim is to characterize the frequency of pediatric candidiasis by describing the incidence of pediatric candidiasis relative to all pediatric admissions.

 For this aim, the investigators will use descriptive statistics to establish the frequency of hospital admissions involving an invasive candidiasis per total hospital admissions and total hospital days during the study period.

 PEACE: Pediatric Antifungal Comparative Effectiveness@highlight

The overarching objective is to develop new evidence-based treatment guidelines for invasive fungal diseases in children.

 To accomplish that, this protocol will focus on two specific aims: 1) Compare the effectiveness of echinocandin versus amphotericin B or triazole antifungal therapy for pediatric invasive candidiasis and for the subset of patients with invasive candidemia; 2) Characterize the incidence rate of inpatient pediatric invasive candidiasis per hospital admissions.
