(fifthQuint)Promoting Smoking Cessation in Carpenters.

 Specific Aim 1: Develop targeted health messages based on audience segmentation to encourage smokers to enroll in a comprehensive union-sponsored smoking cessation program.

 We will craft six specific health messages that appeal to four different audience segments: workers under 30 years old without children, workers under 30 with children, workers 30 years old or older without children, and workers 30 or older with children.

 Specific Aim 2: Conduct a randomized controlled trial of targeted messaging based on audience segmentation versus standard smoking cessation messaging.

 After conducting baseline surveys with union carpenters and floor layers, we will randomize current smokers (smoked within the last 30 days) into either the intervention or control group.

 - Control subjects will receive one standard mailing informing them about the free smoking cessation program available to union members.

 - Intervention subjects will receive the standard mailing in addition to six targeted smoking cessation messages delivered monthly by mail to their homes.

 Messages will be specific to one of four audience segments determined by age and parental status.

 In addition to a segment-specific anti-smoking message, each mailing will have contact information for the union smoking cessation program.

 Intervention subjects who consented to text messaging will also receive one booster text message each month with a shortened targeted message.

 Promoting Smoking Cessation in Carpenters@highlight

The purpose of this study is to test an innovative and sustainable intervention to increase participation in a union-sponsored smoking cessation program among carpenters and floor layers.

 The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing targeted messaging versus standard messaging.

 All subjects will receive information about the free, union-sponsored smoking cessation program.

 Subjects randomized to the intervention group will receive additional targeted materials to encourage enrollment in the union's smoking cessation program.

 The intervention will include monthly mailed and text messages.

 The investigators hypothesize that subjects who receive targeted messages will be more likely to enroll in the union-sponsored smoking cessation program, be more likely to show change in readiness to quit smoking, and be more likely to quit smoking compared to subjects who receive only standard messaging.
