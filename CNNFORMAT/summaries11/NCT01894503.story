(firstQuint)Safety and Performance of the Steroid-Releasing S8 Sinus Implant.

 The S8 PK study was a single-center, open label study treating 5 adult (18 years or older) patients diagnosed with chronic sinusitis, who had undergone prior bilateral total ethmoidectomy and later presented with recurrent nasal obstruction/congestion symptoms and bilateral ethmoid polyposis.

 The S8 PK study assessed the safety, implant delivery to the ethmoid sinus, and systemic exposure to mometasone furoate (MF) by measuring plasma MF and cortisol concentrations through 30 days post-procedure.
