(secondQuint)EBUS-GS-TBLB With or Without Fluoroscopy for the Diagnosis of PPLs.

 The investigators evaluated the efficacy and safety of transbronchial biopsy (TBB) and bronchial brushing by endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS) with a guide sheath (GS) as a guide for diagnosing peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) without radiographic fluoroscopy.

The study is designed as a two-center prospective randomized controlled trial.

 The participating centers are Department of pulmonary medicine and endoscope center, Shanghai chest Hospital affiliated to Shanghai JiaoTong University School, China.

 Department of pulmonary medicine, Fukushima Medical University, Japan.

Patients are divided into two groups, EBUS-GS-X-ray group and EBUS-GS group.

Each subject will be randomized to each group.

The study is expected to enroll 100 patients at 2 centers (China:75, Fukushima:25).
