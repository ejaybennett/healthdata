(thirdQuint)Triple Therapy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients.

 In an estimated temporal space of about 3 years, 64 not well controlled, type 2 diabetic patients will be recruited.

 Patients will be instructed to take metformin 500 mg three times a day for the first three months, then pioglitazone 15 mg twice a day will be added for further three months, and finally sitagliptin 100 mg once a day will be added for the last three months.

 At the baseline, and every three months a continuous glucose monitoring system will be performed.

 At any stage of the study, if the value of glycated hemoglobin reach the desired goal ( packets/day), alcohol consumption, coffee consumption, physical activity.

 - Physical exam, general anthropometric parameters such as weight, height, circumference, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, and blood pressure.

 - Assessment of glycemic variability every three months using a continuous glucose monitoring system.

 - Collection of blood and urine samples to assess: glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post-prandial glucose (PPG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), HOMA-index (HOMA-IR and HOMA-), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, tryglicerides, lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), soluble adhesion molecules (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1), sE-selectin, adiponectin (ADN), complete urinalysis, 24-hour microalbuminuria.

 Triple Therapy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients@highlight

The treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus often requires the use of one or more hypoglycemic agents to reach the adequate glycemic control.

 The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of a triple therapy with metformin, pioglitazone and sitagliptin on glycemic variability compared to metformin monotherapy, and compared to a combination of metformin and pioglitazone.

 To assess glycemic variability a continuous glucose monitoring system will be used.
