(fifthQuint)Does Straight Catheterization in Short Gynecologic Procedures Cause Bacteriuria?.

 The majority of research currently concentrates on indwelling catheters rather than one-time catheterization.

 Current practice at our institution in the gynecologic operating room is to perform a one time catheterization on patient's undergoing short procedures, yet it is unclear if this is a necessary intervention.

 If patients are asked to void immediately before their procedure it would eliminate the need for intra-operative catheterization and eliminate a potential source of infection.

 The study is designed to determine whether routine catheterization prior to a minor OB/GYN procedure causes symptomatic or asymptomatic bacteria in the urine.

 Current practice is one-time catheterization of patients undergoing minor OB/GYN procedures prior to the beginning of the procedure.

 The investigators hypothesize that this causes asymptomatic or symptomatic bacteriuria.

 Does Straight Catheterization in Short Gynecologic Procedures Cause Bacteriuria?@highlight

This is a prospective randomized controlled trial to look into the reduction of catheter associated urinary tract infections in the postoperative period.

 It will specifically look at short gynecologic procedures such as D&C (dilation and curettage), hysteroscopies and LEEP procedures and the need to perform intraoperative catheterization.

 If a patient urinates immediately before a short operation then there is no need to drain the bladder with a catheter during the procedure.

 The investigators hypothesize that eliminating catheterization during these short procedures may decrease postoperative urinary tract infections.

 The hope is that this study would provide evidence to support a change in practice.
