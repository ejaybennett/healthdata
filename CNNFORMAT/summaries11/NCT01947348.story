(firstQuint)Safety and Clinical Effectiveness of A3 SVF in Osteoarthritis.

 This is a prospective non-randomized, clinical study of 30 patients to determine safety and treatment potential of A3(Adult Autologous Adipose) SVF for the pain and inflammation associated with Osteoarthritis.

 Patients will be treated for Osteoarthritis due to degeneration or chronic injury.

 They will be given autologous SVF extract derived by the A3 method mixed with activated platelets from a PRP(platelet rich plasma) preparation as direct injections to the effected joints.

 Outcomes will be tracked with WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index), AUSCAN(Australian Hand Osteoarthritis Index) scores, and a general blood panel in order to evaluate systemic effects.
