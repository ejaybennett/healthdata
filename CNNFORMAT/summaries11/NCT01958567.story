(secondQuint)Optical Coherence Tomography in the Diagnosis of Scleritis and Episcleritis.

 A total of 40 eyes will be included.

 20 eyes with scleral inflammation and 20 eyes from healthy subjects as controls.

 Each patient will undergo complete ophthalmic and medical examination.

 Laboratory studies will performed whenever indicated.
