(firstQuint)Usability Study to Assess the Reveal LINQ Insertable Cardiac Monitor System.

 The Reveal LINQ Usability Study is a prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized, multi-center clinical trial.

 Subjects will transmit device data via manual interrogation on a weekly basis during the first month and will be evaluated in the office at 1-month post-implant, in addition to an automatic nightly wireless data transmission using the MyCareLink(R) home monitor.

 All subjects will be requested to wear an external Holter for 48 hours at approximately 4 weeks post-insertion.

 Follow-up visits will continue at 6 and 12 months post-implant, with monthly manual interrogations.

 Subjects will be exited at their 12 month follow-up visit.

 The overall study will be conducted in 2 phases which differ primarily on inclusion criteria: Phase I subjects (initial 30 subjects) will have any indication for an ICM, Phase II subjects (all subjects following the initial 30 subjects) will be atrial fibrillation (AF) pre-ablation patients.

 The study will assess functionality of the Reveal LINQ device by assessing sensing performance and data transmission.
