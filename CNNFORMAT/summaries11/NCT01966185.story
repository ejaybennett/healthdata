(thirdQuint)Establishing Learning Curves in Virtual Simulation Training of Mastoidectomy.

 Repeat surgical simulation training is known to provide better learning and long-term transfer.

 The learning curves for the mastoidectomy procedure have not been intensively studied.

 The only study conducted on learning curves in mastoidectomy to date found a plateau in performance for 4 medical students after about 4 mastoidectomy procedures on separate occasions.

 The participants were however assessed using an unvalidated, unestablished simulator integrated overall performance score.

 There is therefore a need for establishing learning curves and plateau using established objective assessment scales, which could have implications for future studies and on a larger scale for the future organization of temporal bone dissection courses.

 The long-term effect on learning of deliberate repeat simulator training of the mastoidectomy procedure has not previously been studied.

 The role of cognitive load in learning complex surgical technical skills in simulation has not been studied in great detail.

 The relationship between time and progress/performance assessment using Final Product Analysis (FPA) has not been studied.

 We have previously suggested that a tutor-function with volumetric approach with green lighting of the procedural steps could have an effect on performance.

 The effect of the tutor function could however not be isolated.

 Establishing Learning Curves in Virtual Simulation Training of Mastoidectomy@highlight

The purpose of this study is to establish learning curves of mastoidectomy training in virtual surgical simulation training, to establish the long-term effect of repeat simulation training and to explore the transfer of skills, the roles of an integrated tutor function, self-directed learning and cognitive load.
