(secondQuint)Immune Regulation in Multiple Sclerosis: The Effect of Glatiramer Acetate on MicroRNA Expression in Antigen-Presenting Cells.

 MicroRNAs regulate gene expression.

 The abnormal expression of microRNAs has been reported in many human diseases.

 The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if microRNA expression is changed in untreated and glatiramer acetate-treated patients with multiple sclerosis.

 The expression of microRNA will be analysed in cell subsets separated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
