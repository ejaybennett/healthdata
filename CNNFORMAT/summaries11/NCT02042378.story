(firstQuint)A Study of Rucaparib in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer and a Known Deleterious BRCA Mutation.

 Rucaparib is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) that inhibits a specific DNA repair pathway known as base excision repair (BER).

 PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have been shown to effectively kill tumors with a defect in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

 Clinical benefit has been observed in patients with a gBRCA mutation as well as in those with a somatic BRCA (sBRCA) mutation.

 Clinical data have also shown that pancreatic cancer patients with a gBRCA mutation benefit from PARPi treatment.

 Clinical activity of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer combined with the paucity of 2nd line therapies support evaluation of rucaparib in pancreatic cancer patients known to harbor a deleterious BRCA mutation.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral rucaparib is effective in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer and a known deleterious BRCA mutation.
