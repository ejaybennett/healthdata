(thirdQuint)Randomized Phase 2 Study to Investigate Efficacy of ALECSAT in Patients With GBM Measured Compared to Avastin/Irinotecan.

 This study is an open-label, randomized, prospective, parallel group phase II study with ALECSAT compared to Bevacizumab/Irinotecan in patients with verified relapsed glioblastoma multiforme after or during treatment with recognised first-line treatment.

 After 62 PFS events have been recorded, an interim analysis will be conducted under the auspices of the Data Monitoring Committee.

 The patients in the two treatment groups will be followed for up to 62 weeks by planned study visits.

 Patients with, at least, stable disease will continue the allocated treatment after the study period as judged by the Investigator.

 Patients allocated to the Bevacizumab/Irinotecan (control group) will receive their treatment according to standard praxis, i.

e.

 up to 16 treatment cycles with 4 weeks duration.

 Each cycle of Bevacizumab/Irinotecan consist of 2 dosing days; day 1 and day 15 in the cycle.

 Randomized Phase 2 Study to Investigate Efficacy of ALECSAT in Patients With GBM Measured Compared to Avastin/Irinotecan@highlight

The overall purpose of the study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of ALECSAT in patients with relapse of GlioBlastoma Multiforme (GBM) after first line treatments (followed by reoperation if possible).

 The efficacy and safety of ALECSAT treatment is, compared to standard Bevacizumab/Irinotecan second line treatments for these patients.
