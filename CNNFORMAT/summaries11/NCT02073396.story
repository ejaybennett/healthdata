(fifthQuint)Assessment of Thrombotic Status in Patients at Risk of Cardiovascular Thrombosis.

 Impaired thrombotic status is associated with adverse cardiovascular events.

 Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are at increased risk of thrombotic events.

 It is not known whether thrombotic status differs in these patients, or how thrombotic status alters in response to clinical stabilisation with treatment.

 The aim of this study is to assess the global thrombotic status (stickiness of the blood) in patients with coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation at baseline and after clinical stabilisation.

 This is a small, pilot, hypothesis-generating study.

 Design Single centre, hypothesis-generating study.

 Patients diagnosed with coronary disease (n=70) or atrial fibrillation (n=70) recruited from amongst in-patients or out-patients, will have a blood draw at presentation and after clinical stabilisation.

 Blood will be tested to assess global thrombotic status.

 The recruitment period is 3 years.

 Assessment of Thrombotic Status in Patients at Risk of Cardiovascular Thrombosis@highlight

Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are at increased risk of stroke and heart attack.

 Such events are usually caused by increased stickiness of the blood causing a blood clot to block the artery (thrombus) in the heart or the brain.

 The aim of this study is to assess the stickiness of the blood (global thrombotic status) in patients with CAD and AF at baseline and after clinical stabilisation to see how disease state and clinical treatments affect the stickiness of the blood (thrombotic status).

 This will be a single centre study.

 Patients diagnosed with CAD or AF will have a blood sample taken at baseline and after clinical stabilisation.

 Blood stickiness will be tested with the Global Thrombosis Test.

 The results will be evaluated to assess the effect of disease process and clinical state on blood stickiness to gain further understanding of this condition and form the basis for future studies aimed at identifying patients who are at high risk of future cardiovascular events, based on increased blood stickiness.
