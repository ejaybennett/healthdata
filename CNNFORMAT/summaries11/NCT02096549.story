(fifthQuint)Validity of Bispectral Index Monitoring During Deep Sedation.

 Intramuscular botulinum toxin injections for children with cerebral palsy have been extensively performed to relive spasticity and improve rehabilitation.

 During procedure immobility is essential to inject botulinum toxin to the right muscle for optimal effect.

 Because children with cerebral palsy are generally unable to control their movement, deep sedation is required during this painful procedure.

 Short-acting drugs with rapid, predictable onset and offset of action, such as propofol and remifentanil, facilitate infusion rate adjustments and rapid recovery.

 However, there is always the possibility of over-sedation, hypotension and respiratory depression due to their rather narrow therapeutic window.

 Several clinical sedation scales have been used to provide an effective and safe sedation in children.

 Because clinical scoring depends on patient response to verbal or physical stimulation, it is difficult to assess the level of sedatin in patients with deep sedation during delicate phase of the procedure.

 Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring,an objective guidance of sedation might be helpful.

 Although BIS scores in children with conscious and deep sedation were reported to correlate with clinical sedation scales, the validity during painful procedure in children with cerebral palsy was not investigated yet.

 The present study is to investigate the validity of the BIS monitoring and its correlation to University of Michigan sedation scale during deep sedation of children with cerebral palsy for injection of botulinum toxin.

During Intramuscular botulinum toxin injections for children with cerebral palsy, immobility is essential to inject botulinum toxin to the right muscle.

 Because children with cerebral palsy are generally unable to control their movement, deep sedation is required during this painful procedure.

 Short-acting drugs such as propofol and remifentanil are widely used for pediatric anesthesia and sedation but still have possibility of over-sedation and associated complications due to their rather narrow therapeutic window.

 Therefore, objective scoring system to assess the level of sedation to provide an effective and safe sedation in children.

 Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring,an objective guidance of sedation might be helpful.

 The present study is to investigate the validity of the BIS monitoring during deep sedation of children with cerebral palsy for injection of botulinum toxin.
