(thirdQuint)Comparative Study of Nonintubated Anesthesia Versus Intubated General Anesthesia in Single Port Thoracoscopic Bullectomy.

 Thoracoscopic bullectomy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax is relatively simple and short procedure compared to other thoracic surgery.

 However, in the anesthetic preparation, complicated technique and procedures are needed including a double lumen endotracheal intubation, auscultation, and flexible bronchoscopic confirmation of the tube location, even during lateral decubitus position.

 The double lumen endotracheal tube has a bigger outer diameter.

 And postoperative sore throat and voice change can develop after the intubation procedure.

 Recently, single lumen intubation using carbon dioxide gas instillation under general anesthesia during thoracoscopic surgery is reported.

 However, if safety and efficacy are warranted, thoracoscopic surgery using nonintubated and self-ventilated anesthesia will be a best solution for above mentioned postoperative discomforts.

 Investigators designed the comparative study of nonintubated local anesthesia under sedation and intubated general anesthesia in thoracoscopic bullectomy through the single port.

 Investigators will investigate postoperative pain, sore throat, voice change, nausea, vomiting, and intraoperative arterial blood gas analysis.

 This study will be performed at Korea University Ansan Hospital.

 A total of 40 patients will be enrolled (20 patients in each arm).
