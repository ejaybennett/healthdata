(thirdQuint)Is High Sensibility Troponins a Dialysable Marker in Hemodialysis Patients and Does it Have Prognostic Value?.

 Recruiting of hemodialysis patients of the nephrology renal supplementation clinics at Sherbrooke University Hospital Center to measure three blood level of high-sensibility troponins before and after standard dialysis.

 Verification on the variation of these levels after dialysis.

 Follow-up at 6 and 12 months of the patient for Cardiovascular events and death and verification of a possible predictive value of troponin blood levels for these events.

 Is High Sensibility Troponins a Dialysable Marker in Hemodialysis Patients and Does it Have Prognostic Value?@highlight

Evaluation of High sensibility troponin levels modification by hemodialysis in terminal renal failure patient at Sherbrooke University Hospital Center as determined by serial measurements.

 Verification of potential effects of these levels and their variation as predictors of cardiovascular outcomes and events at 6 and 12 months.
