(firstQuint)Stop Vasodepressor Drugs in Reflex Syncope.

 Several drugs which are commonly used in clinical practice, such as antihypertensive, antiarrhythmic and psychiatric drugs, are associated with orthostatic hypotension and syncope.

 This phenomenon is much more evident in the elderly and with multiple therapies.

 The present study was aimed to investigate, in patients affected by reflex syncope, the clinical effects (reduction in syncope recurrence and associated symptoms) and the laboratory tests (negativization of carotid sinus massage and tilt table test) when such drugs are discontinued or reduced.
