(firstQuint)A Study of Intravesical BCG in Combination With ALT-803 in Patients With Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.

 The study includes a dose escalation phase (phase Ib) and an expansion phase (phase IIb).

 In the phase Ib, patients will be treated with intravesical ALT-803 in combination with BCG.

 The purpose of the phase Ib portion of the study is to evaluate the safety, identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of ALT-803 and determine the Recommended Dose (RD) level of ALT-803 in combination with BCG for the phase IIb expansion.

 In the phase IIb expansion, patients will be randomized to receive either intravesical ALT-803 in combination with BCG or BCG alone.

 The purpose of the phase IIb portion of the study is to compare disease response, recurrence and survival rates, safety and quality of life between the two treatment groups.
