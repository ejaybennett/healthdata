(secondQuint)Endoscopic Prevention of Esophageal Cancer at Tenwek Hospital.

 Esophageal squamous dysplasia (ESD) is the precursor lesion of esophageal squamous cell cancer.

 ESD causes no symptoms but can be detected by screening.

 ESD may harbor various grades of dysplasia.

 Patients with moderate grade or high grade dysplasia (MGD or HGD) have up to a 40-fold increased risk of esophageal squamous cell cancer.

 In this study, persons known to have ESD with MGD or HGD on the basis of prior screening will be invited to undergo endoscopic treatment with either endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and/or radio frequency ablation (RFA) in order to remove or ablate regions of ESD.

 Participants will undergo a series of endoscopies to treat ESD and monitor success of treatment.
