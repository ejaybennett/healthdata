(firstQuint)A Phase 2 Extension Study of Study GCS-100-CS-4002.

 Galectin-3 contributes to fibrosis, is elevated in patients with ESRD, and correlates with adverse outcomes.

 Animal models with genetic knockout of galectin-3 demonstrate a reduction in structural and functional deficits in the kidney.

 GCS-100 is a galectin-3 antagonist that has been shown to reduce fibrosis pre-clinically.

 Based on the role of galectin-3 and fibrosis in kidney disease, the Sponsor believes GCS-100 may be effective at treating patients with CKD.

 Study GCS-100-CS-4002 is an ongoing randomized, placebo controlled study of GCS-100 in Stage 3b and 4 CKD.

 The objective of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of 8 weekly injections of GCS-100 on eGFR.

 Patients who have completed that study without adverse safety events, may be asked to participate in this study to test the safety of prolonged administration of study drug.
