(firstQuint)A Double-blind, Randomised, Placebo-controlled, Rising Multiple Dose Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Steady State Pharmacokinetic Profile and CNS Effects of BIA 2-093.

 Single centre, Phase I, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study investigating 4 multiple rising oral doses of BIA 2-093 in 4 groups of 8 young healthy male subjects.

 Within each group, 2 subjects were randomised to receive placebo and the remaining 6 subjects to receive BIA 2-093.

 No subject was a member of more than one group.

 The dose regimens investigated were: 200 mg b.

 BIA 2-093/placebo was administered orally once daily on Days 1-8, or twice a day (at 12-hour intervals) on Days 1-7 with a final dose in the morning of Day 8.

 The multiple dose regimens were to be investigated in ascending order.

 Progression to each higher dose level was only to occur if the previous dose level was deemed by the investigator and the sponsor to be safe and well tolerated.
