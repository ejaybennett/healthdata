(secondQuint)Steroids for Pediatric Apnea Research in Kids.

 Several studies have suggested that NCS or leukotriene antagonists may be effective in the treatment of childhood OSAS.

 However, these studies have been limited by factors such as small size, lack of randomization and blinding, short-term follow-up, involvement of children with only very mild OSAS, and/or lack of stratifying for the presence of atopy.

 Therefore, investigators will plan a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of NCS vs placebo in children with mild to moderate OSAS.

 The overall hypothesis is that NCS will be safe and efficacious in the treatment of mild to moderate childhood OSAS, particularly in children with asthma/atopy, but will require ongoing maintenance therapy.
