(fifthQuint)ER Reactivation Therapy for Breast Cancer.

 Metastatic breast cancer is rarely cured by current therapies.

 ER+ breast cancers ultimately become resistant to all available anti-estrogens.

 Response rates to estrogens are similar to those of anti-estrogens in the metastatic setting.

 Given that ER+ breast cancers are often responsive to anti-estrogens and estrogens, alternating anti-estrogen/estrogen therapies may be more effective than continuous treatment with either type of agent.

 Anecdotal evidence indicates that such a strategy of alternating therapies is effective in some patients.

 Preclinical evidence suggests that anti-estrogen-resistant ER+ breast cancers are sensitized to the anti-tumor effects of estrogens.

 Such cells harbor subpopulations that can ultimately regain the ability to grow in the presence of estrogens, and revert to their anti-estrogen-sensitive state.

 The investigators will formally test whether alternating 17b-estradiol/anti-estrogen therapies is effective for the management of anti-estrogen-resistant metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer, and to identify molecular biomarkers that predict tumor response to 1) 17b-estradiol and 2) alternating 17b-estradiol/anti-estrogen therapies.

 If successful, this study would present a novel strategy to manage metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer by pre-emptively switching therapies prior to disease progression.

 ER Reactivation Therapy for Breast Cancer@highlight

Before anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen were developed to treat estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, high-dose estrogen therapies were used.

 This seems counterintuitive since anti-estrogens block ER function, while estrogens increase ER function, but these therapies are effective to similar extents for the treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer.

 Estrogen therapies are most effective against cancers that develop resistance to anti-estrogens, likely because such cancers have adapted to grow without ER function, and restoring ER function (with estrogen) is damaging to the cancer cells.

 In some patients with ER+ breast cancer that becomes resistant to anti-estrogens, treatment with the estrogen 17b-estradiol induces tumor response.

 Furthermore, when 17b-estradiol-sensitive tumors eventually become resistant to 17b-estradiol, switching back to anti-estrogen therapy is often effective.

 These observations suggest that cancers can alternate between anti-estrogen-sensitive and 17b-estradiol-sensitive states.

 The investigators hypothesize that treatment with alternating 17b-estradiol / anti-estrogen therapies on a defined 8-week / 16-week schedule will more effectively prevent cancer growth than continuous treatment with either type of therapy in patients with metastatic anti-estrogen-resistant ER+ breast cancer.
