(secondQuint)Sub-occipital Muscle Inhibition in Tension Type Headache.

 This study is based on the combined application of sub-occipital muscle inhibition technique associated with interferential electrotherapy improves symptoms in patients with tension type headache and cervicogenic headache.

 The purposes of this study are: - Evaluate the effectiveness of treatment based on the combined application of sub-occipital muscle inhibition technique associated with interferential electrotherapy in patients with tension type headache.

 - Evaluate the effects of treatment caused in upper cervical movement.

 - Evaluate the effects of treatment caused in neck pain.

 - Evaluate the effects of treatment caused in headache.
