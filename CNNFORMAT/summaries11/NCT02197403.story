(secondQuint)Paradoxical Excitement Response During Sedation Between Dexmedetomidine and Propofol in Hazardous Alcohol Drinker.

 1.

 Adequate sedation during surgery provide anxiolysis and comfort to patient.

 Insufficient sedation can't provide comfort to patient during surgery, otherwise excessive sedation can cause variable complications like respiratory depression or delayed awakening.

 2.

 Dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting 2 receptor agonist that is increasingly being used as a sedative for MAC and intensive care with mechanical ventilated patients because of its analgesic properties, "cooperative sedation," and lack of respiratory depression.

 3.

 Because of the different site of action between dexmedetomidine and propofol, we assumed that paradoxical excitement responses which appeared in heavy alcohol drinkers in midazolam or propofol-induced sedation might be less observed in dexmedetomidine-induced sedation.
