(firstQuint)Bare -Metal Stents and Drug -Eluting Stents in the Treatment of Patients With Vertebral Artery Ostium Stenosis.

 The vertebral artery ostium stenosis was one of the higher risk of the ischemia stroke in China.

 In the mean time ,more and more people accept revascularization.

 There are no prospective studies for comparison of prevention of restenosis after Drug -eluting stents and Bare-metal stents until now.

 The main aim of this study is to observe the following details: 1.

 Late loss in lumen diameter in follow-up 50% 2.

 Death, non -fatal stroke 30 days after stent implantation associated with antiplatelet drugs 3.

 Death, non -fatal stroke 12 months after stent implantation associated with antiplatelet drugs Secondary endpoint: brain, gastrointestinal and urinary system bleeding in 12 months follow-up.

 Bare -Metal Stents and Drug -Eluting Stents in the Treatment of Patients With Vertebral Artery Ostium Stenosis@highlight

The study hypothesizes that Drug -eluting stents are more effective in preventing restenosis than Bare-metal stents after Vertebral Artery Ostium stenting
