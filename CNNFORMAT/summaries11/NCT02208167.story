(secondQuint)Phase I Study of HIV 1 Antigen Expanded Specific T Cell Therapy.

 The main hypothesis of this study is that the administration of autologous ex vivo expanded HIV-specific T-cells (HXTCs) primed to recognize multiple HIV-1 antigens in HIV-infected participants who initiated ART during acute and chronic HIV infection will be safe, increase HIV-1 antigen specific T-cell immune responses and decrease low level viremia.

 In addition, secondary objectives are to: 1.

 Determine the feasibility of manufacturing HXTC from participants who started cART during acute and chronic HIV infection.

 2.

 Explore the ability of autologous ex vivo expanded HIV-1 specific T-cells (HXTC) to increase HIV-1 specific immune responses in participants initiated on cART during acute and chronic HIV infection.

 3.

 Explore the ability of autologous ex vivo expanded HIV-1 specific T-cells (HXTC) to impact latent HIV infection as measured by a quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) and integrated proviral DNA quantification, and low level viremia as measured by a single copy assay (SCA) in participants initiated on cART during acute and chronic HIV infection.

 Phase I Study of HIV 1 Antigen Expanded Specific T Cell Therapy@highlight

This is a phase 1, single-site study is to evaluate the safety and immunologic and virologic efficacy of ex vivo expanded HIV-1 multi-antigen specific T-cell (HXTC) therapy in HIV-infected individuals with viral suppression on antiretroviral therapy (ART).
