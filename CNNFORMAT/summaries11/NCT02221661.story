(secondQuint)Performance of AclarusDx a Blood-Based Transcriptomic Test for AD, in French Patients Newly Referred to a Memory Center.

 The objective of this study is to apply AclarusDx cent signature in 600 patients newly referred in french memory centers.

 Only AclarusDx cent will be added to the panel of tests usually performed at the centers to establish diagnosis.

 AclarusDx cent will be used for investigational use only, not for diagnostic purpose.

 The ultimate goal is to define the clinical utility of AclarusDx cent to provide physicians with a tool that will help them in making the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

 The primary objective is to estimate the prevalence of positive AclarusDx cent in patients diagnosed AD in the population of primary consultants.

 This population of primary consultants consists of patients with cognitive impairment and / or a memory complaint requiring specialized exploration using AclarusDx cent blood test and which may be potentially related to multiple and different etiologies.

 The secondary objectives are: - Assess the prevalence of positive AclarusDx cent in relation to other diagnoses (MCI, vascular dementia .

.

.

) established by the physician investigator at the end of specialized assessment.

 - Identify the demographic factors anamnestic, clinical, biological and imaging associated with positivity of AclarusDx cent - Identify the demographic factors anamnestic, clinical, biological and imaging associated with the diagnosis of AD and other diagnoses.

 - Determine the contribution of AclarusDx cent in the usual battery of tests performed for diagnostic approach to Alzheimer's disease and to identify a possible association of interest with one or more endpoints (clinical, neuropsychological, brain, biological imaging).

 - Assess: diagnostic status at 6 and 12 months, and the MMSE and IADL at 6 and 12 months.

 - assess the predictive value of AclarusDx cent achieved during the initial visit to the diagnosis of AD is 12 months.

 - Evaluate AclarusDx cent predictive value to 12 months.

 Performance of AclarusDx a Blood-Based Transcriptomic Test for AD, in French Patients Newly Referred to a Memory Center@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of AclarusDx cent , an investigational blood test detecting gene expression information, and intended to help physicians in making an Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis in patients having memory complaint and/or cognitive impairments.
