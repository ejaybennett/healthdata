(firstQuint)Influence of Two Different PEEP Niveaus and a Trendelenburg Positioning Manoeuvre on Subclavian Vein Diameter.

 In 50 Patients who are undergoing a planned surgical procedure which require a central venous catheter the diameter of the subclavian vein is measured by ultrasound under 6 different conditions.

 The conditions are 1.

 neutral positioning, PEEP 0 cm H2O, 2.

 neutral positioning, PEEP 5cm H2O, 3.

 neutral positioning, PEEP 10cm H2O, 4.

 Trendelenburg positioning -20, PEEP 0 cmH2O, 5.

 Trendelenburg positioning -20, PEEP 5 cmH2O, 6.

 Trendelenburg positioning -20, PEEP 10 cmH2O After these measurements a central venous catheter is used to measure the central venous pressure.
