(thirdQuint)Methadone and Ketamine for Neuropathic Pain Treatment.

 Either oral methadone or ketamine have been used in neuropathic pain management, however, the benefits of the association of both drugs are uncertain.

 Here, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, in parallel, active controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that methadone combined ketamine (methadone/ketamine) is more effective than methadone or ketamine alone in reducing neuropathic pain.

 Methods: Fourthly two patients with neuropathic pain refractory to conventional therapy were randomly assigned to receive during three months oral methadone (n= 13), ketamine (n=13) or methadone combined with ketamine (n=13).

 The primary outcome was pain score on visual analogical scale (VAS) assessed on baseline, 8, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days throughout the treatment, and the secondary outcomes were symptoms of neuropathic pain such as allodynia, burning or shooting pain as well the side effects.
