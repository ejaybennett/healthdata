(thirdQuint)Using an iPhone ECG to Monitor the QT Interval on Dofetilide and Sotalol Patients.

 Patients that were already selected to begin either dofetilide or sotalol in the hospital, will be included in the study.

 Patients will receive an ECG before and 2 hours after each dose of the medication, which is done to monitor the QT interval.

 In addition, patients that consent to participate in the study will have an iPhone ECG recording taken in lead positions that correspond to leads I,II, and III.

 These recordings will be compared and analyzed to assess the accuracy of the QT interval recordings between the two methods.

 Using an iPhone ECG to Monitor the QT Interval on Dofetilide and Sotalol Patients@highlight

This study will validate the recording accuracy of a specific electrical interval of the heart, the QT interval, between an iPhone rhythm strip recording and a traditional 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).

 These measurements will occur in hospitalized patients that are starting either sotalol or dofetilide, since both of these medications can prolong the QT interval.
