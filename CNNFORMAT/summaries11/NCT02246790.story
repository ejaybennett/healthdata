(thirdQuint)Surgical Ablation of Long-standing Persistent AF During CABG.

 This is a single blinded prospective randomized study involving 116 patients with long-standing persistent AF and coronary artery disease.

 116 patients are required to have a 80% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, an increase in the primary outcome (freedom fro AF) measure by 12% in the biatrial group over left atrial group.

 Patients are divided into two groups, group I - biatrial + CABG (58 patients), and group II - left atrial + CABG (58 patients).

 Randomization is conducted by using accidental sampling before operation.

 The blinding process is applied to a patient, who is informed about received coronary artery bypass grafting, but don't know about kind of surgical ablation.

 Subcutaneous cardiac monitor is implanted to all patients for cardiac rhythm monitoring.

 Surgical Ablation of Long-standing Persistent AF During CABG@highlight

Purpose.

 Comparison of outcomes in patients underwent CABG combined with left atrial and biatrial radiofrequency ablation of long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation.

 Hypothesis of the study - patients with long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease after CABG in combination with biatrial RFA have a better outcomes for the freedom of AF compared with patients undergoing left atrial RFA during CABG.
