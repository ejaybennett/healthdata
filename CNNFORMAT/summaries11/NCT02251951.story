(secondQuint)Nab-Paclitaxel as Salvage Treatment in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer.

 Adenocarcinomas of the stomach or gastrointestinal junction refractory/resistant to 1st line chemotherapy are considered as an orphan disease with limited (if any) treatment options.

 The promising results of Nab-Paclitaxel derived from preclinical studies and from clinical trials conducted in breast cancer patients open the field to develop such therapeutic approaches in other cancers types usually treated with taxanes such as gastric and GEJ adenocarcinomas.

 We design a phase II study in order to evaluate the effect of nab-Paclitaxel as salvage treatment for patients with advanced cancer of the stomach and GEJ previously treated with the DCF regimen.
