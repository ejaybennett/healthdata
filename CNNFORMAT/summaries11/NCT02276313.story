(secondQuint)BIOLUX P-III All-Comers Passeo-18 Lux Registry.

 The Passeo-18 LUX Paclitaxel Releasing BalloonCatheter is a novel drug-releasing balloon that received CE-mark in January 2014.

 Its safety and efficacy has been investigated in two randomized First-in-Man trials in patients with stenosis or occlusion of the femoropopliteal (BIOLUX P-I) and infrapopliteal (BIOLUX P-II) arteries when compared to an uncoated device.

 The purpose of the BIOLUX P-III all-comers registry is to collect short and long-term clinical performance data on the Passeo-18 Lux DRB in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease in the infrainguinal arteries in an all-comers patient population in daily clinical practice.
