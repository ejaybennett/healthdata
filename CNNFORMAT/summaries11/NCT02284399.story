(thirdQuint)National Prevalence and Impact of Noninvasive Prenatal Testing.

 Information regarding the frequency of non-invasive testing (NIPT), the impact of screening on the need for and frequency of invasive testing, and the indications for testing are important for the clinicians in this country to not only understand the impact that this testing has had but also to plan for allocation of personnel and resources in their prenatal testing units, as well as many other more subtle changes including describing changes to referring clinicians and patients and projecting financial impacts.

 Information on pregnant women undergoing NIPT at one of the Obstetrix Medical Groups Outpatient Centers between January 2012 and June 2014 will be retrospectively gathered and compared to a control group of pregnant women in those same practices undergoing prenatal testing during the months of January 2010-July 2010.

 An analysis of the impact of NIPT will be done.
