(secondQuint)Specified Drug-use Survey of the Granular Capsule Formulation of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters: OCEAN3.

 This survey is planned to determine the incidence rate of cardiovascular (CV) events associated with long-term treatment with omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (Lotriga Granular Capsules) in high-risk hyperlipidemic patients treated by statin in daily medical practice.

 The incidence rate of CV events in the patients who are treated by the standard anti-hyperlipidemic therapies other than Lotriga is investigated in this survey so as to compare the events rates between two patients groups just for information.

 For adults, 2 g of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters is usually administered orally once daily immediately after meals.

 However, the dose can be increased up to twice daily (to a dose of 2 g) depending on patient's triglyceride (TG) level.
