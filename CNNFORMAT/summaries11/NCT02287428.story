(fifthQuint)Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine With RT Plus Pembrolizumab for Patients With MGMT Unmethylated, Newly Diagnosed GBM.

 It is known that glioblastomas have mutations that are specific to an individual patient's tumor.

 These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells.

 It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could cause glioblastoma to recur.

 Methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair protein which can be increased in some cancers, including glioblastoma.

 MGMT works to repair the DNA of cancer cells that are damaged by treatment.

 If a tumor is found to be "unmethylated", it means there is more MGMT present in the tumor than one that is "methylated".

 Methylation of MGMT is believed to make tumor cells more responsive to drugs like temozolomide.

 Studies have shown that temozolomide provides a very small improvement in outcome for many patients whose glioblastoma is MGMT-unmethylated.

 Patients with glioblastoma usually receive six weeks of radiation with a daily chemotherapy called temozolomide after their surgery, followed by six to twelve months of additional temozolomide.

 In this study, only participants whose tumors are MGMT-methylated will receive temozolomide; those participants whose tumors are MGMT-unmethylated will not receive temozolomide, as studies have shown that temozolomide provides a very small improvement in outcome for many patients whose glioblastoma is MGMT-unmethylated.

 On this trial, Cohort 1 participants will receive the Personalized NeoAntigen Vaccine (5 priming doses and 2 booster doses over ~ 20 weeks) after having completed six weeks of standard radiation.

 The study will examine the safety of the vaccine when given at several different time points and will examine the participant blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an immune response.

 Two additional cohorts (1a and 1b) will be included in the study following completion of accrual to the original study cohort (cohort 1).

 Each additional cohort will receive NeoVax and radiation therapy as administered to cohort 1 and will also receive pembrolizumab.

 Cohort 1a will enroll patients with MGMT unmethylated tumors and this cohort will not receive temozolomide (as per Cohort 1).

 Cohort 1b will enroll patients with tumors for which the MGMT status is methylated, indeterminate or unknown; patients on cohort 1b will receive standard temozolomide during radiation and as adjuvant therapy following completion of radiation therapy.

 The rationale for adding cohorts 1a and 1b includes to: 1) assess the safety and feasibility of NeoVax when administered with pembrolizumab (cohort 1a); and 2) determine the safety and feasibility of NeoVax when administered with pembrolizumab and temozolomide (cohort 1b).

 Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine With RT Plus Pembrolizumab for Patients With MGMT Unmethylated, Newly Diagnosed GBM@highlight

This research study is studying a new type of vaccine as a possible treatment for patients with MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma.

 This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the intervention to use for further studies.

 "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied and that research doctors are trying to find more about it.

 It also means that the FDA (U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine for any use in patients, including people with glioblastoma.

 The purpose of this study (Cohort 1) is to determine if it is possible to make and administer safely a vaccine against glioblastoma by using information gained from specific characteristics of the participants tumor.

 It is known that glioblastomas have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient's tumor.

 These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells.

 It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could cause the glioblastoma to come back in the future.

 Two additional cohorts (1a and 1b) will be included in the study following completion of accrual to the original study cohort (cohort 1).

 Each additional cohort will receive NeoVax and radiation therapy as administered to cohort 1 and will also receive pembrolizumab.

 Cohort 1b will also receive standard temozolomide during radiation and as adjuvant therapy following completion of radiation therapy.
