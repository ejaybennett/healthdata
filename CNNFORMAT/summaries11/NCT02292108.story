High food impulsiveness, impaired food reward and stress response are involved in the phenomena of weight gain and resistance at weight loss.

 In obese subjects with high food impulsiveness, it is expected that Erickson's hypnosis and self-hypnosis practice would improve food disinhibition assessed by an adapted questionary (TFEQ 51).
