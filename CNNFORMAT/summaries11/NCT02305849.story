(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of ASP015K in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Who Had an Inadequate Response to Methotrexate (MTX) Treatment.

 This study is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, confirmatory study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASP015K administered in combination with MTX in patients with RA who had an inadequate response to MTX.

 Subjects will orally receive ASP015K or placebo once daily (QD) in combination with MTX after breakfast for 52 weeks.

 At Week 12, inadequate responders in the placebo group, as determined by a < 20% improvement from baseline (i.

e.

, treatment initiation day) in tender or painful joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC), will be switched to ASP015K, and the dosage will be maintained until the end of treatment.

 In addition, subjects receiving placebo at Week 28 will be switched to ASP015K, and the dosage will be maintained until the end of treatment.

 The ASP015K dose that will be started for placebo group subjects at Week 12 or Week 28 will be randomly chosen at baseline.

 The dose will be switched under the blinded condition.

 Subjects who complete this study will be eligible for participation in the open-label extension study (015K-CL-RAJ2).

 Subjects will make a follow-up visit after the Week 52 visit if they do not enroll into the extension study on the day of the Week 52 visit.

The objective of this study is to verify the efficacy of ASP015K versus placebo administrated in combination with methotrexate (MTX) over placebo in terms of efficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had an inadequate response to MTX
