(secondQuint)A Pilot Study To Investigate The Effect Of Concurrent Antacid Administration On The Bioavailability Of Six Experimental Formulations Of Palbociclib.

 This will be a 6 cohort study investigating one experimental formulation of palbociclib in each of the six cohorts of 10 healthy subjects.

 Each cohort will receive two treatments in a fixed-sequence.

 In Period 1, all subjects will receive a single 125mg dose of palbociclib alone and undergo serial pharmacokinetic blood sampling for up to 120 hours post-dose.

 In Period 2, all subjects will receive daily 40mg doses of Rabeprazole for 7 consecutive days, and approximately 4 hours after the Day 7 rabeprazole dose each subject will receive a single 125mg dose of palbociclib.

 Subjects will undergo serial pharmacokinetic blood sampling up to 120 hours post-dose.

 A Pilot Study To Investigate The Effect Of Concurrent Antacid Administration On The Bioavailability Of Six Experimental Formulations Of Palbociclib@highlight

This study will investigate whether concurrent administration of rabeprazole, an antacid known as a proton pump inhibitor, alters the absorption of the drug palbociclib when given as one of six experimental formulations.
