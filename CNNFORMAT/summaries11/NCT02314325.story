(fifthQuint)Subclinical Joint Bleeding in Irish Adults With Severe Haemophilia A on Personalised Prophylaxis Regimens.

 Subclinical joint bleeding (SJB) in Haemophilia may cause early and progressive joint damage.

 Clinical haemarthrosis is a traditional outcome measure in Haemophilia trials but may not always correlate with the degree of arthropathy.

 Even in the absence of haemarthrosis, abnormalities may be detected on MRI.

 MRI offers greater sensitivity than physical examination for early joint damage and use of the International Prophylaxis Study Group (IPSG) score allows standardisation across clinical trials.

 Early awareness of haemophiliac arthropathy can prompt intervention with physiotherapy, specific exercise programmes, optimization of prophylaxis and orthotics to improve overall joint outcomes.

 The time spent with Factor VIII (FVIII) levels 0.

015 IU/mL).

 This is a crossover study will participants spending months 0-6 on standard prophylaxis and then changing over to PK tailored dosing for months 7-18.

 A comprehensive joint assessment involving bleed history, clinical examination, physical activity, specialist physiotherapy review, X-rays and MRI scanning of bilateral ankles, knees and elbow will be performed at months 0,6 and 18.

 Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS), International Physical Activity (IPAQ) and EuroQoL 5-Dimensions (EQ5D) Questionnaires will also be performed at these three timepoints.

 Clinical bleeds and FVIII usage will be recorded throughout the trial using the investigators Home Scan system, a smart phone application that allows patients to log factor VIII usage.

 Results will be compared between both arms and between participants on primary and secondary prophylaxis.

 Information on those with naive joints versus established arthropathy will be compared.

 Due to the relative rarity of severe Haemophilia A the investigators plan to recruit 20 patients in total.

 All patients will act as their own control, crossing over from standard to PK tailored prophylaxis with joint assessments prior to crossover to allow comparison of the two regimes.

This trial is designed to assess if there is evidence of subclinical joint bleeding on MRI/X-Ray in adults with severe Haemophilia A while on standard and/or pharmacokinetically tailored prophylaxis regimens.

 Participants with severe Haemophilia A will have longitudinal MRI and XRay imaging of their elbows, ankles and knees at 0, 6 and 18 months while on standard ( 0-6 months) and then pharmacokinetically tailored (7-18 months) recombinant Factor VIII prophylaxis.
