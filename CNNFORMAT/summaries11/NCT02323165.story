(fifthQuint)A New Method for Detection of Bacteria in the Bloodstream.

 This study will involve additional blood samples to be taken during the routine clinical blood draw, while the subject is being treated for their burn/wounds.

 The additional research samples will be examined for bacteria.

 A second blood draw will be performed at approximately 24 hours of initial blood collection.

 The blood is being collected and then correlate with results of routine medical care blood cultures and clinical status of the subject (diagnosis of sepsis, hemodynamic instability).

 Data that will be abstracted from the current electronic medical record includes whether there is any type of catheter indwelling (brand name and type), insertion methods including place of insertion (Intensive Care Unit, Operating Room, Emergency Department), adherence to bundle, complications during insertion, colonization of the subject with bacteria (MRSA), and culture results obtained as part of clinical care.

 Demographics (subject's age) and diagnoses will also be captured as some studies have shown a higher risk of infection with certain processes (burns) and percentage of burn.

 A New Method for Detection of Bacteria in the Bloodstream@highlight

The primary aim is to determine if this new technique will detect and identify bacteria in the blood sooner than standard blood cultures or identify patients who may be septic without growing bacteria in their cultures.

 These will be correlated with the data collected from medical records on presumed sepsis.

 These results will be linked to data concerning infection that will be available as part of routine care including blood counts and other laboratory values that would be part of the routine medical care such as a white blood cell count.

 The earlier the bacteria are identified and the appropriate antimicrobials are administered the better the patient outcome.
