(firstQuint)Study of Kinetics, Dosimetry & Safety of [18F]F-AraG, a Positron Emission Tomography Imaging Tracer in Healthy Humans.

 A positron emission tomography (PET) imaging tracer will be intravenously injected into healthy human volunteers who provide informed consent.

 Following injection of this tracer each volunteer will have four whole-body PET scans inside a PET scanner to obtain images of tracer biodistribution at four different time points.

 This will allow studying the kinetics of the tracer as well analysis of tracer dosimetry.

 Safety of the tracer will also be analyzed in each volunteer.
