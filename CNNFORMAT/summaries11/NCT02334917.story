(fifthQuint)Comparison of Fast-Absorbing Sutures for Mohs Surgery.

 Prospective randomized controlled split-scar observer-blinded study.

 After dermatologic surgery on the face, surgeons have a choice between using non-absorbable or absorbable sutures for skin closure.

 A dermatologic surgeon favoring absorbable sutures for wound closure will consider many factors in material selection, including ease of manipulation, cost, and absorption time.

 However, there have been no randomized trials comparing the most important measure: aesthetic/cosmetic outcome.

 Study endpoint/outcome: use three validated scar assessment tools.

 Comparison of Fast-Absorbing Sutures for Mohs Surgery@highlight

This study is being carried out to assess equivalence of scar outcome for two absorbable sutures used for wound closure on the face in dermatologic surgery: rapidly absorbable polyglactin 910 (VicrylRapide cent ) and fast-absorbing plain gut (5-0 fast).

 This is important because absorbable sutures are commonly used in Mohs surgery for epidermal closure, yet there is no evidence indicating if any of the sutures above allow for a better cosmetic outcome (less erythema, edema, and scarring).
