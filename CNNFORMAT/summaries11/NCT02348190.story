(fifthQuint)Fat Induced Insulin Resistance and Atherosclerosis.

 All subjects will be admitted to the GCRC in the afternoon before the tests (Day 1) and will undergo a thorough physical examination.

 Routine admission lab tests (including a 2-h 75g OGTT) and body composition measurements will be obtained.

 A standardized dinner will be served at ~ 6PM.

 The next (Day 2) after an overnight fast, IV lines will be placed (arms will be wrapped with a heating blanket and kept at 70F to arterialize venous blood).

 The following studies will be performed.

 Thirty-two healthy volunteers will undergo euglycemic - hyperinsulinemic clamping without radioactive isotopes and with (n=16) and without (n=16) lipid/heparin co-infusion for 8 hours.

 Serial (at 0, 1, 2 and 4 h) muscle and fat biopsies and serial blood samples (q' 1 h) will be obtained.

 The following measurements will be obtained in muscle biopsies and T-cell extracts: PKC-I and II and PKC-, IKK, IB-, NFB, IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-1 associated PI3- kinase, ICAM, VCAM and e-selectin mRNAs.

 Fat Induced Insulin Resistance and Atherosclerosis@highlight

The overall objective of the current proposal is to strengthen the putative link between FFA induced insulin resistance and atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASVD).

 To this end, the investigators will test the following hypotheses: 1) that FFA induced activation of protein kinase C II (PKC II) and and other serine kinases such as IB kinase (IKK) in human muscle is associated with a decrease in insulin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and of IRS-1 associated phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase; 2) that these changes precede the development of insulin resistance; 3) that the decrease in IB- results in activation of nuclear factor B (NFB) and the expression of adhesion molecules and cytokines; 4) that PKC and IKK are involved in producing insulin resistance and activation of the IB/ NFB pathway and lastly 5) that the same mechanisms operative in healthy volunteers are also operative in patients with T2DM.

The investigators will test these hypotheses in normal (current) and diabetic volunteers (previously completed) .

 Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps will be performed with and without co-infusion of lipid plus heparin (to raise FFAs) and by obtaining serial muscle and fat biopsies and blood samples will be obtained for measurement of substrates, hormones, enzymes and metabolites.
