(firstQuint)An Observational Study of the Functional Capacity of Heart Failure.

 This observational study will evaluate the functional capacity (ability to walk and distance walked) of patients with Heart failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) in approximately 50-70 patients who present with Acute Heart Failure to approximately 5-6 hospital sites in the USA.

 All enrolled patients will be evaluated for their baseline functional capacity.

 Patients will receive standard Acute Heart Failure therapy and will be serially assessed for change in their functional capacity.
