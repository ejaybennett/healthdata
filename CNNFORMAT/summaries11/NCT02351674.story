(thirdQuint)Retrospective Cohort Study on Post Analysis on the Link Between the Clinical Heart Rate and Outcomes During PCI.

 The study requires those data including subjects aged from 20 to 80 year-old, diagnosed as coronary heart disease with records on mean clinical heart rate during PCI from 2009.

1 to 2014.

5 in the database from the department of cardiology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing.

 All 15,000 subjects' related data from the database will be collected.

Once selected, 15,000 patients in the retrospective cohort will be divided into 4 groups according to their mean clinical resting heart rate during PCI.

 Group 1 will be defined as subjects' mean clinical resting heart rate 70 BPM, which will be set as baseline.

 Group 2 will be defined as subjects' mean clinical resting heart rate between 71 to 80 BPM.

 Group 3 will be defined as subjects' mean clinical resting heart rate between 81 to 90 BPM.

 Group 4 will be defined as subjects' mean clinical resting heart rate >90 BPM.

 The primary endpoint is to determine the link between the mean perioperative heart rate and short-term outcomes during PCI among local CHD patients.
