(thirdQuint)Impact of Respiratory Physiotherapy in the Management of Infectious Pleural Effusion.

 This is a multicenter, prospective and randomized trial.

 Objective: To determine if the Chest physiotherapy (CP) associated with conventional medical treatment (CT) improves functional sequelae secondary to pleural infectious disease, defined as an increased of 15% in Vital Functional Capacity (VFC).

 Adult patients with diagnosis of pleural infection will be included and randomized into two branches: control group - only CT and interventional one - CT plus CP.

 Impact of Respiratory Physiotherapy in the Management of Infectious Pleural Effusion@highlight

Chest physiotherapy (CP) facilitates the absorption of fluid in the pleural cavity and reduces the formation of fibrous adhesions in patients with pleural infection, allowing a faster clinical, functional and radiological improve.

 The aim of the study is to determine if the CP associated with conventional medical treatment (CT) improves functional sequelae secondary to pleural infectious.
