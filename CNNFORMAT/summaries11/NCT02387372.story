(firstQuint)Plasma Pharmacokinetics (PK) & Lung Penetration of Ceftolozane/Tazobactam in Participants With Pneumonia (MK-7625A-007).

 This is a Phase 1, prospective, multicenter, non-comparative, open-label study to characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics and intrapulmonary penetration of ceftolozane/tazobactam in two groups of participants.

 Group 1: approximately 25 ventilated participants with suspected or proven pneumonia receiving concurrent standard antibiotic therapy.

 Within Group 1, efforts will be made to enroll approximately 5 participants with a CLCR 150 mL/min (as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation).

 Group 2: 8-10 critically ill participants with CLCR 180 mL/min (as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation).
