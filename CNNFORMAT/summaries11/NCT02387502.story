(fifthQuint)Comparison of Three Laryngoscopes in Difficult Laryngoscopy.

 Airtraq laryngoscope is an optical laryngoscope which allows visualization of vocal cord as a reflected image through multiple lenses and prisms.

 MacCoy laryngoscope is a modification of Macintosh laryngoscope.

 It has a lever which, when pressed, moves its flexible tip.

 In the investigators' study, the researchers compared the performances of Airtraq laryngoscope with MacCoy and Macintosh laryngoscopes in simulated difficult laryngoscopy using a rigid neck collar.

 The researchers recruited 120 patients and randomly divided those patients into three equal groups i.

e.

 30 patients in each group.

 These three groups are 1-Airtraq, 2-MacCoy and 3-Macintosh.

 The researchers compared efficacy and safety in these three laryngoscopes.

 The researchers compared efficacy in terms of time of intubation, ease of intubation, overall success, Intubation difficulty score, visualization of vocal cord in terms of POGO (percentage of Glottic Opening) score.

 The researchers compared safety in terms of hemodynamic pressor response and airway trauma.

Tracheal intubation requires alignment of oro-pharyngeal-laryngeal axes.

 When these three axes are not aligned, intubation becomes difficult.

 In the researchers' study, the investigators simulated difficult laryngoscopy situation by using a rigid neck collar.

 This neck collar renders intubation difficult not only by restricting neck movement, but also reducing mouth opening.

 The investigators compared the performance of Macintosh, MacCoy and Airtraq laryngoscope in simulated difficult laryngoscopy using a rigid neck collar.
