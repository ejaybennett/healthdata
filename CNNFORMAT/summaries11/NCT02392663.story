(thirdQuint)Sputum Clearance Effects of Hypertonic Saline in Non-cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis.

 The present study will be a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial.

 Each nebulized solution [hypertonic saline (7%); hyaluronic acid + hypertonic saline (7%); isotonic saline (0,9%)] will be administrated during 4 days.

 After each inhalation, all patients will carry out a bronchial drainage session (autogenic drainage technique).

 All patients recruited will perform the three arms of intervention.

 In this way, each patient will be able to act as his/her own control.

 A 7 days washout period will be required among the different solutions to avoid carryover effects.

 During the study period the patients' pharmacological treatment remained unchanged.

 Sputum Clearance Effects of Hypertonic Saline in Non-cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis@highlight

This study aims to analyze whether the hypertonic saline nebulization enhances sputum clearance effects, reduces the impact on cough severity and their level of safety and tolerability in a population with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE).

 In addition, this trial aims to compare these health outcomes among 3 nebulized solutions: hypertonic saline (7%); hyaluronic acid + hypertonic saline (7%); isotonic saline (0,9%).
