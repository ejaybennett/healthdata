 Diagnostic Tools for Parkinson's Disease@highlight

The study aims to identify genetic variants associated to Parkinson's disease through the analysis of exome-sequencing data of familial cases and controls.

 The identified variants will be used to generate a diagnostic tool for the identification of genetic risk profiles.
