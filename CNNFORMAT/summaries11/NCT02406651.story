(thirdQuint)Study of IL-22 IgG2-Fc (F-652) for Subjects With Grade II-IV Lower GI aGVHD.

 This is a Phase IIa single arm open-label study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of F-652 in combination with systemic corticosteroids in subjects who have undergone HSCT and have newly diagnosed grade II-IV lower GI aGVHD.

 The HSCT may be derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood.

 The PK of F-652 in this subject population will be investigated.

 Subjects may be replaced if subject withdrawal is not related to safety or treatment response.

 F-652 will be administered in conjunction with prednisone (or equivalent) at the time of the onset of clinical symptoms consistent with GI and/or liver aGVHD.

 Prednisone (or equivalent) will be given at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day and tapered as per protocol.

 F-652 will be administered intravenously at a rate of 100 mL/hour for one hour once per week for four weeks.

 A total of 4 doses will be administered at a dose of 45 1/2g/kg each.

 Subjects will be followed for safety and efficacy through Day 180, and subject survival status will be collected at Day 365.

 In the first stage of the trial, a total of 16 subjects will be enrolled.

 If six or fewer have a Day 28 treatment response, the trial will close due to a lack of efficacy.

 If seven or more have a response, an additional 11 subjects will be enrolled into study for a total sample size of 27.

 During the course of a subject's therapy, dose reduction may occur on an individual basis as per protocol.

A Phase IIa single arm open-label study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of F-652 in combination with systemic corticosteroids in subjects who have undergone Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) and have newly diagnosed grade II-IV lower GI acute Graft Verses Host Disease (aGVHD).

 Treatment with F-652 will be once a week for 4 weeks, with post treatment follow up visits on days 28, 56, 180 and 365.
