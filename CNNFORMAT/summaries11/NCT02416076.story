(thirdQuint)Ultherapy for Treating the Face and Neck Using Standard Versus Simulines Transducers.

 This is a prospective, multi-center, split-face, randomized pilot trial to determine the clinical feasibility of the simulines transducers, i.

e.

, transducers which deliver two lines of treatment simultaneously (at once), in comparison to the standard transducers which deliver a single treatment line, by collecting average pain scores in the treated regions, as well as efficacy and treatment efficiency data.

 There will be 3 study arms with each arm having 2 treatment groups.

 Enrolled subjects will be randomized to one of two study arms, and one of two treatment groups within each study arm.

to determine which side of the face will be treated with standard transducers and simulines transducers and the energy level for treatment.

 Subjects will receive one dual-depth treatment at 4.

5mm and 3.

0mm depths.

 Clinical feasibility will be assessed based on comfort level of standard transducers versus simulines transducers by comparing average pain scores obtained during study treatment.

 Efficacy will be determined based on qualitative masked assessment of post-treatment photographs compared to pre-treatment photographs and quantitative eyebrow lift measurements.

 Patient satisfaction questionnaires will be obtained.

 Ultherapy for Treating the Face and Neck Using Standard Versus Simulines Transducers@highlight

Up to 40 subjects will be enrolled, randomized and treated.

 Enrolled subjects will receive one, split-face Ulthera(R) treatment on the face and neck using a standard transducer on one side of the face and a simulines transducers on the other side of the face.

 Follow-up visits will occur at 90 and 180 days post-treatment.

 Study images will be obtained pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at each follow-up visit.
