(thirdQuint)Study of Preservation of Ovarian Reserve Function During Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer Patients at Reproductive Age.

 6.

6-12% of women with breast cancer were diagnosed before the age of 40 year and breast cancer accounted for 40% of all cancer in women before the age of 40 year.

Attributed to improved treatment, of which chemotherapy plays a major role, more than 70% of breast cancer patients at reproductive age obtain 10-year survival rates.

 Consequently, the question of pregnancy and premature ovarian failure after breast cancer treatment are presented more frequently.

 Fortunately, most of the available literature provides good evidence that pregnancy after breast cancer may improve survival.

 Unfortunately, no therapy has been shown to preserve fertility in patients receiving chemotherapy so far, although chemotherapy induced ovarian failure ,which finally results in infertility and premature ovarian failure, has been reported 60 years before.

 The greater rate of prepubertal than of postpubertal women with normal ovarian function after chemotherapy supports the concept that the suppressed ovary has a greater tolerance during cytotoxic treatments.

While inhibiting the pituitary ovarian axis, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) is thought to block follicular development and reduce chemotherapy toxicity.

 Several studies had revealed GnRHa co-treatment yielded a statistically significant improvement in the proportion of spontaneous menstrual resumption after chemotherapy, compared to controls.

It is noteworthy that menses and fertility are not necessarily linked.

 Absence of regular menses, particularly if the patient is taking tamoxifen(endocrine therapy for breast cancer), does not necessarily imply lack of fertility.

 Conversely, the presence of menses does not guarantee fertility.

Currently, anti-Mullerian hormone(AMH) is considered as the best biochemical marker for assessment of reproductive capacity in reproductive medicine settings.

 Because it is produced by granulosa cells of growing antral follicles, AMH is significant positive correlation with both quantity and quality of oocytes.

 Moreover, it can be measured on any day for minimal fluctuation during the menstrual cycle.

Antral follicle count (AFC) by vaginal ultrasound is also a good predictor of response to exogenous FSH and correlates independently with the number of oocytes retrieved during in vitro fertilization(IVF).

This study is designed to make sure the effect of GnRHa on the preservation of ovarian reserve function in breast cancer patients at reproductive age treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy by observing the dynamic changes of AMH and AFC pre and post chemotherapy(1 week before chemotherapy, 2 weeks, half a year, 1 year and 2 years following completion of chemotherapy) between two groups(one group will be treated with chemotherapy plus GnRHa, and the other one will be treated with chemotherapy merely), in order to provide more reliable evidence for GnRHa concerning preservation of ovarian reserve function.

 At present, there are few reported trials about it.

 This study is the first prospective study that focus on the premenopausal breast cancer patients who would like to preserve the ovarian function in China.

 The results will be more adaptable in China and other countries in Asia where breast cancer patients' age at diagnosis is younger.

 The outcome of this study may offer breast cancer patients at reproductive age hope of becoming mothers and possessing vigour of youth.

The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (goserelin) on the preservation of ovarian reserve function in breast cancer patients of reproductive age treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy by serial measuring the biochemical marker AMH pre and post chemotherapy
