(fifthQuint)Exercise in Patients With Multiple Myeloma.

 Background Physical exercise for haematological patients is a relevant complementary treatment, including in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) (Jones 2013).

 In hematological cancer, exercise is feasible, safe and beneficial in numerous aspects (aerobic capacity, muscle strength, quality of life (QOL), fatigue, psychosocial wellbeing, treatment-related symptoms and body composition, before, during and after stem cell transplantation (Persoon 2013; Haren 2013).

 Still the evidence for the value of exercise in hematological diseases is sparse, in general and to specific diagnoses (Jones 2013; Fong 2014; Liu 2009).

 Patients with MM may differ from other hematological diseases, by poorer functional status due to skeletal related pain, affected QOL and immune function, but also in return to work and in risk of disability pension, and furthermore physical performance and the time of being physical active is diminished throughout the treatment course and patients do not meet physical activity guidelines (Coleman 2004; Jones 2004; Craike 2013).

 Hence, there is a need to examine the effect of exercise to be able to give evidence based recommendations on exercise in MM patients.

 In Denmark, 320 patients are diagnosed with MM annually.

 The median age at diagnosis is 68-71 years, and the incidence is increasing with age.

 The prevalence increases due to the aging population and improved survival because of improvement in medical treatment (Kyle 2007; Sihori 2006 & 2004; Alexander 2007; Kumar 2008 & 2014).

 Typically, the patient presents with bone pain, anaemia, renal failure, recurrent infections, or for some patients it is detected by chance through screening of blood or urine.

 Bone pain is caused by osteolytic destructions which also may lead to pathological fractures.

 When diagnosed, most patients (80%) will have symptomatic disease and will need start treatment.

 The medical treatment for MM has two aims.

 Firstly, anti-myeloma systemic therapy aims at reducing tumor burden and to prolong disease free survival, and overall survival, and secondly, supportive care aims at preventing serious morbidity from disease complications.

 Younger patients ( both regarding physical function and bone loss, as in the older population (Chin 2008) and in patients with osteoporosis (Hagen 2011; Howe 2011) or as found in the encouraging results regarding bone health among cancer survivors (Winters-Stone 2010).

 The literature suggests that combined training is beneficial in order to maintain or increase BMD and lean body mass among patients with prostate cancer or breast cancer (Bolam 2012; Cormie 2014), among post menopausal women (Martyn-St James 2008 & 2009; Palombaro 2006) and among elderly (Gomez-Cabello 2012).

 Change in bone markers as an effect of exercise have also been investigated, although in different exercise protocols.

 The results from healthy women and men are promising.

 Bone formation markers are significantly increased, without significant changes in bone resorption markers (Shibata 2003; Karabulut 2011).

 OQL, in a disease specific perspective, needs attention since exercise can improve QOL (Persoon 2013; Haren 2013; Mishra 2012 & 2012), and since bone pain is a major problem in patients with MM, it is relevant to investigate pain as a separate outcome.

 It has been demonstrated, that breast cancer survivors meeting physical activity guidelines are significant less likely to report above-average pain than breast cancer survivors not meeting physical activity guidelines, and those who always have been physically active report less pain than inactive women (Forsythe 2013).

 Griffith (2009) have found, that cancer patients report a lower pain level, if they become more physically active (adjusted for age, cancer diagnosis, pretest pain, pretest physical activity/physical functioning), but Forsythe (2013) have demonstrated unchanged pain level despite increase in physical activity.

 These results make it even more important to investigate pain in the investigators set up.

 Physical functioning will have impact on the level of physical activity, which has importance in a long term perspective, but to the investigators knowledge the level of physical activity has not been investigated in patients with MM neither in a prospective design nor with objective measurements.

 Recruitment All patients with newly diagnosed MM at Roskilde Hospital and Odense University Hospital will be screened for eligibility on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, at their first appointment with the physician (hematologist) at time of diagnosis.

 If eligible, the physician will both briefly inform the patient about the project, and give the written participation information.

 Before the next consultation (typically after 2-3 days), the investigator will call the patient with further information and address any questions the patient may have regarding the project before written informed consent is obtained.

If not eligible or the patient does not want to participate, the patient will be registered only by the reason for exclusion.

 Design After inclusion the patients will be randomized 1:1 into an intervention group or control group.

 The participants will be block randomized and stratified to treatment (planned HDT versus (vs.

) non-intensive treatment), performance status (PFS 0-1 vs.

 PFS2) (Oken 1982), and study site (Roskilde vs.

 Odense).

 The intervention will start at day 8 (in the 2nd week) after start of treatment unless safety reasons make it necessary to postpone start of exercise.

 The measurements at all time points will be conducted by experienced, educated investigators (physiotherapists).

 Measurements will preferably be conducted by the same physiotherapist at each site.

 Power calculation The number of patients to be included has been determined by a power calculation, with a significance level, = 0.

05 and 80% power, = 0.

20 and a minimum clinical difference of mean(SD) 7 kg(13.

1) in the knee extensor strength (Groeneveldt 2013), which is the primary outcome (corresponding to an increase of approximately 23 %).

 The number of patients needed, can be estimated to 44 patients in each group (intervention and control).

 Statistical analysis It will be tested whether data follow a normal distribution.

The following description is based on the assumption that data is normally distributed.

 For continuous data in an interval scale, mean(sd) will be used and for data in an ordinal scale, median(range) and quartiles will be used to describe data.

 Differences within group between test times and between groups at all test times will be examined by t-test.

 The significance level is set to ps z transformation and 95%CI will be formed.

 Exercise in Patients With Multiple Myeloma@highlight

The overall aim is to examine whether early initiated, individualized exercise training in patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma, irrespective of age and current performance status, will be beneficial for the patientsphysical function, level of physical activity and quality of life, pain and bone disease.

 The investigators will examine the effect of supervised in-hospital exercise training sessions combined with home-based exercise training, initiated at time of diagnosis.

 The outcomes of interest are physical function, level of physical activity, QOL, pain and bone disease.

 Furthermore, to describe the disease in patients with newly diagnosed MM in relation to physical function, level of physical activity, QOL, pain and bone condition at time of diagnosis.

 The investigators hypotheses are: - Individualized exercise starting at time of diagnosis will have positive effects on physical function, physical activity, QOL and pain.

 - Individualized exercise starting at time of diagnosis will have positive effects on bone disease (bone markers), bone mineral density (BMD) and lean body mass.

 - A higher level of physical function is associated with a higher level of physical activity, less pain, better QOL, and higher BMD and lean body mass.
