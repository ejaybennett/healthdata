(fifthQuint)A Pilot Study to Examine the Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation on Mitochondrial Bioenergetics in Older Adults.

 In the past two decades, the role of vitamin D has extended beyond bone health to encompass a wide range of biological activities important to muscle function in older adults.

 Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations (70 years depending on the cut-point used (25(OH)D 30 ng/mL through vitamin D3 supplementation on 1) bioenergetic profiles of multiple blood cell populations, skeletal muscle mitochondria, and muscle fibers and 2) skeletal muscle mitochondrial mass and biogenesis.

 Hypothesis 1: Bioenergetic capacity as well as respiratory control in muscle mitochondria, muscle fibers, and blood cells will be improved following 4 months of vitamin D3 supplementation.

 Hypothesis 2: Expression of key mitochondrial proteins (VDAC/Porin and COX4) and regulators of mitochondria biogenesis (PGC1a, SIRT1, SIRT3, and TFAM) will be higher following 4 months of vitamin D3 supplementation.

 We plan to recruit individuals only from screen fails of the EVIDENCE study (IRB00022395).

 The EVIDENCE study is enrolling 200 participants whose 25(OH)D concentrations are 18-<30 ng/mL.

 Those whose concentrations are 12-<18 ng/mL at their EVIDENCE screening visit will be approached about participating in this pilot study.

 We will utilize the EVIDENCE screen fails because this is a pilot study with limited funding, the screening labs (25(OH)D) are expensive and the number needed to screen would be cost-prohibitive in a pilot study, and these two studies are run in the same clinic with the same staff.

 All screening measures will occur during the EVIDENCE study and measures will begin for this study at the baseline visit.

 All persons who screen fail for EVIDENCE with a 25(OH)D concentration of 12-<18 ng/mL will be informed that they are not eligible for the EVIDENCE study and will be called with these results.

 If they meet all of the same eligibility criteria for this study which eliminates participants with conditions that may affect their ability to safely perform the neuromuscular function tests, consume vitamin D supplements, or undergo a muscle biopsy, these people will be informed that we have another study for those whose vitamin D levels are insufficient.

 If interested, they will be asked to come in for a baseline visit (as long as this visit can occur within 2 months of their EVIDENCE screening visit).

 Those persons who screened more than 2 months ago for the EVIDENCE study will not be eligible for this study as the lab work and other tests performed may no longer be accurate.

 A Pilot Study to Examine the Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation on Mitochondrial Bioenergetics in Older Adults@highlight

This pilot study is a 4-month open label trial in 15 older (65-89 yrs) men and women with initial 25(OH)D concentrations of 12-30 ng/mL through vitamin D3 supplementation on changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics.

 We will assess the bioenergetic profile of blood cells isolated mitochondria, and muscle fibers as well as the expression of mitochondrial proteins and regulators of mitochondria biogenesis before and after supplementation.

 All participants will be given vitamin D3 (4,000 IU/d) for 4 months.
