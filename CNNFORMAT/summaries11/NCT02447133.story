(firstQuint)TopQ Cut-off Score Validation Study for 3D OCT-1 Maestro.

 Scans with a TopQ score below the optimum cut-off should be considered to be poor or unacceptable quality, and scans with a TopQ score above the cut-off should be considered good or acceptable quality.

 The study will evaluate the predetermined cut-off values by investigating measurement variability of scans.
