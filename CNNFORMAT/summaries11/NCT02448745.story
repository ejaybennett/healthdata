(thirdQuint)Liberia Insecticide Treated Durable Wall Linings Study: Protocol for a Cluster Randomised Trial (DL).

 Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are the established vector control product for malaria control.

 In Bomi County Liberia, LLINs have been distributed but malaria prevalence in children under 5 remains high, with prevalence in study villages found to be 42% in April 2014.

 The major malaria vector species are resistant to pyrethroid insecticides approved for use in LLINs, and new control measures with non-pyrethroid active ingredients may protect the population.

 Liberia Insecticide Treated Durable Wall Linings Study: Protocol for a Cluster Randomised Trial (DL)@highlight

A cluster-randomized control trial will study the effect of insecticide-treated wall lining on malaria transmission in Bomi County, Liberia.

 Half of the villages enrolled in the study will receive insecticide-treated wall lining covering their walls and ceilings in addition to long-lasting insecticidal nets, while the other half will be protected by existing long-lasting insecticidal nets.
