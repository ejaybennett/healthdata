(firstQuint)The Biological Effect of ESWT and the Role of Proinflammatory Cytokines and Cannabinoid Receptor in Shoulder Stiffness.

 1.

 First year:Investigators intend to further delineate the inflammatory mechanism, such as IL-1, CB1, HSP in the incidence of shoulder stiffness.

 2.

 Second year: Investigators intend to conduct a prospective randomized double-blind study for the clinical effect of ESWT on patients with shoulder stiffness.

 3.

 Third year: Investigators wish to test the biologic effect of ESWT on patients with shoulder stiffness and to elucidate the molecular mechanism for this effect through a randomized comparative study.

 The Biological Effect of ESWT and the Role of Proinflammatory Cytokines and Cannabinoid Receptor in Shoulder Stiffness@highlight

Investigators recent data showed anti-inflammatory effect of Effect of Extracorporeal Shockwave Technology (ESWT).

 Little studies focused on the effect and pathomechanism of ESWT on shoulder stiffness.
