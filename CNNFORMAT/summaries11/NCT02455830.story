(firstQuint)Cytokines Associated With Cord Blood Cell Therapy for Neonatal Encephalopathy.

 The effects and mechanisms of umbilical cord blood cell therapy for perinatal brain injury are not well understood.

 This is a multicenter study to measure serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and trophic factors associated with perinatal brain injury and repair in term gestation newborns with neonatal encephalopathy (hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy).

 This study proceeds along with the study "Autologous cord blood cell therapy for neonatal encephalopathy (ClinicalTrials.

gov identifier: NCT02256618)".

 Blood samples are obtained before the first cell infusion, and subsequently 2h, 24h, 48h, and 7 days after the first cell infusion.

 Blood samples are obtained in the same manner from newborns with neonatal encephalopathy who are not receiving the cell therapy.

This is a observational study to assess the effects of and to explore the mechanisms of autologous umbilical cord blood cell therapy for neonatal encephalopathy by way of measuring serum cytokines.
