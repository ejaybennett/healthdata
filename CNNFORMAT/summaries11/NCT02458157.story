(fifthQuint)Forced Fluid Removal in High Risk Acute Kidney Injury.

 Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication in patients admitted to ICU.

 A core element of critical care is resuscitation with crystalloid solutions.

 In many cases fluid accumulates and patients become fluid overloaded (positive fluid balance > 10% of bodyweight).

 This is especially true in patients with AKI, since they often have impaired ability to excrete salt and water.

 Most observational suggests harm with increased positive fluid balance.

 Objectives: To assess feasibility of forced fluid removal with diuretics and/or CRRT in ICU patients with AKI and severe fluid overload, compared to current clinical practice.

 Design: Multicentre, parallel group, randomized, assessor blinded pilot-trial with adequate generation of allocation sequence, and allocation concealment.

 Trial Size: The pilot study is planned to include 50 patients.

 Inclusion is expected to start in August 2015.

 Forced Fluid Removal in High Risk Acute Kidney Injury@highlight

The objective of this pilot trial is to assess the feasibility of forced fluid removal in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with high-risk AKI and severe fluid overload.

 The intervention will use furosemide infusion and/or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to achieve and maintain a neutral cumulative fluid balance.

 The intervention will be compared to standard of care as reflected in the kidney disease improving global outcome (KDIGO) guidelines.
