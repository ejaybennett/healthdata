(thirdQuint)Real World Study: Genotype 1 Chronic HCV Treatment and Evaluation of Real World SVR and PROs.

 This is a Phase IV, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the real world sustained virological response rate, subject adherence, and subject reported outcomes during and after treatment of non-cirrhotic genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C subjects aged 18 years and older, with the AbbVie 3 direct-acting antiviral (3-DAA) regimen of VIEKIRA PAK (ombitasvir, paritaprevir/r, dasubuvir), with or without ribavirin.

 Subjects may be treatment-naive or treatment experienced with pegylated-interferon based regimens excluding regimens with direct-acting antiviral agents.

 The study will be conducted at multiple Kaiser Permanente Southern California Medical Centers.

 The primary objective of this open label study is to evaluate the rate of sustained virological response rate 12 weeks after completion of treatment (SVR12) with VIEKIRA PAK, with or without ribavirin in a large real world setting.
