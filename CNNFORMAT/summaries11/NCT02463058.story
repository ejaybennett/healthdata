(thirdQuint)Evaluating the Physiological Strain Induced by a BC Protective Undergarment Under Exercise-heat Stress.

 In order to physiologically evaluate a new BC protective garment for the Israeli police use under exercise-heat stress conditions, 10 young and healthy civilian volunteers will participate in this study.

 The subjects will undergo 5 experiment days: Recruitment day, one day of acclimatization to heat, and 3 days of performing experiment protocol, each day dressed with different protective garment (Protective garment in current use + NBC mask, new BC protective undergarment + standard combat uniforms, new BC protective undergarment + standard combat uniforms + NBC mask).

 Core (rectal) and skin temperature and heart rate will be monitored continuously, liquid balance will be recorded.

the physiological heat strain will be assessed and compared between the different protective garments.

 Evaluating the Physiological Strain Induced by a BC Protective Undergarment Under Exercise-heat Stress@highlight

Israel ministry of defense is examining a new protective undergarment of GORE company (chempark fabric) for the police forces.

 The goal of this research is to perform a comparative experiment in order to evaluate the physiological strain induced by a BC protective undergarment under exercise-heat stress conditions.
