(secondQuint)Effectiveness of Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Maternal Vaccination Among Pregnant Women and Their Newborns in South Africa.

 Study design Investigators will conduct a vaccination campaign amongst pregnant women in different areas of South Africa and monitor the effectiveness of the programme.

 Investigators will then use an unmatched case-control study design.

 Vaccination campaigns will be conducted in clinics with active promotion of influenza vaccination.

 Posters will be placed in clinics recommending influenza vaccination for pregnant women and health education material will be provided.

 Vaccines will be administered by clinic staff through routine services as vaccination is the recommended standard of care.

 Dedicated study staff (research assistants) will be placed in each clinic offering vaccination.

 These staff will assist clinic staff with management of influenza vaccine supplies and documentation of influenza vaccination status in patient records.

 Vaccination status will be documented in the mother's antenatal records.

 Investigators will visit all the facilities in the area serving the surveillance hospital and conduct staff training in the facilities where babies are delivered to enter maternal influenza immunization status on the child's vaccination card at the time of administration of the birth dose of polio vaccine.

 Identification and enrolment of cases and controls for the estimation of VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalised illness in infants18 years Epidemiologic, clinical presentation, laboratory data as well as information on hospital course will be collected from enrolled patients.

 A case investigation form will be completed by structured interview.

 Information gathered will include: demographics (age, sex, race), presenting symptoms, medical history (lung disease, immunosuppressive or other chronic illness including cardiac diseases, chronic renal diseases, diabetes mellitus and similar metabolic disorders), previous hospital admissions, recent infections, recent antimicrobial use, household characteristics (residence type and number of rooms, number of persons and their ages, questions related to socioeconomic status, exposure to tobacco smoke and indoor air pollution) and data on current and previous influenza vaccination.

 Information on HIV status will include current HIV status and whether the patient has been previously tested for HIV and results of such tests, previous HIV-associated diagnosis, HIV staging.

 Obesity evaluated measuring weight (in kilograms) and length (in centimetres) at the time of admission.

 Medical records will be reviewed for inpatient management (antimicrobial use, influenza antiviral therapy and results of investigations conducted) and outcome (admission to ICU, discharged or died).

 Monitoring adverse events The diary will be taken home by the participant.

 Telephone contact will be made with the participant by a study staff member on day eight (or day 7, 9 or 10 if day 8 falls over a weekend) and the contents of the diary will be recovered telephonically.

 If the study staff are not able to contact the participant on the first attempt, three further documented attempts will be made to contact the patient.

 Participants will also be request to return their diaries at their next clinic visit.

 Participating women will be asked to contact the study team if she is hospitalized for any reason in the seven days post-vaccination.

 A member of the study team will visit the woman in hospital and, using a predesigned form, collect data on the reason for hospitalization.

 Logs recording the enrolled patients with their contact details will be kept at each site.

 Completed data collection forms will be returned to the data centre at NICD for data capture and storage.

 Effectiveness of Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Maternal Vaccination Among Pregnant Women and Their Newborns in South Africa@highlight

This is a case-control study embedded in a surveillance system to determine the effectiveness of antenatal maternal influenza vaccination against laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalised illness in infants <6 months of age.
