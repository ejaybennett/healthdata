(fifthQuint)An Efficacy and Safety Study of Sirukumab in Participants With Major Depressive Disorder.

 A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of sirukumab as adjunctive treatment to a monoaminergic antidepressant in adults with major depressive disorder.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo or sirukumab 50 milligram (mg) at a ratio of 1:1 at Day 1, 28 and 56.

 Participants will primarily be assessed for change from baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17) score at Week 12.

 Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

 An Efficacy and Safety Study of Sirukumab in Participants With Major Depressive Disorder@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of sirukumab as adjunctive treatment to antidepressant therapy (monoaminergic antidepressant) where sirukumab (administered as a 50 milligram (mg) subcutaneous (SC) injection at Day 1, Day 28 and Day 56 during the 12- week double-blind treatment period) is compared to adjunctive placebo based on the change from baseline to 12-week endpoint in depressive symptoms as measured by the total score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), in participants diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who have had a suboptimal response to the current standard oral antidepressant therapy and have a screening high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) >=0.

300 milligram per deciliters (mg/dL) (International System of Units (SI) 3.

00 mg/L).

 A cohort of subjects with hsCRP <0.

300 milligram per deciliter will also be enrolled to allow a better understanding of the relationship between CRP and clinical changes.
