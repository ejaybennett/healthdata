(fifthQuint)Facilitating Migraine Medication Adherence and Optimizing Medication Use.

 Objective 1.

 To examine the feasibility and user usage patterns/demand of an online intervention designed to enhance adherence and optimize abortive medication-use for migraineurs.

 Goal 1: To evaluate the practical utility of an Internet-based user environment to host an intervention designed to increase knowledge of and facilitate adherence and optimize abortive medication use.

 Hypothesis 1A: That an Internet-based user environment can be appropriately suited to deliver an adherence intervention that, in turn, could be made widely accessible and readily employed.

 Hypothesis 1B: That a high proportion of patients referred to the adherence facilitation Web site will actually visit and make use of the adherence intervention Web site.

 Hypothesis 1C: That once the Web-based intervention is initiated, a low attrition rate will be observed and the majority of patients will complete the intervention.

 Objective 2.

 To examine the efficacy of an online adherence facilitation and medication optimization intervention in increasing knowledge of optimal abortive medication-use.

 Goal 2: To conduct a pilot trial examining the efficacy of an adherence and medication optimization intervention for improving knowledge and medication-use behavior in a wide range of migraine sufferers.

 Hypothesis 2A: That patients who complete the Web-based intervention will demonstrate improved knowledge of optimal abortive medication strategies at post-treatment and this knowledge will be maintained at follow-up.

 Hypothesis 2B: That patients who complete the Web-based intervention will report improved abortive medication use strategies at post-treatment and this behavior change will be maintained at follow-up.

 Facilitating Migraine Medication Adherence and Optimizing Medication Use@highlight

The present research will pilot-test a new state-of-the-art Internet-based intervention targeting adherence facilitation and optimization of medication use, and will be evaluated to assess its utility in facilitating adherence and optimization of medication use for acute migraine pharmacotherapy.

 This is not an interventional study and will instead be an observational assessment of the feasibility of an online program (a proof-of-concept study).

 The two principal objectives of this study include: (a) examination of the feasibility and user usage patterns of an Internet-based intervention designed to potentially enhance adherence to medication use recommendations, and (b) determination of the efficacy of the Internet-based intervention in potentially increasing knowledge of abortive medication-use guidelines and in improving adherence to those guidelines.

 To meet the objectives of this study, a website has been specifically developed including a series of supplemental text-based headache materials and a series of videos based social learning theory and modeling principles (as opposed to the stereotypical 'talking-heads' mode of information delivery).
