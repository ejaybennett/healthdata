(fifthQuint)Early Precut Versus Pancreatic Stent for Post-ERCP Pancreatitis.

 It is well known that pancreatitis is the most common and dreadful complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

 Historically, precut sphincterotomy has been regarded as a risk factor for post-ERCP pancreatitis.

 However, some evidence has suggested that if used at an early point during the procedure, it may actually behave as a protective factor.

 In high risk patients, such as those patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, pancreatic duct stent placement has been considered to be a prophylactic measure against pancreatitis.

 However, pancreatic duct stent placement can sometimes be a cumbersome procedure, and may require additional procedures (mainly if spontaneous stent dislodgment is not accomplished).

 There is no evidence comparing early precut versus pancreatic duct stent placement in high-risk patients.

 As a consequence, the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of early precut sphincterotomy versus pancreatic duct stent placement in patients presenting at least one risk factor for post-ERCP pancreatitis and difficult biliary cannulation.

 A single-blinded, randomized trial was undertaken.

 Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria who presented with difficult biliary cannulation during ERCP were randomized to early precut or persistence in biliary cannulation with a sphincterotome with posterior pancreatic duct stent placement.

 The incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis as well as other complications were compared between groups.

 Early Precut Versus Pancreatic Stent for Post-ERCP Pancreatitis@highlight

BACKGROUND: The most common complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is pancreatitis.

 Precut sphincterotomy has been regarded as a risk factor.

 However, early precut may actually reduce post-ERCP pancreatitis risk.

 However, early precut as a preventive measure has not been compared to other preventive measures, such as pancreatic duct stent placement.

 AIM: To compare the efficacy of early precut sphincterotomy versus pancreatic duct stent placement in high-risk subjects undergoing ERCP.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single-blinded, randomized trial that took place in two tertiary referral centers in Buenos Aires.

 ERCP subjects shall present at least one of the following risk factors: female sex, age less than 40 years, clinical suspicion of Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, previous pancreatitis, common bile duct diameter of less than 8 mm.

 Only those who present a difficult biliary cannulation shall be randomized into two groups: those who receive early precut sphincterotomy or those in whom persistency of biliary cannulation is intended with subsequent pancreatic duct stent placement after cholangiography is achieved.

 The incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis as well as other complications shall be compared.
