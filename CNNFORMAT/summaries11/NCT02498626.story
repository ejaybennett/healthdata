(thirdQuint)Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation From Central Venous Line, Venous Side of Heart Lung Machine and the Pulmonary Artery.

 Forty children aged from 1-15 years undergoing correction for different congenital heart procedures with cardiopulmonary bypass [CPB] were included in this study.

 Simultaneous samples were taken from the central venous line, pulmonary artery, and from venous side of the heart lung machine.

 Samples were taken after 10 minutes on full CPB and at the end of surgery before end of CPB.

 Bland and Altman plots were used to study the agreement between venous saturations.

 Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation From Central Venous Line, Venous Side of Heart Lung Machine and the Pulmonary Artery@highlight

This study was designed to examine if venous saturations from the central venous line and from the venous side of the heart lung machine are interchangeable or not with mixed venous saturation from the pulmonary artery in children undergoing open heart surgery for correction of various congenital heart defects.
