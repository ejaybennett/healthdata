(thirdQuint)The Pacing vs No Pacing Study - PNP Study.

 The aim is to compare, in terms of procedural success and safety, the procedure of percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) without rapid ventricular pacing with the same procedure carried out with the aid of rapid ventricular pacing.

 It is a pilot study with the objective to enroll 100 consecutive patients matching inclusion and exclusion criteria who are randomized 1:1 in two arms: in the first patients undergo procedure of BAV without rapid pacing, in the second BAV with rapid ventricular pacing able to help in balloon stabilization during inflations.

 Efficacy will be studied analysing changes in transvalvular gradient from baseline to post-BAV.

 Safety outcomes will be collected both at discharge and at 30-day.

 Other procedural data will be object of direct comparison.

 The Pacing vs No Pacing Study - PNP Study@highlight

Pilot interventional study, without drug, randomized 1: 1, open-label comparison of efficacy and safety between the technique of percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty without rapid ventricular pacing vs valvuloplasty during rapid ventricular pacing (using a temporary pacemaker device with CE mark).

 It is expected to enroll 100 patients.

 Randomization is done through a dedicated computer program.
