(fifthQuint)Study of Intratumoral G100 With Or Without Pembrolizumab In Patients With Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 This is a multi-center Phase 1/2 open label trial of intratumoral G100 in patients with low grade NHL.

 Patients with NHL who are to be treated with local radiation will be enrolled and receive G100 to an accessable tumor mass.

 Clinical response will be evaluated in the injected lesion and systemic (abscopal) responses will be evaluated in distal areas involved with tumor.

 The study will be conducted in 3 parts.

 In Part 1, Dose Escalation, 2 sequentially enrolled cohorts of patients will be treated at one of 2 dose levels of G100 using a standard escalation design.

 In this portion of the study, both follicular and marginal zone NHL will eligible.

 In Part 2, 2 groups of patients with follicular NHL may be examined.

 One group will be randomly assigned to receive either single agent G100 intratumorally at the maximum safe dose determined in Part 1 following local radiation or will receive the same treatment regimen sequentially administered with pembrolizumab.

 A second treatment group may be explored if the safety profile in Part 1 is acceptable.

 In this optional group, patients with injectable tumors of 4 cm or greater would be enrolled and treated with a higher dose of G100.

 In Part 3, expansion of a higher dose (20 mu g of G100) in patients with follicular NHL will be enrolled to receive local radiation therapy and intratumoral G100 (no tumor size requirement in this arm).

 The primary goal of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of different doses of G100 when administered by intratumoral injection.

 The development of anti-tumor immune responses and preliminary evidence of clinical responses in local and distal tumor sites will also be examined.

 Study of Intratumoral G100 With Or Without Pembrolizumab In Patients With Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@highlight

This is a Phase 1/2 open label trial of G100 in patients with low grade NHL.

 G100 is composed of glucopranosyl lipid A in a stable emulsion and is a potent TLR4 (toll-like receptor-4) agonist.

 G100 will be administered by direct injection (intratumorally) into tumors of low grade NHL following standard low dose radiation therapy.

 Preclinical models and clinical studies in other cancers such as Merkel cell carcinoma have demonstrated that G100 administered in this manner can alter the tumor microenvironment, activate dendritic cells, T cells and other immune cells and induce systemic anti-tumor immune responses.

 In this trial, the safety, immunogenicity, and clinical efficacy of G100 will be examined alone or with pembrolizumab.
