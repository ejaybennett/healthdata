(thirdQuint)HEMOBLAST Pilot Clinical Investigation.

 HEMOBLAST cent Bellows is intended for use in surgical procedures as an adjunct to hemostasis when control of bleeding by conventional procedures is ineffective or impractical.

 This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm pilot clinical investigation.

 There will be 36 subjects enrolled across 4 investigational sites.

 The subjects will be followed at hospital charge and 6 weeks postoperatively.

 The primary endpoint of this clinical investigation is the mean paired Kappa statistic for the assignment of SBSS scores by 2 Investigators.

 Secondary endpoints of this clinical investigation consist of: - Proportion of subjects achieving hemostasis within 6 minutes of HEMOBLAST cent Bellows application; - Proportion of subjects achieving hemostasis within 10 minutes of HEMOBLAST cent Bellows application; - Proportion of subjects achieving hemostasis within 3 minutes of HEMOBLAST cent Bellows application; and - Incidence of adverse events through final follow-up.
