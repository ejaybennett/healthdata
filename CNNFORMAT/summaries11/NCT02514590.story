(secondQuint)Wireless High Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation for Chronic Pain.

 This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized study in which subjects will receive a Freedom SCS System and be randomized 1:1 to receive either HF (10,000 Hz) or LF (5 Hz to 1500 Hz) stimulation parameters.

 Enrollment will continue until 80 responders at end of trial have been identified.

 A description of the Freedom SCS System can be found in Appendix A.

 Subjects will have chronic back or back and leg pain refractory to standard medical treatment associated with Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS).

 Subjects will be randomized into either the test (high frequency) or control (low frequency) group for a 6-month period after a maximum one-month trial period.

 At the end of 6 months follow-up, all subjects will assess the outcomes of their appointed therapy and continue with long-term use of the system.

 Stimulators will be placed at the following sites to target the painful area: - High Frequency (HF) Group: Epidural Space midline covering vertebrae levels T8 through T11 (one stimulator placed at the top of T8 and the second stimulator placed at the middle of T9).

 - Low Frequency (LF) Group: Epidural Space covering vertebrae level determined by paresthesia mapping for painful area.
