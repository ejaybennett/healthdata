(fifthQuint)The Correlation Between Testosterone and Cortisol Level and Inflammatory Markers Levels in Type 2 Diabetic Men.

.

 Eligible participants are type 2 diabetic men who visit our clinic, as part of their routine medical surveillance, and other 10 healthy volunteers (men) as a control group.

 All the participants will sign an informed consent form.

 The study will include 30 type 2 diabetic men, (40-55 years old) and 10 healthily volunteers (same age group).

 In addition to routine blood test of blood count, kidney function and liver enzymes will be taken blood samples of total testosterone serum levels, total cortisol serum levels and serum inflammation markers levels, and also a sample of head-hair for cortisol and testosterone levels (1 cm of occipital hair weighing 50 mg).

 Optional: from patients who will agree to visit the clinic after 8 hours-fast will be also taken one additional blood sample of fasting glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels, in order to estimate their insulin resistance status, and it's possible correlation to the other measures.

 From the 10 healthy volunteers In addition will be taken blood and hair samples of the above parameters, as a control.

 The Correlation Between Testosterone and Cortisol Level and Inflammatory Markers Levels in Type 2 Diabetic Men.

@highlight

Many type 2 diabetic men have low serum testosterone levels.

 Our aim in this trial is to check if there is a correlation between serum or hair testosteron levels and serum or hair cortisol levels in type 2 diabetic men.

 We'll also examine whether there is a correlation between serum and hair testosterone levels and cortisol levels and serum inflammatory markers.

 If such correlation will be found- then it is possible that excess cortisol or an abnormal inflammatory status- may cause the low testosterone levels that seen in type 2 diabetic men.
