(thirdQuint)Treatment of Proximal Interphalangeal Joint Injuries.

 Clinical Efficiency of Syndactyly Treatment and Digital Compression.

 Proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) injuries of the fingers are a common occurrence.

 They may be treated various ways: strict immobilization in a finger splint for one to three weeks, syndactyly, no immobilization.

 Immobilization is often responsible for joint stiffness whereas immediate mobilization might produce pain.

 Injuries to the joints of the hand produce edema that is responsible for additional stiffness.

 Compressive garment may be worn to limit the extent of the edema and help its resorption.

 Although PIPJ injuries are frequent, their treatment does not benefit from a consensus.

 Most studies are retrospective or aimed at a pediatric population.

 The investigators wish to evaluate the outcome of PIPJ injury after different treatments: either strict immobilization in a rigid splint for three weeks, of relative immobilization in a syndactyly for three weeks.

The investigators also wish to study the effect of finger compression on edema resolution and finger motion.

 Therefore there will be four treatment groups: syndactyly with and without compression, rigid splint with and without compression.

 The study will be conducted in the hand surgery unit of a university hospital in a prospective way.

 The assignment to a particular treatment group will be randomly performed.

 Patients will be followed for 6 months.

 Clinical Efficiency of Syndactyly Treatment and Digital Compression@highlight

Proximal interphalangeal joint injuries of the fingers may be treated in various ways and no treatment has been shown to be superior.

 The investigators wish to study the effectiveness of syndactyly versus digital splint when comparing joint mobility.

 The investigators also wish to study the effectiveness of finger compression in reducing edema and therefore allowing a greater arc of motion.
