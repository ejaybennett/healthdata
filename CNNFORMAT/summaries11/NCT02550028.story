(thirdQuint)Levetiracetam Treatment of Neonatal Seizures.

 This project aims to improve the treatment of neonatal seizures.

 Current treatments are poorly effective and have significant side effects.

 Levetiracetam has great potential as a treatment for neonatal seizures but is not approved for use in children less than 1 years of age by oral.

 This study aims to obtain essential data regarding the efficacy and safety of oral Levetiracetam in neonatal population and simultaneously to use EEG monitoring systems that facilitate seizure detection and research.

 Specific aims are: 1.

 To determine the efficacy of oral Levetiracetam in terminating neonatal seizures by EEG in the Neonatal Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NNICU).

 2.

 To determine dose escalation data by studying the additional efficacy of a further dose in non responders.

 3.

 To determine additional pharmacokinetic data to confirm findings from our previous pharmacokinetic study.

 4.

 To determine further safety data of oral Levetiracetam in neonates.

 Levetiracetam Treatment of Neonatal Seizures@highlight

Current treatments for the brain damaging complication of neonatal seizures are unsatisfactory.

 A multi-centre Chinese clinical trials with the aim to using oral Levetiracetam to develop new treatment strategies for the treatment of neonatal seizures.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the correct oral dosing, safety and efficacy for oral Levetiracetam as first line treatment in term new born babies with seizures.
