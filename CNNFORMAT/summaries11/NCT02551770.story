(secondQuint)Emdogain Minimally Invasive Surgical Technique.

 The aim of the study will be achieved through the following primary and secondary objectives.

 The primary objective is to evaluate the regenerative potential of Straumann Emdogain by comparing the change in clinical attachment level from baseline to 12 months between the test and control arms.

 The regenerative potential of Straumann Emdogain will also be assessed by comparing the changes in gingival margins, changes in average probing pocket depth, changes in full mouth plaque score, changes in bleeding on probing, and changes in root dentin hypersensitivity from baseline to 12 months between the test and control arms.
