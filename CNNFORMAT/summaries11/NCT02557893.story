(secondQuint)Effects of Resistance Exercise During Pregnancy.

 A parallel group trial was completed at a single site.

 Second trimester women (n=134) were randomly assigned (in blocks of 3) to 12-weeks of wait list, bi-monthly pregnancy education classes or twice weekly low-to-moderate intensity resistance training.

 Resistance training involved one abdominal exercise with no external load and five exercises with an external load that gradually progressed (leg extension, leg press, arm lat pull, leg curl, and lumbar extension).

 Several outcomes were assessed including physical function, quality of life and mood.
