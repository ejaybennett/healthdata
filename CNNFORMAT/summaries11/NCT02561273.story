(fifthQuint)Combination Chemotherapy and Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II-IV Peripheral T-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide in combination with standard induction therapy (CHOEP- cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin [doxorubicin hydrochloride], etoposide, vincristine [vincristine sulfate] and prednisone) in patients with newly diagnosed stage II, III and IV peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (NOS), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase [ALK] negative) (ALK positive if International Prognostic Index [IPI] 3, 4, or 5), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma or hepatosplenic gamma delta T-cell lymphoma.

 II.

 To establish the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide in combination with CHOEP chemotherapy.

 (Phase I) III.

 To assess the efficacy (complete response rate) of this combination.

 (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) of the combination of lenalidomide and CHOEP chemotherapy.

 II.

 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the regimen.

 III.

 To assess the 2 year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) using this regimen.

 OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide, followed by a phase II study.

 Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV), doxorubicin hydrochloride IV and vincristine sulfate IV on day 1, etoposide IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1-3, prednisone orally (PO) on days 1-5, and lenalidomide PO on days 1-10.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients responding after 6 courses of treatment may then undergo an autologous stem cell transplant or receive maintenance lenalidomide at the discretion of the physician or patient choice as follows: TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo autologous stem cell transplant per standard of care.

 MAINTENANCE LENALIDOMIDE: Patients receive lenalidomide PO on days 1-21.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.

 Combination Chemotherapy and Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II-IV Peripheral T-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@highlight

This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together with combination chemotherapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage II-IV peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Lenalidomide may stop the growth of peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for cancer growth.

 Giving combination chemotherapy with lenalidomide may be a better treatment for peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
