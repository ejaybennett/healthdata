(thirdQuint)A Smoking Cessation Intervention for Yale Dining Employees.

 The primary aim of this study is to test the effect of a smoking cessation intervention provided to Yale University dining hall employees on smoking quit rates and quit attempts at the end of six weeks of treatment.

 It is hypothesized that participants from the test site will have higher rates of smoking cessation and quit attempts compared to participants from the control site.

 In addition, this study will examine the number of participants who enroll in the smoking cessation program who successfully quit smoking at 6 months.

 There will be 3 test sites and 3 control sites in this study (broken down into 3 pairs of test/control).

 Each test site will be matched to on a control site.

 Self-reported smoking status will be obtained for all participants in the test and control sites at 3 time points (baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months).

 The study start time for each pair will be delayed by 4-8 weeks for feasibility issues.
