(secondQuint)"Neutral Head Position" and "Head-lift Position" for Orotracheal Intubation With "Trachway" Intubating Stylet in Adults.

 The sniffing position has traditionally been considered the optimal head position for direct laryngoscopy, However, it may aggravate cervical spine injury.

 The Trachway(R) video stylet is an intubating device that may avoid cervical movement during intubation.

 Nonetheless, the effectiveness of limited neck movement in patients with neutral head or head-lift position using the Trachway(R) video stylet remains unclear.

 The purpose of this study was to compare the intubation time of the two positions with the Trachway(R) video stylet.
