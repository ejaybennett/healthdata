(thirdQuint)Decipher Genomics Resource Information Database.

 Observational study involving the release of genome-wide expression data allowing participating institutions to pair these data with clinical treatment and outcome data for patients in whom Decipher testing was performed.

 Through these collaborations, the GRID database population will be used to characterize the genomics of cancer and discover new gene expression signatures that may be useful for expanding the current understanding of the biology of the disease.

 Decipher Genomics Resource Information Database@highlight

To prospectively evaluate the utility of genomic expression data as a tool to better characterize the tumors of individual patients, and to understand how genomic information from individual patients undergoing routine clinical testing can be used in population-level analysis to improve treatment and outcomes.
