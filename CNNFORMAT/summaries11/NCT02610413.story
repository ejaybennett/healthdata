(thirdQuint)Whole Exome Sequencing in Finding Causative Variants in Germline DNA Samples From Patients With Hypertension Receiving Bevacizumab for Breast Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To identify, using next generation sequencing, rare variants of large effect size that impact the risk of hypertension in patients from the clinical trial Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)-5103 (E5103).

 OUTLINE: Previously collected germline DNA samples are analyzed via whole exome sequencing.

 Whole Exome Sequencing in Finding Causative Variants in Germline DNA Samples From Patients With Hypertension Receiving Bevacizumab for Breast Cancer@highlight

This research trial studies whole exome sequencing in finding causative variants in germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from patients with hypertension receiving bevacizumab for breast cancer.

 Studying samples of germline DNA in the laboratory from patients with hypertension receiving bevacizumab for breast cancer may help doctors learn about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to hypertension.
