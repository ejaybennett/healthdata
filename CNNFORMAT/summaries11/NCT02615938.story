(firstQuint)Hydroxychloroquin (HCQ) in Pediatric Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD).

 This study is an explorative, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled investigation of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in pediatric ILD.

 The treatments are organized in START and STOP blocks, which can be initiated in sequence, as needed by the subjects.

 Each patient can participate in each block only once.

 In the START block subjects are randomized to parallel-groups, then the placebo group is switched to active drug.

 In the STOP block, subjects on HCQ are randomized into parallel-groups treated with placebo or HCQ to investigate the withdrawal of HCQ for assessment of its efficacy.
