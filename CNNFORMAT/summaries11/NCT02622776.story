(firstQuint)Advanced Methods for Cancer Detection by Vaginal Screening.

 Most high grade ovarian cancers originate in the fallopian tubes.

 Since the lining of the fallopian tube opens into the uterine cavity cancer cells from ovarian/fallopian tube cancers can travel through the uterus to the cervix and vagina.

 Likewise, endometrial cancer cells shed through the cervix into the vagina.

 It may be possible to develop a screening test for ovarian and endometrial cancers by collecting vaginal cells.

This pilot study is the first step in the development of an new assay that may be further tested as a screening method for ovarian and endometrial cancers.
