(fifthQuint)Study of Copanlisib in Combination With Standard Immunochemotherapy in Relapsed Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (iNHL).

 Patients should be in need of and fit for immunochemotherapy and should not be resistant to rituximab (resistance defined as lack of response, or progression within 6 months of the last course of treatment with a rituximab containing regimen).

 This study will be composed of two parts: Safety run-in and phase III part.

 The purpose of the safety run-in part of this study is to assess whether the drug being tested (copanlisib) in combination with standard immunochemotherapy (R-B or R-CHOP) is safe and at what dose level of the study drug (copanlisib - 45mg or 60 mg) patients are able to tolerate the study treatment combination.

 In addition to finding a safe and tolerable dose level for the phase III part of the study, efficacy will also be evaluated for patients that stay on the study treatment during the safety run-in.

 The phase III part of the study will start when the recommended dose of copanlisib in combination with R-CHOP and R-B has been defined and confirmed by sponsor, principal investigator and Data Monitoring Committee.

 A maximum of 24 patients will take part in the safety run-in part of this study.

 In the phase III part approximately 520 patients will be randomly assigned to blinded treatment arms of copanlisib plus R-B or R-CHOP or placebo plus R-B or R-CHOP.

 Study of Copanlisib in Combination With Standard Immunochemotherapy in Relapsed Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (iNHL)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess whether copanlisib in combination with standard immunochemotherapy (rituximab in combination with bendamustine [R-B] and rituximab in combination with a 4 drug combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone/prednisolone [R-CHOP]) is effective and safe, compared with placebo in combination with standard immunochemotherapy (R-B or R-CHOP) in patients with relapsed iNHL who have received at least one, but at most three, lines of treatment, including rituximab-based immunochemotherapy and alkylating agents.
