(firstQuint)QVA Mechanistic Efficacy Study (Receptor Effects, Etc).

 Current physiological measures of small airway dysfunction are limited, subject to a high degree of variability and do not allow a quantitative assessment of global and regional ventilation defects.

 The MRI approach represents an opportunity to better understand the impact of a potent dual bronchodilator on the small and central airways and thereby increasing ventilated lung volume, gas exchange, and ventilation-perfusion deficits.

This study will investigate the effect of QVA149 on global and regional lung ventilation using MRI lung imaging to enhance the understanding of QVA pharmacology in COPD patients.

 QVA Mechanistic Efficacy Study (Receptor Effects, Etc)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess global ventilated lung volume in moderate to severe COPD patients using MRI lung imaging after 8 days of treatment with QVA149 compared to placebo.
