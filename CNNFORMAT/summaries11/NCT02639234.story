(fifthQuint)Vigil + Nivolumab in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 This is an open label phase 2 study to evaluate the combination of Vigil cent autologous tumor cell immunotherapy and nivolumab PD-1 inhibitor therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC that is progressive on or after one prior platinum-based systemic therapy (ALK or EGFR mutation-targeted therapy should have been received if appropriate mutation present).

 Patients undergoing a standard surgical procedure (e.

g.

, tumor biopsy, palliative resection, or thoracentesis of malignant pleural effusion) may elect to have tumor tissue procured for manufacture of Vigil cent vaccine.

 Patients meeting study eligibility criteria will receive doublet therapy comprising of (i) Vigil cent 1 x 10^7 cells by intradermal injection every 2 weeks for a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 12 doses and (ii) nivolumab 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks.

 Three to six weeks after tissue procurement has occurred eligibility will be reconfirmed by the study site.

 Subjects must begin the study regimen within 6 weeks of tissue procurement.

 Radiological assessment of tumor response will be performed at screening, Cycle 5 (Week 9) and approximately every 2 months thereafter until progressive disease unless the subject is lost to follow-up, withdraws consent for study related procedures, or initiates another cancer therapy.

 Tumor biopsy for correlative studies should be obtained at tissue procurement and at Cycle 5 (Week 9).

 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for correlative studies should be obtained before tumor procurement, and prior to initiation of study therapy on Day 1 at Cycle 1 (Week 1), Cycle 5 (Week 9), Cycle 9 (Week 17) and EOT.

 Vigil + Nivolumab in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

This is an open label phase 2 study to evaluate the combination of Vigil cent and nivolumab in advanced or metastatic NSCLC that is progressive on or after one prior platinum-based systemic therapy.

 Patients meeting study eligibility criteria will receive Vigil cent every 2 weeks (for a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 12 doses) and nivolumab every 2 weeks.

 The combination of Vigil cent and nivolumab will demonstrate a higher objective response rate (ORR) than the historical ORR of single agent nivolumab in patients with advanced NSCLC.
