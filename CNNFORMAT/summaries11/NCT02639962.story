(fifthQuint)Characteristics of Culprit Lesion and Changes in Plaque Composition.

 A Dual Energy Cardiac CT Study.

 Patients with verified NSTEMI undergo contrast-enhanced coronary DECT before conventional coronary angiography (CAG), and DECT characteristics of the culprit lesion will be determined.

 All Non-culprit lesions will be observed during 2 month and 1 year follow up characteristics and changes in plaque composition, volume and core content will be assessed.

 Patients with SAP undergo a baseline DECT similar to NSTEMI group.

 Because the expected change in coronary plaques in SAP group is minimal, there is no need for follow up at 2 month.

 Characteristics of Culprit Lesion and Changes in Plaque Composition.

 A Dual Energy Cardiac CT Study@highlight

Identifying patients who are at risk for a future myocardial infarction, is still one of the biggest challenges in cardiology.

 In this study the investigators will investigate culprit lesion in patients with NSTEMI and the ability of cardiac CT with dual energy computed tomography (DECT) scanning to describe and identify plaques that may be vulnerable.

 The investigators will also describe changes in characteristic in both stable and unstable plaques during 1 year follow up of NSTEMI and a matching group of stable angina pectoris (SAP) patients.
