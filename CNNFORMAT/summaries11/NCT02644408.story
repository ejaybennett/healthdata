(fifthQuint)Effect of Megestrol Acetate on the Quality of Life of Patients With Esophageal Carcinoma.

 The investigators plan to recruit the patients who were pathologically confirmed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and performed chemoradiotherapy from the Oct 2014.

 The patients will be divided into two groups.

Experimental group:esophageal cancer patients with oral megestrol chemoradiation.

 Megestrol(Yining):160mg/d,po,5 weeks in total,oen week before chemoradiotherapy and one week after chemoradiotherapy.

 chemoradiotherapy:chemotherapy and radiotherapy: 50Gy in total,2 Gy/d,5d/w.

Control group: Esophageal cancer patients with chemoradiation without oral megestrol.

chemoradiotherapy:chemotherapy and radiotherapy: 50Gy in total,2 Gy/d,5d/w.

To evaluate the overall survival of the two group.

 Also observe the patient's gastrointestinal reaction body weight change, performance status, leucopenia and deep venous thrombosis.

 A total of 210 patients will be accrued from China within 2 years.
