(secondQuint)Trial of Robotic Versus Laparoscopic-assisted Radical Resection for Rectal Cancer.

 Urinary and sexual dysfunction are recognized complications of rectal cancer surgery in men.

 This study compared robot-assisted total mesorectal excision (RTME) and laparoscopic total mesorectal excision(LTME) with regard to these functional outcomes.

Sphincter- preservation outcomes for low rectal cancer was observed as well.
