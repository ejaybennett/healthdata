(secondQuint)Safety Evaluation of Cellavita HD Administered Intravenously in Participants With Huntington's Disease.

 This is a first-in-human, dose escalation, non-randomized phase I study in which participants with HD will receive three intravenous injections of one of two doses of the investigational product, one every month for three months.

 Safety evaluation data will include report of all adverse events (including type, frequency, intensity, seriousness, severity, and action taken related to the investigational product study), changes in vital signs, physical examination and medical evaluations, changes in laboratory or serology tests and electrocardiogram (ECG), and incidence and classification of benign and malignant neoplasms.

 Preliminary evidence of efficacy will be evaluated by clinical improvement of motor, cognitive and behavioral degradation through Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and inflammatory markers: IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 (interleukin IL) e TNF-alpha (tumoral necrosis factor alpha); CNS improvement will be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

 The immunological response of HD product over the administration period will be evaluated by CD4+ and CD8+ proliferation and inflammatory markers release.
