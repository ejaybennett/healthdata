(fifthQuint)First-in-human Study of Oral TP-0903 (a Novel Inhibitor of AXL Kinase) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 This is a phase 1a / 1b, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic study of TP-0903 administered once daily for the first 21 out of 28 days.

 There are 2 phases in this study.

 In Phase 1a (dose escalation), sequential cohorts of three (3) patients will be treated with escalated doses until the MTD is established.

 In the absence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the dose will be increased using a modified Fibonacci dose escalation scheme.

 Once the MTD has been established, dosing will change from BSA-dependent to a flat dose based on the average of the dose administered in the MTD expansion safety cohort.

 Once the MTD has been established, in Ph 1b (expansion), 5 additional cohorts of up to 20 patients each with specific tumor types (up to 100 additional patients total) may be enrolled at the MTD dose level to confirm safety, explore potential biomarkers, and evaluate potential signals of activity when TP-0903 is administered to specific groups of heavily pretreated patients or given in combination with immunotherapy or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

 Ten patients in each of these 5 Expansion Cohorts will be required to consent to undergo pre- and post-dose tumor biopsies.

 All patients who undergo these biopsies will comprise the 'Biopsy Cohorts' (Phase 1b).

 Patients who successfully complete a 4-week treatment cycle without evidence of significant treatment-related toxicity or progressive disease will be permitted to continue to receive treatment with the same dose and dosing schedule.

 First-in-human Study of Oral TP-0903 (a Novel Inhibitor of AXL Kinase) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors@highlight

TP-0903 is a novel oral inhibitor that targets AXL kinase and reverses the mesenchymal phenotype associated with advanced cancers.

 Preclinical studies have shown promising antitumor activity of TP-0903 as a single agent against a variety of tumor types in both in vitro and in vivo studies.

 This first-in-human Phase 1a study is conducted to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TP-0903 administered orally to patients with advanced solid tumors and to identify the safety profile and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of TP-0903.

 Once the MTD has been established, additional patients with specific tumor types (advanced solid tumors that have progressed despite immunotherapy*, EGFR+ Non Small Cell Lung Cancer [NSCLC] and have progressed on 2 lines of oral TKIs*, BRAF-, KRAS-, or NRAS-mutated Colorectal Carcinoma [CRC] for whom there is no standard therapy remaining, persistent/recurrent Ovarian Cancer who would be platinum refractory/ resistant and have had any number of lines of prior therapy, and BRAF-mutated Melanoma that has not responded to immunotherapy or a combination BRAF/MEK inhibitor) will be enrolled at the MTD in the Phase 1b study.

 Data collected from patients enrolled in each of these additional cohorts will be used for to confirm safety, explore potential biomarkers, and evaluate potential signals of activity when TP-0903 is administered to specific groups of heavily pretreated patients or given in combination with immunotherapy or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

 *Patients with immunotherapy-resistant tumors or EGFR+ NSCLC who are enrolled in these expansion cohorts will continue treatment with their previous immunotherapy or TKI regimens, respectively, and add TP-0903.

 The rationale is based on preclinical data that has shown that the combination is superior in patients who have progressed on prior immunotherapy or a TKI.

 The study will investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity profiles.
