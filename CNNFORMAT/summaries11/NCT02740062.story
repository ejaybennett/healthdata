(fifthQuint)Non Invasive Brain Evaluation and Treatment for Neuropathic Pain.

 Neuropathic pain is a pain which persists after nerve injury has healed and results from significant functional and structural changes in the nervous system similar to memory processes.

 As a result, neuropathic pain has been proposed to be "a persistence of the memory of pain and/or the inability to extinguish the memory of pain evoked by an initial inciting injury".

 A firm conclusion in the neurobiology of learning and memory is that different types of memory have distinct mechanisms (e.

g.

, declarative memory vs procedural memory).

 A similar distinction can be made in pain: various chronic pain states have distinct central mechanisms .

 Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic pain is a type of nociceptive memory mediated by structural and functional plasticity in by multiple pathways at cortical, subcortical, spinal, and peripheral levels.

Elucidating the basal neuronal signature of the person suffering from chronic pain enables to optimizing a treatment which in all studies was constant for all patients regardless of their basal activity In this study participants will undergo diagnosis of the personalized central manifestation characteristics of the neuropathic pain and evaluate the efficacy of a standard, most commonly used tDCS treatment, based on the diagnosis.

 for this purpose a single meeting will take place during which participants will undergo evaluation, sham treatment and standard tDCS treatment.

 Non Invasive Brain Evaluation and Treatment for Neuropathic Pain@highlight

This trial is designed to preliminary evaluate the efficacy and safety of NIBS system for evaluation and treatment of neuropathic pain.

 The NIBS system evaluates brain neuronal network activity and customizes a personalized treatment utilizing low current non invasive brain stimulation technology for neuropathic pain with central component.

 this is single meeting trial which includes brain activity evaluation and a single treatment and sham treatment.

 The goal of the study is to evaluate the central brain component of neuropathic pain subjects, and the effect of conventional tDCS treatment.
