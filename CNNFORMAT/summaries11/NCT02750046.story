(thirdQuint)Study of A Special Vessel Subtype in Bone Samples From Patients With Osteoporotic and Nonosteoporotic Fracture.

 OBJECTIVES: 1.

 Establish type H vessel in bone specimen in patients with hip fracture.

 2.

 Explore the correlation of BMD and type H vessel.

 OUTLINE: 1.

 Collect human bone specimens from patients with Osteoporotic and Nonosteoporotic Fracture.

 2.

 Provide a repository for storage of tissue and make these specimens available for approved projects by laboratory-based investigators.

 3.

 Observe the type H vessel in bone slice by immunofluorescence staining.

 4.

 Collect clinical data on these patients including bone mineral density.

 5.

 Investigate the relationship between BMD and type H vessel.

 Study of A Special Vessel Subtype in Bone Samples From Patients With Osteoporotic and Nonosteoporotic Fracture@highlight

RATIONALE: Collecting and storing bone samples from patients with osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic fracture to study a special vessel subtype in the laboratory may help surgeon learn more about the relationship between bone mineral density (BMD) and a special vessel subtype (type H vessel).

 PURPOSE: This research study is looking at changes of a special vessel subtype in bone samples from patients with osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic fracture.
