(thirdQuint)Rapid Plasma Genotyping For Early Initiation Of Erlotinib In EGFR Mutant Lung Cancer.

 This research study is a Phase II clinical trial.

 This research study will determine if a rapid blood test can be used to detect EGFR mutations in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer and use that information to rapidly start patients on a pill-based therapy.

 This blood test has not previously been used to select patients for treatment with Erlotinib without confirming this finding on a biopsy.

 Rapid Plasma Genotyping For Early Initiation Of Erlotinib In EGFR Mutant Lung Cancer@highlight

Patient with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) that might have a genetic change (mutation) in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) are invited to take part in this study.

 This research study is evaluating a new blood test that is capable of detecting an EGFR mutation in cancer without a biopsy.
