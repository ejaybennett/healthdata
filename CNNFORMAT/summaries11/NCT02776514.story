(secondQuint)Steroids, Hyaluronic Acid or Platelet Rich Plasma Versus Placebo for the Knee Osteoarthritis.

 Osteoarthritis of the knee joint is a very common disease in middle aged and elderly patients.

 This study evaluates the efficiency of different commonly used substances for intraarticular, non-operative treatment in early stages of this disease.

 240 patients receive an fluoroscopic guided injection in the knee joint: 60 patients get injection with steroids 60 patients get injection with prp 60 patients get injection with hyaluronic acid 60 patients get injection with placebo (iopamiro contrast media) Primary outcome: - clinical outcome (pain using numeric rating scale) - Magnetic Resonance imaging (cartilage defects etc.

).
