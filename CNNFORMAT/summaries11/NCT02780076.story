(fifthQuint)Recovery of Physical Functioning After Hip Fracture.

 Functional training, such as walking and transfers, ought to be an important part of the rehabilitation after hip fracture.

 We have an assumption that it is of utmost importance to continue and progress the functional training that started in the acute phase at the hospital, also during the sub-acute phase while the patients are at short-term stays in nursing homes.

 However, there are indications of lack of resources in the nursing homes and that the nurses may be less concerned with their role and participation in the patients' rehabilitation process.

 Possibly, this creates a discontinuity in the rehabilitation efforts during short-term stays that may have a negative impact on the patients' recovery of physical functioning.

 In this study the aim is to continue and progress the functional training started during hospital stay, such as training in walking and further on repetitive sit-to-stands, as part of the daily habitual routine during short-term stays in the nursing homes.

 This type of functional training may be motivational and easily recognizable to the patients, and it can also be carried out by the nursing staff with only initial guiding from a physiotherapist.

 There is lack of knowledge on the effect of additional functional training, incorporated as part of the habitual daily routine during short-term stays, on the patients' immediate and long term recovery of physical functioning and activity level after hip fracture, compared to usual care alone.

 The study is designed as a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing the effects of additional functional training (functional training group)to usual care alone (control group) during short-term stays in nursing homes.

 Recovery of Physical Functioning After Hip Fracture@highlight

The survivors after hip fracture often report severe pain and loss of physical functioning.

 The poor outcomes cause negative impact on the person's physical functioning and quality of life and put a financial burden on society.

 It is important to continue and progress the functional training that already started at the hospital, while the patients are transferred to short-term stays in a nursing home before they are returning to home.

 The aim presently is to examine the effects of a functional training program by a RCT design, initiated by the physiotherapist and performed by the nurses, on physical functioning while the patients are at short term stays in primary health care.
