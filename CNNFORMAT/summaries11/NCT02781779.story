(secondQuint)Comparison of Outcomes Between the Use of Silverlon Dressing and AQUACEL AG Dressing Post Cardiac Device Implant.

 This is a single center, prospective, 2-arm randomized, non-blinded study.

 A total of 100 participants will be assigned to the Silverlon arm and 100 to the AQUACEL AG arm.

 The number of procedures to implant CIED has risen in recent years.

 With this rise has also brought a rise in post-procedure infections.

 Infections will happen and there is a continued need to improve all aspects of the surgery and post-operative care.

 Wound coverage with appropriate dressings is one aspect that needs to be studied in CIED implant patients.

 Silverlon and AQUACEL AG are two options of dressings available for these patients.

 This study will look to see if one of the two is a better option for post-operative CIED implant patients.
