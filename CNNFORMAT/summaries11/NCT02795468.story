(firstQuint)The Usefulness of Ultrasound Guided Technique Insertion of Radial Artery Catheter in Neonates and Infants.

 In infants (<12mo), radial arterial catheterization is sometimes difficult to perform.

 Moreover, repeated attempts itself would cause the arterial spasm or hematoma.

 The use of ultrasound as an adjunct to radial arterial cannulation has considered to be the best practice in adults and pediatrics.

 However, its usefulness or superiority for neonates and infants is not known.

 Therefore, we would compare ultrasound guided radial arterial cannulation with the usual palpation methods in infants undergoing cardiac surgery.
