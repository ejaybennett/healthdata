(secondQuint)A Computerised Test for Assessing the Early Reading Skills.

 Conventional tests for assessing the early reading skills of preschool children on school entry are not accessible to children with mobility limitations.

 This paper presents a game-like computerised test featuring an appealing scenario that is accessible to these children.

 It was developed on a platform that creates 2D vector graphics and contains three phases of interactive content accessible through an adapted peripheral.

 Conventional tests were also used to validate the effectiveness of the game.

 The two types of tests had the same degree of predictive power when completed by thirty three preschool children without mobility impairment.

 A Computerised Test for Assessing the Early Reading Skills@highlight

This study was to develop a computerised test with an adapted peripheral to assess the emerging literacy knowledge of children with mobility difficulties.

 The software was implemented using a game-like design controllable by a peripheral device without needing fine movements.
