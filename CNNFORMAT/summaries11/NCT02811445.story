(fifthQuint)Role of the Gut Microbiome on Lean Mass and Physical Function in Older Adults.

 In older adults (70+ years), reduced lean body mass and physical function are associated with increased disability, hospitalization, morbidity and mortality.

 Because older adults are the fastest growing global subpopulation, identification of mechanisms that underlie the maintenance of lean mass and physical function will be important for addressing the public health priority of healthy aging.

 Gut bacteria may be involved in mechanisms that underlie the maintenance of lean mass and physical function.

 In support of this hypothesis, in multiple publications I recently reported significant associations between circulating gut bacteria-related metabolites with these outcomes in older adults.

 Accordingly, my overarching hypothesis is that is gut bacteria are associated with and are causatively involved in mechanisms that underlie the maintenance of lean mass and physical function in older adults.

 To test this hypothesis, I propose to: characterize the association between fecal bacteria with lean mass and physical function (AIM 1), test the causative role of gut bacteria on the maintenance of lean mass and physical function by colonizing germ-free mice with fecal bacteria from older adults (AIM 2), and examine potential mechanisms that link gut bacteria with these outcomes by identifying associations between gut bacteria and serum metabolites with lean mass and physical function (AIM 3).

 Role of the Gut Microbiome on Lean Mass and Physical Function in Older Adults@highlight

I recently published significant associations between circulating gut bacteria-related metabolites with lean and skeletal muscle mass and with measures of physical function in older adults, evidence that suggests a role for gut bacteria on the maintenance of these outcomes.

 To date, studies aimed at identification of associations between gut bacteria with lean mass or with specific measures of physical function have yet to be reported.

 Accordingly, my over-arching hypothesis is that is gut bacteria are associated with and are causatively involved in mechanisms that underlie the maintenance of lean mass and physical function in older adults.

 Results obtained from the proposed study are intended as the basis for future studies aimed at targeted modulation of the gut microflora, which may be a novel and innovative means for improving lean mass and physical function and for addressing the public health priority of healthy aging in older adults.
