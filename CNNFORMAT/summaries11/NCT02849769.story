(secondQuint)Magnetic Resonance (MR) Conditional Tachyarrhythmia Therapy Products Post-approval Study.

 Pre-clinical testing and clinical data has demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of magnetic resonance (MR) Conditional Tachyarrhythmia Therapy Systems in the MR environment when used according to labeling requirements.

 Following approval, further confirmation of the MR Conditional Tachyarrhythmia Therapy Systems sensing and detection performance post MRI exposure will be obtained by actively monitoring de-identified device data obtained through the Medtronic CareLink(R) Network.

 MR conditional tachyarrhythmia therapy system enrolled in the Medtronic CareLink(R) Network (CL) will be used to prospectively assess spontaneous Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) episode detection following MRI exposure.
