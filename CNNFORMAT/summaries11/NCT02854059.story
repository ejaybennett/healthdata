(secondQuint)IdeS in Asymptomatic Asymptomatic Antibody-Mediated Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) Patients.

 Immunoglobulin G-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes (IdeS) is an IgG specific endopeptidase which cleaves IgG molecules and efficiently neutralizes Fc-mediated activities.

 IdeS-mediated IgG degradation constitutes a novel therapeutic principle for the treatment of IgG-driven human diseases.

 In addition to assessing the safety and tolerability of IdeS the study will also assess the efficacy of IdeS to significantly increase the ADAMTS13 activity and decrease the anti-ADAMTS13 antibody levels in patients diagnosed with asymptomatic antibody-mediated TTP with low ADAMTS13 activity.

The main purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability in patients diagnosed with asymptomatic antibody-mediated TTP with low ADAMTS13 activity after receiving single intravenous dose of IdeS.
