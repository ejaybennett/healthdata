(secondQuint)Confocal Raman Spectroscopy: in Vivo Measurement of Physiological Skin Parameters.

 In vivo Raman experiments will be carried out weekly on voluntary participants using a RiverDiagnostics gen2-SCA Skin Composition Analyzer (RiverDiagnostics, Rotterdam, Netherlands).

 All experiments will be carried out on the volar forearm.

 Semi-quantitative concentration profiles for several skin parameters will be determined, for example natural moisturizing factor (NMF) and cholesterol.

 Additionally the total cholesterol level will be detected by venous blood sample analysis.

 The blood samples will be taken weekly within two weeks, similar to the Raman measurements.

 Confocal Raman Spectroscopy: in Vivo Measurement of Physiological Skin Parameters@highlight

The purpose of this study is to I.

 determine several skin parameters, for example natural moisturizing factor (NMF) and cholesterol, with Raman spectroscopy in vivo and II.

 compare the results with the corresponding cholesterol levels measured in venous blood.
