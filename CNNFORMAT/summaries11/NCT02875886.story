(secondQuint)DD-study: Diet or Diuretics for Salt-sensitivity in Chronic Kidney Disease.

 Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are exquisitely salt-sensitive.

 Salt-sensitivity in CKD is linked to hypertension and cardiovascular outcomes.

 Dietary salt restriction is an accepted intervention for salt-sensitivity in CKD.

 Another strategy, however, could be to block sodium uptake by the kidney pharmacologically by diuretics.

 Especially diuretics acting on the distal tubule may be effective, because this appears to be the site of increased sodium reabsorption in CKD.

 It is currently unknown how these two strategies, diet or diuretics, relate.

 The investigators hypothesize that diuretics are non-inferior to diet.

 DD-study: Diet or Diuretics for Salt-sensitivity in Chronic Kidney Disease@highlight

In this clinical study the anti-hypertensive response to dietary salt restriction is compared with the anti-hypertensive response to the diuretics hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride in adult patients with chronic kidney disease.
