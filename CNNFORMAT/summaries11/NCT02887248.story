(secondQuint)Nab-paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine as First-line Therapy for Cisplatin-ineligible or Cisplatin-incurable Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma.

 This open-label, non-randomized phase II trial evaluates the efficacy and toxicity of first-line treatment with a combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, followed by maintenance therapy with nab-paclitaxel alone in patients with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable urothelial cancer.

 Two groups of patients are eligible: (1) patients who are poor candidates for treatment with cisplatin, and (2) patients with visceral metastases who are incurable and unlikely to derive long-term benefit from treatment with cisplatin-based regimens.

 Eligible patients will receive a minimum of 3 cycles and up to 6 cycles of treatment with the gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel combination.

 Patients having an objective response or stable disease will continue maintenance treatment with single-agent nab-paclitaxel until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or patient decision to discontinue treatment.

 Up to 55 patients are planned for enrollment.

The purpose of this trial is to determine the benefit of the combination of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine given for 6 cycles, followed by maintenance nab-paclitaxel alone, in patients with cisplatin-ineligible or cisplatin-incurable advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC).
