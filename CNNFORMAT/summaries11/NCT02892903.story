(thirdQuint)In the Management of Coronary Artery Disease, Does Routine Pressure Wire Assessment at the Time of Coronary Angiography Affect Management Strategy, Hospital Costs and Outcomes?.

 The study will recruit patients undergoing angiography for the investigation of stable angina or for the assessment of a recent, but stabilised, non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome event.

 Eligible patients who provide written informed consent will be randomised to conventional angiography or additional, routine pressure wire assessment - measuring fractional flow reserve (FFR) - in all main vessels judged as being of sufficient vessel calibre to allow percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (experimental arm).

 The study pragmatic design allows investigators to conduct all diagnostic and therapeutic management in accordance with prevailing best practice patterns.

 Study outcome measures will examine resource utilisation, patient reported quality of life and clinical events at 1 year.

 In the Management of Coronary Artery Disease, Does Routine Pressure Wire Assessment at the Time of Coronary Angiography Affect Management Strategy, Hospital Costs and Outcomes?@highlight

A randomised controlled trial to compare two strategies for the investigation of coronary artery disease at the time of angiography.

 Patients will be randomised to conventional angiography or additional, routine pressure wire assessment - measuring fractional flow reserve (FFR) - in all main vessels judged as being of sufficient vessel calibre to allow percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (experimental arm).
