(firstQuint)MSC Administration for the Management of Type 1 Diabetic Patients.

 Aim: to evaluate whether a single intravenous administration of allogeneic bone marrow-derived multipotent stromal cell also referred as to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), modified endogenous insulin secretion capacity and exogenous insulin requirement in patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.

 Participants: 10, females or males, 18 years or older, diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus at most 1 year before enrollment, under exogenous insulin treatment, with pancreatic reserve of insulin.

 Intervention: intravenous administration of a single dose (2-3 millions/Kg) of allogeneic MSCs.

 Follow up: before and 1, 6, 24 months after MSC administration.
