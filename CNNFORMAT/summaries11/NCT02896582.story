(thirdQuint)Efficacy of Upfront and Maintenance Obinutuzumab in Mantle Cell Lymphoma Treated by DHAP and MRD Driven Maintenance.

 Patients will be recruited over 2 years.

 They must have a histologically proven diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma, be aged from 18 to 65 years at the time of registration.

 Patients must be eligible for autologous transplant and not previously treated for their lymphoma at inclusion.

 Patients will receive 4 cycles of Obinutuzumab (GA101) and Cisplatinum-Cytarabine-Dexamethasone (GA-DHAP) every 21 days followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) using a GA101-Carmustine- Etoposide- Cytarabine- Melphalan (GA-BEAM) conditioning regimen plus a Obinutuzumab maintenance for 3 years then a Obinutuzumab maintenance on demand according to MRD status.

 Stem cells will be collected after cycle 3 and/or 4 of GA-DHAP.

 Efficacy of Upfront and Maintenance Obinutuzumab in Mantle Cell Lymphoma Treated by DHAP and MRD Driven Maintenance@highlight

This study is a multicentric, single arm phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy of upfront obinutuzumab in mantle cell lymphoma patients treated by Cisplatinum-Cytarabine-Dexamethasone (DHAP) followed by autologous transplantation plus obinutuzumab maintenance then Molecular Residual Disease (MRD) driven maintenance
