(fifthQuint)Back Pain Prevention in Multiple Myeloma Using an External Spinal Brace.

 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplasia of plasma cells mostly within the bone marrow, commonly leading to multiple vertebral collapses.

 This causes spinal deformity, leading to incapacitating back pain and reduced quality of life.

 In spite of advances in medical therapy, some patients are left with disabling back pain, sometimes requiring surgical intervention.

 University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust have observed on an audit of our own practice that application of an external spinal brace as early in the disease process as is possible appears to maintain the overall alignment of the spine, thus minimising risk of spinal deformity and consequent back pain.

 The ultimate aim is to undertake an RCT to determine whether the use of an external spinal brace can reduce back pain and spine-related disability in patients suffering from back pain due to multiple myeloma, in comparison to conventional management without a brace.

 However, prior to this, a feasibility study is required.

 The feasibility study is needed to see if the trial processes (providing patient information, consent process, conducting the baseline investigations and outcome measures) can be accommodated without causing too much delay to the application of the brace.

 Suitable patients will be consented by the research team and randomised to receive a brace or no brace in addition to their routine Myeloma treatment.

 After baseline data collection and questionnaires, the participant would be followed up for data collection at 6 weeks and 3 months.

Consenting patients with multiple myeloma (MM) will be randomly allocated to receive either standard medical treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, pain-killing medication) alone or standard medical treatment plus a brace.

 Patients will be regularly evaluated in research clinics; the results data will inform the design of a full trial.

 Information will be collected to inform a list of requirements a centre needs to have in place to run an RCT of these interventions.
