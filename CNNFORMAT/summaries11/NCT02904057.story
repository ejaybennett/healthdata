 Evaluation of the MJGS Following Radiesse (+) Injection Into the Jawline@highlight

This study will evaluate the sensitivity of the validated Merz Jawline Grading Scale (MJGS) to detect treatment effects following Radiesse (+) correction of subcutaneous volume loss and contour deficits of the jawline.

 Treatment effects detected on the MJGS will be correlated with assessments of aesthetic outcomes on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) and FACE-Q instrument
