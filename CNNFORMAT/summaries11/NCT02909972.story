(thirdQuint)Safety Study of ALRN-6924 in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Advanced Myelodysplastic Syndrome.

 Phase I, open label, multi-center dose escalation (DEP) and dose expansion (EXP) study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK (pharmacokinetics), PD (pharmacodynamics) and anti-tumor effects of ALRN-6924 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome with wild-type (WT) TP53.

 ALRN-6924 is a stapled peptide designed to disrupt integration between the p53 tumor suppression protein and inhibition by murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and murine double minute X (MDMX).

 Men and women 18 years of age and older with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome and for which standard treatment(s) are not available or are no longer effective can be enrolled.

 Treatment of patients in the DEP and EXP phases will continue in the study until documentation of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient or physician decision to discontinue study participation is made.
