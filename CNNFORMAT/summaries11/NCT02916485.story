(firstQuint)Safety and Clinical Performance of a Sirolimus-eluting Absorbable Metal Scaffold.

 This is a prospective, multi-centre, single-arm, open label trial to assess the safety and clinical performance of Magmaris Drug Eluting Absorbable Metal Scaffold.

 A total of up to 110 patients with de novo lesions in native coronary arteries will be enrolled at up to 8 investigational sites in India.

 In-hospital clinical follow-up visits will take place at 1 and 6 months post procedure.

 The primary endpoint is target lesion failure (a composite of cardiac death, target vessel Q-wave or non-Q wave myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, clinically driven target lesion revascularization) at 1 month post procedure.
