(fifthQuint)Effect of Soluble Corn Fiber Supplementation for 1 Year on Bone Metabolism in Adolescents.

 The adolescent period is crucial for optimizing future bone health because bone accumulates rapidly during these years and accounts for up to half of adult peak bone mass.

 Calcium intake during this period is critical for adequate bone mineralization but this is the nutrient most deficient in the diets of adolescents.

 A strategy to maximize bone mineralization during this critical period is to increase the absorption of the calcium being consumed.

 This could be achieved by supplementing diets with certain non-digestible carbohydrates, such as soluble corn fiber (SCF).

 The primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of SCF supplementation for 1 year on bone metabolism in growing adolescents compared to controls.

 A randomized double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trial will be conducted in 168 healthy adolescents aged 11-14 years, equally randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: SCF (12 g/d, administered twice a day), SCF + calcium (12 g/d of SCF + 600 mg/d of elemental calcium carbonate, twice a day), or placebo (0 g/d of SCF or calcium, administered twice a day).

 The treatment and the placebo will be provided in the form of flavored drinks twice per day (this was previously used in a short-term study among adolescents with excellent acceptance).

 Both adolescents and parents will be blinded to the assigned intervention.

 Participants are required to come to the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium for 2 study visits (at baseline and after 12 months consuming the supplement).

 In these visits, participants will undergo a bone scan, provide a blood sample and a 24-h urine sample to measure bone related biomarkers, complete several general health, diet and activity questionnaires and undergo anthropometric measurements.

 In addition, the team will visit the participant in their homes at 3, 6 and 9 months to refill the treatment and assess compliance to the treatment.

 The primary outcome is change in bone mineral content (BMC) measured using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) The secondary outcomes include biochemical markers reflecting vitamin D status and calcium homeostasis, such as serum calcium, phosphate, bone biomarkers, vitamin D (measured as serum levels of 25(OH)D), urinary calcium, phosphate, creatinine and N-telopeptide cross-links.

 Effect of Soluble Corn Fiber Supplementation for 1 Year on Bone Metabolism in Adolescents@highlight

The primary aim of this proposal is to determine the effects of soluble corn fiber (SCF) supplementation for 1 year on bone metabolism in growing adolescents compared to controls.

 For the proposed study, a randomized double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trial will be conducted in 168 healthy adolescents aged 11-14 years, equally randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: SCF (12 g/d, administered twice a day), SCF + calcium (12 g/d of SCF + 600 mg/d of elemental calcium carbonate, twice a day), or placebo (0 g/d of SCF or calcium, administered twice a day).

 Bone metabolism and bone related biomarkers will be assessed at baseline and at 12 months.
