(fifthQuint)Shockwave Medical Peripheral Lithoplasty System Study for PAD (Disrupt PAD III).

 Shockwave Medical Inc.

 intends to conduct a prospective, multi-center, single blind, randomized (1:1) study of Lithoplasty treatment used in combination with DCB versus standard balloon angioplasty used in combination with DCB to treat moderate and severely calcified femoropopliteal arteries.

 The Shockwave Medical Peripheral Lithoplasty System is indicated for lithotripsy-enhanced, low-pressure balloon dilatation of calcified, stenotic peripheral arteries in patients who are candidates for percutaneous therapy.

 Up to 400 subjects at 60 sites in Europe, the United States and New Zealand.

 Subjects will be followed through discharge, 30 days, and 6, 12 and 24 months.

 DUS assessments will be completed at 12 and 24 months.

 Procedural success defined as residual stenosis <30% prior to DCB or stenting by angiographic core lab.

 Subjects who do not meet the randomized study inclusion and exclusion criteria, but meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the observational study may be enrolled in the observational study.

 The objective of the observational study is to assess the real-world acute performance of the Shockwave Medical Lithoplasty System in the treatment of calcified, stenotic, peripheral arteries.

The observational study is a prospective, multi-center, single arm observational study for subjects who do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the randomized study.

 A maximum of 500 subjects at the same 60 sites will be enrolled in the observational study.

 Procedural success defined as residual stenosis <30% prior to DCB or stenting by angiographic core lab.

 Enrollment in the observational study is anticipated to last approximately 16 months.

 Subjects in the observational study will be followed through hospital discharge.

 Once enrollment in the randomized portion of the study is complete, subjects may continue to be enrolled in the observational study provided they meet OS eligibility criteria.

Shockwave Medical Inc.

 intends to conduct a prospective, multi-center, single blind, randomized (1:1) study of Lithoplasty treatment used in combination with DCB versus standard balloon angioplasty used in combination with DCB to treat moderate and severely calcified femoropopliteal arteries.

 Assuming that roughly 15% of the subjects will be lost-to-follow-up, a total of up to 400 subjects (200 per treatment arm) will be enrolled in the study at up to 60 sites in Europe, the United States and New Zealand.

 In addition to the randomized study, an observational study of subjects who do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the randomized study will be conducted.

 The objective of the observational study is to assess the real-world acute performance of the Shockwave Medical Peripheral Lithoplasty System in the treatment of calcified, stenotic, peripheral arteries.

 The observational study is a prospective, multi-center, single arm observational study for subjects who do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the randomized study.
