(thirdQuint)Supine MRI in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Neoadjuvant Therapy.

 The procedure involved is called a supine breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

In this study, the investigators are evaluating the value of supine MRI in the treatment of women with breast cancer before and after receiving neoadjuvant therapy.

 The purpose of this study is to assess the value of supine breast MRI as a new imaging method for women receiving neoadjuvant therapy.

 It is possible that the use of supine breast MRI will help your doctor see the size and location of tumors more accurately.

This research study involves the use of a common breast imaging modality (magnetic resonance imaging, 'MRI') and is investigating its role in evaluating treatment for breast cancer when it is performed with the patient in a new position (lying on one's back) as opposed to in the standard position (lying on one's stomach).
