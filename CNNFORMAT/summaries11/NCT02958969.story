(fifthQuint)Apixaban for Primary Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Multiple Myeloma.

 MM is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

 The use of targeted therapies, including immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), has improved outcomes for patients with MM but also increases the risk of VTE.

 Prevention of VTE has become a major management dilemma during MM treatment.

 There is a paucity of data with respect to the non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in the cancer population, including patients with MM.

 However, the NOACs have been shown to offer comparable efficacy but improved safety compared with warfarin.

 Apixaban has shown excellent safety and efficacy for treatment and prevention of recurrent VTE (1,2).

 Compared with injectable thromboprophylactic regimens such as enoxaparin, apixaban offers the advantages of being orally administered and less reliant on renal clearance.

 The safety and efficacy of apixaban for primary prevention of VTE in MM patients has not been established.

 The current study will evaluate apixaban (2.

5 mg twice daily) in a patient population without a history of prior VTE.

 Although the current study population is high risk for VTE, it is likely to be lower risk for VTE than those of the prior randomized controlled trials of apixaban for secondary prevention.

 Furthermore, current practice is to provide MM patients receiving IMiDs with prophylactic doses (not treatment doses) of low-molecular weight heparin (such as enoxaparin 40 mg injected daily).

 Accordingly, the rationale to test apixaban (2.

5 mg twice daily) is consistent with the standard practice of prophylactic anticoagulation.

 The current study will provide event rates that will inform the design of a larger randomized controlled trial.

 If safe and effective, apixaban will satisfy a critical unmet need and will represent a substantial advance and "game changer" in the prevention of VTE in this high risk patient population.

 Apixaban for Primary Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Multiple Myeloma@highlight

Patients living with multiple myeloma (MM) have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to the disease itself and the use of targeted therapies, including immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs).

 Prevention of VTE has become a major management challenge during MM treatment.

 There is a paucity of data with respect to the non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in the cancer population.

 However, the NOACs offer comparable efficacy but improved safety compared with warfarin.

 Apixaban has shown excellent safety and efficacy for treatment and prevention of recurrent VTE (1,2).

 The safety and efficacy of apixaban for primary prevention of VTE in MM patients has not been established.

 Aim #1: To quantify the 6-month rate of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding in MM patients receiving IMiDs who are prescribed apixaban 2.

5 mg orally twice daily for primary prevention of VTE.

 Hypothesis #1: The 6-month rate of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding in MM patients receiving IMiDs who are prescribed apixaban 2.

5 mg orally twice daily for primary prevention of VTE will be 3% (2).

 Although the MM population, in general, has a higher medical acuity than that of the previous large randomized controlled trials of apixaban, we will be selecting a stable population of MM patients who are appropriate for immunomodulatory therapy.

 Aim #2: To quantify 6-month rate of symptomatic VTE in MM patients receiving IMiDs who are prescribed apixaban 2.

5 mg orally twice daily for primary prevention of VTE.

 Hypothesis #2: The 6-month rate of symptomatic VTE in MM patients receiving IMiDs who are prescribed apixaban 2.

5 mg orally twice daily for primary prevention of VTE will be <7% (3).

 Although additional therapies for MM such as dexamethasone and erythropoietin-stimulating agents may further increase the risk of VTE, the rate of incident VTE should be reduced to <7% with apixaban.
