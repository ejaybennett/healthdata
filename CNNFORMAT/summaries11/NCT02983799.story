(thirdQuint)Olaparib Tablets as a Treatment for Ovarian Cancer Subjects With Different HRD Tumor Status.

 This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study assessing the efficacy and safety of olaparib tablets 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) given orally twice daily (bid) in subjects with platinum-sensitive or partially platinum-sensitive, relapsed, high-grade serous or high-grade endometrioid epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have received at least 1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy.

 The study will assess the effectiveness of olaparib tablets as measured by the objective response rate (ORR) as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.

1, in subjects with germline BRCA mutations (gBRCAm), somatic BRCA mutations (sBRCAm), or potential aberrations in homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) as determined by myChoice(R) HRD, as well as in subjects without identifiable HRD.

 This study will utilize Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx(R) for germline BRCA analysis and a tumor test (myChoice(R) HRD) for tumor BRCA analysis and HRD status.

 Four cohorts will be identified based upon the genetic testing described above: - Cohort 1: gBRCAm, - Cohort 2: sBRCAm and germline BRCA wild type, - Cohort 3: myChoice(R) HRD positive (genomic instability positive) and BRCA wild type (BRCAwt) (no BRCA mutation), - Cohort 4: myChoice(R) HRD negative (genomic instability negative) and BRCAwt (no BRCA mutation).

 Olaparib Tablets as a Treatment for Ovarian Cancer Subjects With Different HRD Tumor Status@highlight

This is a non-randomized, open-label study to assess olaparib tablets as a treatment for subjects with different homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) tumor status and with platinum-sensitive, relapsed, high-grade serous or high-grade endometrioid ovarian cancer.

 Subjects should have received at least 1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy.
