(thirdQuint)Akin Osteotomy With or Without Fixation.

 It's a prospective monocentric randomized work about forefoot surgery.

 Every patient included undergoes an hallux valgus chevron osteotomy of the first metatarsal associated with a percutaneous Akin osteotomy of the first phalange.

 The investigators study the impact of the fixation of percutaneous Akin osteotomy ( osteotomy of the first phalange of hallux) with two arms: one with fixation of the percutaneous Akin osteotomy, and one with a non-fixed percutaneous Akin osteotomy This study as been approved by Institutional review board; written informed consent is required for all patients before inclusion.

 The clinic follow-up of each patients included in the study will be the same of the normal follow-up for this type of surgery in our practice.

 This includes clinical exam, radiologic exam, and functional score AOFAS before surgery, at 6 weeks after the surgery, four months after surgery and finally one year after the surgery.

 The primary outcome measure which is the first metatarso-phalangeal global mobility will be blindly measure by an observator.

 Akin Osteotomy With or Without Fixation@highlight

The study is a prospective randomized study about hallux valgus surgery.

 The investigator try to assess if the fixation of percutaneous Akin osteotomy with a cannulated screw have an incidence in the first ray mobility since the two technics ( fixation and no-fixation) are described and practiced, and since the stiffness of the first metatarso-phalangeal joint is determinant in the result of this functional surgery.
