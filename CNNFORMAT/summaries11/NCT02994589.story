(secondQuint)A Comparison of OASIS Wound Matrix With Approved Dressings for Skin Graft Donor Sites.

 Investigators seek to compare Oasis wound matrix with Tegaderm and Xeroform in order to determine whether advantages exist in one or more of the dressing types that are approved and currently used for split-thickness skin graft donor site dressings.

 Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups and followed up post-operatively and treated as per current standard of care.

 Data to be collected and analyzed includes: patient age, co-morbid illnesses, medication, skin-graft donor location, skin-graft donor area, STSG thickness, infection rate, complications involving the donor site, post-operative pain score every morning until hospital discharge, healing rate, photographs of the donor site immediately post-operatively and then at routine follow-up appointments.
