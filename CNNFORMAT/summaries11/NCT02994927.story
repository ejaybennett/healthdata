(secondQuint)A Phase 3 Clinical Trial of CCX168 (Avacopan) in Patients With ANCA-Associated Vasculitis.

 Complement 5a and its receptor C5aR (CD88) are involved in the pathogenesis of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis.

 This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled Phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the orally-administered, selective C5aR inhibitor CCX168 (avacopan) in inducing and sustaining remission in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) treated concomitantly with Rituximab or Cyclophosphamide/Azathioprine.
