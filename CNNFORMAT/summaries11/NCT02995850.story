(thirdQuint)A Phase Ib/II Study of Efficacy and Feasibility of Cytoreductive Surgery, Extensive Peritoneal Lavage, Hyperthermicintraperitoneal Chemotherapy and Post-operative Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Combination in Gastric Cancer With Peritoneal Metastasis.

 Peritoneal metastases in gastric cancer are considered to indicate terminal disease due to poor prognosis because systemic chemotherapy is unlikely to accumulate in peritoneal nodules in cytotoxic concentrations.

 Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) along with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been suggested to improve survival in select patients with limited peritoneal spread, resulting in a median overall survival (OS) of 8 to 14 months.

 It remains unclear, however, which regimen is best and who have benefits from CRS and HIPEC.

 Herein, we has conducting prospective phase Ib/II trial of CRC and HIPEC with intraperitoneal paclitaxel and cisplatin, and oral S-1 in gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis.

This is an open-label, non-randomized, single-center, phase Ib/II study, evaluating efficacy and feasibility of cytoreductive surgery(CRS), extensive peritoneal lavage, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy(HIPEC) and post-operative intraperitoneal chemotherapy combination in gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis
