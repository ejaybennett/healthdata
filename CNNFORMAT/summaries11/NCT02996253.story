(thirdQuint)Endoscopic Transfer of Flexor Hallucis Longus Tendon for Chronic Achilles Tendon Rupture.

 The transfer of FHL in the management of chronic Achilles tendon ruptures has demonstrated good functional outcome with American Orthopaedic Foot ane Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot scores at 80-89.

 The extensive surgical field by either a two-incision approach or a single longitudinal posterior approach to the Achilles tendon may lead to an increased risk for soft tissue problems, both infections and wound healing problems.

 The endoscopic FHL transfer may reduce the risk for soft tissue problems while retaining a good functional outcome.

 Several functional outcome measures and scores are evaluated a year after surgery.

 Prospective study for evaluation of the surgical procedure.

 Endoscopic Transfer of Flexor Hallucis Longus Tendon for Chronic Achilles Tendon Rupture@highlight

The transfer of Flexor Hallucis Longus (FHL) in the management of chronic Achilles tendon ruptures has demonstrated good functional outcome, but an extensive surgical field at a vulnerable location may lead to increased risk for soft tissue problems.

 The arthroscopic FHL transfer may reduce the risk for soft tissue problems.

 Functional outcome parameters are investigated, wound/soft tissue complications registered.
