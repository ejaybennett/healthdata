(thirdQuint)A Trial of the FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase 3 (FLT3) Inhibitor Gilteritinib Administered as Maintenance Therapy Following Allogeneic Transplant for Patients With FLT3/Internal Tandem Duplication (ITD) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

 Participants with FLT3/ITD AML in first morphologic complete remission (CR1) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) will be randomized to receive gilteritinib or placebo 30 to 90 days after HCT for a two year period.

 Participants will be stratified according to: 1) conditioning regimen intensity (myeloablative vs.

 reduced intensity/non-myeloablative), 2) time from first day of hematopoietic cell infusion to randomization (30-60 days vs.

 61-90 days) and 3) presence vs absence of or unknown minimal residual disease (MRD) from the most recent pre-registration bone marrow (BM) aspirate.

 A Trial of the FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase 3 (FLT3) Inhibitor Gilteritinib Administered as Maintenance Therapy Following Allogeneic Transplant for Patients With FLT3/Internal Tandem Duplication (ITD) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare relapse-free survival between participants with FLT3/ITD AML in first morphologic complete remission (CR1) who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) and are randomized to receive gilteritinib or placebo beginning after the time of engraftment for a two year period.
