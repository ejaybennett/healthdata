(secondQuint)Sodium Pertechnetate (99Tc) Injection Generator: 99mTc From Neutron-activation 99Mo v 99mTc From Fission 99Mo.

 This clinical trial will be a comparison of diagnostic and imaging equivalency of 99mTc Pertechnetate intravenous injection (labeled with commercial MDP kits) produced by a non-fission sourced/solvent generator and a nuclear reactor/column sourced generator.

 Each oncologic participant acts as their own control to reduce error variance.

 Condition Intervention Phase Oncologic indication for which a bone scan would normally be indicated.

 Participant having recently had a bone scan using Technetium (99mTc) Medronate Injection USP labeled with 99mTc derived from fission-sourced 99Mo.

 Drug: Technetium (99mTc) Medronate Injection USP labeled with 99mTc derived from neutron-activation-produced 99Mo.

 Phase 3.

 Sodium Pertechnetate (99Tc) Injection Generator: 99mTc From Neutron-activation 99Mo v 99mTc From Fission 99Mo@highlight

A non-fission sourced, solvent generator produced 99mTc intravenous injection, as 99mTc -MDP, is to be used as a bone scan diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for assessment of bone pathology using the same oncologic indications as nuclear reactor sourced 99mTc, as 99mTc-MDP.
