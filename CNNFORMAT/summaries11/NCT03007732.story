(secondQuint)Pembrolizumab in Combination With Intratumoral SD-101 Therapy.

 This randomized phase II trial studies how well androgen deprivation therapy, pembrolizumab, and stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without TLR9 agonist SD-101 in treating patients with prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body.

 Androgen can cause the growth of tumor cells.

 Androgen deprivation therapy, such as leuprolide acetate, prednisone, and abiraterone acetate may lessen the amount of androgen made by the body.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

 Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage to normal tissue.

 Colony-stimulating factors, such as TLR9 agonist SD-101, may increase the production of blood cells.

 It is not yet known whether giving androgen deprivation therapy, pembrolizumab, and stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without TLR9 agonist SD-101 may work better in treating patients with prostate cancer.

This is a non-comparative open-label multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial combining stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and pembrolizumab with or without intratumoral SD-101 in patients with newly diagnosed hormone-naive oligometastatic prostate cancer.
