(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Longterm Outcome of New York Heart Association Class III Heart Failure Patients Receiving Telemonitoring Using a Pulmonary Artery Pressure Sensor System (CardioMEMS).

 All patients who receive invasive hemodynamic monitoring using a pulmonary artery pressure sensor (CardioMEMS device) are offered participation in the registry.

 Routine heart-failure parameters, lab values, medication and QoL as obtained on the regular outpatients visits in the department are entered into a registry-specific database.

 The investigators plan to asses the impact of telemonitoring on mortality, morbidity and QoL as well as on Guideline-recommended heart failure medication.

 In addition, it is planned to quantify the input in person time for telemonitoring.

Invasive hemodynamic monitoring in advanced heart failure patients is a relative new option.

 In order to investigate the impact of remote telemonitoring of pulmonary artery pressures on mortality and morbidity in a routine clinical setting in germany, the investigators initiated this Frankfurt registry.
