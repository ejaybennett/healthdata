(thirdQuint)The Glycaemic Effect of Isomaltulose Consumption in Healthy Participants.

 The objective of the present study is to investigate the glycaemic effect of isomaltulose in Chinese, Indians, Malays and Caucasians.

 This will be a single intervention.

 Up to fifty participants, consisting of at least ten Chinese, ten Malays, ten Indians, and ten Caucasians completed data sets, aged between 21 and 40 years will be recruited from the general public in Singapore.

 Participants will be asked to attend two test sessions for this study.

 Participants will consume either a sucrose drink or an isomaltulose drink (each containing 50 g of available carbohydrate).

 The Glycaemic Effect of Isomaltulose Consumption in Healthy Participants@highlight

The objective of this study is to determine the glycaemic effect of isomaltulose and sucrose in Chinese, Indian, Malay, and Caucasian individuals.

 The current study will provide important information on the potential health benefits of isomaltulose consumption in Asian population.

 It will also reveal how the three main ethnicities in Singapore respond to isomaltulose and whether the response differs from the Caucasians.
