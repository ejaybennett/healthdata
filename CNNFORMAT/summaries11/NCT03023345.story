(secondQuint)Trans-rectal Focal Microwave Ablation of the Index Tumor in Patients With Low-risk Prostate Cancer.

 In men with low-risk prostate cancer, European and American guidelines recommend either active surveillance or whole-gland treatments, with significant induced morbidity and burden on quality of life.

 Focal treatments of the index tumor are currently under investigation to decrease morbidity while proposing active treatment.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility, precision and safety of a novel ablation treatment using microwaves, delivered transrectally under real-time guidance with MRI-transrectal ultrasound image registration.

 The index tumor will be detected with prostate MRI and characterized with targeted biopsies using MRI-transrectal ultrasound image registration.

 It will then be ablated with microwaves using the same transrectal approach and guidance system (KOELIS).

The purpose of this study is to determine if trans-rectal microwave ablation of the index tumor of patients with low-risk prostate cancer is sufficiently precise and safe, using MRI-transrectal ultrasound image registration.
