(firstQuint)Early Detection of Cardiac Toxicity in Childhood Cancer Survivors.

 Cardiac toxicity is a significant potential complication for patients receiving anthracycline chemotherapy.

 Cells in the cardiovascular system have limited regenerative capability, making them susceptible to long term adverse effects from these chemotherapeutic agents.

 The ability to detect subclinical changes in cardiac function will allow clinicians to use proven treatments to prevent further progression in this vulnerable population.

 The current standard testing uses echocardiography, which is not as sensitive as cardiac MRI or serum biomarkers.
