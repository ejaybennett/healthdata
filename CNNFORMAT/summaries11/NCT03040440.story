(firstQuint)Comparison of the Cuff Pressure of TaperGuard and Cylindrical- Endotracheal Tube During Laparoscopic Surgery.

 Sixty four participants were assigned to one of the two groups: cylindrical and TaperGuard endotracheal tube.

 At the supine position, cuff pressure of endotracheal tube was measured before and after abdominal insufflation in the supine position.

 After insufflation the head-up position (30) was made and cuff pressure was recorded.
