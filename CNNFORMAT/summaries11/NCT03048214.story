(firstQuint)Effect of Nerve Block Versus General Anaesthesia for Distal Radial Fracture Surgery.

 A single blinded randomized control trial will be performed to compare regional anaesthesia with single shot infraclavicular nerve block versus general anaesthesia.

 For this study, the power calculations were performed as follows using a two-sided test: The mean VAS score in the control group (at recovery) is 5.

0.

 The SD is 4.

0 The mean VAS score in the treatment group is expected to decrease by 40% to 3, which is clinically relevant.

 Since no data from our institution exists for pain after distal radial fracture surgery, data from the literature (O'Donnell, 2009) was used in this power calculation.

 For p=0.

05 and power of 80%, we will require 32 (thirty-two) patients in each arm of this study.

 For a study with two arms, a total of 64 patients should be recruited To account for possible dropouts, 35 patients will be recruited into each arm, and therefore, 70 patients should be recruited for this study.

 Patients will be approached in the general ward before operation.

 The aims of the study and need for follow up assessment would be explained and patient will be recruited only if s/he agrees.

 After agreeing to join the study, patients will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: 1) General anaesthesia (GA) 2) Regional Anaesthesia with infraclavicular block (RA).

 Outcomes of patients in receiving general anaesthesia (GA) will be compared with patients receiving infraclavicular nerve block (RA).

 Data Analysis Intention-to-treat will be used.

 Patients will remain in their initial designated groups for data analysis even if there is a change in surgical or anaesthetic/analgesic management, as long as they are undergoing distal radial fracture surgery not involving another operative site (eg bone graft).

 Patients in the RA group who required conversion to general anaesthesia due to inadequate infraclavicular block would remain in the RA group for data analysis.

 Statistical methods used: - Incidence of chronic post surgical pain: Chi-Square test - NRS pain scores at 3 and 6 months after surgery: Mann-Whitney test to look at difference in mean pain scores between two groups - duration of anaesthetic, analgesic and surgical procedures, time to extubation, cumulative opioid consumption, dose and frequency of rescue analgesic used, time to food intake and ambulation, time to discharge, patient satisfaction: Kruskal-Wallis test - Acute NRS pain scores over 48 hours: Expressed as area under the curve (AUC) using the trapezoid rule and compared using Kruskal-Wallis test.

 - Patient demographic data: One way ANOVA and chi-square test.

 - Intraoperative vital signs, HRQOL, HADS, DASH-HKPWH: Repeated measures ANOVA (with Bonferroni correction when appropriate) - Side effects and postoperative complications: Chi Square test - When a significant result is obtained, t-test or Mann-Whitney test for numerical values and Chi-square test for categorical data will be applied for post hoc pairwise comparisons.

This study aims to investigate whether infraclavicular nerve block improves acute postoperative pain after distal radial fracture surgery.
