(thirdQuint)The Effect of a Walking Assist Robot on Gait Function and Brain Activity in Stroke Patients and Elderly Adults.

 Primary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on gait and sit-to-stand movement in elderly adults.

 Secondary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on sit-to-stand movement and brain activity in stroke patients.

 In elderly adults, 1.

 Spatio temporal characteristics, muscle activation and foot pressure distribution are measured by motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA, USA), surface electromyography (sEMG) (Noraxon Inc.

, Scottsdale, AZ, USA) and F-Scan Mobile system (Tekscan Inc.

, South Boston, MA, USA) during 10m walking test.

 2.

 Muscle activation and foot pressure distribution are measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) and F-Scan Mobile system during five times sit-to-stand test.

 3.

 Muscle activation and foot pressure distribution are measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) and F-Scan Mobile system during stair climbing.

 In stroke patients, 1.

 Muscle activation and foot pressure distribution are measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) and F-Scan Mobile system during five times sit-to-stand test.

 2.

 Brain activity is measured by functional Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy (fNIRS) (NIRScout, NIRx, Germany) during treadmill gait.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the new wearable hip assist robot, gait enhancing mechatronic system (GEMS) developed by Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd.

, Korea) on gait, sit-to-stand movement and brain activity in elderly adults and stroke patients.
