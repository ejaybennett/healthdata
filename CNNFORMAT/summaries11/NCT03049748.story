(fifthQuint)Self-Management App for Patients With Left-Ventricular Assist Devices.

 About 250,000 of 5.

8 million Americans are suffering from an advanced or end-stage heart failure.

 Generally, these individuals require a heart transplant or a mechanical circulatory support such as a left-ventricular assist device (LVAD).

 LVAD is implanted to liberate patients from crippling symptoms of heart failure, or in some cases avert imminent death.

 However, maintaining health and improving quality of life (QOL) depend on a "trouble-free" LVAD.

 Despite the refinement in circulatory support technology, many patients and their family caregivers still face challenges in managing the LVAD in home settings.

 The LVAD home-care regimen comprise of complex technical and non-technical tasks and procedures that must be implemented frequently and consistently.

 During the first 6 months following hospital discharge, patients/caregivers generally exhibit low levels of confidence (i.

e.

, self-efficacy) in managing the tasks/procedures.

 This problem appears to contribute to low adherence to the regimen and poor outcomes.

 The current self-management processes include provision of instructional manuals and logs for vital signs, LVAD parameters, etc.

 To address this problem, the research team developed a mobile phone VAD Care App as a self-management tool.

 The app will aid and may ease patients/caregivers' problems in managing the complexity of the home-care regimen.

 The app offers patients/caregivers with (a) daily reminders about the tasks/procedures to be performed, (b) videoconferencing feature to communicate with healthcare providers about LVAD and health issues, and (c) on-line LVAD training/education.

 The prototype of the app was tested by 16 patients and caregivers.

 Results included ease of use and high acceptability and competency rates among users.

The specific aim for the present study is to obtain preliminary efficacy data of the care app as self-management tool in patients with a long-term LVAD.

 This study will employ a randomized control trial to establish preliminary estimates of the effects of the care app on the following: (1) the patients and caregivers' self-efficacy and (2) adherence to the LVAD home-care regimen; (3) LVAD-related complications and healthcare utilizations; and (4) patients' overall health status and (5) QOL.

 A total of 40 patient-caregiver dyads will be recruited.

 There will be 20 patients/caregivers allocated in the control (usual care) and experimental (usual care + VAD Care App) groups.

 Data collection will be performed during pre-hospital discharge (baseline) and at 1, 3 and 6 months post discharge using self-administered questionnaires, chart reviews, interviews, and retrieval of historical data of the care app.

 Descriptive and inferential statistical procedures will be employed for data analysis.

 The outcome of this pilot will inform the next stages of investigations that are crucial for transforming LVAD self-management processes and improving outcomes.

 Self-Management App for Patients With Left-Ventricular Assist Devices@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of VAD Care App in an out-patient mechanical circulatory support program.

 The specific aim for this pilot study is to obtain preliminary efficacy data of the VAD Care App as a self-management tool for patients with long-term LVADs.

 A randomized control trial will be employed to establish preliminary estimates of the effects of the App on the following outcomes: (1) patients' and caregivers' self-efficacy and (2) adherence to the LVAD care regimen; (3) LVAD-related complications and health care utilization [e.

g.

, hospital re-admission]; and (4) the patients' overall health status and (5) quality of life.

 The duration of the study is 6 months.
