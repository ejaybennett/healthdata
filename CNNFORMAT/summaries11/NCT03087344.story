(thirdQuint)Postprandial Liver and Spleen Stiffness Measurements in the Noninvasive Diagnosis of Cirrhosis.

 This is a prospective longitudinal study that will evaluate the utility of change in liver stiffness (LSM) and spleen stiffness measurements after a test meal in patients whom the diagnosis cannot be reliably ruled in or ruled out based on two measurement of LSM by TE per standard of care.

 This includes patients in whom there is discordance between clinical impression and LSM and/or LSM are in the grey zone (LSM between 10 and 15 kPa).

 Liver biopsy/HVPG which is performed as standard of care will be used as gold standard.

 Postprandial Liver and Spleen Stiffness Measurements in the Noninvasive Diagnosis of Cirrhosis@highlight

This is a study that will evaluate the utility of measuring liver and spleen stiffness before and after a meal by a non invasive ultrasound based technologies called Fibroscan (Transient elastography) and acoustic radio-frequency impulse (ARFI) in diagnosing or excluding cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver disease who will be getting a liver biopsy.
