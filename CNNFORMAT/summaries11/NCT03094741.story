(thirdQuint)Evaluation of a Mobile Digital Solution for Cancer Care and Research.

 Demographic information and patient-reported symptoms will be collected from study participants through a mobile health application called CancerLife that they can download (FREE) from their mobile device app store (Android or iOS).

 Participants will be asked to broadcast their emotional and physical status through a list of symptom list within the app as well as how that symptom is impacting their quality of life and activities of daily living.

 This data will be collected inside the application and display in easy to understand pie charts.

 Participants will also have the option to broadcast their entry to their social network.

 Since the objective of the current feasibility study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a Mobile Digital Solution in monitoring and collecting symptom burden and QOL data, the investigators will include a standard validated instrument (FACT-G: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General) as part of this study.

 Participants will be asked to complete the FACT-G after initial registration and weekly for up to 4 weeks.

 Participants will receive electronic mail messages with a link to CancerLife weekly as a reminder to access the website.

 Evaluation of a Mobile Digital Solution for Cancer Care and Research@highlight

The primary purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a Mobile Digital Solution in monitoring and collecting symptom burden data.

 The proposed study is meant to be the preparatory work for an intervention study to test the effect of Mobile Digital Solutions on improving patient outcomes by prompting early interventions for symptom relief and support of patient and family caregiver quality of life (QOL).
