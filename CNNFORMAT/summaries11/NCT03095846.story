(thirdQuint)Cold Induced Activation of Brown Adipose Tissue in Winter Swimmers.

 The field of human brown adipose tissue (BAT) research is focused on activation of BAT as a means of manipulating energy expenditure and potentially anti-obesity and anti-diabetic properties of the tissue.

 This is well established in rodent studies and explained as due to the specific brown fat uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1).

 Despite increasing evidence that indicates a metabolic regulatory role of BAT in humans, BAT activation/recruitment is not fully understood.

 Cold induced brown fat activity will be measured by skin temperature measures by means of infra-red thermography imaging and skin temperature.

 15 healthy male winter swimmers and 8 healthy male non-winter swimmers (controls) will be included in the study.

 Cold Induced Activation of Brown Adipose Tissue in Winter Swimmers@highlight

This study investigates cold-induced brown fat activation in winter swimmers and not-winter swimmers by skin temperature measures assessed with infra red thermography imaging and skin temperatures.

 Winter swimmers and not-winter swimmers will participate in an acute cooling intervention and thermoneutral intervention for comparison of energy expenditure and skin temperatures at the supraclavicular area.
