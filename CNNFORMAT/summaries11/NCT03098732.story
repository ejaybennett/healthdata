(fifthQuint)Magnetically Enhanced Diffusion for Acute Ischaemic Stroke (MEDIS) Trial.

 The study is a global, multicentre prospective, randomised, single blind, blinded endpoint study comparing rates of early recanalisation (defined by mAOL) in Acute Ischaemic Stroke (AIS) subjects with visible occlusion who are treated with either IV tPA plus sham device or IV tPA in combination with the MED System procedure.

 The study population will be randomised 1:1 into two arms: - A Sham Control Group (SCG) and an - Experimental Treatment Group (ETG).

 The ETG will receive IV tPA and the complete MED System procedure consisting of MED MicroBeads and the MED Workstation magnet procedure.

 The SCG will not receive MED MicroBeads while the MED Workstation will be activated as a Sham control.

 Subjects will be blinded to treatment arm.

 Stratification will be performed based upon baseline age and location of the occlusion (Middle Cerebral Artery segments M1, M2, or Carotid Terminus).

 Magnetically Enhanced Diffusion for Acute Ischaemic Stroke (MEDIS) Trial@highlight

The objective of the MEDIS study is to determine if subjects experiencing an Acute Ischaemic Stroke due to large vessel occlusion, treated with IV tPA combined with the MED procedure have a greater likelihood of recanalisation 30-90 minutes after the completion of tPA infusion than subjects treated with IV tPA (plus sham device).

 Safety of the MED System Procedure will be evaluated by the incidence of symptomatic PH-2 haemorrhagic transformation within 24 hours following the procedure.

 Lastly, a health economics study will be conducted to estimate health care costs for each treatment.
