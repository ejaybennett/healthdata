(secondQuint)Maximizing Trichiasis Surgery Success.

 In this trial the investigators will randomize 3,972 individuals with previously unoperated trichiasis on a 1:1:1 basis to bilamellar tarsal rotation trichiasis surgery with an incision height of 3mm, bilamellar tarsal rotation trichiasis surgery with an incision height of 5mm, or Trabut surgery.

 Participants will receive trichiasis surgery then will be followed at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 months after surgery.

 The primary outcome is development of post-operative trachomatous trichiasis (PTT) within 12 months after surgery.

 Logistic regression analyses will be performed to compare the rates of PTT in the 3 versus 5 mm incision BLTR groups, in the 3 mm BLTR versus Trabut group, and in the 5 mm BLTR versus Trabut group, adjusting for demographic characteristics and pre-operative trichiasis severity.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether the rate of post-operative trachomatous trichiasis differs significantly between bilamellar tarsal rotation surgery with an incision height of 3mm, bilamellar tarsal rotation surgery with an incision height of 5 mm, and Trabut surgery.
