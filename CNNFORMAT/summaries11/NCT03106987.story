(thirdQuint)A Study to Examine Olaparib Maintenance Retreatment in Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.

.

 The OReO study will investigate the efficacy and safety of Olaparib maintenance re-treatment in patients with relapsed non-mucinous EOC, who have had disease progression following maintenance therapy with a Polyadenosine 5'diphosphoribose [poly (ADP ribose)] polymerisation inhibitor (PARPi) and a complete or partial radiological response to subsequent treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.

 Patients will be enrolled on the basis of their breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA1, BRCA2) status into one of two cohorts (BRCA1/2 [+ve] and BRCA1/2 [-ve]).

 The BRCA1/2 (+ve) and BRCA1/2 (-ve) cohorts will be randomised separately.

 Within each cohort, patients will be randomised by prospective allocation in a 2:1 ratio (Olaparib: matching placebo).

@highlight

The OReO study will be a Phase IIIb, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of Olaparib retreatment, versus matching placebo, in non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients (including patients with primary peritoneal and/or fallopian tube cancer).
