(secondQuint)Mild Hypothermia Influence on Patient Outcome in Major Abdominal Surgery.

 This study evaluates associations between patients' core temperature during surgery and intra-operative blood loss, and to SSI.

 Additionally, the investigators observe the use of hypothermia prevention measures in operating theaters, use of surgical safety checklists.

 SSI is registered at discharge from hospital and up to 30 days post-discharge.

 The goal of the study is to contribute to focus on prevention of even mild hypothermia in surgery.

 This study is of interest for healthcare personnel as operating room nurses, surgeons, nurse anaesthetists, anaesthesiologists, ward nurses, post anaesthetic care unit nurses, and other healthcare staff involved in the in-hospital surgical pathway.
