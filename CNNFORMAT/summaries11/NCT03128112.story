(thirdQuint)Healthy Weight Poster, Multi-site Study.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a novel, educational, exam room poster can effectively prompt parents to ask their pediatricians about their children's weight status.

 Exam rooms within clinics will be randomized to either have the poster or not and parents will complete questionnaires assessing weight perception, whether they discussed their child's weight with their physician, and basic demographics.

 Participants who are in exam rooms with a poster will also answer questions specifically about the poster.
