(secondQuint)Predictive Value of 2-microspheres for Postoperative Delirium.

 In this study, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of the patients were collected to detect the levels of 2-microspheres before operation.

 Also, the patients were interviewed one day before the surgery and on postoperative days 1-3 by the Confusion Assessment Method and then divided them into POD and non-POD groups.

 The aim of the present study was to assess whether higher levels of 2-microspheres could predict the occurrence of POD.
