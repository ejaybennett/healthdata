(secondQuint)Cardiac Rehab for Advanced Heart Failure-LVAD Candidates.

 Frailty in patients with advanced heart failure is not thoroughly described, but in those studies that assessed frailty, it was a common phenomenon.

 Furthermore, some data suggest an association between pre-LVAD implant frailty and post-implant complications and survival.

 Interventions for frailty have been utilized in various populations, including the elderly frail and the frail from cardiovascular causes.

 These interventions target physical strengthening and endurance and have been shown on occasion to improve functional outcomes.

 The current study, a pilot study, seeks to assess frailty in a prospective cohort of patients being evaluated in Heart Failure Clinic for consideration of LVAD implantation due to NYHA class III-IV dyspnea and enroll these patients in a six-week focused cardiac rehabilitation protocol aimed at improving frailty and functional independence.

 The primary endpoint of the study is improvement in frailty markers at the end (gait speed, handgrip strength), and secondary endpoints include improvement in the indices of quality of life and symptomatology via validated questionnaires.

This study is a pilot study evaluating the feasibility and early efficacy of cardiac rehabilitation to improve frailty and symptoms in patients with advanced heart failure (NYHA class III-IV), who are being considered for LVAD therapy.
