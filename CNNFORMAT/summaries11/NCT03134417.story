(firstQuint)Magnesium and Vitamin D Supplementation and Cardiometabolic Outcomes.

 Individuals living with obesity are at a higher risk of cardiometabolic abnormalities and high circulating parathyroid hormone.

 There is evidence suggesting that vitamin D may play a role in cardiovascular health outcomes; however, the research is currently inconclusive.

 Magnesium is a cofactor of vitamin D metabolism, and the prevalence of concurrent vitamin D and magnesium deficiency is high.

 This study aims to investigate the effect of vitamin D and magnesium supplements in individuals who are overweight and obese on parathyroid hormone and cardiometabolic health.
