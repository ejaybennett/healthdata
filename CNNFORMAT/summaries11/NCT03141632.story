(secondQuint)Effects of Glucagon Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) Analogues on Fluid Intake.

 GLP-1 analogues are well known to stimulate glucose-induced insulin secretion and to reduce energy intake.

 Recent findings from animal and human studies suggest a role of GLP-1 in regulating water and salt homeostasis.

 GLP-1 has been shown to reduce fluid intake after an oral salt load or during a meal - pointing to a hypodipsic effect.

 The aim of this study is to elucidate whether these putative hypodipsic properties of GLP-1 analogues reduce fluid intake in healthy volunteers compared to placebo assessed during an evaluation visit of 8 hours.

The aim of this study is to elucidate whether GLP-1 analogues influence not only appetite but also thirst perception.

 It is hypothesized that GLP-1 analogues reduce fluid intake in healthy volunteers compared to Placebo.
