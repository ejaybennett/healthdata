(fifthQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of CC-90001 in Subjects With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.

 Approximately 135 adult male and female subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (according to the most recent IPF guideline for diagnosis and management) will be randomized 1:1:1 (45 subjects per arm) to treatment with oral CC-90001 (200 mg QD or 400 mg QD) or matching placebo for an initial 24 weeks.

 Subjects completing 24 weeks of treatment will continue onto the blinded 28-week Treatment Extension Phase.

 Following an initial screening at Visit 1, eligible subjects will be randomized to either CC-90001 200 mg or 400 mg PO QD or matching placebo beginning on Day 1 (Baseline Visit) of the study.

 Subjects completing the 24-week Double-blind Treatment Phase will continue the same blinded treatment assignment for 28 weeks in the Treatment Extension Phase.

 In the 28-week Treatment Extension Phase, all subjects will have the opportunity, if deemed appropriate by the Investigator, to use standard of care (SOC).

 The time to add and the choice of SOC will be at the Investigator's discretion.

 All subjects who complete the study treatment phases, or those subjects who discontinue Investigational product (IP) prior to the completion of the study, will participate in the 4-week Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase.

 The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

 An external DMC, comprised of independent physician experts and a statistician who are not affiliated with the Sponsor and for whom there is no identified conflict of interest will be responsible for safeguarding study participants' interests and for monitoring the overall conduct of the study.

 A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of CC-90001 in Subjects With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis@highlight

This is a Phase 2, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), quality of life and exploratory pharmacodynamics (PD) of two treatment doses of CC-90001, 200 mg and 400 mg, compared with placebo, when delivered once daily per os (PO) in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

 This study is designed to assess response to treatment by using measures of lung function, disease progression, fibrosis on radiography, and patient-reported outcomes.

 It will also assess dose response.
