(fifthQuint)Resistin in Septic Shock and Acute Kidney Injury.

 Day 1 of recruitment A blood sample (up to 20ml) and urine sample (up to 20ml) will be collected from an indwelling arterial/venous catheter and indwelling foley catheter respectively at the initiation of the study.

 The blood sample will be centrifuged in order to isolate the serum.

 The serum will either (1) be frozen at -80C if there is no laboratory technician able to run the ELISA assay for resistin or (2) processed per manufacturer's instructions to measure serum resistin levels via ELISA assay.

 Urine samples will also be centrifuged to remove sediment, and either (1) be frozen at -80C if there is no laboratory technician able to run the ELISA assay for resistin or (2) processed per manufacturer's instructions to measure serum resistin levels via ELISA assay.

 The investigators will record current medications and routine lab values which are available in the EMR at the time of collection of blood samples.

 This will enable the study team to determine the severity of septic shock and kidney injury (if present) at the time of collection of blood samples.

 When a laboratory technician is available to process serum samples, the following tests will be performed: Transwell Migration Assays with neutrophils NB4 cells will be used in this study.

 NB4 cells are a cultured human cell line for acute promyelolytic leukemia.

 They will be differentiated into neutrophils and then incubated in human control serum or patients samples prior to transwell migration assay.

 Migration without the neutrophil chemotactic factor N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or toward fMLP will be allowed for 2 hours.

 The migrated cells in the bottom well will be counted vial flow cytometry.

 All samples will be run in triplicates.

 Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Generation and Quantification ROS generation will be measured using a commercially available probe.

 Samples will be fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry.

 Day 5 The study team will exactly repeat the process described above ("Day 1 of recruitment") 4 days later to compare the levels of resistin during the course of disease (septic shock +/- AKI).

 Resistin in Septic Shock and Acute Kidney Injury@highlight

Sepsis-induced immunosuppression affects all types of immune cells.

 Neutrophils are pivotal components of innate immunity and provide the first line of defense against invading microorganisms.

 After recruitment to the site of invading microorganisms, they phagocytose, kill and digest the microorganisms via well-orchestrated processes involving reactive oxygen species (ROS).

 However, neutrophils in sepsis demonstrate an immunosuppressed phenotype.

(1) Reduced bacterial clearance, diminished production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and impaired recruitment to the site of infection are the most prominent features.

(2-4) Available data also reveal that neutrophil dysfunction develops prior to secondary infections, and patients with the most severely impaired neutrophil function carry the highest risk for secondary infections.

(3) However, the mechanisms involved are still poorly understood.

 Hyperresistinemia in sepsis has been associated with a greater disease severity and a worse outcome.

(5-7).

 The Investigator's prior work in vitro has demonstrated that hyperresistinemia reversibly hinders neutrophil migration by impairing F-actin formation.

(8) The current project revolves around the overall hypothesis that resistin also impairs bacterial killing by inhibiting the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species.

 While the study team has accumulated preliminary in vitro data supporting the inhibitory effect of resistin on neutrophils, it is imperative to confirm these findings in vivo.

 Specifically, the study team will need to study how serum resistin levels differ in patients with septic shock and acute kidney injury (AKI).

 Furthermore, it is essential to see how neutrophil function differs when exposed to serum from these two different patient populations (septic shock versus septic shock + AKI).
