(secondQuint)Assess Differences in Pain Following Cryo and Radiofrequency Atrial Fibrillation Ablation.

 Currently there are several different accepted techniques for performing ablation of atrial fibrillation.

 The two primary techniques currently in use in our center for atrial fibrillation are Cryo Balloon and Radiofrequency ablation.

 Based on personal observation, it is felt that patients undergoing Radiofrequency ablation have a higher incidence of chest discomfort and subsequently a greater requirement for pain medications post procedure as compared to those patients undergoing Cryo ablation.

 Assess Differences in Pain Following Cryo and Radiofrequency Atrial Fibrillation Ablation@highlight

The primary objective is to assess any differences in patient quality of life between Cryo Balloon ablation and Radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

 The study will also assess any differences in the amount and duration of pain medication required after the ablation.
