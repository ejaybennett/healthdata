(thirdQuint)PURE-HF: Peripheral Ultrafiltration for the RElief From Congestion in Heart Failure.

 The study will evaluate whether stepped, peripheral ultrafiltration complementary to low-dose diuretics influences 90-day clinical outcomes compared to usual care including intravenous diuretics in symptomatic heart failure patients with persistent congestion.

 Hospitalized subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either a tailored, peripheral ultrafiltration approach complementary to intravenous low-dose diuretics and other guideline-directed medical therapy OR high-dose diuretic therapy and other Guideline-directed medical therapy.

 PURE-HF: Peripheral Ultrafiltration for the RElief From Congestion in Heart Failure@highlight

This study evaluates whether tailored, peripheral ultrafiltration complementary to low-dose diuretics is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality in 90 days after randomization and heart failure events in 90 days after discharge than usual care including stepped intravenous diuretics in acutely decompensated chronic heart failure with fluid overload (not fully responsive to diuretic therapy).
