(fifthQuint)Neuromodulation by Non-invasive Brain Stimulation.

 The objective of this project is to determine the changes of behavioral performances (time of answer, percentage of correct answers) further to the neuromodulation.

 The specific question is to estimate the effect on the performances of access at the semantic representations of this method, according to the age.

 One of the hypotheses in the research on the normal ageing is the difficulty of access to these representations (fundamental process for the cognitive functions, such as the language and the memory) at the healthy elderly.

 By using the neuromodulation the investigators wish to explore this hypothesis and to understand if the neuromodulation can have a beneficial effect on the improvement of the behavioral performances of the elderly.

 Neuromodulation by Non-invasive Brain Stimulation@highlight

The main objective of this study is to estimate the effect of the neuromodulation on the behavioral performances during the access in semantics according to the age of the individuals.

 Neuromodulation by non-invasive stimulation allows to explore the functioning of the brain by exciting or by inhibiting localized cortical zones.

 The modulation of the performances in cognitive tasks, further to the neuromodulation of these zones, allows to deduce on their functional roles.
