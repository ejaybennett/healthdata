(fifthQuint)Test-Retest of (18)F-Fluoroazomycin Arabinoside ([18F]FAZA) PET-CT of Solid Tumors.

 Study Groups and Study Procedures: If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups depending on when you join the study.

 The first 5-8 participants will be enrolled in Group A and the next 5-8 will be enrolled in Group B.

 The study doctor will tell you to which group you have been assigned.

 - Group A will have 5 [18F]FAZA PET-CT scans on Day 1 of the study and 5 scans on Day 2.

 - Based on what is learned from Group A, Group B will have 5 or less [18F]FAZA PET-CT scans on Day 1 and will have 5 or less [18F]FAZA PET-CT scans on either Day 3, 4, or 5.

 [18F]FAZA will be given by vein as an injection 1 time each day, about 1 hour before the scans begin.

 This means you will be injected with [18F]FAZA a total of 2 times while on study.

 There may be a break between each scan.

 During that time you can get off the scanner, but you will be monitored for side effects.

 Your vital signs will be measured before and about 3 1/2 hours after the [18F]FAZA PET-CT scan.

 Follow-Up Phone Calls: You will be called about 24 hours after the [18F]FAZA PET-CT scans and asked about any side effects you may be having.

 You will also be called about 30 days after your last [18F]FAZA PET-CT scan and you will be asked about any side effects you may have had.

 Length of Study: Your participation in this study will be over after the 30 day follow-up phone call.

 Test-Retest of (18)F-Fluoroazomycin Arabinoside ([18F]FAZA) PET-CT of Solid Tumors@highlight

This goal of this clinical research study is to learn the best time to have a PET-CT scan after receiving (18)F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside ([18F]FAZA).

 During certain types of scans (like PET-CT scans), an "imaging agent" is injected into your bloodstream to help certain parts of your body be more clearly seen during the scan.

 [18F]FAZA is a new imaging agent designed to show how much oxygen is in a tumor during a PET-CT scan.

 This is an investigational study.

 The imaging agent [18F]FAZA is an investigational drug and its use in PET-CT scans is not FDA approved or commercially available.

 Its use in this study is investigational.

 The study doctor can describe how [18F]FAZA is designed to work.

 Up to 15 participants will be enrolled in the study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
