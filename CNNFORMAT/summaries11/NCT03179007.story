(thirdQuint)CTLA-4 and PD-1 Antibodies Expressing MUC1-CAR-T Cells for MUC1 Positive Advanced Solid Tumor.

 This study will be conducted using a phase I/II trial design to assess the safety and efficacy of the CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies expressing MUC1-CAR-T for patients with MUC1 positive, advanced recurrent or refractory malignant solid tumors.

 MUC1-CAR-T can specificly and effectively kill the MUC1 positive cancer cells, CTLA4 and PD-1 antibodies are secreted from the CAR-T cells could improve immunosuppression microenvironment, new CAR-T cells contain the advantages of CAR-T and immune checkpoint inhibitor, which is a promising therapeutic method for advanced solid tumors.

 The new CAR-T therapy is applied to clinical practice as bellow.

 T cells are prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by leukapheresis, and then activated and engineered to express CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor targeting MUC1.

 Cells are proliferated in culture and returned to the patients by venous transfusion.

 A total of 40 patients may be enrolled in the study.

 The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 24 months.

 CTLA-4 and PD-1 Antibodies Expressing MUC1-CAR-T Cells for MUC1 Positive Advanced Solid Tumor@highlight

This is a single-arm, open-label, one center clinical study, to determine the safety and efficacy of infusion of autologous T cells engineered to express immune checkpoint antibodies (CTLA-4 and PD-1) and chimeric antigen receptor targeting MUC1 in adult patients with MUC1 positive, advanced recurrent or refractory malignant solid tumors.
