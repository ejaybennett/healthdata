(thirdQuint)Mitochondrial Bioenergetics and Role in Cellular Damage in Ischemic Myocardium.

 Coronary artery disease, one of the most common pathologies in the developed world, causes hypoperfusion of myocardial tissue, usually evident by the presence of anginal pain.

 This myocardial ischemia elicits alterations in normal cardiomyocyte physiology, which gradually deteriorate cellular function, affecting the performance of the entire organ.

 The condition is frequently further complicated (and aggravated) by the presence of various co-morbidities, such as diabetes mellitus.

 The primary aim of this study is to investigate the cardiomyocyte bioenergetics and the consequences of potentially reduced mitochondrial metabolic function in ischemic heart, and evaluate the potential contribution of other conditions, primarily ones affecting metabolic homeostasis.

 Mitochondrial Bioenergetics and Role in Cellular Damage in Ischemic Myocardium@highlight

Cardiac ischemia is a common pathological condition, known to elicit multiple pathological processes at the cellular level.

 One of the most affected is thought to be cellular metabolism, key for the adequate cardiac function.

 The aim is to study mitochondrial bioenergetic function, interaction with other cellular systems and influence of several co-morbidities in myocardium of the affected patients.
