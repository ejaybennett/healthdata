(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy Comparison Of Two TAVI Systems in a Prospective Randomized Evaluation II.

 Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established and valuable treatment option for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and at high surgical risk for aortic valve replacement.

 The use of TAVI is rapidly expanding worldwide and its indications are widening into intermediate and lower risk populations.

 However, device comparisons by use of randomized trials are scarce in particular for newer generation transcatheter valves.

 The Symetis ACURATE neo cent , a self-expanding transcatheter valve delivered via transfemoral access, is a second-generation device that gained CE mark approval in June 2014.

 The SCOPE-II trial will compare the safety and performance of the Symetis ACURATE neo cent with the self-expanding Medtronic Evolut R system, a widely used and well-established transcatheter heart valve, which obtained CE mark in 8NOV2006 and HAS approval on 13JAN2015.
