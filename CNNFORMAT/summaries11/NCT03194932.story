(fifthQuint)Study of Venetoclax in Combination With Chemotherapy in Pediatric Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Acute Leukemia of Ambiguous Lineage.

 This study will be done in two parts: - Part 1 - Dose Escalation: The goal of Part 1 of the study is to find the highest tolerable combination of venetoclax and chemotherapy that can be given to patients with leukemia.

 - Part 2 - Dose Expansion: After determination of doses in Part 1, patients will be enrolled on Part 2: to look at the effects of the venetoclax in combination with chemotherapy.

 Depending on when participants enroll on the study, PART1 participants will receive one of the following courses of therapy: - Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine every 12 hours on days 8-17; OR - Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine every 12 hours on days 8-11; OR - Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine every 12 hours on days 8-11; idarubicin once on day 1; OR - Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine every 12 hours on days 8-17; idarubicin once on day 1.

 PART 2 participants will receive one of the following courses of therapy: - Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine - to be determined from Part 1 of the study; OR - Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine - to be determined from Part 1 of the study; idarubicin once on day 8.

 The cytarabine dosage will be that found in Part 1 to be the highest safest dose.

 Those participants receiving idarubicin will also receive dexrazoxane.

 All participants on both Part 1 and Part 2 receive one intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy before starting the first cycle.

 Patients with CNS disease will receive weekly IT therapy until the cerebrospinal fluid becomes free of leukemia (minimum of 4 doses).

 Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to assess response will be performed between days 28 and 42 of cycle 1.

 Patients who achieve complete remission/complete remission with incomplete count recovery/partial remission (CR/CRi/PR) and who do not experience unacceptable toxicity during cycle 1 may receive up to four cycles of chemotherapy.

 Study of Venetoclax in Combination With Chemotherapy in Pediatric Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Acute Leukemia of Ambiguous Lineage@highlight

The purpose of this study is to test the safety of venetoclax and to find the highest dose of venetoclax that can be given safely when it is combined with one or two chemotherapy drugs (cytarabine or cytarabine and idarubicin).

 This study tests different doses of venetoclax to see which dose is safer in children with leukemia.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Determine a tolerable combination of venetoclax plus chemotherapy in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage.

 The primary endpoint is the maximum tolerated combination (MTC) of venetoclax plus chemotherapy.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: Estimate the overall response rate to the combination of venetoclax and chemotherapy in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractor AML or acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage.

 The secondary endpoints are the rates of complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) for patients treated at the MTC.
