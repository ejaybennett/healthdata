(secondQuint)Platelet-rich Plasma for Chronic Lateral Ankle Instability.

 Chronic lateral ankle instability (CAI) in a common foot and ankle problem.

 It has been linked to recurrent ankle pain, swelling, and even early degenerative change if not properly treated.

 Lateral ligament reconstruction using modified Brostrom-Gould procedure is the mainstream in treatment of CAI.

 Early mobilization is related to better functional outcome, and rapid healing of the repair is the key point to shorten the immobilization time.

 Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a fraction of plasma that contains platelets and multiple growth factors concentrated at high level.

 Because activated platelets have the potential to release growth factors, PRP has been clinically used to accelerate wound healing and tissue regeneration.

 However, there is no conclusion regarding the efficacy of PRP on CAI.

 This clinical trial will investigate the effect of PRP on CAI.

 Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive PRP or whole blood during the modified Brostrom-Gould procedure.

 The postoperative imaging and clinical outcomes will be compared and analyzed.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on chronic lateral ankle instability by comparing the imaging and clinical outcomes between patients receiving PRP and those receiving whole blood during the modified Brostrom-Gould procedure.
