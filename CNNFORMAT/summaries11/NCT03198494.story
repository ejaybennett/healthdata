(thirdQuint)Acoustic Stimulation for Seizure Suppression.

 1.

 To test the feasibility of wearing an earphone system delivering acoustic stimulation during a night of sleep in adult epilepsy patients monitored in an inpatient unit.

 2.

 To determine the acute physiological effects of low-frequency acoustic stimulation on interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) frequency during NREM sleep in adult patients with epilepsy in an ambulatory setting.

 3.

 To determine the feasibility of applying low-frequency acoustic stimulation in a long-term home setting in adult epilepsy patients with frequent nocturnal seizures.

 Acoustic Stimulation for Seizure Suppression@highlight

The objective of this study is to test the feasibility and physiological effect of low-frequency (1 Hz) acoustic stimulation delivered during nocturnal NREM sleep in epilepsy patients.

 The long-term goal is to develop this protocol for daily, long-term use in a home setting, for nocturnal seizure and IED suppression
