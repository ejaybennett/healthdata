(thirdQuint)Emotional Regulation and Impulsivity Among Adolescents With Borderline Personality Disorder.

 Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a severe condition associated with intense emotional and behavioral responses to stressful events, impulsivity, and risk-taking behavior.

 It has been shown to begin in adolescence.

 However, very few studies have addressed the physiopathology of BPD in adolescents.

 In order to gather rational information for targeted care, the heterogeneity of BPD determinants needs to be disentangled.

 To this aim, a multimodal approach to BPD dimensional aspects is proposed.

 BPD adolescents will be compared to typically developing controls in two complementary experimental designs: (1) Monitoring of neurovegetative, hormonal and body motion responses to an acute stress, with the hypothesis that stress reactivity might account for the physiopathology of the disorder; (2) Structural and functional imaging (fMRI BOLD) in the context of a reward processing task to delineate the neural/functional basis of BPD risk taking behavior.

This study aims to better understand the behavioral, neurobiological and hormonal underpinnings of stress and reward reactivity of adolescents suffering from borderline personality disorder compared to healthy adolescents by a multimodal approach based on clinical assessments, structural and functional mri and experimental acute stress exposure.
