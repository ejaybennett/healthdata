(secondQuint)Evaluating the Safety and Immunogenicity of EnvSeq-1 Envs Adjuvanted With GLA-SE, Administered Alone or With DNA Mosaic-Tre Env, in Healthy, HIV-Uninfected Adults.

 This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of EnvSeq-1 Envs adjuvanted with GLA-SE, administered with or without DNA Mosaic-Tre env, in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

 The four individual EnvSeq-1 HIV vaccine Envs used in this study are called CH505TF, CH505w53, CH505w78, and CH505w100.

 DNA Mosaic-Tre env is also an HIV vaccine.

 This study will take place in two parts: Part A and Part B.

 Participants in Part A will be randomly assigned to one of four groups.

 Participants in each group will receive CH505TF (admixed with GLA-SE) or placebo by intramuscular (IM) injection at Months 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12.

 Study researchers will evaluate participant data from Part A of the study prior to enrolling participants into Part B of the study.

 Researchers will also evaluate data from Part A to determine the dosing for Part B.

 Participants in Part B will be randomly assigned to one of five groups.

 Participants in each group will receive IM injections at Months 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16.

 Injections for Part B, Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, will follow an additive and a sequential approach to EnvSeq-1 vaccine administration, both with and without the DNA Mosaic-Tre env vaccine.

 The sequential approach will start with administration of the CH505TF vaccine at Month 0, then CH505w53 at Month 2, CH505w78 at Month 4, and CH505w100 at Months 8, 12, and 16.

 Part B, Group 5 participants will receive placebo injections at each time point.

 Additional study visits will occur through Month 18 for participants in Part A and through Month 22 for participants in Part B.

 Visits may include physical examinations and clinical assessments; blood, urine, and stool collection; HIV testing; risk reduction counseling; and interviews/questionnaires.

 Study staff will contact participants for follow-up health monitoring at Month 24 for participants in Part A and at Month 28 for participants in Part B.
