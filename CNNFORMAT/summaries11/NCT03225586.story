(fifthQuint)Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology Study.

 1.

 To examine the relationship between societal influences and prevalence of risk factors and chronic noncommunicable diseases.

 Societal determinants are measured by an index of measures from each of the 4 domains of interest: built environment, food and nutrition policy, psychosocial/socioeconomic factors, and tobacco.

 2.

 To examine the relationship between societal determinants and incidence of chronic noncommunicable disease events (e.

g.

 cardiovascular disease, cancer) and on changes in rates of selected risk factors (e.

g.

 smoking) 3.

 To examine the relationship between health related behaviors (e.

g.

 diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol) and health outcomes (e.

g.

 death, non-communicable diseases) 4.

 The quality of health systems across a diverse range of health resource settings, and how this impacts health outcomes 5.

 Genetic factors for non-communicable diseases.

 Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology Study@highlight

To examine the impact of health determinants at the individual (e.

g.

 health related behaviors) and societal level (e.

g.

 environmental factors, health related policy, quality of health systems) on health outcomes (e.

g.

 death, non-communicable disease development) across a range of socioeconomic and health resource settings.

 Additional components of this study will examine genetic factors for non-communicable diseases.

 This will be examined both through a cross sectional component, and prospectively (cohort component).
