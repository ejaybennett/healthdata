(fifthQuint)Protocol for Observational Study of Post op Delirium Following Total Joint Arthroplasties.

 BACKGROUND Modern studies have evaluated the risk factors and incidence of postoperative delirium in post-TJA patients.

 In current literature, incidence ranges from 0-10%.

 However, the epidemiology of these studies mainly focused on non-Asian populations.

 The investigators hope to determine both the incidence and risk factors of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing TJA with a focus on the Asian population.

 This is especially relevant in today's ageing Asian population.

 AIMS To characterize the incidence and risk factors of delirium in older adults undergoing elective total joint replacement surgery.

 HYPOTHESIS The incidence of postoperative delirium following elective TJA is low compared to Western studies.

 Age, gender and use of opioids perioperatively are risk factors for postoperative delirium following elective total joint replacement surgery.

 DESIGN: Prospective observational study.

 SETTING: Academic medical center.

 DURATION: July 2017 - Dec 2017 STUDY POPULATION: Individuals aged 65 to 90 years old undergoing elective total joint (hip or knee) replacement surgery.

 METHODOLOGY: Preoperative data Before the operation, each patient will be interviewed to assess their baseline cognitive status.

 The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) will be used, which is a 11-question screening tool used to evaluate the cognitive aspects of mental function.

 A score of 0-30 can be obtained with higher values denoting better cognitive function.

 A score of cent database.

 This will include data regarding patient's demographics, smoking history, alcohol history, pre-existing medical conditions, preoperative medications.

 Each patient will also be rated preoperatively by an anaesthesiologist in the PEC based on the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification.

 For analysis, the investigators will be calculating each patient's perioperative risk based on the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).

 Preoperative laboratory results, including data about haemoglobin or creatinine level, will also be collected.

 Intraoperative data Data regarding the surgery will be collected.

 Intraoperative data includes type of arthroplasty performed (total hip or total knee arthroplasty), type of anaesthesia (spinal, general or other anaesthesia), use of femoral nerve block, intraoperative drug use, tourniquet time, intra-articular injections and blood transfusion (number of pints transfused).

 Occurrence of hypotension, which is defined as a mean arterial pressure cent (Research Electronic Data Capture) tool hosted on a secure server at Singapore General Hospital.

 The hardcopy of the research data will be securely stored within the department.

 The softcopy of research data will be saved in a password-protected file and will be stored in institution approved login-protected system and encrypted hard-drive.

 Only study members will have access to the data.

 Power and sample size calculations The sample size will be calculated based on the incidence of postoperative delirium.

 Based on existing literature, the estimated incidence of postoperative delirium following TJA is around 10%.

 Using this estimate, a minimum sample size of 150 patients will be needed to detect the incidence with a precision of 5% and power of 80%.

 The sample size of 200 patients is needed to measure incidence to account for attrition.

 However, this study will also be analysing the factors which may be correlated to postoperative delirium by logistic regression.

 A study population size of 500 will thus be targeted to be able to run a multiple logistic model while minimising the limitation of a small number of events of postoperative delirium.

 Protocol for Observational Study of Post op Delirium Following Total Joint Arthroplasties@highlight

The incidence of post-operative delirium in the South-east Asian population is not known.

 Through a prospective, single centre, observational study, the investigators aim to characterize the incidence and risk factors of delirium in older adults undergoing elective total joint arthroplasties (TJA).

 The study will recruit eligible patients (65 - 90 years old undergoing elective TJA), with a targeted sample size of 500.

 Patients will be screened for dementia and Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) scores obtained pre and post operatively.

 Other data such as preoperative Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), post op complications using Post operative Morbidity Survey (POMS), pain scores, readmission rates and length of hospital stay (LOS), functional and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) will also be collected and analysed.
