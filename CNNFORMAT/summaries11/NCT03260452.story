(fifthQuint)Comparison of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Activity in Adipose Tissue From Type 2 Diabetic Patients and Healthy Volunteers.

 In mice, increasing data demonstrate a causal relationship between the inflammatory process in adipose tissue and the development of insulin resistance, resulting in type 2 diabetes occurrence.

 However, the mechanisms mediating inflammation and its metabolic consequences are still unclear.

 In humans, recent publications have suggested an important interaction between the metabolic status and medullar hematopoietic activity.

 A preliminary study performed by the STROMAlab's research team has identified functional hematopoietic stem cells in human adipose tissue samples, indicating that adipose tissue-hematopoiesis is an active mechanism.

 To determine whether an alteration in adipose tissue-hematopoiesis could be a hallmark of type 2 diabetes in human, biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue will be performed in 2 groups of 10 volunteers: overweight/obese type 2 diabetes subjects versus healthy volunteers, matched on age.

 Then, hematopoietic stem cells extracted from human biopsies will be grafted into immunodeficient mice and after 12 weeks, flow cytometry using antibodies specific for human cell surface markers will be performed to quantify proinflammatory macrophages derived from human adipose tissue-hematopoietic stem cells.

Based on solid preclinical results in mice and preliminary data in humans, this study aims to provide the proof of concept of the crucial role of the hematopoietic process occurring in human adipose tissue in the initiation of the inflammatory process at the origin of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

 The main objective is to compare the number of pro-inflammatory macrophages derived from human adipose tissue hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) according to their origin, type 2 diabetes subjects or healthy volunteers.
