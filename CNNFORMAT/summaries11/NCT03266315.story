(fifthQuint)Probiotics Supplementation and Length of Hospital Stay in Neonates With Gastrointestinal Surgery.

 Research Objectives/Question: The main objective of this study is to determine the impact of probiotics administration on length of hospital stay in neonate undergoing gastrointestinal surgery.

 The study will also generate important data about safety and efficacy of probiotics in this surgical population.

 Primary question: Does probiotic supplementation in neonates after gastrointestinal surgery reduce the duration of parenteral nutrition? Secondary outcomes: 1.

 Length of hospital stay 2.

 Time to reach full feed (defined as 120 ml/kg/day)in the post-operative period 3.

 Incidence of infection as defined by positive bacterial blood, urine or cerebrospinal fluid culture 4.

 Incidence of cholestasis 5.

 Duration of cholestasis 6.

 Growth anthropometrics(weight, head circumference and length) and Z-score 7.

 Diversity and abundancy of stool microbiome at baseline and after 1 and 3 weeks of initiation of probiotics Relevance: Project has the potential to promote the health of Alberta's children and their families.

 Improve feed tolerance, prevent complications of parenteral nutrition and shortening the length of hospital stay in neonates with gastrointestinal surgery are potential health benefits for the project.

 Methodology: Study design This study will be a randomized controlled trial NICU at Alberta Children's Hospital and Stollery Children's Hospital .

 Probiotics or placebo will be administered orally or via naso- or orogastric feeding tube.

 Clinical outcomes and gut microbiome data will be compared between the two groups.

 The project starting time is November 2017.

 Study duration will be 18 months.

 Study Population Infants born between 23 - 42 weeks of gestation, admitted to NICU at Alberta Children's Hospital for gastrointestinal surgery.

 1.

 Inclusion Criteria: 1.

 Infants born between 23 - 42 weeks of gestation 2.

 Required gastrointestinal surgery in a first week of life (including spontaneous intestinal perforation, necrotizing enterocolitis, bowel atresia, mechanical bowel obstruction, volvulus, gastroschisis) 3.

 Ready to start enteral feeding 2.

 Exclusion Criteria: 1.

 Infants with major congenital anomalies excluding GI tract 2.

 Suspected congenital or acquired immune deficiency 3.

 Palliative care patient 4.

 Septic babies with positive blood, CSF or urine culture Sample Size and feasibility A study by Dang et al.

 revealed a difference of 3 days in the time to reach full feeds in non-surgical preterm infants receiving probiotics compared to those in the placebo group.

 (3) A sample size of 44 infants per group will allow for a power of 0.

8 and an alpha of 0.

05 for a two-tailed detect similar difference in surgical neonates.

 Assuming that 70% of parents' consent to their infant's participation in the study, it will be feasible to complete enrollment of 88 babies in the 2 year period of the study.

 Variables collected 1.

 Demographic variables: Gestational age, birth weight, gender, mode of delivery, singleton/multiple and rank, maternal administration of corticosteroids and antibiotics, duration of rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis.

 2.

 Clinical variables: Type of surgery, day of life at start of feeds post-surgery, total days of study drug, antibiotic use pre- and post-surgery, type of feeds during NICU and at discharge.

 3.

 Outcome variables: mortality, time taken to reach full enteral feeds before (if applicable) and after surgery (defined by 120ml/kg/day), post-operative total days of NPO and TPN, duration of central catheter use, number of separate NPO events, Z-score, head circumference and weight at discharge home, post-operative infection (blood, urine or CSF), length of hospital stay, and incidence of cholestasis (defined by conjugated bilirubin >34 micromol/L).

 Study protocol.

 Infants will be identified within 48 hours of surgery and parents will be approached for informed consent.

 Once consent is obtained, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either probiotics or placebo.

 Investigators will conduct the randomization using a computer-generated table of random numbers generated at the University of Calgary.

 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug The study supplementation will be started at the when oral feeds will reach 24 mL/kg/day after surgery after collecting a stool/ostomy sample.

 The decision to start feeding will be made by the neonatal and surgical team.

 After the first stool/ostomy sample is obtained, one study sachet to a minimum of 1 mL of Expressed Breast Milk (EBM) (mothers own milk or donor human milk) once a day.

 If mothers own milk or donor human milk is not available, 1 sachet will be added to a minimum of 1 mL of sterile water or formula (in formula fed babies) once a day.

 All empty sachets will be placed into biohazard container.

 Placebo sachet will be made of 0.

3 g maltodextrin and be administered to the control group in the same manner.

 If the infant is placed NPO, the study drug will be stopped and restarted together with refeeding.

 Both probiotic and placebo will be packaged as single dose sachet.

 They will be maintained, blinded and dispensed by the pharmacists at the study sites, who will be the only ones knowing the subject assignment.

 The study probiotic / placebo will be given till discharge.

 If the infant is transferred outside NICU, the study drug will be dispensed with the infant and clinical outcomes will be ascertained in collaboration with the local Pediatrician at the time of infants' discharge home.

 Sample collection Nurses will collect the stool samples at 3 time points: prior to initiation, 1 week after and 4 weeks after probiotic or placebo administration is commenced.

 "Stool" will be collected directly from the infant's ostomy bag and diaper with a sterile spatula.

 As soon as a sample is collected, the nurse will contact the investigators.

 The samples will then be placed in a laboratory freezer (-80C) within 24 hours of collection.

 Batched samples will be transported to the University of Calgary Genomics laboratory for subsequent microbiome processing.

 Probiotics Supplementation and Length of Hospital Stay in Neonates With Gastrointestinal Surgery@highlight

Probiotics have been started in the NICUs in Calgary since 2016 aiming to decrease the incidence of NEC.

 Adults with abdominal surgery who received post-op probiotics reported a significant reduction in surgical site infection, urinary tract infection, and combined infection.

 Currently probiotics used only in none-surgical population of infants The main objective of this study is to determine the impact of probiotics administration on length of hospital stay in neonates undergoing intestinal surgery.

 The study will also generate important data about safety and efficacy of probiotics in this surgical population.
