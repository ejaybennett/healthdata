(secondQuint)Use of Injectable-platelet-rich-fibrin (I-PRF) to Thicken Gingival Phenotype.

 Due to the thin gingival phenotype, gingival recession is a problem.

 The investigators aimed to increase the gingival thickness using i-PRF with microneedle without considering surgical procedures, considering the positive effects of platelet concentrations on revascularization and wound healing in individuals with bone defect, fenestration and gingival thickness which are prone to gingival recession .

 Use of Injectable-platelet-rich-fibrin (I-PRF) to Thicken Gingival Phenotype@highlight

The main objective of this study is to investigate whether the for individuals with thin gingival thickness who are susceptible to gingival recession, the investigators will use i-PRF with microneedle to increase gingival thickness without the need for surgical procedures
