(firstQuint)Tolerability, Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study of GX-30 in Total Thyroidectomy or Near Total Thyroidectomy Patients.

 Recombinant human TSH was developed to provide TSH stimulation without withdrawal of thyroid hormone.

 Radioiodine ablation and diagnosis with rhTSH became standard of care treatment for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.

 Stably supplying rhTSH has been the unmet need for management and follow-up procedure for thyroid remnant.

 GX-30 is an investigational product, developed to provide inexpensive rhTSH to patients in order to ensure stable supply of rhTSH.

 The purpose of this study is to assess tolerability of GX-30, in patients with total thyroidectomy or near total thyroidectomy.
