(fifthQuint)Transoral Robotic Surgery and Tailored Radiotherapy in Unknown Primary and Small Squamous Cell Head and Neck Cancer.

 Patients who present with carcinomas of unknown primary site (CUP) of the head and neck represent a challenging problem for clinicians both from a diagnostic and therapeutic perspective.

 Traditional techniques for identification of primary tumors involved a Positron Emission Tomography scan (PET)/ computerized tomography scan(CT) followed by examination under anesthesia with biopsies of the nasopharynx, tongue base, piriform sinuses in conjunction with a tonsillectomy may identify as many as 44% of primary tumors, the remaining unidentified tumors are treated with mucosal irradiation to all high risk mucosal sites.

 The addition of a lingual tonsillectomy with Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) may identify almost 70% of primary tumours that have otherwise escaped initial identification at this timepoint,.

 Historically, for those whose primary would not be discovered at the PET/CT, the discovery would have been made later during follow up visits.

 The investigators propose to integrate Transoral Robotic Surgery into the diagnostic evaluation of participants presenting with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the neck of unknown primary origin.

 The investigators will localize small hidden oropharyngeal carcinomas, determine their laterality, and based on the laterality of the tumour, laterality of neck nodes, and completeness of resection, will offer reduced radiotherapy to the primary site and/or to the neck (de-intensification)to the participant.

 The investigators hypothesize that this approach to unknown primary carcinomas will be both safe and effective.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) to identify small oropharyngeal carcinomas.

 Findings from this study will be used to better determine which patients may be suitable for more targeted radiotherapy that would lead to a reduction in the total amount of radiotherapy needed as part of their treatment.

 Reducing the amount of radiotherapy received has been found to reduce the risk of late complications and toxicity to the patient.

The pathologic findings will then be used to determine patients who may be candidates for de-intensification of radiotherapy.
