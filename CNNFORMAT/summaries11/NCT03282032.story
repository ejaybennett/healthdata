(firstQuint)Preconditioning of One-lung Ventilation.

 For lung isolation and better surgical view, one-lung ventilation(OLV) is essential for thoracic surgery.

 However, OLV may cause serious pulmonary complications due to intraoperative hypoxia.

 Animal studies showed a positive effect of OLV preconditioning (Intermittent OLV before surgical intervention) on perioperative pulmonary oxygenation.

 Thus, we designed a study to observe the effect of OLV preconditioning on perioperative oxygenation during thoracic surgery.
