(thirdQuint)Effect of Strength and Coordination Training on Biomechanics and Injury in New Runners.

 The study will investigate the effect of a sequenced training program - beginning with strength training, followed by running-specific coordination exercises, and finally a gradual introduction to running - on strength, coordination and injury incidence in a group of novice runners.

 he investigators hypothesize that runners who perform strength and coordination training prior to beginning to run will 1) demonstrate greater lower extremity strength, 2) demonstrate alters coordination patterns and 3) experience fewer injuries, when compared to a control group of novice runners who perform no physical preparation prior to a gradual introduction to running.

 The possible long-term benefits of this study include reduced burden of running-related injuries, increased participation in the sport of running, improved cardiovascular and metabolic health characteristics, and reduced incidence of disease such as cardiovascular events and cancer.

The investigators hypothesize that new runners participating in an 8 week strength and coordination training program prior to beginning to run will 1) display different coordination patterns , and 2) experience fewer injuries, compared to new runners who do not perform strength or coordination training prior to running.
