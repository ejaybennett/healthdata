(thirdQuint)TRANSFORM-HF: ToRsemide compArisoN With furoSemide FORManagement of Heart Failure.

 - This study will be a randomized, unblinded, two-arm, multi-center clinical trial of patients with heart failure who are hospitalized.

 Heart failure need not be the reason for hospitalization.

 Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either oral torsemide OR oral furosemide prior to hospital discharge.

 Oral dosing of torsemide compared to furosemide will be 1mg:2mg.

 The specific loop diuretic dose will be at the discretion of the treating physician with the above noted conversion.

 - Trial enrollment occurs before hospital discharge, at the discretion of the healthcare provider.

 - As appropriate, adherence to the randomized medication will be encouraged during the remainder of hospitalization and will continue post-discharge.

 Patients will receive follow-up per standard care without any additional study-specific visits.

 - Patients will have 30-day, 6-month and 12-month follow-up phone contacts for assessments of vital status, interval hospitalizations, adherence, and quality of life.

 "Central follow-up" and collection of hospital discharge summaries via IRB-approved mechanisms.

 Subsets of patients enrolled early in the study have additional phone contacts beyond 12 months, up to 30 months, at six month intervals, to document vital status.

 TRANSFORM-HF: ToRsemide compArisoN With furoSemide FORManagement of Heart Failure@highlight

TRANSFORM-HF is a large-scale, pragmatic, randomized, unblinded clinical effectiveness study comparing torsemide versus furosemide as treatment for heart failure.

 Approximately 6,000 patients with heart failure will be enrolled.

 The primary objective of the TRANSFORM-HF study is to compare the treatment strategy of torsemide versus furosemide on clinical outcomes over 12 months in patients with heart failure who are hospitalized.
