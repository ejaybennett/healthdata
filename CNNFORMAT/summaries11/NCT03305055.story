(thirdQuint)RCT: Fentanyl Plus Ketamine Versus Fentanyl Alone for Acute Burn Pain.

 Department of Defense (DoD) and the U.

S.

 Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) are funding this RCT for the following reasons: Primary Aims: 1.

 To evaluate the safety and efficacy of fentanyl (usual care) + placebo versus fentanyl + ketamine (low-dose, sub-anesthetic, slow-infusion) during twice daily burn wound care across a 7-day study period and 30 day outcome period.

 2.

 To evaluate the opiate sparing effect of fentanyl (usual care) + placebo versus fentanyl + ketamine (low-dose, sub-anesthetic, slow-infusion) during the 7-day study period and 30 day outcome period.

 and Secondary Aims: 1.

 To determine the short and long term effect of the Ketamine Augmentation Condition versus the Usual Care Condition on symptoms and syndromes of posttraumatic stress disorder and of depression, 2.

 To evaluate several established and hypothesized moderators of the relationship between the Ketamine Augmentation Condition versus the Usual Care Condition on: 1) pain severity reported during wound care, 2) opiate use during wound care, 3) posttraumatic stress and 4) depression.

 RCT: Fentanyl Plus Ketamine Versus Fentanyl Alone for Acute Burn Pain@highlight

The Ketamine for Acute Pain in Burns study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial (RCT) with active control (usual care) contrasting the efficacy and safety of "Ketamine Plus Opiate-based usual care" (O+K) with the safety and efficacy of the "Current Standard of Care".

 THe current standard of care is an opiate medication alone, Fentanyl (Usual Care-Opiate (UC-O), dose/timing as per Burn Center protocol).
