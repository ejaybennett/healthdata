(thirdQuint)EMPOWER: Randomized Trial of Online Chronic Pain Management Program to Reduce Reliance on Opioid Analgesic Medications.

 This study will determine whether an innovative, accessible E-health intervention can assist with reduced opioid reliance in chronic pain patients, which can, ultimately, reduce risks of unintended opioid overdose and death.

 Importantly, the study will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms contributing to opioid use reduction while managing pain.

 The findings may assist in developing treatment options for a population at risk for opioid adverse effects.

 Potential participants will be identified through electronic health record (EHR) queries at participating sites.

 Participants will be assessed at baseline, at the end of the 4-month treatment period, and at 6 months following end-of-treatment through an electronic data capture system accessed by the participants.

 Other outcome data will be obtained from the participant's EHR data.

 EMPOWER: Randomized Trial of Online Chronic Pain Management Program to Reduce Reliance on Opioid Analgesic Medications@highlight

This is a 10-month internet-based randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether an online chronic pain management program ("E-Health") can assist with reduced opioid reliance in chronic pain patients.

 About half of the eligible participants will receive access to the E-Health program in addition to their standard chronic pain treatment; the other half will just continue receiving their standard chronic pain treatment.
