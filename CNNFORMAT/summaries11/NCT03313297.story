(secondQuint)Glucocorticoids and Skin Healing in Diabetes (GC-SHealD).

 Glucocorticoids are known to impair skin function and wound healing which are also compromised in patients with type 2 diabetes.

 The enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11-HSD1) activates glucocorticoids in target tissues including skin.

 Pre-clinical data demonstrate that 11-HSD1 inhibition improves skin function and wound healing but this has not been investigated in man.

 Using the 11-HSD1 inhibitor AZD4017, we will investigate if 1.

 Oral AZD4017 inhibits 11-HSD1 activity in skin 2.

 AZD4017 is safe and well-tolerated in patient with T2DM 3.

 Oral AZD4017 regulates skin function 4.

 Systemic glucocorticoid levels and skin 11-HSD1 activity, independently or in combination correlate with measures of skin function Study feasibility will also be assessed; if successful, data from this pilot study will inform power calculations for a future trial to investigate the ability of 11-HSD1 inhibition to promote foot ulcer healing in type 2 diabetes.

The study aims to investigate effects of inhibiting glucocorticoid activation on skin function and wound healing in patients with type 2 diabetes.

 Half of patients will be given a drug to inhibit glucocorticoid activation and the other half will be given a placebo.
