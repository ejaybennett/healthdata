(fifthQuint)Effects of Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation on Oxidative Stress, Antioxidant Capacity, Inflammatory Responses, Fatigue Elimination, and Exercise Performance in Athletes.

.

 The long-term high-amount and -intensity exercise training could cause oxidative damage, muscle impairment, inflammation and exercise fatigue to athletes easily.

 Such above conditions will affect the exercise performances and health of athletes.

 This research will take 2 years to implement.

 The aims of the 1st year are: 1) to compare the differences in plasma coenzyme Q10, oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, muscle impairment, fatigue recovery, and inflammation and exercise performances among three type of athletes (i.

e.

, swimming, soccer, and taekwondo players) and healthy non-athletes; 2) to investigate the relationship between plasma coenzyme Q10, oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, muscle impairment, fatigue recovery, and inflammation and exercise performances; 3) to explore the influence on plasma coenzyme Q10, oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, muscle impairment, fatigue recovery, and inflammation and exercise performances for three type of athletes, respectively, Week 0, Week 6, and Week 12 various doses of coenzyme Q10 intervention (150 mg/day and 300 mg/day).

 The aims of the 2nd year are: 1) to explore the effects of acute- single various doses of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on plasma coenzyme Q10, oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, muscle impairment, fatigue recovery, and inflammation among three type of athletes, respectively, before and after low-to-moderate intensity interval training; 2) to explore the effects of acute- single various doses of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on plasma coenzyme Q10, oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, muscle impairment, fatigue recovery, and inflammation among three type of athletes, respectively, before and after high-intensity interval training; 3) to investigate the relationship of changes in plasma coenzyme Q10, oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, muscle impairment, fatigue recovery, and inflammation before and after exercise training.

 During the 1st year, the cross-sectional and interventional studies are planning to recruit swimming (n = 30), soccer (n = 30), and taekwondo (n = 30) athletes and healthy non-athletes (n = 30).

 In addition, the intervention studies of coenzyme Q10 will be conducted with the swimming, soccer, and taekwondo athletes separately divided into 3 subgroups based on various doses of coenzyme Q10 [placebo group, low-dose group, and high-dose group, and control group] with an intervention duration lasting for 12 weeks.

 It is scheduled that the examinations on anthropometric measurements, exercise performance, urine and blood sampling are separately conducted on Week 0, Week 6 and Week 12.

 During the 2nd year, the interventional and follow-up studies of coenzyme Q10 will be conducted with the swimming, soccer, and taekwondo athletes separately divided into 3 subgroups based on acute- single various doses of coenzyme Q10 supplementation [placebo group, low-dose group, and high-dose group, and control group] after low-to-moderate and high-intensity interval training.

 It is scheduled that the examinations on anthropometric measurements, urine, and blood sampling are separately conducted on 0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min.

 Eventually, these results of this study can provide the information for the known to improve the oxidative stress, anti-oxidation and inflammation internal to the bodies of athletes for various competitions.

 As a consequence, the athletic performances can be further enhanced.
