(firstQuint)The Effects of Early Life PUFA and R-TFA on AD: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

 The prevalence of Allergic Diseases (AD) is rising dramatically worldwide especially in more industrialized countries during the past two decades, representing a substantial disease burden of individuals and health service cost.

 Early life nutritional exposures could modify the gene expression and susceptibility of allergic diseases (AD), yet the effects of early life polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and ruminant trans fatty acids (R-TFA) on AD remain unclear.

Therefore,the investigators performed the meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate whether early life natural exposure to PUFA and R-TFA affects the AD risk.
