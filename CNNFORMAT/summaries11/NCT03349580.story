(firstQuint)Early Initiation of a Strength Training Based Rehabilitation After Lumbar Spine Fusion Improves Core Muscle Strength.

 The 27 patients were recruited for the study, aged 45 to 70 years, who had undergone lumbar spine fusion.

 The patients were randomized in to two groups.

 The strength training group started rehabilitation 3 weeks after surgery.

 The patients exercised two times per week, over 9 weeks.

 The focus was on muscle activation of lumbopelvic muscles stabilization.

 The control group followed a standard postoperative protocol, where no exercises were performed at the rehabilitation stage.

 The functional outcomes and the plain radiographs were evaluated after 3 weeks and subsequently after 3 and 18 months after the surgery.
