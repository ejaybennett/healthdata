(thirdQuint)The Relationship Between Physical Activity and Radiographic Osteoarthritis Worsening.

 1025 residents aged 50 years will be recruited using door-to-door enumeration in randomly selected rural communities in Wuchuan, China, and will be followed in 3 years.

 At baseline and follow-up visits, subjects will complete a home interview (including, but not limited to, socio-demographic factors, physical activity level using IPA-Q questionnaire,WOMAC questionnaire) and have a weight-bearing posteroanterior semiflexed view of radiographs at tibiofemoral (TF) joints.

 Radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA) worsening for a knee is defined if its Kellgren and Lawrence (K/L) grade increases by at least 1 grade except for the change from 0 to 1 during follow-up.

 The relationship between level of physical activity and ROA worsening will be assessed.
