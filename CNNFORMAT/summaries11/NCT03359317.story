(firstQuint)Jogging in the Change of Osteoporosis.

 Patients in this research are given an entry Bone Densitometry(DEXA)scan and are required to advance from 3-minute jogging a day to 10-minute level in daily practice for 1 year as instructed.

 After 1 year, subsequent DEXA scans are recorded.

 Interested participants are also encouraged to have hip and spine X-rays, and bone quality studies on study entry and two years later.

 Actual subject participation, intercurrent illnesses, fractures and changes in medication are self-monitored.

 Results are calculated by change in bone mineral density in the lumbar spine, hips and femurs by the DEXA scan in the study.

 Dose-response relationships between the amount of jogging and bone mineral density are sought.

 Jogging-related fractures and other adverse effects are also noted.
