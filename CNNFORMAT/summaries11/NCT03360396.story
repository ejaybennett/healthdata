(firstQuint)Study of PneumRx Endobronchial Coil System in Treatment of Subjects With Severe Emphysema.

 This will be a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled study comparing outcomes between the Endobronchial Coil and Control Groups.

 Subjects will be block randomized in a Treatment to Control ratio of 2:1.

 The randomization will be stratified by site and homogeneous versus heterogeneous emphysema, to support a balance of patients with differing heterogeneity in both the Treatment and Control Groups.
