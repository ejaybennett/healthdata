(thirdQuint)Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in the Treatment of Pouchitis.

 Pouchitis is the most common long term complication among patients with ulcerative colitis who have undergone restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA).

 The etiology of pouchitis remains unclear.

 There is significant clinical evidence implicating bacteria in the pathogenesis.

 It has been shown that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile -infection.

 Case reports have also shown promising results of FMT in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

 Currently there is no established effective treatment for chronic antibiotic dependent or refractory pouchitis.

 The aim of our study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of fecal transplantation in the treatment of chronic pouchitis instead of antibiotic therapy.

 Another aim is to evaluate phylogenetic analysis of the fecal microbiota trying to find microorganisms contributing to good results in fecal transplantation in IPAA patients.

 Patients receive FMTs on weeks 0 and 3.

 Antibiotic treatment has been stopped 36 hours before the first FMT.

 Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in the Treatment of Pouchitis@highlight

The aim of our study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of fecal transplantation in the treatment of antibiotic dependent chronic pouchitis.

 This is a double-blinded randomized placebo controlled study.

 13 patients receive a fecal transplantation from the healthy tested donor and 13 patients in the control group receive their own feces.
