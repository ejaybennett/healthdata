(thirdQuint)Family ICU Delirium Detection Study.

 Delirium is a major problem in critically ill patients, affecting almost half of this population.

 Delirium is associated with substantial persistent impaired cognition and psychiatric comorbidity, attributable mortality, and increased healthcare costs.

 Family members of critically ill patients are also at risk for developing adverse consequences including anxiety and depression.

 One strategy that may help both patients and families is to engage family members in the detection of delirium.

 The Facilitated Sensemaking model (of family member/patient engagement in critical care) is the theoretical framework underpinning the proposed work.

 Facilitated Sensemaking engages families by providing opportunities to participate in communication, decision-making, and bedside care, with the understanding that a sense of purpose derived from active participation in care can serve as a protective mechanism to reduce stress-related complications among families of critically ill patients, known as Post-Intensive Care Syndrome-Family.

 Family delirium detection may result in earlier and more accurate recognition of delirium and meaningful family involvement, and therein the potential for better patient and family outcomes.

 Family-administered tools to measure delirium exist, but they have not been explored in the intensive care unit (ICU) context; the ICU is unique in terms of the patient population served and the invasiveness of therapies employed.

 We propose to evaluate the validity and reliability of using family-administered tools to detect delirium in critically ill patients and to explore perceptions and experiences of family members' participation in the detection of delirium.

 Aim 1: To assess the validity and reliability of the FAM-CAM and Sour Seven to detect delirium in critically ill patients (Phase 1).

 Aim 2: To explore stakeholder (former ICU patients and family members, nurse, physician) perceptions and experiences of family-administered delirium detection in critically ill patients (Phase 2).

 Family ICU Delirium Detection Study@highlight

To evaluate the validity, reliability, and acceptability of employing family-administered delirium detection tools in the critically ill.

 The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the care of critically ill patients by creating valid, earlier, and patient and family-centered prevention, recognition, and management of delirium.
