(thirdQuint)The Effect of a Wearable Hip Assist Robot on Cardiopulmonary Metabolic Efficiency During Stair Ascent in Elderly Adults.

 Primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effect of a wearable hip assist robot on cardiopulmonary metabolic efficiency during stair ascent in elderly adults.

 Fifteen elderly adults participated in this study.

 The stair ascent trials were designed to climb stairs from the first basement level to the fourth floor of the Proton Therapy Center, Samsung Medical Center, Korea.

 The metabolic energy expenditure was measured using a portable cardiopulmonary metabolic system (Cosmed K4b, Rome, Italy) while participants performed randomly assigned two different conditions consecutively:, free ascent without the GEMS (NoGEMS) or robot-assisted ascent with the GEMS (GEMS).

 Participants rested for 10 minutes between the two trial conditions.

The aim of this study was to identify the assistance effect of the new wearable hip assist robot, gait enhancing mechatronic system (GEMS) developed by Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd.

, Korea) during stair ascent by comparing the energy expenditure of elderly adults with and without the GEMS.
