(fifthQuint)Acne Scarring in Skin of Color: Laser vs Microneedling.

 This is a randomized, prospective clinical trial of 30 healthy patients with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes III-V with atrophic acne scars on the face who desire treatment of their scars.

 Subjects with skin phototypes III - V are being studied because this population has been underrepresented in literature on treatment of acne scarring and also has been shown to have a higher incidence of adverse effects including post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from established treatments for acne scarring such as ablative laser resurfacing.

 Each treatment group of 15 subjects will be composed of 5 patients each with skin type III, IV, and V.

 Participants will have a total of 7 visits lasting between thirty minutes to one hour in duration.

 The first visit will be an assessment for inclusion in the study.

 Once consented participants will randomized to either the laser arm that will be treated with a 1,540nm fractional nonablative laser (Palomar StarLux) or the microneedling arm that will be treated with a microneedling device (Dermapen 3MD).

 The precise laser or microneedling settings will be tailored to each participant.

 After enrollment and prior to the first treatment session, participants in both groups will pretreat with adapalene 0.

1% gel, hydroquinone 2% cream, and sunscreen to the face daily for 4 weeks prior to first treatment.

 This is an acceptable pre-treatment protocol in the treatment of acne scarring.

 Participants will receive a series of 5 treatment sessions of either the laser or microneedling per randomization protocol at 4-6 week intervals.

 At each visit, participants will be asked about any adverse effects and also examined by either the PI or co-investigator.

 If any adverse effects are noted, subjects will have the option of either continuing or discontinuing their involvement in the study.

 Standardized high-resolution digital photographs of all patients will be taken at baseline (pre-treatment) and 3 months after the last treatment session.

 At that 3 months follow up participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire about their treatment experiences and satisfaction with the outcome and the Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire.

 If the study reveals that one treatment modality is far superior to the other treatment, participants randomized to the inferior treatment modality will be offered the superior treatment at no cost.

 Acne Scarring in Skin of Color: Laser vs Microneedling@highlight

Atrophic acne scars are a common and important sequelae of acne that affect up to 43-55% of patients with acne.

 Scarring impacts quality of life with reports of diminished self-esteem and frustration/sadness; additionally, some individuals report that their appearance even interferes with their professional lives.

 Though many treatments for acne scarring exist including ablative and nonablative lasers, subcision, and peels, none is without risk of adverse effects of pain, post-procedure redness or pigmentary changes.

 There have been no randomized studies directly comparing the effectiveness and safety profiles of microneedling (Dermapen) to 1,540nm nonablative fractional lasers (Palomar StarLux) in the treatment of atrophic acne scarring in skin of color.

 This clinical trial aims to determine which treatment modality -- microneedling or nonablative fractional laser -- is safer and more efficacious in the treatment of acne scarring in patients with skin of color.
