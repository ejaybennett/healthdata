(firstQuint)Remifentanil Versus Dexmedetomidine for Post-Cardiac Surgery Patients With Noninvasive Ventilation Intolerance.

 This study is a prospective, randomized, single-center, single-blinded study.

 Patients who receive noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in the investigators' cardiac surgical intensive care unit will be divided into two groups: remifentanil group and dexmedetomidine group.

 Remifentanil or dexmedetomidine will be given to the patients as needed according to the four-point NIV intolerance score: A score of 1 indicates a comfortable and relaxed patient tolerating NIV; a score of 2 indicates mild intolerance with some discomfort and occasional grabbing at the NIV mask; a score of 3 indicates moderate intolerance and discomfort with the NIV mask most of the time with frequent grabbing at the mask (sometimes pulling it off); and a score of 4 indicates severe NIV intolerance with agitation or/and an inability to leave the NIV mask in place.

 Participants who receive re-intubation will be recorded as 4 points.

 The investigators will compare the two groups with the NIV intolerance score at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the initiation of the sedation regime.

 The investigators will also compare the two groups with clinical outcomes such as reintubation rate, tracheotomy rate, mortality, ICU length of stay etc.

The aim of this study is to compare the sedation effects between remifentanil and dexmedetomidine in post-cardiac surgical patients who developed noninvasive ventilation (NIV) intolerance.
