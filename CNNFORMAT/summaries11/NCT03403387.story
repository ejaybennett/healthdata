(thirdQuint)Effects of GlutenShield, a Prebiotic, Probiotic, and Enzyme Supplement, on the Gut Microbiome of Adults With GI Symptoms.

 The purpose of this research is to identify if there is a relationship between GlutenShield, a combination prebiotic, probiotic, and enzyme supplement, and the gut environment.

 The study will be a split, 28-day randomized, partially blinded design.

 Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.

 One group will complete a 28-day treatment period with GlutenShield taken 3x/day with meals.

 The other group will complete a 28-day placebo period with the placebo taken 3x/day with meals.

 The placebo will contain Avicel (cellulose) and bentonite powder (to have a similar color as GlutenShield).

 Participants will be blinded to which group/ treatment they are being given.

 Serum and fecal samples will be collected at baseline and on day 29.

 Participants will also complete a gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaire, a food frequency questionnaire and a psychosocial measures of self questionnaire.
