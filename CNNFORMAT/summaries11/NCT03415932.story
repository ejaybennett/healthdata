(firstQuint)Health Group Intervention Among Refugees in Sweden.

 Migration is well known to be stressful and to have a negative impact on Health.

 Multidisciplinary health-promoting group interventions have significantly improved self-rated health.

 Further, symptom improvement was shown after implementation of physical activity in form of basic body awareness training.

 In this study a multimodal team consisted of a physiotherapist, nurse, psychologist, dietician, and physician held sessions of three hours weekly for a period of nine weeks.

 The sessions started with basic body awareness training, followed by theme discussions on symptoms and health strategies.

 A total of 54 participants completed the intervention.

 Health care consumption and movement quality were measured before and after the intervention.
