(thirdQuint)Effect of a New BI-specifiC Antibody Towards Dendritic Cells on Inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis.

 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common autoimmune disease in adult.

 It exists several drugs but none target dendritic cells even if it seems they play a major role in the physiopathology.

 One of the unit of research of Tours recently develop a new format of bispecific antibody which target dendritic cells.

 The first results in PBMC (unpublished yet) show an increase of the production of IL-10 In this study, we are going to first evaluate the cellular composition of synovial fluid from patients with RA and patients with gout (for the comparison, because the inflammatory mechanisms are different) Then, we will use this new antibody and evaluate the response by dosing Il-10, IL-6 and IFN.

 The aim is to verify in vitro if, with this new drug, it is possible to reverse the inflammation and induce a tolerance.

First, this study will evaluate, in vitro, the cellular composition of the synovial fluid from patient with rheumatoid arthritis or gout.

 Then samples will be test with a new format of bispecific antibody targeting dendritic cells.

 The production of IL-10 will be the principal criteria of judgment.

 Production of IL-6 and IFN will be checked as well.
