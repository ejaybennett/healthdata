(fifthQuint)Assessing Efficacy of Neuropsychiatric Assessment and Treatment Protocols in Huntington's Disease Patients.

 As presented to patient participant: In Phase A of this study, participants will be asked to answer questions about their psychiatric symptoms and quality of life in the presence of a member of study staff and a caregiver (see scales below).

 They will also undergo a psychiatric evaluation with a psychiatrist at Vanderbilt who works with HD patients.

 This psychiatric evaluation will take approximately 60 minutes and will occur up to 2 weeks before or after the first regular study visit.

 This involves a clinical interview during which a psychiatrist, who is an expert in psychiatric symptoms of HD, will ask about their experience with many different symptoms that can be experienced in HD.

 These two evaluations will occur in random order, and they will occur within 2 weeks of each other.

 Participants will continue to see their neurology provider for routine follow-up, and they will repeat surveys at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months.

 In Phase B of this study, participants will answer a series of questions assessing psychiatric symptoms and quality of life in the presence of a member of study staff and a caregiver.

 In addition, psychiatric symptoms will be treated according to a systematic protocol developed by HD experts that guides treatment decisions based on current clinical standard of care.

 Participants will return for follow-up at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months and repeat the aforementioned surveys at that time.

 Health-Related Quality of Life and Psychiatric Symptom Scales (This will take approximately 60-90 minutes): Participants will be asked to answer questions about psychiatric symptoms and quality of life in the presence of a member of study staff and a caregiver.

 - Two HD Quality of Life (HDQLIFE) scales, Concern with Death and Dying and Meaning and Purpose, will ask participants a total of 9 questions related to your thoughts about death and meaning in your life.

 - The Neuro-QoL scales include 5 subscales created specifically to measure quality of life in patients with neurological disease.

 These scales include 41 total questions which ask participants to report participation in social activities, anxiety, depression, sense of well-being, and satisfaction within the previous week.

 - The PROMIS Anger scale includes 8 questions that ask participants to rate symptoms of anger in the previous week.

 - The PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment short form includes 8 questions that ask about sleep quality and how participants feel during the day after sleeping.

 - The Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ-9) includes 9 questions about symptoms of depression.

 - The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) asks participants to rate the severity of 14 anxiety symptoms.

 - The Problem Behaviors Assessment short form (PBA-s) asks participants and their caregivers about the frequency and severity of 11 different psychiatric symptoms that can be experienced in HD.

 - The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale includes up to 6 items yes or no questions to assess presence and severity of suicidal thoughts.

 - The HD Anosognosia Rating Scale includes 8 questions that ask participants to assess how they perform daily tasks.

 - Sleep Questionnaire includes 5 questions about night and daytime sleep habits.

 Medical History and Examination (This will take approximately 30-60 minutes): - The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) is short test to measure memory and thinking skills.

 - The United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) tool is used by HD clinicians to measure the presence and severity of your motor symptoms like chorea and walking difficulty.

 - The UHDRS Total Functional Capacity (TFC) scale is used by HD clinicians to rate participant ability to carry out daily tasks such as household chores or managing finances.

 - Investigators will also gather background information such as: date of birth, address, insurance status, and income.

 Participants will also be asked about health and medical history such as: date of diagnosis and current medications.

 - The Modified Morisky Scale includes 6 yes or no questions about how participants take medications.

 As presented to caregiver participant: Caregiver participants will be asked to accompany the HD patient to a total of 4 clinic visits where study staff will administer a series of surveys.

 Surveys requiring caregiver participation are as follows: - The Factor analysis of the frontal systems behavior scale (FrSBe) family-version is a 46-item scale that asks caregivers to rate characteristics of frontal lobe dysfunction in the HD patient currently and prior to disease onset.

 - The Traumatic Brain Injury- Care Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) Caregiver Strain short form includes 6 items which ask caregivers to rate their feelings of stress and strain related to being a caregiver.

 - The Problem Behaviors Assessment short form (PBA-s) asks patients and caregivers about the frequency and severity of 11 different psychiatric symptoms that can be experienced in HD.

 Caregivers may also offer input on the patient's medical history and other symptom surveys as they would in a normal clinic visit.

 Assessing Efficacy of Neuropsychiatric Assessment and Treatment Protocols in Huntington's Disease Patients@highlight

Phase A: Recruit 50 patients with HD, and their caregivers, to complete a neuropsychiatric and quality of life battery of scales at baseline.

 Have these 50 patients complete a formal psychiatric assessment with a psychiatrist within 2 weeks of this clinical battery, and the results of these 2 types of assessments will be compared to establish the level of agreement between clinical rating scales and formal psychiatric assessment.

 Phase B: Continue to follow Phase A cohort longitudinally and administer neuropsychiatric and quality of life battery at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months form baseline.

 Recruit an additional 50 patients, administer the same neuropsychiatric and quality of life battery at baseline, implement medication and counseling intervention according to a standard of care protocol, and follow up with the same neuropsychiatric and quality of life battery at 6, 12, and 18 months.
