(thirdQuint)Brief Internet Intervention for Hazardous Alcohol Use to People Seeking Online Help for Depression.

 A double-blinded, parallel group randomized controlled trial will be used.

 Participants with current depression who also drink in a hazardous fashion (N=986) will be recruited for a study to 'help improve an online intervention for depression.

' Participants will be assigned, by chance, to receive MoodGYM or to receive MoodGYM plus a brief Internet intervention for hazardous alcohol consumption - Check Your Drinking (CYD).

 Participants will be contacted 3- and 6-months after receiving the interventions to assess changes in drinking and depression status.

 It is predicted that participants receiving the CYD intervention in addition to MoodGYM will reduce their alcohol consumption to a greater extent than those who just received MoodGYM.

 Further predictions include the impact of receiving Check Your Drinking on improvements in depressive symptoms.

Hazardous alcohol consumption is common among people suffering from depression.

 There are effective Internet interventions that target hazardous alcohol consumption or depression separately but none that combine these online interventions without the involvement of a therapist.

 This study aims to evaluate the effects of combining an Internet intervention targeting hazardous alcohol consumption with one for depression on drinking and depressive symptoms.
