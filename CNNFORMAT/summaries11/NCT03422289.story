(fifthQuint)Improved Effects of MI Plus Alpha-LA in PCOS.

 Polycystic ovary syndrome is a complex chronic condition inducing several related disorders, such as subfertility and pregnancy complications.

 So far myo-inositol, successfully used in PCOS, has not been always effective in all patients.

 Aiming at overcoming this drawback, we tested a new formulation with myo-inositol and -lactalbumin, in consideration of the effects exerted by -lactalbumin in favoring molecule passage among body compartments, and also in consideration of its anti-inflammatory activity.

 Only PCOS patients, according to Rotterdam ESHRE-ASRM criteria, with anovulation and infertility > 1 year, were included in the study.

 Following a treatment with 2 g myo-inositol and 0.

2 mg folic acid, a part of them are resistant and do not ovulate.

 These non-responders to myo-inositol alone undergo the second phase of the study, receiving 2g myo-inositol and 0.

2 mg folic acid plus 50 mg -lactalbumin for three months.

 After this combined treatment, the majority of them ovulate, showing a hormone and lipid profile improvement.

 In addition, myo-inositol plasma levels at the end of the treatment are significantly higher than at baseline and comparable to those patients who respond positively to myo-inositol alone.

PCOS patients are initially treated with 2 g myo-inositol and 0.

2 mg folic acid, two times per day by oral route, for three months.

 Among them, the subjects who have not ovulated despite this treatment are administered with 2g myo-inositol and 0.

2 mg folic acid plus 50 mg -lactalbumin for three months.

 Most of them improve and achieve ovulation.

 Therefore, the combination of -lactalbumin with myo-inositol allows to get a significant result in the treatment of PCOS patients.
