(firstQuint)Comparing Surgical and Economical Parameters of Total Knee Replacement.

.

 Randomized 1: ratio study comparing Medacta MyKnee surgical technique using Efficiency single use instruments versus Stryker Navigation surgical techniques performed with conventional instruments.

 MyKnee surgical technique patients will receive a CT scan of the surgical knee which enables custom manufacturing of the MyKnee cutting blocks.

 Stryker Navigational surgical technique patients will not require a CT scan.

 Both groups of patients will undergo total knee arthroplasty.
