(secondQuint)A Nutritarian Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Lifestyle Changes in Chronic Disease Prevention, Especially Cancer.

 The Nutritional Research Foundation, in conjunction with Northern Arizona University, is conducting a long-term health study for women ages 18 and older.

 This study will address the effects of a nutrient dense, plant-rich diet on the long-term risks of cancer and other chronic diseases.

 Participants enroll in a 30-day training module which outlines the benefits of a nutrient-dense, plant-rich diet.

 At the conclusion of those videos and written modules, they take a short quiz to assess their knowledge and they can enroll in the full study.

 All participation is online with ongoing modules on nutrition and lifestyle.

 There is a comprehensive health history and lifestyle index to be completed.

 Nutrition questionnaires will be administered an average of every 3-6 months; PHQ-9 & PSQI questionnaires an average of every 12 months; serum cardiometabolic measures and liquid biopsies an average of every 18 months.
