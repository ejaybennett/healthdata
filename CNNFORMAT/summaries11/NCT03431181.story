(firstQuint)Impact of Permissive Hypotension on End-organ Damage in the Elderly.

 Background When it is severe, hypotension compromises tissue perfusion and organ function, leading to multiple organ failure and death.

 Commonly in intensive care units (ICUs), excessive vasodilation causes hypotension.

 In response, clinicians administer vasopressors to induce vasoconstriction and thereby raise blood pressure.

 However, these medications may reduce blood flow to vital organs, including the heart, and therefore damage them.

 Titrating vasopressors therefore requires balancing the risks of organ dysfunction arising from vasopressors or hypotension.

 Current guidelines recommend titrating vasopressors to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) 65 mmHg.

 By not specifying an upper limit, guidelines and clinicians put more emphasis on preventing hypotension than on minimizing vasopressor exposure.

 Permissive hypotension, defined as a MAP target below traditional levels, may reduce vasopressor-induced harm while avoiding organ dysfunction induced by severe hypotension.

 Work by the investigators group Observational data from the investigators group show that the average MAP in Canadian patients on vasopressors is 75 mmHg, 10 mmHg above current guideline recommendations and self-reported practices.

The recent CIHR-funded OVATION pilot RCT (n=118) of permissive hypotension met feasibility objectives of demonstrating a separation in mean MAP between arms (9 mmHg, p12 hours on the co-primary outcomes of myocardial injury (high sensitivity cardiac troponin [cTn], a validated marker of myocardial injury and powerful prognostic factor in ICU patients) and 90-day mortality.

 Secondary outcomes will include other end-organ biomarkers.

 Investigators hypothesize that permissive hypotension will reduce organ injury and death.

 Methods Eligible patients will be randomized to target MAP 60-65 mmHg vs.

 usual care.

 Investigators selected usual care to avoid protocol misalignment with standard practices and after ascertaining contemporary vasopressor use in Canada, which suggests that the risk of contamination is low.

 Investigators will enroll 200 patients in 5 Canadian ICUs.

 The deferred consent model will be adopted, successfully used in the pilot trial.

 Risk of bias will be minimized by allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, complete hospital follow-up and intention-to-treat analysis.

 Relevance This RCT proposal is embedded in the international OVATION65 program of research, which includes the ongoing NIHR-funded UK65 Trial, designed by the investigators group, which measures 90-day mortality as the primary outcome.

 The pooled analysis of both RCTs will be powered to detect a plausible difference of 6% in mortality.

 The proposed Canadian OVATION65 RCT will be the only trial that measures organ injury biomarkers, providing crucial clinical information regardless of the effect on mortality.

 Results will be incorporated into guidelines to inform practice worldwide.

We have designed OVATION-65 to evaluate the effects of permissive low blood pressure compared to usual care on markers of organ injury and survival in older patients.
