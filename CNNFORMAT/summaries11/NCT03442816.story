(fifthQuint)Retinal Metabolic Imaging in a Diverse Population.

 Hyperspectral retinal imaging results from several consecutive images taken while the filter scans a wide spectral range to obtain one spectrum for each image pixel.

 The combination of imaging and spectroscopy offered by hyperspectral imaging makes it possible to identify and quantify several specific biomolecules in the retina and the optic nerve, thus paving the way for metabolic imaging of the fundus.

 Subsequent analysis of the light signal with algorithms and image analysis software tools permits extracting molecular information modulated according to the underlying pathology.

 This technique thus permits direct, non-invasive and inexpensive diagnosis of pathologies of the retina and systemic pathologies presenting manifestations in the eye.

 In this research project, Optina Diagnostics aims to evaluate in a clinical context a novel Metabolic Hyperspectral Retinal Camera (MHRC) based on a mydriatic camera customized for observation of the fundus in combination with a tunable filter, i.

 Retinal Metabolic Imaging in a Diverse Population@highlight

This research project aims to evaluate use in a clinical context of a novel imaging instrument, the Metabolic Hyperspectral retina Camera (MHRC) from Optina Diagnostics.

 This camera enables the acquisition of retinal images at multiple colors (up to 100 specific colors) and therefore extract way more information that can be captured with a conventional retinal camera (up to 3 colors).

 This additional color information available for each pixel of the image could be useful to identify signs of pathologies having manifestations in the retina.

 The performances of this new prototype camera will be evaluated and the acquisition procedures optimized in a diverse population of subjects.
