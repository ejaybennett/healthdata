(firstQuint)Technology-Based Intervention to Promote Heart Health After Cardiac Rehab (Mobile4Heart).

 Ongoing maintenance of physical activity after cardiac rehab is an important part of preventing secondary cardiac events in patients with ischemic heart disease.

 Our central hypothesis is that monitoring and promotion of health-related behaviors by increasing patient-provider communication through a mobile device after discharge from cardiac rehab increased adherence to a heart healthy prescription over time.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to use a mobile app or serve as the control group.

 All participants will have an activity tracker to track their activity for two months.
