 Study dietitians will place patients on a strict and controlled diet that manages daily macronutrient breakdown and increases the ratio of dietary fat relative to protein and carbohydrate consumption.

 Dietitians will provide guidance and teaching of the diet, as well as, monitoring and diet adjustment to ensure metabolic ketosis.

 Dietitians and study physicians (and their staff) will monitor subjects for safety, nutrition, quality of life, and standard of care tumor assessments over the course of the study.
