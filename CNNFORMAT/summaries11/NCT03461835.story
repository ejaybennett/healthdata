(fifthQuint)Management of Pregnancies of Unknown Location (PUL).

 Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) is a term used to describe a situation where there is no evidence of a gestation either intra-or extrauterine on transvaginal sonography (TVS) in women seeking medical attention for various reasons in early pregnancy.

 The principal tool in PUL management besides TVS is the interpretation of the change in serial serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels.

 A recent meta-analysis concluded that there is not enough evidence to recommend a specific strategy using hCG when managing PULs.

 In a NICE (National Institute of health and care excellence) guideline however women with a PUL acceptable for outpatient surveillance, where the rate of change in rising hCG levels surpassing 63 % in 48 hours (h) highly likely represents an IUP and the patient is triaged to a TVS after one week.

 Those with a decline in hCG levels of more than 50 % are predicted to be failed PULs and a urinary pregnancy test (UPT) after two weeks is appropriate.

 If the rate of change in hCG levels fail to meet these cut-offs a re-visit within 24 h is warranted in order to possibly diagnose an EP and suitable treatment selected.

 In a previous study; an hCG based logistic regression model, M4 classified 70 % of all PULs as low risk of being an EP, hence qualifying for a reduced follow-up while correctly identifying 88 % of EPs.

 A study from Sahlgrenska University hospital (SU) evaluated the M4 model with similar results, where also the cut-offs by NICE similarly identified 86 % of EPs but to a lesser extent correctly classified low risk PULs.

 Another finding in the study was that EPs identified by M4 mainly depicted rising hCG levels opposed to the NICE model identifying mainly EPs with declining hCG levels which could have clinical consequences since EPs with rising hCG levels more often seem to necessitate laparoscopic surgery and maybe a postponed diagnosis could be deleterious in these cases.

 Hence, the M4 model potentially would be better than the NICE cut-offs for PUL management.

 None of these findings however have been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).

 Management of Pregnancies of Unknown Location (PUL)@highlight

In a randomized multicenter trial we want to compare the ability of two hCG-based models in correctly classifying EPs as high risk among PULs and correctly classifying IUPs and failed PULs as low risk after two hCG measurements.

 After the classification of PULs into high or low risk of EP, the clinical management will be the same within each risk group (high and low) regardless of randomization group (which model classified the patients).

 The clinical management will be according to the management protocol published in a NICE guideline.
