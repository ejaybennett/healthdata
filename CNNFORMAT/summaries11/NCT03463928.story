(fifthQuint)A Feasibility and Safety Study of Concomitant Therapy With Allo-CAR-T Cells and Allo-HSCT in Patients With Relapse or Refractory Leukemia.

 1.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: 1.

 To evaluate the feasibility and safety of donor-derived HSCT following donor-derived CD19/22 bispecific CAR-T cells or CD19-directed CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia.

 2.

 To evaluate the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred CAR-T cells, and the phenotype of persisting T cells.

 Real Time polymerase chain receptor (RT-PCR) and Flow cytometry(FCM) analysis of PB,BM will be used to detect and quantify survival of infused allo-CAR-T cells over time.

 3.

 To evaluate the donor chimerism after co-infusion of donor-derived CD19/22 bispecific CAR-T cells or CD19-directed CAR-T cells and donor-derived-HSCT 2.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: 1.

 For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to co-infusion of donor-derived CD19/22 bispecific CAR-T cells or CD19-directed CAR-T cells and donor-derived-HSCT.

 The allo-CAR-T cells will be infused in a fractionated manner, 1/3 on day 0, 2/3 on day 1.

The allo-HSCT will be infused on day 2.

 A Feasibility and Safety Study of Concomitant Therapy With Allo-CAR-T Cells and Allo-HSCT in Patients With Relapse or Refractory Leukemia@highlight

Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (Allo-HSCT) is routinely used for treatment of aggressive hematological malignancies.

 The biological foundation of allo-HSCT is the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, which is primarily mediated by donor T cells present in the graft and is able to eradicate malignant B cells either CD19+ or CD19-.

 Relapse following an allo-HSCT remains a major challenge in the treatment of B-ALL.

 CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy has shown promising results for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies; however, a subset of patients relapse due to the loss of CD19 in tumor cells.

 Co-infusion of donor-derived CD19/22 bispecific CAR-T cells or CD19-directed CAR-T cells and donor-derived-HSCT has the potential to combine the CAR-T cell mediated targeted elimination of CD19 expressing B cells with GVL effect, which could have clear advantages in reducing the risk of relapse and the evolution of CD19- escape variants or clonally related malignancies in other lineages.

 Therefore, a complete and durable tumor responses induced by this immunotherapy could be expected.
