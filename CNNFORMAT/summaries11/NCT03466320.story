(thirdQuint)DEPLETHINK - LymphoDEPLEtion and THerapeutic Immunotherapy With NKR-2.

 This open-label Phase I study aims at assessing primarily the safety of the NKR-2 treatment administered after a non-myeloablative preconditioning regimen in r/r AML/MDS patients.

 This Phase I study will contain two different sequential segments.

 The first segment will determine the recommended investigational treatment option (schedule of preconditioning and NKR-2 dose) and the second segment will expand to a larger number of r/r AML/MDS patients.

 The first segment will evaluate the preconditioning regimen consisting in cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m and fludarabine 30 mg/m daily (CYFLU) administrated 3 consecutive days daily at a specific interval prior to the NKR-2 administration.

 This segment is divided into three sequential cohorts to evaluate respectively: - Two different intervals between the preconditioning regimen and the NKR-2 administration i.

e.

 NKR-2 administered 3 days (T3) or 7 days (T7) after the end of the preconditioning regimen, - Two different NKR-2 dose-levels i.

e.

 dose-level 1 (1x108 NKR-2/injection) and dose-level 2 (3x108 NKR-2/injection).

 The second segment (extension segment) will enroll more r/r AML/MDS patients (to reach 9 evaluable patients in total) to further evaluate the recommended NKR-2 dose (1x108 or 3x108 NKR-2/injection) administered at the recommended interval (T3 or T7) after the CYFLU preconditioning.

 Each patient will receive a single administration of NKR-2 following the preconditioning regimen.

 Depending on the clinical response as evaluated at the first tumor assessment, scheduled five weeks after NKR-2 administration, three situations may arise: - If the patient is presenting a complete remission, then three new injections of NKR-2 at the recommended dose defined in the ongoing THINK study (THINK RecD), without prior preconditioning, will be administered with a two weeks interval, - If the patient is presenting a stable disease or a partial remission, a new injection of NKR-2, with a prior preconditioning (with the same interval and regimen than for the first injection) will be administered to the patient, - If the patient is in PD, he/she will not receive any other NKR-2 injection but will follow other visits as scheduled.

 At the second tumor assessment scheduled 12 weeks after first injection, and for patients who received a second injection of NKR-2 with a prior preconditioning, two situations may arise: - If the patient is in CR, SD or PR, then three new injections of NKR-2 at the THINK RecD, without prior preconditioning, will be administered with a two weeks interval, - If the patient is in PD, he/she will not receive any other NKR-2 injection but will follow other visits as scheduled.

 For each patient who received at least one NKR-2 administration, the overall study duration will be 15 years after first NKR-2 administration.

 The duration of the administration phase and treatment follow-up will be 24 months.

 Patients will be asked to complete a total of maximum 23 visits during the treatment administration phase, and maximum 6 visits during the treatment follow-up phase.

 During the long-term safety follow-up, yearly visits will be scheduled (up to Y15).

 Rationale for the study: NKR-2 has the potential to treat many distinct tumor-types because of a broad expression and important prevalence of the NKG2D ligands expression in various tumor types including in r/r AML/MDS.

 This Phase I study will explore the hypothesis that the administration of modified T-cells targeting NKG2D-ligands expressed by AML/MDS cells, after a prior nonmyeloablative preconditioning treatment, in patients refractory to and/or relapsing after prior therapies, is safe and, considering the poor outcomes and lack of therapeutic strategies for this patient population, may have a strategic advantage over current approaches and provide potential clinical benefit.

 Objectives of the study: Primary To document and characterize: cent The safety of the NKR-2 treatment administration in r/r AML/MDS patients after a non-myeloablative preconditioning.

 Secondary To document and characterize: - The NKR-2 peripheral blood kinetics post-administration, - Indicators of clinical activity, - Additional indicators of safety.
