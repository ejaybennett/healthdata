(fifthQuint)Reducing Emergency Diabetes Care for Older African Americans.

 This Phase-III RCT will compare the efficacy of COPDE (COmmunity Care to Prevent Diabetes Emergencies) vs.

 intensive home-based DM education to reduce the number of DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations over 12 months (primary outcome), in 230 AAs with DM, 50 years and older, who are recruited from the ED after an ED visit.

 COPDE is a culturally relevant intervention that extends from the ED to the community, and aims to improve access to care and DM self-care (secondary outcomes).

 A mediation analysis will determine whether changes in access to care and/or DM self-care explain COPDE's efficacy.

 A moderation analysis will determine whether participants who reside in low- vs.

 high-need communities [defined by Community Need Index scores (i.

e.

, an indicator of the built environment)] respond differently to treatment.

 COPDE will begin soon after the participant's index ED visit, when many patients remain uncertain how to manage DM or how to access follow-up care.

 Community Health Workers (CHWs), who are race-concordant with participants, will: 1) deliver in-home DM education to increase participants' knowledge and skills; 2) use DM-specific Behavioral Activation to improve DM self-care; and 3) facilitate telehealth visits with the participant's primary care physician (PCP) and a DM nurse educator to increase access to care.

 The control treatment, EUC, is intensive home-based DM education.

 EUC matches COPDE in treatment intensity (i.

e.

, 6 in-home sessions over 4 months, and 3 booster sessions over the next 8 months) and delivery of culturally relevant DM education, but does not include DM-specific Behavioral Activation or telehealth visits.

 The treatment comparison will identify COPDE's specific efficacy over and above EUC.

 This RCT is significant as the population ages and becomes more racially diverse, and as ED use and costs increase.

 This RCT is innovative because it: 1) tests the first ED-to-community intervention designed to reduce the need for ED care in AAs with DM; 2) assesses both subjective and objective indicators of access to care; and 3) defines the specific characteristics of COPDE that confer its cultural relevance.

 If successful, COPDE will meet Healthy People 2020's twin goals of reducing the personal and societal costs of DM and achieving health equity for all Americans.

 The Specific Aims of this RCT are: Primary Specific Aim: Test the efficacy of COPDE to reduce the number of incident DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations over 12 months (primary outcome) in AAs with DM.

 Hypothesis: COPDE will halve the number of incident DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations relative to EUC over 12 months.

 The Secondary Aims are to: 1.

 Test the efficacy of COPDE to increase perceived access to care over 12 months (secondary outcome).

 Hypothesis: COPDE will increase Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire-18 scores to a greater extent than EUC over 12 months.

 2.

 Test the efficacy of COPDE to increase realized access to care over 12 months (secondary outcome).

 Hypothesis: COPDE will increase the number of received Diabetes Quality Metrics (e.

g.

, hemoglobin A1c testing, urine screening) to a greater extent than EUC over 12 months.

 3.

 Test the efficacy of COPDE to improve DM self-care over 12 months (secondary outcome).

 Hypothesis: COPDE will increase Diabetes Self-Care Inventory scores to a greater extent than EUC over 12 months.

 4.

 Determine if increasing subjective and/or objective indicators of access to care and/or DM self-care mediates COPDE's reduction of DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations.

 Hypothesis: COPDE will reduce DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations to the extent that it increases subjective and/or objective indicators of access to care and/or improves DM self-care.

 The Exploratory Aims are to: 1) determine whether COPDE reduces "all cause" ED visits/hospitalizations relative to EUC.

; 2) determine whether Community Need Index scores, literacy, age, and/or sex moderate treatment effects; 3) determine if COPDE improves glycemic control (i.

e.

, lowers hemoglobin A1c levels), impacts DM-related health beliefs, reduces depression, and/or improves quality-of-life; 4) identify COPDE's treatment features that confer its cultural relevance; and 5) estimate COPDE's costs and net financial benefit to the healthcare system.

 Reducing Emergency Diabetes Care for Older African Americans@highlight

This RCT will compare the efficacy of COPDE (COmmunity Care to Prevent Diabetes Emergencies) vs.

 intensive home-based diabetes (DM) education [i.

e.

, Enhanced Usual Care (EUC)] to reduce DM-related emergency department (ED) visits and/or hospitalizations over 12 months (primary outcome) in 230 blacks with diabetes, 50 years and older, after an ED visit.

 A moderation analysis will determine whether participants who reside in low- vs.

 high-need communities [defined by Community Need Index scores (i.

e.

, an indicator of the built environment)] respond differently to treatment.

 COPDE is a collaborative intervention of Primary Care Physicians, (PCPs), a DM nurse educator, and Community Health Workers (CHWs) that extends from the ED into the community.

 The CHWs will: 1) deliver in-home DM education to increase participants' knowledge and skills to manage DM; 2) use DM-specific Behavioral Activation to reinforce DM self-care; and 3) facilitate telehealth visits with PCPs and a DM nurse educator to increase access to care.

 The control treatment, EUC, is home-based intensive DM education.

 EUC matches COPDE in treatment intensity (i.

e.

, number and duration of in-home visits) and delivery of DM self-care education, but does not include COPDE's other active elements (i.

e.

, Behavioral Activation and telehealth).

 The treatment comparison will identify COPDE's specific efficacy over and above EUC.

 We hypothesize that COPDE will halve the rate of incident DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations relative to EUC.

 The three secondary outcomes are: 1) subjective perceptions of access to care; 2) receipt of DM Quality Metrics (i.

e.

, objective indicators of realized access to care); and 3) DM self-care.
