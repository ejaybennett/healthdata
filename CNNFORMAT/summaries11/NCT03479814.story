(secondQuint)Adaptive Individualized High-Dose Radiotherapy Analysis-REctum-1 (AIDA-RE-1).

 AIDA-RE-1 is an interventional prospective trial for the treatment of locally advanced high-risk rectal cancer.

 In neoadjuvant setting, patients are treated with standard chemotherapy plus experimental radiotherapy.

 The total dose to clinical target volume (CTV, rectum and locoregional lymph nodes) is 45 Gy, with a concomitant boost of 5 Gy to gross tumor volume (GTV), delivered with IMRT-SIB (intensity modulated radiotherapy-simultaneous integrated boost) technique in 25 fractions.

 After 2 weeks of treatment, patients are evaluated with 18 FDG-PET and sequential boost of 5 Gy (in 2 fractions) is planned.
