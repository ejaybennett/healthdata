(fifthQuint)Tug Endotracheal Tube to Assess Tube Location.

 Introduction Correct endotracheal tube (ETT) placement is important.

 Ideal ETT position is achieved when the distal tip is in mid-trachea with the head in neutral alignment.

 Unrecognized tube misplacement is an uncommon but significant cause of hypoxemia and death during general anesthesia and emergency intubation of critically ill patients.

 It is commoner in out-of-hospital intubations, where it is reported to occur in 1 to 15% of cases, often with disastrous results.

 Three types of malpositioning can occur: one outside the trachea (esophageal), and two within the trachea: too shallow (hypopharyngeal), or too deep (endobronchial).

 Esophageal intubation results in rapid hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and inflation of the stomach as the patient receives no ventilation at all.

 Too-shallow placement of the ETT can result in inadvertent extubation, especially with manipulation of head and neck.

 Endobronchial intubation occurs when the ETT is advanced into a mainstem bronchus, which results in hypoxia and the potential for barotrauma in the hyperventilated lung.

 Confirmation of correct ETT depth is currently performed by several methods.

 In the operating room, simple measurement of the length of the tube at the corner of the mouth is rapid but not reliable.

 One study improved on this by using additional anatomical landmarks to determine ETT tube length as measured at the mouth.

 It enabled a reduction in the incidence of too-deep placement of the ETT from 58.

8% to 24%.

 Cuff ballottement at the level of the suprasternal notch is a technique that has been studied with cuffed tubes in adults.

 Ballottement as described in these papers involves moving the fingers in a direction normal to the long axis of the ETT in order to alternately compress and release the finger pressure on the cuff, while feeling and watching the corresponding movement of the pilot balloon.

 Ease of palpation of ballottement was inconsistent, and in one study 15 of 82 patients had ETT tips <2.

5 cm above the carina.

 Studies to date of ballottement do not comment on its ability to prevent esophageal intubation.

 Ultrasound guided intubation has been shown to provide correct placement, but requires training and machine availability.

 The investigators propose to refine methods of palpating the trachea that the investigators studied in previous experiments.

 The investigators found that palpation of the anterior trachea with the fingertips during intubation enabled us to feel the tip of the endotracheal tube sliding into the trachea and improve correct depth compared to measurement at the teeth.

 15 That study was undertaken to determine whether palpation of the trachea could enable correct position of the endotracheal tube with respect to depth.

 Esophageal intubation was studied subsequently, but the study was stopped when it became clear that the investigators could not determine esophageal intubation by anterior tracheal palpation (unpublished).

 However, during two instances of inadvertent esophageal intubation, the investigators accidentally discovered a technique that may be able to detect inadvertent esophageal intubation as well as ensure correct endotracheal tube depth.

 Following tracheal intubation, with the cuff inflated to 50cm water pressure in the trachea, there will be a sudden marked increase in the force necessary to gently tug the endotracheal tube proximally as the inflated cuff impinges on the rigid, encircling cricoid cartilage.

 When the increased force is sensed, then pushing the ETT down 2cm will ensure it is correctly positioned.

 If the cuff is in the esophagus, it will slide out without the sudden increased force being felt.

 A simple set of manoeuvres (Tug EndoTracheal Tube: TETT) take about ten seconds: 1.

 Intubate the trachea in the usual fashion by clinically indicated techniques.

 2.

 Gently push the endotracheal tube down a further 2cm (to avoid inflation with the cuff within the larynx).

 3.

 Using a cuff manometer, inflate the cuff to desired water pressure.

 4.

 Gently tug the endotracheal tube upward until there is a sudden increase in the force required to tug it further.

 5.

 Deflate the cuff to the safe pressure of 20 to 30 cm water pressure, push the ETT downward 2 cm (to ensure the cuff is below the larynx), and fix it in place.

 The investigators plan a clinical pilot study of intubation of esophagus versus trachea with initial intubation of the esophagus flowed by intubation of the trachea.

 Hypotheses.

 The specific maneuvers described above (TETT) will enable detection of esophageal intubation; there will be an optimal cuff-inflation pressure to distinguish trachea from esophagus; and the technique will assure placement of the tip of the ETT within the trachea at correct depth (more than 2.

5cm above the carina and more than 5cm below the vocal cords).

 Primary outcome.

 To assess the reliability and accuracy of TETT as a method to determine tracheal versus esophageal intubation.

 Secondary outcomes.

 To find the optimal cuff-inflation pressure to distinguish trachea from esophagus and to assess the reliability and accuracy of TETT as a method to determine depth of endotracheal tube in the trachea.

 Experimental design.

 A clinical trial with an objective measure of the difference in force of tugging between esophagus and trachea.

 Interventions: Intubation will be by the attending anesthesiologist, who will choose the intubating anesthetic and equipment on clinical grounds.

 The anesthesiologist will intubate the esophagus first, and the investigator will and inflate the ETT cuff to various pressures in 10cm H2O pressure steps form participant to to determine the lowest inflation pressure that clearly differentiates esophagus from trachea.

 An apparatus including a force transducer (LoadStar F-152217557 S-beam sensor run on LoadVue software; Loadstar Sensors Ltd.

, Fremont CA, USA) will be attached to the ETT connector and the testers will perform the gentle tugging while recording the force of pull until the ETT comes out of the esophagus.

 The process will be repeated with the trachea.

 At this point the anesthesiologist will intubate the trachea and the tester will carry out the manoeuvre for depth of insertion, after which depth of insertion will be measured by fibre-optic bronchoscopy.

 Only one set of intubations will be tested on any participant.

 For depth of insertion, the ETT will be moved carefully to the midline of the mouth without changing its tracheal depth, and the ETT depth marking at the upper incisors or gums noted.

 The ETT will be taped in place, and held in place at that exact depth during bronchoscopy.

 Bronchoscopy will be carried out through the ETT via a bronchoscopic elbow connector, thus allowing for no break in ventilation.

 Measurements: Data will be recorded on paper data sheets for later transcription to a computer spread sheet for analysis.

 Usual demographics (age, gender, height, weight, type of surgery) will be recorded.

 Whether the investigator thinks the ETT is esophageal, tracheal, or can't determine will be recorded.

 Force transducer data will be digitally recorded on a computer for later analysis.

 Depth of the ETT in the trachea will be determined as follows.

 The bronchoscope will be advanced to the carina, and the depth at the elbow connector marked with a spring clip.

 It will then be withdrawn to the ETT tip, and a second clip placed.

 The bronchoscope will be withdrawn further with its light turned off until a focused fibreoptic light shone through the cricothyroid membrane is seen, when a third clip is placed on the bronchoscope.

 Bottom-to-bottom measurement of the distance between the clips will enable accurate measurement of the distance from the carina to the ETT tip, and measurement of second to third clip will give the distance from EET tip to cricothyroid membrane, while adding the estimated distance from cricothyroid membrane to cords will give distance from ETT tip to vocal cords.

 Tug Endotracheal Tube to Assess Tube Location@highlight

A study of a new approach to determining if, following endotracheal intubation, the endotracheal tube (ETT) is in the trachea or the esophagus, and if in the trachea, it is at the correct depth.

 The test for correct placement consists of inflating the cuff to a pressure (to be determined by the study) and tugging the ETT gently up and out of the mouth.

 The investigators hypothesize that if it is in the esophagus, it will slide easily all the way out; if in the trachea, the cuff will be impeded by catching on the lower surface of the cricoid ring, and that this can be felt by the person tugging.
