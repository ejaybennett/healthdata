(secondQuint)Neuro RX Gamma - Pivotal Phase.

 A potential participant will undergo pre-screening and screening assessments to assess eligibility for the study.

 Eligible participants will undergo a baseline visit in which they will be randomized to either active or sham Neuro RX Gamma device.

 The Vielight Neuro RX Gamma is a non-invasive device that administers low-energy near-infrared LED light to the brain transcranially and intranasally.

 There are two treatment phases in the trial, each with a duration of 12 weeks.

 The patient along with the caregiver will perform home (or living facility) - based treatments with the device and document the sessions in a patient diary.

 The device will be applied to the patient participant by a dedicated caregiver for a 20 minute daily session, 6 days a week for a total of 12 weeks.

 The study participant and caregiver will be required to return to the clinic for follow-up assessments at 12 and 24 weeks post randomization, between treatment phases.

 228 patients will be enrolled across 8 sites in Canada and the United States.

 Neuro RX Gamma - Pivotal Phase@highlight

The active Neuro RX Gamma device uses non-invasive near-infrared energy delivered to the brain with the intention to improve cognitive functioning and quality of life in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's Disease.

 Treatment will occur at home-based treatment sessions with the device.
