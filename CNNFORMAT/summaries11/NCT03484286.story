(thirdQuint)Selfcare Management Intervention in Heart Failure.

 Patients will be recruited using continuous sampling, and will be approached either in connection with being discharged after a heart failure (HF) related event or upon visiting an out-patient HF clinic if the patient has been admitted for HF at least once the last year.

 After written consent has been given, demographical data will be noted, and the patient will complete two forms: 1 - the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour scale 9-item questionnaire (EHFScB-9) and 2 - the quality of life assessment tool "EuroQol five dimension scale" (EQ5D).

 Expected time for this is 20 minutes.

 The baseline demographical data will include age, gender, ejection-fraction, New York Heart Association (NYHA)-class, blood pressure, heart rate, HF aetiology, and other routine tests for HF visits as outlined in the European guidelines for HF treatment.

 After the patient has filled out the two forms, the patient will be randomized to the control group (CG) meaning standard care, or the intervention group (IG).

 Patients allocated to the IG will be equipped with the home based self-care enhancement tool OPTILOGG.

 OPTILOGG assists the patient with symptom monitoring and flexible diuretics regimen, as well as education about living with HF.

 It consists of a specialized tablet computer wirelessly connected to a weight scale.

 OPTILOGG is CE-marked.

 The intervention will be deployed for eight months.

 After the eight months, the patients will be called to a follow-up visit.

 During the visit all data that was collected at baseline/recruitment will be collected again.

 All cardiovascular events for each patient will be retrieved, for the eight months during which the intervention was deployed, but also for the following 12 months.

 These events include hospital admissions, ER-visits and number of in-hospital days.

 Based off of previous findings in the literature, target for enrollment was set at 70 + 70 patients, to achieve statistical significance with 80% power.

 Selfcare Management Intervention in Heart Failure@highlight

A novel tool for self-care enhancement for heart failure (HF) patients has been developed.

 In this randomized controlled trial, patients will be randomized 1:1 to either receive the home-based tool (OPTILOGG) or standard care.

 The intervention will go on for 8 months, and outcomes are self-care, quality of life, cardiovascular events (including emergency visits, admissions and number of in-hospital days).
