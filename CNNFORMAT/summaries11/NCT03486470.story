(secondQuint)Comparison of Two Radial Artery Segments Related to "Old-Fashioned" Radial and New Snuff Box Vessel Approach by US.

 Radial approach for coronary and peripheral procedures is now well established due to both patient and operator preference and carries a lower risk of bleeding and mortality.

 The most lasting consequence of transradial procedures remains radial artery occlusion, which is mainly influenced by the artery diameter and the size of the sheath.

 As a new, more distal approach looms on the horizon, it is plausible to determine factors that could impact its feasibility.

 Since the success rate for artery cannulation depends to a great extent on the size and the depth of the artery, the current study examines both parameters, as well as whether they are influenced by variables such as sex, body mass index, handedness, or comorbidities i.

The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in the size and the depth of the radial artery at the access points for established radial and new distal radial approach for the arteries of both arms
