(firstQuint)A Study to Examine the Effect of Tesofensine and Metoprolol on the 24-hour Mean Heart Rate.

 In this study, the dose-response relationship between tesofensine and metoprolol will be examined and thus the optimal dose of metoprolol to mitigate the effects of tesofensine on HR will be determined.

 HR is the primary endpoint because in the previous studies it has been shown to be the most affected safety endpoint by the effects of tesofensine.
