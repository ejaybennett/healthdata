(secondQuint)A Study to Determine the Bioequivalence of Alogliptin and Pioglitazone When Administered as Individual Tablets and as Fixed-Dose Combination (FDC)-SYR-322-4833 BL Tablets to Healthy Russian Participants.

 The drug being tested in this study are called Incresync (SYR-322-4833 BL), alogliptin, and pioglitazone.

 This study will assess the bioequivalence, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of alogliptin and pioglitazone administered as individual tablets and as the FDC tablet product in healthy volunteers.

 The study will enroll approximately 72 participants.

 Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the 4 treatment sequences to receive one of the following treatments: - Treatment A: SYR-322-4833 BL (25 mg + 15 mg) - Treatment B: Alogliptin 25 mg + pioglitazone 15 mg - Treatment C: SYR-322-4833 BL (25 mg + 30 mg) - Treatment D: Alogliptin 25 mg + pioglitazone 30 mg All participants will be asked to take single dose of study medication on Day 1 of each intervention period.

 This single center trial will be conducted in Russia.

 The overall time to participate in this study is 66 days.

 Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 14 days after their last dose of drug for a follow-up assessment.
