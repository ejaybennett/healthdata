(thirdQuint)Study of Addiction Criteria in the Elderly.

 The hypothesis of this research is that some of the DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorder are more appropriate than others in people over 65 years of age.

 This study therefore aims to describe the frequency of the DSM-5 criteria for the substance use disorder in a population over 65 years of age and to link it secondarily to the severity of the addiction.

 The study is a descriptive study of a population of subjects over 65 years old.

 It aims to search for addiction criteria in this population by formulating the hypothesis of an addictive vulnerability relating to certain risk factors.

 To sensitize the detection of criteria, we chose among older subjects those who are most at risk because they are more exposed to the vulnerability factor relative to this population (physical disability, loss of autonomy, loneliness).
