(fifthQuint)The PERFORM-TAVR Trial.

 The PERFORM-TAVR trial (Protein and Exercise to Reverse Frailty in OldeR Men and women undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) is a multicenter randomized clinical trial with a parallel-group design.

 The investigators will screen consecutive patients 70 years of age before TAVR and enroll those that have evidence of physical frailty defined as an SPPB score 8.

 The SPPB was chosen as the main inclusion criterion and also as the primary endpoint based on its ease-of-use, reproducibility, responsiveness to change, and superior predictive value for mortality and patient-centered outcomes in the Frailty-AVR Study.

 The investigators will randomly allocate 220 patients to receive a multi-faceted intervention consisting of a home-based exercise program and a protein-rich oral nutritional supplement or usual lifestyle counselling.

 The multi-faceted intervention consists of two synergistic components performed by patients at their homes.

 The first component is a home-based supervised exercise program that combines walking and weight-bearing exercises to build strength and balance performed for 12 weeks after the patient is discharged home post-TAVR.

 The exercises are based on the WEBB program that was developed at the University of Sydney and validated to help therapists individually prescribe progressive exercise that is challenging but safe for older adults.

 Starting as soon as the patient returns home post-TAVR, a trained therapist (TT; physiotherapist or certified exercise physiologist) will visit their home for 1 hour twice weekly over a 12-week period to supervise and tailor the exercises according to each individual's capability and progress, and to reinforce the goal of moderate-intensity aerobic activity such as brisk walking at least 30 minutes 5 days per week.

 To monitor compliance, the TT will ask patients to log their daily exercises and wear a wrist-worn accelerometer to record daily step counts.

 The accelerometer provides motivational cues such as individualized daily step count goals and gentle vibrations to remind patients to mobilize when they have been sedentary for a prolonged period during the day.

 The second component is a protein-rich oral nutritional supplement with 20 g protein and 1.

5 g HMB per serving, delivered as a ready-to-drink beverage in 235 mL bottles, consumed twice daily for 4 weeks pre-TAVR and 12 weeks after the patient is discharged home post-TAVR.

 This beverage contains 350 calories, and is provided in chocolate and vanilla flavors.

 It will be consumed with breakfast (first serving of the day) and with exercise (second serving of the day), not before meals, so as to supplement rather than replace food intake.

 The HMB ingredient stimulates muscle protein synthesis, particularly when combined with exercise due to the muscle priming effect.

 Therefore, the TT will ask the patient to drink the beverage during/after the exercise session.

 The TT will also replenish the patient's supply of beverages during home-visits and perform bottle-counts to verify compliance.

 Lifestyle counselling consists of formalized usual care - instructing patients to perform moderate-intensity aerobic activity at least 30 minutes 5 days per week as tolerated and eat a balanced diet based on the 2013 AHA/ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management.

 In order to standardize this counselling and ensure that it is safely carried out in both the control and intervention groups, the TT will provide and explain the "Easy Tips for Heart Healthy Eating" and "Walking for a Healthy Heart" brochures designed by the American Heart Association.

 The latter brochure outlines practical tips to safely begin a walking program and gradually increase walking time over a 12-week period to meet the goal of 150 minutes per week.

 The brochures are available in English and French.

 The investigators will ask control group patients to refrain from consuming protein supplements during the trial unless prescribed by their treating physician.

 The primary endpoint is physical frailty measured by the SPPB score at 3 months.

 Secondary endpoints are health-related QOL measured by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), disability measured by the Older Americans Resources and Services ADL/IADL scale, cognitive function measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, handgrip strength measured by a Jamar dynamometer, body composition and phase angle measured by a portable bioimpedance device, vital status and a composite safety endpoint of all-cause mortality, injurious fall, acute kidney injury, or readmission for worsening angina, heart failure, or arrhythmia at 3 months.

 Habitual physical activity will be measured using a modified version of the Paffenbarger scale and accelerometer step counts.

 Body weight will be measured using a scale.

 The primary and secondary endpoints will be re-assessed at 6 months to detect latent effects and sustained adherence, and vital status and questionnaires will be assessed by telephone at 12 months.

The PERFORM-TAVR trial (Protein and Exercise to Reverse Frailty in OldeR Men and women undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) is a multicenter randomized clinical trial with a parallel-group design.

 The investigators will screen consecutive patients 70 years of age before TAVR and enroll those that have evidence of physical frailty defined as an SPPB score 8.

 The investigators will randomly allocate 220 patients to receive a multi-faceted intervention consisting of a home-based exercise program and a protein-rich oral nutritional supplement or usual lifestyle counselling.

 The primary endpoint is the change in SPPB score 3-months post-procedure.
