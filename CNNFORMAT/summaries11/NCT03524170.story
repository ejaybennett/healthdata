(fifthQuint)RACHEL1: Radiation and CHEckpoint bLockade Trial in Patients With Metastatic Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer.

 Study Drug Administration: There are 28 days in every cycle.

 If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive 1 of 2 dose levels of MSB0011359C, based on when you join the study.

 The first 3 participants will receive the higher of the 2 dose levels.

 Each new group (of 3) will receive the same dose unless intolerable side effects are seen in a certain number of participants.

 If this occurs, the next groups will receive the lower dose level of MSB0011359C.

 If intolerable side effects are seen in a certain number of participants when using the lower dose, the study will be stopped.

 You will receive MSB0011359C by vein over about 1 hour every 14 days +/-3 days.

 You will be watched for side effects for 2 hours after each infusion.

 Radiation therapy will start within 3 days after the second dose of MSB0011359C.

 Depending on the site of your disease, you will receive radiation 1 time a day for 5 days or 10 days.

 Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 If you cannot tolerate the study drug, your dose may be lowered or stopped.

 Your participation on the study will be over 90 days after you receive the last dose of MSB0011359C.

 Pharmacokinetic (PK) Testing: Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 3, and before study drug infusion in Cycles 2 and 6 for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing.

 They may also be tested at the end of study visit.

 PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.

 The samples will also be tested to learn how the drug has changed inside your body.

 This will help the doctors decide if the daily dose of the study drug needs to be increased, decreased, or remain at the current level.

 Study Visits: On Day 1 of Each Cycle: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 14 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to measure your blood sugar levels, blood clotting function, the amount of cholesterol in your blood, and your thyroid, liver, and kidney functions.

 - You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

 - If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be drawn for a pregnancy test.

 On Day 56: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 14 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to measure the amount of cholesterol in your blood, and your liver and kidney functions.

 - If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be drawn for a pregnancy test.

 - You will have a CT scan, a PET/CT scan, and/or an MRI to check the status of the disease.

 - You will have a tumor biopsy of 2 sites if possible (the site that received radiation and a site that did not) on Day 56 or within 7 days of Day 56 for immune system and biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers.

 End-of-Study Visit (EOT): If the disease gets worse, you will have an end of study visit.

 At this visit you will have the following tests: - Blood (about 14 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to measure your blood sugar levels, blood clotting function, the amount of cholesterol in your blood, and to test your thyroid, liver, and kidney function.

 - You will have a core biopsy to find out if the tumor has grown due to problems with your immune system.

 RACHEL1: Radiation and CHEckpoint bLockade Trial in Patients With Metastatic Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of M7824 (MSB0011359C) that can be given with radiation therapy to patients with estrogen and/or progesterone receptor (HR) positive, HER2-negative breast cancer that is metastatic (has spread).

 The safety and tolerability of MSB0011359C will also be studied.

 Researchers also want to learn more about how certain immune cells may change when MSB0011359C in given in combination with radiation therapy.

 The effect of the study treatment combination will also be studied.

 This is an investigational study.

 MSB0011359C is not FDA approved or commercially available.

 It is currently being used for research purposes only.

 Radiation therapy is part of standard of care for many breast cancer patients.

 The study doctor can describe how the study drug and radiation therapy are designed to work.

 Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
