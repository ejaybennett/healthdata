(firstQuint)Nitric Oxide in CPB for Renal Protection in Cardiac Surgery.

 The aim of this work is to study nephroprotective effects of nitric oxide (NO) supply to the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit during cardiac surgery with normothermic CPB in adult patients.

 The prospective randomized study is performed in the settings of Federal Cardiology Center.

 A total of 71 adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery with CPB are enrolled in the study.

 Patients are randomized to two groups: main group receive NO treatment; control group undergoes sham procedure.

 In the main group, NO is supplied to the CPB line in a dose of 40 ppm throughout the entire CPB period.

 The primary endpoint is the frequency of acute kidney injury (AKI).

 The secondary endpoints are the diuresis during CPB and the level of urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) four hours after surgery.

 Cumulative hydrobalance, diuresis, and Lasix doses are assessed within the first 48 h of the postoperative period.

 The dynamics of serum creatinine is assessed during the first week following the intervention.
