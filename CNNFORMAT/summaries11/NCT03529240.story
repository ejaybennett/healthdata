(firstQuint)Kinesiology Taping in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Effects on Performance, Gait Characteristics, and Energy Consumption.

 Forty-five patients from Level 1 and 2 according to the Brooke Lower Extremity Functional Classification were included in the study.

 Performance was assessed by measuring the distance in 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and the duration of timed performance tests; energy consumption by Physiological Consumption Index (PCI), and gait characteristics by footprint method on powdered ground at baseline.

 Kinesiology taping with facilitation technique was applied on bilateral quadriceps and tibialis anterior muscles and the assessments were repeated 1 hour after application.

 The comparison between before and after taping was analyzed.
