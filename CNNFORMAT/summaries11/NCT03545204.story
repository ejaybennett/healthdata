(fifthQuint)Implementation Research of Kangaroo Mother Care in Rural Pakistan.

.

 Pakistan has a high neonatal mortality rate (55/1000 live birth) and each year more than 200,000 newborns die.

 In rural Pakistan, Prematurity and low birth weight is considered risk factor for 50% of all neonatal deaths.

 An estimated 450,000 infant deaths can be prevented each year with the universal implementation of KMC at facility and community levels in the 75 countdowns to 2015 priority countries.

 The "Every Newborn Action Plan" endorsed and launched by the World Health Assembly in May 2014 includes the goal of scaling up KMC to 50% of babies weighing under 2000 grams by 2020, and to 75% of these babies by 2025.

 A situation analysis of 5 Asian countries including Pakistan for evaluation of facility based KMC uptake was carried out by Save the Children's Saving New-born Lives (SNL) program and the Maternal and Child Health Integration Program (MCHIP).

 It was found that Pakistan was well behind other countries for preparedness and implementation of KMC.

 The factors highlighted in the report for this poor performance was lack of awareness at health care providers level, significant bottlenecks were identified in leadership, governess and health workforce competence.

 The goal is to develop a delivery model that will result in the uptake of KMC at facility and community level.

 KMC Package will consist of strategies to overcome socio-cultural barriers for families to practice KMC in a sustained manner in the community.

 The other objectives of the study are to determine the impact of promoting KMC on the following: - Post-enrolment neonatal mortality measured at 28 days of age.

 - Neurodevelopment assessment in a subset of recruited LBW babies at 6, 9, 12 and 24 months.

 - Cost-effective assessment of KMC implementation model.

 - Incidence of serious bacterial infection (PSBI) and referral to hospital at 1 and 2 months of age.

 - Growth (weight, length and head circumference) at 1, 3 and 6 months of age.

 - Percent of women administering KMC for more than 8 hours in a day.

 Study Design: A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial is selected to implement KMC on community-wide scale; to estimate the causal impact of an intervention on its target population.

Through this design, once the intervention is provided it will remain sustained in the community.

 The duration of trial would be for 3 years.

 Unit of Randomization will be union councils.

 A total of 18 union councils will be randomly selected from the total of 62 UCs, six from each Taluka (subdivision) along with its health facility will participate in the implementation.

 The facilities that will implement KMC include THQ-Johi, THQ-Khairpur Nathan Shah and THQ-Mehar.

 Nine UCs will be allocated to the Intervention clusters from 3 Taluka's; remaining 9 union councils will serve as control.

 The study population would be the babies of birth weight 1200-2500g delivered at hospital or in community.

 The performance of the intervention will be gauged by percent increase in the uptake of KMC in the population.

 The baseline coverage is assumed to negligible in the study population, which provides an important and credible reference for comparison.

 Randomization: Method used to assign intervention to the clusters is restricted randomization scheme, which is restricted to the population size of each Taluka, live births, neonatal mortality and distance from the Taluka facility.

 The allocation of intervention is based on clusters rather than individuals.

 A probability proportionate to size (PPS) sampling method will be used to implement this intervention in each union council in order to minimize bias.

 Study Activities includes; 1.

 Pregnancy Surveillance 2.

 Baseline Survey 3.

 Enrollment and KMC administration at Facility 4.

 Continuation of KMC administration at Community 5.

 Impact Assessments (mid-line and end-line).

 Implementation Research of Kangaroo Mother Care in Rural Pakistan.

@highlight

Pakistan has a high neonatal mortality rate (55/1000 live birth) and each year more than 200,000 newborns die.

 In rural Pakistan, more than 50% deliveries occur at home and majority by unskilled birth attendants.

 The country has high proportion of preterm births and according to unpublished data it ranges between 15-20% of all live births.

 Prematurity and low birth weight is considered risk factors for 50% of all neonatal deaths.

 While many interventions exist to save the preterm newborns, KMC is considered as a simple, close to nature and cost-effective intervention.

 There are evidence to suggest that KMC, compared to incubator care, lowers the neonatal mortality by 51% for stable babies weighing <2,000 g if started in the first week.

 In this study; early, prolonged and continuous direct skin-to-skin contact is provided to preterm newborn by the mother or another family member to provide warmth and to encourage frequent and exclusive breastfeeding.

 The investigator intend to increase exclusive breastfeeding, weight gain, and mother-baby bonding and improves neurodevelopmental outcomes through this approach.

 In addition to be more parent and baby-friendly, KMC is also more health-system friendly by reducing hospital stay and nursing support.

 The investigator decided to implement this intervention through a Cluster Randomized Stepped-wedge design in District Dadu.

 Union councils of the subdivisions will be the unit of randomization.
