 Acute urticaria (hives) is a common skin disease.

 The prevalence of acute urticaria in life is about 15 to 20% in the general population.

 It is responsible for a frequent use of emergency departments (ED).

 The usual treatment is based on early administration of an association of antihistamines and corticosteroid.

 The therapeutic efficacy of corticosteroids has never been established by high evidence studies.

 However, corticosteroids are frequently used.

 When stopped, corticosteroids could promote the occurence of urticaria recurrences, and a transition to chronic urticaria.

 In addition, corticosteroids may be rarely responsible for gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension and diabetes.
