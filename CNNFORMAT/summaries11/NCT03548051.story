(fifthQuint)Microbial Restoration for Individuals With One or More Recurrences of Clostridium Difficile Associated Disease (CDAD).

 This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled, partially blinded trial comparing the safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation versus placebo both delivered by rectal enema in subjects 18 years of age or older with recurrent Clostridium difficile Associated Disease (CDAD).

 162 (108 in the FMT group, 54 in the placebo group) male or female subjects will be enrolled in the study.

 Subjects must have had treatment for most recent CDAD with at least 10 days of either metronidazole po/IV (500 mg tid), oral vancomycin (at least 125 mg qid), or oral fidaxomicin (200 mg bid) and have no diarrheal symptoms (<3 unformed stools per 24 hour period) off antibiotics during the washout period.

 Enrolled subjects will be randomized at each site to receive either FMT by enema or placebo by enema in a 2:1 ratio.

 The study is described as partially blinded because by design subjects are to be blinded only to a certain point.

 Subjects will be followed for clinical response (efficacy) and safety.

 Study duration is 4 years, subject participation duration is approximately 3 years.

 Primary study objectives are to: 1) evaluate the safety of FMT(s) delivered by enema vs.

 placebo delivered by enema, 2) determine efficacy of FMT delivered by enema vs.

 placebo delivered by enema.

 Secondary objectives are to: 1) evaluate the sustained clinical response rate of FMTs delivered by enema vs.

 placebo delivered by enema, 2) evaluate the rate of recurrent CDAD, 3) evaluate the time to recurrent CDAD.
