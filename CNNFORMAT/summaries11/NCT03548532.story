(firstQuint)Embryo Culture at a Constant Temperature of 36.

6C or 37.

1C.

 A previous study in our centre analysed stable embryo culture at 36.

6C and 37.

1C, on sibling oocytes.

 The primary aim was to analyse possible differneces in embryo development (utilization rate) up to day 5/6.

 In this study, the investigators found a high difference in clinical pregnancy rate between both groups (46.

4% versus 77.

4%).

 Since this study was not powered to find differences in clincial pregnancy rates between both groups, this RCT was especially powered as a superiority trial to find differences in clincial pregnancy rates between both groups.

 On the day of oocyte retrieval, patients will be allocated to culture at one of both temperatures.

On the day of oocyte retrieval, participants will be randomized to stable culture at 37.

6C with the ultimate aim of finding a difference in clincial pregnancies.
