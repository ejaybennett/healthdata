(secondQuint)Patient Perception and Clinical Efficacy of a Collagen Matrix for the Treatment of Peri-implantitis.

 Nowadays, there is not enough evidence that evaluates the patient's perception of utilizing the soft tissue substitutes in comparison to the autologous connective tissue graft for the augmentation of the keratinized mucosa and gain of hygienic access to the implants with infectious pathology and with minimum or absent keratinized mucosa.

 Therefore, the aim of the study is to evaluate the change of clinical parameters of peri-implant health and the patient perception of the procedure for augmentation of the keratinized tissues around dental implants with peri-implantitis.

 The hypothesis is that collagen matrix of porcine origin is associated with lower patient morbidity, in comparison with autologous connective-tissue graft, when used for the augmentation of the keratinized tissues around endosseous dental implants with infectious pathology and with minimum or absent KT mucosa.

 A sample 48 patients will be recruited basing upon the diagnosis of peri-implantitis and absent or insufficient peri- implant mucosa.

 1 month after the non-surgical treatment, surgical procedure will be performed.

 Peri-implant clinical and radiographic parameters, as well as patient perception of the therapy provided, will be evaluated before and at various stages (up to 52 weeks) after the surgical intervention.

 Also, change of vestibulum depth will be analyzed, as well as the time spent for the procedure measured.

This is a multi-centre, randomized clinical trial which evaluates the efficiency of the collagen xenograft (Muco-Graft(R)) in comparison to the autologous connective tissue graft for the augmentation of keratinized mucosa and gaining hygienic access to the implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis.
