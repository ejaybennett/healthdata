(secondQuint)Assessment of Safety and Feasibility of ExAblate Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Disruption.

 This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study to establish the safety and feasibility of BBB (blood brain barrier) disruption along the periphery of tumor resection cavity using the ExAblate Neuro Model 4000 Type 2.

0 (220 kHz) system.

 For this study, patients will be eligible to enroll in the study prior to beginning the planned adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy phase of treatment.

 Of note, only patients who are deemed eligible for adjuvant TMZ will be eligible for enrollment.

 This will be a staged protocol where the first 5 patients will have the ExAblate BBBD (blood brain barrier disruption) target non-eloquent areas of the peripheral margin of the resected tumor.

 While study enrollment continues, a full summary of the first 5 subjects will be reviewed by the DSMB (data safety monitoring board).

 Following DSMB review, the 5-subjects report and the DSMB summaries will be shared with the FDA.
