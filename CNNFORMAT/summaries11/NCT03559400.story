(fifthQuint)RCT Intraoperative Gentamicin Versus No Antibiotics in Open Tibia Fractures.

 The study asks the question, among adults treated at a resource-limited setting with intramedullary nailing or external fixation for an open tibia fracture, does intraoperative local gentamicin injection result in lower rates of infection when compared to no local antibiotics? Investigators propose a prospective randomized controlled trial enrolling all adult open tibial shaft fractures (OTA 42) with primarily closeable wounds (Gustilo Type I, II, or IIIA) at a partner site in Sub-Saharan Africa, namely, Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute (MOI) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

 Participants would be randomly assigned to receive aqueous gentamicin administered after closure at the time of initial debridement or debridement alone.

 The primary outcome would be the composite outcome of deep surgical site infection or fracture nonunion at 1 year.

 Secondary outcomes will include the direct and indirect cost and quality-of-life via EQ-5D.

 The central hypothesis is that there is a difference in the rate of deep surgical site infection (SSI) and nonunion comparing local gentamicin administration to debridement alone for adult patients with open tibia fractures treated in Tanzania.

 RCT Intraoperative Gentamicin Versus No Antibiotics in Open Tibia Fractures@highlight

The study focuses on infection prevention via antibiotic injection into the wound during surgery.

 Specifically, the study asks the question, among adults treated at a resource-limited setting with intramedullary nailing or external fixation for an open tibia fracture, does intraoperative local gentamicin injection result in lower rates of infection when compared to no local antibiotics? Participants will be randomized into one of two groups to receive either no antibiotics or local gentamicin injection.
