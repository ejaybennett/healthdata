(fifthQuint)Tai Chi Quan Improving Biochemistry and Quality of Life in Type 2 Diabetes.

 In this study, the hypothesis that the 12-week Tai Chi Quan training would have better control of blood sugar, biochemistry index, and also better quality of life and activity of automatic nerve system.

 In the study, type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) patients will be recruited as subjects.

 The subjects were randomized to either Tai Chi group or control group.

 Tai Chi group would take Tai Chi Quan training for 1hr, twice a week for 12 weeks.

 There were 10-minute warm-up, 40-minute Tai Chi lesson, and 10-minute cool-down exercise in the training.

 In this study, the 1st section of Yang style 108 form is chosen for the experiment group.

 Both group were given diabetic patients care education and the exercise recording book for encouraging the daily exercise habits.

 The outcome measures before and after 12-week intervention include basic demographic characteristics, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, high and low density lipid, creatinine, eGFR, GPT, ACR, quality of life, and activity of automatic nerve system.

In this study, the hypothesis that the 12-week Tai Chi Quan training would have better control of blood sugar, biochemistry profile, and also better quality of life and activity of autonomic nerve system (ANS).

 The subjects were randomize assigned to either Tai Chi group or control group.

 The outcome measures before and after 12-week intervention include basic demographic characteristics, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose(FBG), triglycerides (TG), high and low density lipoprotein (HDL, LDL), creatinine(Cr), eGFR, GPT, ACR, quality of life, and activity of automatic nerve system.
