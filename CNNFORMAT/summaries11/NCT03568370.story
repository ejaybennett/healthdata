(thirdQuint)Effects of Olive Oil on Nipple Cracking, Nipple Pain and Maternal Satisfactions.

 Previous studies have shown that olive oil, applied to the skin, has analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.

 It is proposed in this study that olive oil may also help prevent cracked nipple and sore nipple in breastfeeding mothers.

 The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of olive oil in the prevention of nipple cracking, nipple pain and ascension of maternal satisfaction in lactating women.

 It's a prospective, randomized study of 80 lactating women, admitted to TSGH postpartum unit.

 Eligible patients were randomized into two groups of 40 women.

 In Group 1 Olive oil will be applied on the nipple after breastfeeding, and in Group 2 drops of breast milk were applied to the nipple after feeding.

 Clinical evaluations were made during the first 3 days of treatment and the 7th and 10th day after delivery.

 Furthermore, we will check the 1month breastfeeding rate data, which collected by the hospital nurse for baby-friendly hospital policy.
