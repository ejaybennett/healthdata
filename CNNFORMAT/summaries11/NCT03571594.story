(secondQuint)A Four-Part Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, PK and PD of ONO-5788 in Healthy Adult Volunteers.

 This single centre study will be comprised of 4 parts, Part A (SAD; up to 7 cohorts, 8 subjects per cohort and including an assessment of food effect), a multiple-dose part (up to 4 doses, 10 subjects per cohort); an elderly cohort (8 subjects per gender) and a proof of principle part.

 The single ascending dose part (Part A) comprises of increasing doses of an oral solution or capsule, with an investigation of the potential for food effects.

 The multiple ascending dose part (Part B, MAD; 14 days dosing) will be initiated after the PK and safety data are available from the single ascending dose part.

 An evaluation of the PK in the elderly and any potential gender differences will also be evaluated in Part C.

 Part D will be a proof of principle evaluation where the effects of ONO-5788 to inhibit the GHRH and arginine-stimulated GH release will be evaluated.

 Octreotide acetate is a reference arm in this part of the study.

 A Four-Part Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, PK and PD of ONO-5788 in Healthy Adult Volunteers@highlight

This is a first in human study to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ONO-5788 in healthy adult volunteers.

 This study will be conducted in 4 parts: a single-ascending dose part, a multiple-ascending dose part, an elderly part and a proof of principle part.
