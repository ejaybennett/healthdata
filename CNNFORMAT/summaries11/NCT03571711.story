(fifthQuint)Meropenem Pharmacokinetics in Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis.

 Spontaneous bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) in liver cirrhosis is a severe and increasingly common disease, which is associated with high morbidity, mortality and high costs for the investigator's health care system.

 In addition to age and severity of comorbidities, female sex is associated with detrimental outcome.

 Delayed diagnosis and therapy of SBP may lead to a higher mortality in this patient population.

 Therefore, an early diagnosis and adequate anti-infective therapy is essential.

 Due to the accumulation of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) pathogens, especially in nosocomial SBP, empirical application of broad-spectrum antibiotics is recommended in the therapy of SBP.

During the use of antibiotic drugs in general, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets, as the achieved time period over the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), should be evaluated to increase drug efficacy and reduce AMR development.

 Pharmacokinetic studies of meropenem concentrations at the infection site in this particular group of patients are rare in the literature.

 Recent studies in critically ill patients showed highly variable meropenem concentrations in peritoneal fluid after iv administration.

 The aim of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of meropenem during SBP in female and male patients with liver cirrhosis to investigate whether pharmacodynamics therapy goals are met.

 Meropenem Pharmacokinetics in Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis@highlight

The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has increased the use of meropenem in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

 Additionally, recent studies suggested female gender as an independent risk factor for mortality in SBP.

 Studies regarding possible sex dependent differences in meropenem pharmacokinetics in SBP are scarce.

 The aim of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of meropenem during SBP in female and male patients with liver cirrhosis to investigate whether pharmacodynamics therapy goals are met.
