(thirdQuint)The Prone to Supine Breast MRI Trial.

 The purpose of this study is to find out whether additional MRI images taken with patients in a different position after completing a standard MRI are of sufficient quality to allow a radiologist to identify the edges of the tumor.

 These additional MRI images will only take about 10-15 minutes to obtain and will not require a second injection of contrast material.

The information gathered in this study will make it more feasible to use a new device called the "breast cancer locator" to help surgeons more accurately remove breast cancers.

 The Prone to Supine Breast MRI Trial@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether a supine MRI obtained immediately after a standard diagnostic prone MRI exam, without a second injection of gadolinium (Gd) contrast material, would be of sufficient quality to allow the Radiologist to define the tumor edges ("segment" the tumor) so that a 3-D image of the tumor can be generated to form a BCL.
