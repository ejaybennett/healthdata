(fifthQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Benefit of RUCONEST in Subjects With CVID Who Experience ADRs Related to IVIG Infusions.

 This is a single-site, pilot study conducted in the US to determine the benefit of human C1-esterase inhibitor [recombinant] (C1-INH-R) therapy to ameliorate ADRs in subjects receiving IVIG therapy for CVID for experience ADRs post-infusion.

 CVID subjects who are currently receiving IVIG every 3 to 4 weeks for immunodeficiency and experience ADRs will be enrolled.

 In part 1, subjects will continue to receive IVIG for two infusions.

 Complement proteins will be measured pre- and post-infusion.

 Quality of life and other questionnaires will be administered.

 In part 2, subjects will receive C1-INH-R infusion prior to receiving IVIG infusion for three infusions.

 Complement proteins will be measured pre- and post- infusion.

 Quality of life and other questionnaires will be administered.

 A Study to Evaluate the Benefit of RUCONEST in Subjects With CVID Who Experience ADRs Related to IVIG Infusions@highlight

Patients receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy for primary immunodeficiency, specifically common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), may experience adverse drug reactions (ADRs).

 The mechanism of the ADR is unknown.

 Currently, the standard practice for these patients is to change from IV to subcutaneous IG (SCIG) but because of the need of immunomodulation or patient preference, SCIG may not be an option.

 Data has shown that some levels of complement decrease from pre- to post-infusion of IVIG.

 This study is to determine if replacing this complement protein may ameliorate ADRs.
