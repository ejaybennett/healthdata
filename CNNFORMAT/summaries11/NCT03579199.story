(thirdQuint)Practical Application of Indocyanine Green Camera in Laparoscopic Liver Surgery.

 "Thanks to the property of ICG to release a fluorescent signal when excited by a Near Infra Red (NIR) light source, ICG fluorescence has been widely used during several clinical situations (angiography, lymphography,.

.

).

 Few years ago it has been shown that hepatic tumors could be seen with a NIR camera able to view ICG fluorescence thanks to the depot in or around the tumor of the dye injected during preop.

Since, this fluorescence imaging technique potential has been underlined to identify tumors undiagnosed before surgery.

 Pre-operative examination of hepatic lesions is based on 3 points: - visual examination - two-hand palpation - intra-operative ultrasound.

 During laparoscopic hepatic surgery it is not possible to palpate the liver thus peroperative examination of the liver surface is harder than during open surgery.

 Moreover per-operative ultrasound is not a reliable tool in order to explore liver surface.

 However the latest development of NIR cameras able to view ICG fluorescence could add a benefit in laparoscopic surgery in view of its capacity to detect superficial lesions, even those of small dimension.

"Indocyanine Green (ICG) is a dye used as an indicator of hepatic function considering its capacity to be eliminated only by the bile.

 Thus, ICG tend to remain in liver tumors.

 The hypothesis of CAMVIC study is that the use of fluorescence imaging during laparoscopic hepatic surgery will allow to detect small subcapsular superficial lesions undetected by other diagnostic methods, which will improve the results of the oncologic treatment.
