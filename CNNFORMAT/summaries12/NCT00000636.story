(fifthQuint)Prophylaxis Against Tuberculosis (TB) in Patients With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection and Confirmed Latent Tuberculous Infection.

 Current guidelines recommend 6 to 12 months of treatment with INH for purified protein derivative (PPD)-positive individuals.

 Problems with this treatment include compliance, adverse reaction, and the possibility of not preventing disease due to INH-resistant organisms.

 Studies suggest that two or three months of rifampin and pyrazinamide may be more effective than longer courses of INH.

 A two-month prevention course should help to increase compliance.

 In addition, the use of two drugs (rifampin and pyrazinamide) may help overcome problems with drug resistance.

 After baseline screening, patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms and are evaluated by means of clinic visits monthly for the first three months, then every three months for the first year (there are additional clinic visits for INH patients).

 Patients are then evaluated every six months.

 One group of patients takes INH plus vitamin B6 for 12 months.

 The other group of patients takes 1 of 2 doses of rifampin (depending on patient's weight) plus pyrazinamide in 3-4 divided doses for 60 days.

To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of a 2-month regimen of rifampin and pyrazinamide versus a 1-year course of isoniazid (INH) to prevent the development of tuberculosis in patients who are coinfected with HIV and latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb).
