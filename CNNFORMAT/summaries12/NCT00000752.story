(fifthQuint)Preventing Frequent Sinus Infections in HIV-Infected Patients.

 Sinusitis is common among HIV-infected patients and is likely to be recurrent or refractory to traditional therapy, particularly in patients with advanced immunosuppression.

 An intervention aimed at prevention of recurrent sinus disease in HIV-infected patients appears to be warranted.

 Patients receive 21-42 days of antibiotic therapy for the defining episode of sinusitis.

 Following discontinuation of antibiotics, screening evaluations are performed.

 Within 7 days following completion of antibiotics, patients with clinical resolution begin 14 +/- 3 days of decongestant therapy with oral Deconsal II, a drug combining pseudoephedrine, a decongestant, and guaifenesin, an expectorant.

 Following decongestant therapy, patients undergo entry evaluations, including nasal endoscopy and sinus radiograph.

 Patients with continued clinical resolution and no purulence on endoscopy are then randomized to receive decongestant alone or in combination with nasal steroid (beclomethasone dipropionate) or antibiotic (cefuroxime axetil) or both.

 Treatment continues for a minimum of 52 weeks and a maximum of 104 weeks.

 Patients are followed at weeks 4, 8, and 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter.

To evaluate the additional effectiveness of an anti-inflammatory nasal spray ( beclomethasone dipropionate ) and a broad spectrum antibiotic ( cefuroxime axetil ) over decongestant ( Deconsal II ) alone, when these agents are given individually or in combination for the prevention of recurrent paranasal sinus infection in patients with HIV infection.

 To compare the clinical utility of paranasal sinus radiographs with computed tomograms (CTs) in the evaluation and management of HIV-infected patients with recurrent paranasal sinus infection.

 To determine relevant prognostic factors and the microbiologic etiology of maxillary sinusitis in this patient population.
