(fifthQuint)A Phase II, Comparative Study of Seroconversion of Single-Dose and Two-Dose Measles Vaccination in HIV-Infected and HIV-Uninfected Children: A Multicenter Trial of the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group.

 Recommendations for the age at vaccination should balance the need to minimize the risk of morbidity and mortality with the benefit of achieving the highest seroconversion rates.

 Immunizing a more intact immune system at an earlier stage of HIV infection may in turn achieve better and long-lasting measles protection.

 This study will help define a more effective measles vaccine regimen for children diagnosed with HIV infection and will provide greater insight into the functional status of the HIV-infected children's humoral immune system.

 Patients, HIV infected and uninfected, are randomized to one of two attenuated measles vaccine schedules: at 6 and 12 months of age, or at 12 months of age only.

 Attenuvax is administered as the month 6 vaccine and M-M-R II as the month 12 vaccine.

 Patients are followed for 24 months after the last vaccination.

 A Phase II, Comparative Study of Seroconversion of Single-Dose and Two-Dose Measles Vaccination in HIV-Infected and HIV-Uninfected Children: A Multicenter Trial of the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group@highlight

To compare measles seroconversion rates (development of antibodies) at 13 months of age in HIV-infected and uninfected children on one of two immunization schedules: attenuated measles/mumps/rubella virus (M-M-R II) vaccine at 12 months versus attenuated measles vaccine (Attenuvax) at 6 months plus M-M-R II vaccine at 12 months.

 Recommendations for the age at vaccination should balance the need to minimize the risk of morbidity and mortality with the benefit of achieving the highest seroconversion rates.

 Immunizing a more intact immune system at an earlier stage of HIV infection may in turn achieve better and long-lasting measles protection.
