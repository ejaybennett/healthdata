(secondQuint)Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Salivary Gland Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Estimate the response rate in patients with metastatic or recurrent salivary gland cancer treated with paclitaxel (Taxol, TAX) by 3-hour infusion.

 II.

 Describe the toxicity of TAX in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy.

 Paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers), Taxol, TAX, NSC-125973.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 32 patients/histology will be entered.

 If no response is observed in the first 14 patients in a particular histology, accrual to that group will close; if after 18 months annual accrual is less than 10 patients/histology, accrual to that group may close.
