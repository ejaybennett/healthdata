(thirdQuint)Docetaxel Plus Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the effectiveness of low dose docetaxel and carboplatin by response rate, response duration, and time to progression in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

 II.

 Determine the side effects and toxicity profile of docetaxel when given in combination with carboplatin in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is open label study.

 Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once a week for 4 weeks.

 Patients receive at least 2 courses (8 weeks) of treatment.

 Courses are further repeated in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease progression.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 20-38 patients accrued into this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining docetaxel and carboplatin in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
