(thirdQuint)Itraconazole Compared With Fluconazole to Prevent Infections in Patients Undergoing Peripheral Stem Cell or Bone Marrow Transplantation.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Compare the efficacy of itraconazole versus fluconazole in reducing the incidence of breakthrough Aspergillus infections in patients undergoing allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell or bone marrow transplantation.

 II.

 Compare the incidence of combined mold/yeast infections and the use of alternative systemic antifungal treatments in these patients on this regimen.

 III.

 Compare the toxic effects of these two drugs in these patients.

 IV.

 Determine the survival rate of these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

 Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

 Arm I: Patients receive fluconazole orally or IV daily beginning at start of conditioning regimen and continuing until day 180 or until 4 weeks after stopping corticosteroids (if it occurs between days 120-180).

 Arm II: Patients receive oral fluconazole daily beginning at start of conditioning regimen and continuing until day 0.

 Patients then receive itraconazole orally or IV daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until day 180, or until 4 weeks after stopping corticosteroids (if it occurs between days 120-180).

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 578 patients (289 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 4 years.

 Itraconazole Compared With Fluconazole to Prevent Infections in Patients Undergoing Peripheral Stem Cell or Bone Marrow Transplantation@highlight

RATIONALE: Giving itraconazole or fluconazole may be effective in preventing infections in patients undergoing peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplantation.

 It is not yet known whether itraconazole is more effective than fluconazole for preventing infections.

 PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of itraconazole with fluconazole to prevent infections in patients undergoing peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplantation.
