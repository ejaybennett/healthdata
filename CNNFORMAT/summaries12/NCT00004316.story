(thirdQuint)Phase I/II Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study of Capsaicin for Interstitial Cystitis and Vulvar Vestibulitis.

 PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

 Patients with interstitial cystitis are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 pain control therapies.

 The first group is treated with capsaicin.

 A second group is given individually titrated doses of capsaicin: the dose is increased as tolerated or until symptomatic response is acceptable.

 A control group receives a placebo.

 Therapy for all groups is administered intravesically every week for 5 weeks.

 Patients with vulvar vestibulitis are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 pain control therapies.

 One group applies topical capsaicin cream to the painful area 4 times a day for 6 weeks.

 The dose is individually titrated if burning discomfort persists and the patient is compliant with the application schedule.

 The control group applies a placebo.

 Patients with vulvar vestibulitis may continue or cross to capsaicin for 6 additional weeks.
