(thirdQuint)Lung Screening Study.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Compare the efficacy of screening spiral CT scan and screening chest x-ray in detecting lung cancer in current or former smokers at high risk for lung cancer.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study of lung cancer screening.

 Patients are randomized to one of two screening arms.

 Arm I: Patients undergo one spiral CT scan.

 Arm II: Patients undergo one chest x-ray.

 Patients and their primary care physicians are notified of test results within 3 weeks of the exam.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,000 participants (1,500 per screening arm) will be accrued for this study at six screening centers (500 per center) by October 31, 2000.

RATIONALE: New imaging procedures such as spiral CT may improve the ability to detect lung cancer in patients who are at high risk for the disease.

 PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of a spiral CT scan with that of a chest x-ray in detecting lung cancer in patients who are at high risk for the disease.
