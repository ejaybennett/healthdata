(thirdQuint)Vapreotide in Treating Patients Undergoing Elective Pancreatic Resection.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Compare the efficacy of vapreotide versus placebo in reducing postoperative pancreatic complications in patients undergoing elective pancreatic resection.

 II.

 Compare the postoperative complications occurring within 45 days after surgery unrelated to the pancreas, days of hospitalization and survival at 45 days after surgery, number of rehospitalizations, and number of postoperative blood units or packed red blood cells administered in patients treated with these regimens.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.

 Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

 Arm I: Patients undergo surgical resection on day 1 and receive vapreotide subcutaneously twice daily on days 1-7.

 Arm II: Patients undergo surgical resection and receive a placebo as in arm I.

 Patients are followed at days 28 and 45.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 580 patients (290 per arm) will be accrued for this study.

 Vapreotide in Treating Patients Undergoing Elective Pancreatic Resection@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs such as vapreotide may prevent complications following pancreatic resection.

 It is not yet known if vapreotide is more effective than no further therapy in preventing side effects of pancreatic resection.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying vapreotide to see how well it works compared to a placebo in preventing complications in patients undergoing surgery for pancreatic cancer.
