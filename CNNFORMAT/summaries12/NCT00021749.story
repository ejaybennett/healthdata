(firstQuint)Phase I/II Study of Genasense in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.

 This study is a two-part phase I-II study.

 Part 1 will determine the MTD of Genasense in patients with CLL.

 This dose will then be tested in a non-randomized, multi-center, Phase II sequential clinical trial of Genasense used alone for treatment of patients with advanced CLL.

 Pharmacokinetics of Genasense and kinetics of Bcl-2 down regulation and re-expression in CLL cells will be followed in selected patients.
