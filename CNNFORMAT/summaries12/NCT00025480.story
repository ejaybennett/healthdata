(fifthQuint)Tipifarnib Plus Radiation Therapy After Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of tipifarnib given concurrently with radiotherapy after induction chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel and carboplatin and followed by maintenance therapy with tipifarnib in patients with stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

 - Determine the tumor response at 3 months in patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: This is multicenter, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib.

 Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses.

 Beginning 4-6 weeks after the completion of induction chemotherapy, patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily for 7 weeks.

 Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 7 weeks beginning 3 days after the start of tipifarnib.

 After completion of radiotherapy, patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily for 4 days and then once daily for 4 days.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib while receiving radiotherapy until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 Beginning 4-6 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy and tipifarnib, patients receive maintenance therapy comprising oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21.

 Maintenance therapy repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 9-12 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.

 Tipifarnib Plus Radiation Therapy After Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by making tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.

 Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing and may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when given together with radiation therapy after combination chemotherapy in treating patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
