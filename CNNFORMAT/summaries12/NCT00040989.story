(secondQuint)BAY 56-3722 in Treating Patients With Recurrent, Unresectable, or Metastatic Kidney Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the tumor response rate of patients with recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with BAY 56-3722.

 - Determine the duration of response, time to progression, and survival of patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive BAY 56-3722 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3.

 Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 6 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-140 patients will be accrued for this study.
