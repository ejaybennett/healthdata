(fifthQuint)Reduced-Intensity Regimen Before Donor Bone Marrow Transplant in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the complete response rate in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes treated with reduced-intensity allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, including photopheresis, total body irradiation, and pentostatin.

 - Determine the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the engraftment rate of donor cells in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the extent and duration of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a single-arm, two-stage, multicenter phase II study.

 - Preparative Regimen: Patients undergo photopheresis using methoxsalen on days -7 and -6 and receive pentostatin intravenously (IV )continuously on days -5 and -4.

 Total body irradiation is administered on days -3 and -2 for a total of 3 doses.

 - Transplantation: Allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0.

 - Acute graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV on days -1 to 30 and then orally every 12 hours.

 Cyclosporine dose is then tapered beginning after day 50 and continuing for 6 months in the absence of GVHD.

 Once cyclosporine dose is significantly decreased, oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is then administered twice a day.

 MMF dose is then tapered for 12 months in the absence of GVHD.

 Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1 and 3.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients would be accrued for this study within 2.

1 years.

 Reduced-Intensity Regimen Before Donor Bone Marrow Transplant in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes@highlight

RATIONALE: Photopheresis treats the patient's blood with drugs and ultraviolet light outside the body and kills the white blood cells.

 Giving photopheresis, pentostatin, and radiation therapy before a donor bone marrow or stem cell transplant helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells.

 The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect).

 Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells.

 Giving pentostatin before transplant and cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil after transplant may stop this from happening.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving pentostatin together with photopheresis and total-body irradiation work before donor bone marrow transplant in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
