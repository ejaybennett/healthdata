(thirdQuint)Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with monoclonal antibody Hu1D10.

 - Determine the duration of response and progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu1D10 IV over 2 hours.

 Treatment repeats weekly for a total of 4 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed at weeks 5 and 8 and then every 3 months thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 12 months.

RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have progressive or recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma.
