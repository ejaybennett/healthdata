(fifthQuint)Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Perfusion Imaging in Patients With Neurofibromatosis 1 and Plexiform Neurofibroma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and MR perfusion studies can predict plexiform neurofibroma growth rates in patients with neurofibromatosis 1.

 - Determine whether FDG-PET and MR perfusion studies can predict the likelihood of response in patients who are undergoing investigational treatment for plexiform neurofibromas.

 - Identify neuroimaging characteristics that distinguish patients who have responded to therapy from those who have not after completion of treatment.

 OUTLINE: - Stratum 1: Patients undergo MR perfusion scan with gadopentetate dimeglumine and fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) at baseline and quantitative MRI evaluation at baseline and 1 year.

 - Stratum 2: Patients undergo quantitative MRI, MR perfusion scan with gadopentetate dimeglumine, and FDG-PET at baseline and 1 year.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients (32 for stratum 1 and 16 for stratum 2) will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: New imaging procedures such as fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging may improve the ability to detect disease progression, help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment, and help plan the most effective treatment.

 PURPOSE: This diagnostic trial is studying how well FDG-PET and MR perfusion imaging work in finding disease progression and determining response to treatment in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 and plexiform neurofibroma.
