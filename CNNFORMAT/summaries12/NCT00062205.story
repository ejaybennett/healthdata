(secondQuint)Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ewing's Family of Tumors or Desmoplastic Small Round-Cell Tumor.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in patients with recurrent Ewing's family of tumors or desmoplastic small round-cell tumor.

 - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the duration of disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

 Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily on days 1-28.

 Courses repeat every 28 days.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ewing's Family of Tumors or Desmoplastic Small Round-Cell Tumor@highlight

RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in treating patients with recurrent Ewing's family of tumors or desmoplastic small round-cell tumor.
