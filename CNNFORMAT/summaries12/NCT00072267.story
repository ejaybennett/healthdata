(fifthQuint)UCN-01 and Topotecan in Treating Patients With Recurrent, Persistent, or Progressive Advanced Ovarian Epithelial, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the antitumor activity of UCN-01 and topotecan, in terms of complete and partial objective response rates, in patients with recurrent, persistent, or progressive advanced ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

 Secondary - Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen, in terms of stable disease rates and duration of response, in these patients.

 - Determine the progression-free, median, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

 - Determine the relationship between clinical and pharmacodynamic effects of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-33 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-11 months.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 UCN-01 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth.

 Combining UCN-01 with topotecan may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining UCN-01 with topotecan in treating patients who have recurrent, persistent, or progressive advanced ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.
