(fifthQuint)Safety of and Immune Response to a Hepatitis B Virus Vaccine Given With a Booster (CpG7909 ODN) in HIV Infected and HIV Uninfected People.

 As HIV disease progresses in HIV infected people, their immune responses to infectious and other foreign invaders becomes weaker; in particular, the cellular (T-cell) immune response is particularly affected by HIV.

 A boosting agent called CpG7909 ODN may be an ideal adjuvant for vaccines given to HIV infected people, because it may help elicit an increased CD8 T-cell response.

 This study will evaluate the safety of and immune response to a hepatitis B virus vaccine series given with CpG7909 ODN in HIV infected and uninfected people.

 There will be three groups in this study; participants will be stratified by baseline CD4 counts and viral load.

 Within each group, participants will be randomly assigned to receive 3 injections of hepatitis B vaccine with CpG7909 ODN or 3 injections of hepatitis B vaccine alone.

 Injections will be given at study entry and Months 1 and 6.

 There will be 10 study visits; a physical exam and blood collection will occur at each visit.

 Safety of and Immune Response to a Hepatitis B Virus Vaccine Given With a Booster (CpG7909 ODN) in HIV Infected and HIV Uninfected People@highlight

The purpose of the study is to determine the safety of and immune response to a hepatitis B virus vaccine series given with a boosting agent, CpG7909 oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN), in HIV infected and HIV uninfected individuals who previously failed to develop a response to hepatitis B vaccine.

 Study hypothesis: Administration of CpG7909 ODN together with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine will result in increased frequency and magnitude of response to vaccine in individuals who have previously failed to mount a response to vaccination, and that in HIV infected subjects with detectable plasma viremia, it will lead to the enhancement of HIV-specific responses.
