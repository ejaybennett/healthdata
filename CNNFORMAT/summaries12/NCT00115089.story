(fifthQuint)7 Day Study of Mast Cell Inhibitor, R926112, in Patients With Symptomatic Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis.

 Seven hundred fifty patients with histories of seasonal allergies will be screened in late summer and early fall at 25 sites across the U.

S.

 Approximately 375 patients, based on severity of symptoms will be randomized among the treatments (150 to R926112, 150 to placebo, 75 to Beconase).

 During, and for about 2-3 weeks prior to the study, patients will have to abstain from other anti-allergy medications.

 Patients will fill out diary cards two times per day to record their symptoms.

 The entire study should take between 2-4 weeks.

 7 Day Study of Mast Cell Inhibitor, R926112, in Patients With Symptomatic Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis@highlight

This is a study of the effectiveness and safety of a new nasal spray for the relief of the symptoms of seasonal allergies.

 The agents being compared are: R926112 (a novel anti-allergy medicine), Beconase (beclomethasone dipropionate, an established FDA approved steroid treatment), and an inactive placebo.

 The study hypothesis is that R926112 will be superior to placebo at the end of a week of testing and evaluation.

 The study does not have the power to determine how R926112 compares to Beconase.
