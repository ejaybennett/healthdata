 This is a multicentric, open-label, non-randomized, non-competitive clinical study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of V-ACVBP chemotherapy in previously untreated patients aged from 18 to 65 years with peripheral T-lymphoma.

 It is anticipated that 60 subjects will be enrolled over two years (from June 2005 to May 2007).
