(fifthQuint)Toxicity Substudy of Evaluation of Subcutaneous Proleukin in a Randomised International Trial (ESPRIT): TOXIL-2 Substudy.

 The research is a randomised open-label substudy of ESPRIT.

 The substudy is exploring whether the amount of rIL-2 taken during a dosing cycle of rIL-2 can be increased through controlling the predictable side-effects of rIL-2 better.

 This is a four arm study with a factorial design; patients will be randomised to one of four arms.

 Each arm consists of different combinations of adjunctive agents.

 Each patient will receive paracetamol and ibuprofen prophylactically throughout the cycle, the other adjunctive agents prescribed will vary according to which arm the patient is randomised to, but the antiemetic used will be either ondansetron or metoclopramide with or without low dose codeine phosphate as an additional analgesic agent.

 The primary end-point is the percentage of planned rIL-2 actually taken during the cycle.

 Secondary end-points include safety, side-effects of rIL-2 and the adjunctive agents, CD4+ T-cell changes and quality of life measures.

 Toxicity Substudy of Evaluation of Subcutaneous Proleukin in a Randomised International Trial (ESPRIT): TOXIL-2 Substudy@highlight

This substudy is an open-label, randomised study comparing the uptake of recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) in HIV-1 infected individuals receiving different combinations of antiemetics and analgesic agents during rIL-2 dosing in ESPRIT.

 The design is a factorial one with 4 arms.

 All patients will receive regular ibuprofen and paracetamol from days 1-6 of the rIL-2 dosing cycle; in addition, patients will be randomised to receive one of two antiemetic combinations, i.

 ondansetron or metoclopramide with or without low dose codeine phosphate as an additional analgesic agent.
