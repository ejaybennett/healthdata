(fifthQuint)Pilot Study to Assess Safety and Feasibility of Resuscitation of Preterm Infants With Controlled Volume of Air/Oxygen.

 Design Randomized controlled pilot study.

 Setting: The study will be conducted at the Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH), Toronto which is a tertiary care teaching hospital in the Greater Toronto Area.

 Approximately 50-75 neonates 100 per minute and pink colour), he/she will be weighed (the resuscitaire has in built scales to obtain the weight without disconnecting the infants from the respiratory support).

 Surfactant (BLESTM, BLES Biochemicals Inc, London, Ontario, Canada) will be administered according to the current NICU protocol at MSH.

 This protocol recommends surfactant administration within 15 minutes of delivery to all infants 27 weeks' gestation if FiO2 requirements are >35% and mean airway pressure is >7 cm of H2O.

 Five ml/kg of surfactant will be instilled via the endotracheal tube into the lungs in three aliquots using a precut nasogastric tube attached to a syringe.

 Each aliquot will be delivered with the infant lying in one of three head positions - supine, left lateral and right lateral.

 Between the administration of each aliquot, the neonate will continue to receive manual IPPV.

 After the administration of surfactant, the neonate will be attached to a ventilator.

 If for any reason the administration of surfactant is delayed, the infant will be attached to ventilator whenever the attending doctor feels it appropriate.

 Subsequent administration of surfactant in this group will follow similar procedural framework as outlined above.

 Study Group: In the first minute, neonates in the study group will be resuscitated as per the current NRP algorithm, that is 30 seconds of IPPV using bag and mask ventilation will be allowed.

 Intubation will proceed only for infants who are apneic, gasping, who have heart rate 30%, the infant will be excluded from the study as he/she would be deemed unfit for the volume controlled ventilation.

 An adequate response will be considered when oxygen saturation is between 86-92%, heart rate maintained >100 per minute and pink color.

 Once the infant has been stabilized, he/she will be weighed using similar technique described in the control group without disconnecting from ventilator.

 At this time, the TV will be adjusted to reflect correct weight of the infant.

 Similar criteria for the administration of surfactant in the control group will be applied to the study group.

 However, in order to avoid disconnection from the ventilator and administration of manual breaths, a closed suctioning adapter with an administration port (NeolinkTM Viasys MedSystems, Whoellng, IL, US) will be attached to the endotracheal tube.

 Five ml/kg of surfactant (BLESTM, BLES Biochemicals Inc, London, Ontario, Canada) will be delivered to the lungs in similar way while continuing mechanical ventilation at the same settings.

 Procedures common to both groups: An oxygen saturation monitor, cardiac leads and end tidal CO2 leads will be attached to all infants at the earliest possible time.

 Continuous cardio-respiratory monitoring will ensue and at the end of the resuscitation period the data will be printed out.

 A naso/orogastric tube will be inserted.

 Umbilical arterial and umbilical venous catheters will be inserted as per the routine of the NICU.

 A chest X-ray will be done to assess endotracheal tube and catheter placement.

 Once stable, infants will be transferred to the NICU.

 Further respiratory management of all infants will be performed as deemed appropriate by NICU team and will be similar.

 (All infants are routinely ventilated with an aim to achieve 4-6 ml/kg of TV).

 Furthermore, all infants will receive head ultrasounds according to the current NICU practice.

 Crossover: Crossover to the control group will be allowed 3 minutes after the onset of the intervention 1.

 If oxygen saturations increase by less than 20% (for starting values of 65%) or 3.

 If the heart rate 7.

25 is currently practiced in most NICUs and the evidence suggests no adverse effects.

 Continuous monitoring of leak will ensure that the lungs are not over distended.

 A safety monitoring committee comprised of two neonatologists and a respiratory therapist not involved in the study will be convened to observe adverse events and provide recommendations about the study to the investigators.

 They will also report any concerns about the study to the Research Ethics Board.

 The clinical data for each infant requiring crossover to the control arm will be presented to the safety committee.

 The safety committee after reviewing the data will provide comments to the investigators as to whether the study should continue or not.

 The safety committee will be authorized to stop the study if it finds that the standard care of the infants in the study group is being jeopardized.

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Data will be analyzed using the statistical package SPSS (version 10, Chicago, IL, USA).

 Chi-square test for categorical variables and Student's t test for continuous variables will be used to compare the demographic characteristics in both groups.

 Intention to treat analysis will be performed; that is subjects will be analyzed in the same group of allocation even if they needed to cross over to control arm.

 Duration profiles of ventilatory requirement, CPAP requirement, and oxygen/air requirement in two groups will be compared using Student's t test.

 The number of subjects requiring switch over to the control group due to failure will be recorded.

 A priori analysis is also planned to compare the Apgar scores and first blood gas parameters after assessing the distribution and applying appropriate statistical transformation.

 A p value of < 0.

05 will be considered significant for all analysis.

 Pilot Study to Assess Safety and Feasibility of Resuscitation of Preterm Infants With Controlled Volume of Air/Oxygen@highlight

QUESTION: Is controlled tidal volume delivery during the resuscitation of preterm infants 100 per minute and a pink color.

 When positive pressure ventilation is delivered with a bag, tidal volume is not measured.

 It is likely that high tidal volume is delivered to the neonate in order to achieve a rapid response.

 The evidence from human and animal model studies suggests that the initiation of mechanical ventilation and volutrauma associated with continued ventilation, are associated with an increase in pro-inflammatory mediators in the lungs of the preterm infants which induce pulmonary injury.

 This may interfere with the signaling involved in alveolarization, leading to a decrease in alveolar formation or maldevelopment of the alveoli, and subsequent evolution to chronic lung disease (CLD) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of controlling tidal volume delivery (and limiting manual ventilation), during the resuscitation of preterm infants < 28 weeks' gestation.

 STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized controlled pilot study of 40 preterm neonates at the Mount Sinai Hospital.

 RESEARCH PLAN: All eligible parents at risk for preterm delivery at < 28 weeks' gestation will be approached.

 After obtaining written informed consent, infants will be randomized to standard resuscitation according to NRP guidelines (control group) or resuscitation using controlled tidal volume ventilation (5 ml/kg) (study group), if they require resuscitation.

 Crossover to the control group will be allowed if there is clinical deterioration or no clinical improvement after 3 minutes of intervention.

 OUTCOMES: 1.

 Primary: Apgar scores at 5,10, 15 and 20 minutes and pH, pO2, and pCO2 levels within 1 hour of resuscitation and at 4 hours of life.

 2.

 Secondary: Durations of mechanical ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure support, low flow oxygen/air requirement; respiratory status of infant at 28 days postnatal and 36 weeks' corrected gestational age.

 Incidences of air leak, intraventricular haemorrhage and all causes of mortality before discharge from NICU will be compared.
