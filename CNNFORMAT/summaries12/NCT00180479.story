(fifthQuint)SPIRIT III Clinical Trial of the XIENCE V Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (EECSS).

 The purpose of the SPIRIT III clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the XIENCE V(R) Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (XIENCE V(R) EECSS).

 The XIENCE V(R) EECS (XIENCE V(R) arm) will be compared to an active control group represented by the FDA approved commercially available Boston Scientific TAXUS(R) EXPRESS2 cent Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent (TAXUS(R) EXPRESS2 cent PECS) System (TAXUS(R) arm).

 The SPIRIT III clinical trial consists of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) in the US which will enroll approximately 1,002 subjects (2:1 randomization XIENCE V(R) EECS : TAXUS(R) EXPRESS2 cent PECS) with a maximum of two de novo native coronary artery lesion treatment within vessel sizes >= 2.

 A pharmacokinetic substudy will be carried out in a minimum of 5 pre-determined sites in the US and a minimum of 5 pre-determined sites in Japan.

 In the US, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of everolimus, as delivered by the XIENCE V(R) EECS will be analyzed in a subset of 15 subjects (minimum) with single vessel/lesion treatment, and up to 20 subjects with dual vessel/lesion treatment, respectively.

 In Japan, a minimum of 10 subjects with single vessel/lesion treatment and up to 20 subjects with dual vessel/lesion treatment will have a PK measurements performed.

 These subsets will include subjects receiving overlapping stents.
