(fifthQuint)A Double-Blind Comparison of Galantamine HBr and Placebo in Adults With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

 Galantamine HBr, a tertiary alkaloid, is a competitive and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase that is indicated to slow the deterioration of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's Disease.

 Initial anecdotal data suggest a promising role for Galantamine HBr in the treatment of ADHD.

 We propose to study to test the safety and efficacy of Galantamine HBr therapy in adults with ADHD.

 We will test if Galantamine HBr -associated improvements in ADHD symptomatology translate into improved cognitive and functional capacities (social and occupational) as well as increased quality of life.

 The proposed study includes 1) use of a 12-week design to document the response rate 2) assessment of the impact of Galantamine HBr on functional capacities (quality of life, psychosocial function) and cognition, 3) careful assessment of safety and tolerability.

 A Double-Blind Comparison of Galantamine HBr and Placebo in Adults With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder@highlight

This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, study using daily doses of up to 24 mg/ day Galantamine HBr in the treatment of adults who meet DSM-IV criteria for childhood-onset ADHD.

 Specific hypotheses are as follows: Hypothesis 1: ADHD symptomatology in adults with DSM-IV ADHD will be responsive to acute Galantamine HBr treatment.

 Hypothesis 2: Galantamine HBr -associated improvement in ADHD symptomatology in adults will translate into improved functional capacities (neuropsychological, social, and occupational) as well as an increased quality of life throughout acute treatment.

 Hypothesis 3: Galantamine HBr treatment will be safe and well tolerated as reflected by a low drop out rate and absence of major differences from placebo.
