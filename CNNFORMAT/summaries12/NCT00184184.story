(firstQuint)Registration of Tobacco, Coffee and Substance Use Among Acutely Admitted Psychiatric Patients.

 We will include all patients acutely admitted to Ostmarka Psychiatric Hospital to register this population's use of coffee, tobacco and substances.

 We will also compare results of substance in immunologic rapid urine tests taken by the nurse at the hospital with substance in urine tested in laboratory with LC/MS (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry).
