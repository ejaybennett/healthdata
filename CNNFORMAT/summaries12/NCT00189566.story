(secondQuint)Taxol in Monotherapy or in Combination With Topotecan or Carboplatin in Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer in Early Relapse.

 The main purpose of this research study is to find out if treatment of early relapse of ovarian or fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer with paclitaxel (Taxol*) weekly administered, in lower doses in combination with topotecan (Hycamtin*) or carboplatin will improve efficacy compared to weekly administration of paclitaxel in monotherapy.

 Tolerance in the three groups will be compared.
