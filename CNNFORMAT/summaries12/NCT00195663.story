(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Adalimumab and Methotrexate (MTX) Versus MTX Monotherapy in Subjects With Early Rheumatoid Arthritis.

 This study had an initial 2-year double-blind treatment period followed by an 8-year open-label extension period, for a total of up to 10 years study duration.

 The study was designed to assess the potential of adalimumab + methotrexate to improve signs and symptoms of disease and to inhibit radiographic progression in patients with recent onset (disease duration less than 3 years) rheumatoid arthritis not previously treated with methotrexate.

 Adalimumab is a human anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibody.
