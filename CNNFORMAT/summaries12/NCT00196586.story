(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Addition of IL-2 to Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2a and Ribavirin in HIV/HCV Coinfected Patients.

 This pilot study evaluate efficacy and safety of addition of IL-2 to pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin in HIV-HCV coinfected patients non-responders after three months of standard therapy with pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin Eligible patients should have CD4 cells count higher than 300/mm if pretreated by antiretroviral therapy or higher than 400/mm if naive of antiretroviral therapy, Metavir score with histological fibrosis score F1, F2 or F3.

 Recombinant IL-2 will be given subcutaneously at a dose of 3 MUI twice daily for 5 days every 8 weeks for 5 cycles from week 14 to week 46.

 This national multicenter study will enroll around 75 patients in order to give IL-2 to 20 non-responders.

 The primary endpoint is sustained virologic response, defined by undetectable serum HCV-RNA at week 72, six months after the end of therapy.

 Efficacy and Safety of Addition of IL-2 to Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2a and Ribavirin in HIV/HCV Coinfected Patients@highlight

The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of addition of IL-2 to pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin in HIV-HCV coinfected patients non-responders after three months of standard therapy with pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin.

 IL-2 may enhance numbers and function of CD4 T lymphocytes and specific anti-HCV immune responses and could participate to the control of HCV replication
