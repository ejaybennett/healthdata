(thirdQuint)Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN) Trial - Long-Acting Beta Agonist Response by Genotype (LARGE).

 BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a long-acting beta agonist in patients with asthma receiving inhaled corticosteroids who express two distinct polymorphisms of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor.

 DESIGN NARRATIVE: Participants were homozygous for arginine or glycine at the 16th amino-acid position of the -2 adrenergic receptor (B16 Arg/Arg or B16 Gly/Gly).

 Individuals were matched against their opposite genotype by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and race.

 Matched participants entered an 8-week run-in period.

 This is a 62-week crossover design where subjects receive the following therapies: - Beclomethasone HFA (240 mu g twice a day (BID)) + as-needed (PRN) albuterol: 8-week run-in - Beclomethasone HFA (240 mu g BID) + salmeterol (50 mu g BID) + PRN ipratropium bromide + PRN albuterol: 18-week treatment period - Beclomethasone HFA (240 mu g BID) + PRN albuterol: 8-week run-out - Beclomethasone HFA (240 mu g BID) + placebo salmeterol + PRN ipratropium bromide + PRN albuterol: 18-week treatment period - Beclomethasone HFA (240 mu g BID) + PRN albuterol: 10-week run-out The order of treatments received during the two treatment periods is randomized.

 Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN) Trial - Long-Acting Beta Agonist Response by Genotype (LARGE)@highlight

The purpose of this trial is to determine whether regularly scheduled use of an inhaled long-acting beta agonist (salmeterol) in the setting of concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone hydroflouroalkane (HFA) inhaler) will have a detrimental effect on asthma control in people who bear the B16-Arg/Arg genotype of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene, as compared to people with asthma of similar severity who bear the B16-Gly/Gly genotype.
