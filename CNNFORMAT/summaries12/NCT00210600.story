(secondQuint)Early and Standard Intervention With 120,000 Units of PROCRIT (Epoetin Alfa) Every Three Weeks in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy.

 This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center study.

 Eligible patients will be identified during the screening phase.

 After randomization, the Treatment Phase will start at the Day 1, Week 1 visit.

 The entire study period will be up to 22 weeks, with the screening phase lasting up to two weeks, treatment for a maximum of 16 weeks, and safety follow-up for four weeks.

 The primary objective of this study is to obtain efficacy and safety data regarding PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) administered at 120,000 units subcutaneously (sc) once every three weeks (q3w) in 2 patient groups with cancer and anemia receiving chemotherapy: 1.

 Early Intervention Group: PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) treatment started at patient hemoglobin (Hb) >= 11.

0 g/dL to <= 12.

0 g/dL and 2.

 Standard Intervention Group: PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) treatment started once patient hemoglobin drops to < 11 g/dL or has a Hb <11.

0 g/dL at study entry.

 For safety monitoring, all patients will be followed for adverse events, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), blood chemistries and blood pressure measurements throughout the study.

 All eligible patients with hemoglobin < 12.

0 g/dL will be randomized to receive Epoetin alfa injections (120,000 Units ) under the skin every 3 weeks for a maximum of 16 treatment weeks.

 Doses may be adjusted depending on the patients hemoglobin levels.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) when administered at 120,000 Units once every three weeks by comparing early dosing (Hb 11g/dL-12g/dL) vs.

 standard dosing (Hb< 11g/dL).
