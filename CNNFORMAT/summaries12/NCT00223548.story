(firstQuint)MESNA for Prevention of Acute Deterioration of Renal Function Following Contrast Agent Application.

 Contrast-induced nephropathy remains a common complication of radiographic precedures.

 Pretreatment with Mesna (Sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate) in combination with sodium chloride is more protective than sodium chloride alone in animal models of acute renal failure.

 The aim of this study is therefore to determine laboratory and clinical benefit of MESNA, as an adjunct to saline hydration, in patients with known renal impairment receiving contrast media.
