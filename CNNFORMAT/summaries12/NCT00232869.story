(thirdQuint)A Study of the SMART Stent in the Treatment SFA Disease.

.

 This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, double blind, two-arm feasibility study evaluating the safety and performance of the sirolimus coated Cordis SMART cent nitinol self-expanding stent and delivery system as compared to the uncoated SMART cent stent and delivery system.

 It is anticipated that a total of 90 patients will be entered into the study.

 Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis of coated to uncoated stents.

 Ninety (90) patients with de novo or restenotic native SFA lesions will be randomized to the Sirolimus Coated SMART cent nitinol self-expanding stent or to the uncoated (bare) SMART cent stent.

 Patients will be followed for 24 months post-procedure, with all patients having duplex ultrasound and clinical assessments at discharge, 1, 6, 9, 18 and 24 months, angiography at 6 six months and plain X-ray at 18 months.

 This study will be conducted at nine investigational sites.

 (Protocol was amended where 56 additional patients were recruited and followed for up to 5 years.

 A Study of the SMART Stent in the Treatment SFA Disease.

@highlight

The main objective of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the sirolimus coated Cordis SMART cent nitinol self expandable stent device and its delivery system in the treatment of obstructive superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease in reducing percent in-stent mean lumen diameter stenosis in de novo or restenotic native lesions as compared to the uncoated SMART cent stent.
