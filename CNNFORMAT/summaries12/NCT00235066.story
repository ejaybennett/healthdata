(thirdQuint)The CYPHER Stent Study in Patients With Small de Novo Coronary Artery Lesions.

.

 This is an international, multicenter (up to 10 sites), nonrandomized, historically controlled study in patients with De Novo coronary artery lesions in small vessels treated with the CYPHER cent (sirolimus-eluting) stent as compared to the small vessel tercile uncoated Bx VELOCITYTM Stent patients from the SIRIUS Trial.

 A total of up to 100 patients will be enrolled in this study.

 Patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions >=15mm and =2.

25 mm to cent (sirolimus-eluting) stent.

 Patients will be followed at 30 days, 6, 8, 9 months and at 1, 2 and 3 years post-procedure, with a repeat angiography at 8 months.

 In all patients Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will be performed before (only in case of crossing success) and after the initial procedure.

 An IVUS control will also be done at 8 months follow up to assess neo-intimal growth and remodeling.

 This is a single lesion treatment study.

 Patients may have other lesions treated before the treatment of the intended lesion in the small vessel (a non-target lesion may not be located in the target vessel!).

 Post-procedural treatment of another lesion is only allowed after the 30-day follow-up contact has been completed or in case this is clinically needed.

 It is anticipated that the total length of the study will be 39 months: 3 months to complete patient enrollment and 3 years for follow-up.

 The CYPHER Stent Study in Patients With Small de Novo Coronary Artery Lesions.

@highlight

The main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the CYPHER cent (sirolimus-eluting) stent in reducing in-lesion late lumen loss in de novo native coronary artery lesions in small vessels (2.

25 - 2.

75 mm) as compared to the small vessel tercile of the uncoated Bx VELOCITYTM Stent patients from the SIRIUS Trial, using a stenting technique that minimizes balloon trauma to the vessel and assures full coverage of the lesion with the stent.
