(firstQuint)PI-88 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Hepatectomy.

 Although early diagnosis and treatment improve survival, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rarely cured and recurs frequently after regional therapy or transplantation.

 Hepatic resection can improve 5-year recurrence-free survival by up to 25%.

 Micrometastases of HCC have been detected by molecular techniques in 88% of patients at the time of surgery, and probably cause postoperative recurrence.

 Efforts to reduce the risk of recurrence after a curative resection have been tried, including various regimens of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy.

 In this study , an anti-angiogenic agent, PI-88, is being used as an adjuvant therapy for HCC patients after curative hepatic resection.

 The efficacy endpoints, including tumour non-recurrence rate, time to first recurrence and 1-year survival rate are being evaluated.

 Several risk factors associated with tumour recurrence are also being analysed.

 There are two stages to this study.

 In stage 1 there are three arms - untreated control and two arms are two different PI-88 dose.

 In stage 2 the better of the two PI-88 arms will be continued against the control arm.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PI-88 to inhibit or reduce tumor recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma following hepatectomy.
