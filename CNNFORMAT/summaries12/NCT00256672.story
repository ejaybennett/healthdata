(secondQuint)Effectiveness of Bracing in Preventing Scoliosis in Children With Spinal Cord Injury.

 This is a randomized control trial to determine the effectiveness of high dose bracing ( 23 hours per day) and low dose bracing ( 12 hours per day) in skeletally immature children with Spinal Cord Injury.

 Subjects will be randomized into either a prophylactic high dose-bracing group ( 23 hours per day) or low dose-bracing group ( 12 hours per day).

 Subjects will be stratified by age (younger than age 10 and older than age 10), and curve severity (< 20 degrees and 20-40 degrees) using a matching random blocks design.

 Effectiveness of Bracing in Preventing Scoliosis in Children With Spinal Cord Injury@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether full-time high dose prophylactic bracing (23 hours or more per day) is more effective than low dose bracing (12 hours or less per day) in preventing or delaying spinal curve progression in children with scoliosis after spinal cord injury.
