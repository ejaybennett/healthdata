(fifthQuint)Paricalcitol and Zoledronate in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma or Other Plasma Cell Disorders.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of paricalcitol when used with zoledronate in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders.

 Secondary - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

 - Determine the antimyeloma activity of paricalcitol in patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of paricalcitol.

 Patients receive paricalcitol IV over 15 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and zoledronate IV over 15 minutes on day 22.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paricalcitol until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Paricalcitol and Zoledronate in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma or Other Plasma Cell Disorders@highlight

RATIONALE: Paricalcitol may cause multiple myeloma cells to look more like normal cells, and to grow and spread more slowly.

 Paricalcitol may also stop the growth of the cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer.

 Zoledronate may delay or prevent bone metastases in patients with multiple myeloma.

 Giving paricalcitol together with zoledronate may be an effective treatment for multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of paricalcitol when given with zoledronate in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders.
