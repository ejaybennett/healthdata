(firstQuint)ALFAURUS : A DB Randomized Parallel Group Study of Alfuzosin 10mg OD vs Placebo in the Management of AUR in Patients With a 1st Episode Due to BPH.

 Double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized Multicenter, Phase III study comparing 2 parallel groups (alfuzosin 10mg OD or placebo) in patients with a first episode of acute urinary retention related to BPH.

The acute episode is managed with catheterization and with study drug treatment for 2 to 3 days, followed by an active voiding trial to assess the patients' ability to void after catheter removal.

 Those patients who successfully void will continue their randomized treatment for a total treatment duration of 6 months.

 For all patients who are prematurely withdrawn during the study, a post-study (clinic or phone) visit will be performed for collection of health care consumption data.
