(secondQuint)Diindolylmethane in Treating Patients With Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded To Previous Hormone Therapy.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Establish the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and a recommended phase II dose of absorption-enhanced diindolylmethane (BioResponse-DIM^(R) [BR-DIM]) in patients with nonmetastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer and rising serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.

 - Evaluate the toxicities of BR-DIM.

 Secondary - Evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of twice daily oral administration of BR-DIM in this patient population.

 - Evaluate the effect of BR-DIM supplementation on serum PSA level.

 - Correlate changes in expression levels of lymphocytes NF-kB with serum PSA levels in patients taking BR-DIM supplementation.

 - Determine quality of life measures in patients taking BR-DIM supplementation.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive oral absorption-enhanced absorption-enhanced diindolylmethane (BioResponse-DIM^(R) [BR-DIM]) twice daily on days 1-28.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BR-DIM until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of each course, and at the completion of study therapy.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Diindolylmethane in Treating Patients With Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded To Previous Hormone Therapy@highlight

RATIONALE: Diindolylmethane may slow the growth of prostate cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of diindolylmethane in treating patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to previous hormone therapy.
