(secondQuint)Nocturnal Oxygen Treatment in Heart Failure and Cheyne-Stokes Respiration.

 Oxygen therapy reduces the number of central apneas among patients with congestive heart failure but it is unknown whether quality of life and heart function also improve.

 We aim to test whether the quality of life, exercise capacity and heart function are improved with nocturnal oxygen therapy during 6 weeks with nocturnal oxygen from oxygen concentrator or nocturnal air from placebo concentrator.
