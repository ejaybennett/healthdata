(fifthQuint)Prophylactic Intrapartum Antibiotics and Immunological Markers for Postpartum Morbidity in HIV Positive Women.

 INTRODUCTION The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 582 000 women die world-wide each year due to pregnancy related conditions that could be prevented.

 Most of these deaths occur in developing countries1.

 Some of the underlying causes of increased maternal morbidity and mortality are HIV-related.

 In South Africa the antenatal HIV seroprevalence surveys report an infection rate of 32%, the highest among the Sub-Saharan countries2.

 According to the Saving Mothers Report (NCCEMD) pregnancy-related sepsis was the fourth commonest cause of maternal mortality, while AIDS was the second leading cause3.

 Of the 67 women who died of HIV/AIDS in 1998, 41 died from puerperal sepsis of which 54% had a vaginal delivery and 46% had a caesarean section.

 It is not clear from the report to what extent HIV infection had contributed to the severity of sepsis.

 The clinical impression is that women with HIV infection have a higher incidence of post delivery morbidity than HIV-negative women.

 Proposed contributory factors include, low CD4 count and associated impaired immunological function, other obstetric complications and sexually transmitted infections3.

 The puerperal sepsis rate is about 2-6 % in most studies.

 It is however much higher in women with bacterial vaginosis (14%)2 and those who deliver out of health institutions (18%)3.

 Women with HIV infection are more likely to harbour BV and other sexually transmitted infections.

 For this and other reasons it is generally accepted that HIV-positive women are at increased risk of puerperal infectious morbidity and mortality independent of the mode of delivery and antiretroviral therapy.

 Di Lieto et al4 reported a 33.

8 % incidence of infectious morbidity following emergency caesarean delivery.

 The incidence of infectious morbidity has been reported to be higher in HIV positive women compared to HIV negative women (Semprini et al.

 1995)5.

 The role of prophylactic antibiotics in obstetric complications has been previously investigated especially in women with preterm labour, prelabour rupture of membranes, cardiac disease and women delivered by caesarean section.

 There is good evidence that prophylactic antibiotics significantly reduce postpartum morbidity.

 In these studies prophylactic antibiotics were largely administered intra-operatively.

 The question that remains is whether prophylactic antibiotics need to be given to only women identified as at risk or to all women with HIV infection.

 The identification of biochemical (laboratory)/immune markers will be of value in the timing of clinical interventions.

 The markers that can be used to predict sepsis will be to determine the level of apoptosis in neutrophils, neutrophil function, C-Reactive protein levels, ESR and the levels of the following cytokines viz.

 TNF-, IL-1 cent , IL-6, IL-8, IL-10.

 Less clear is the role that apoptosis and it's dysregulation may play in pathological immune states like sepsis, autoimmune disease, or immunosuppressed states.

 The potential role of apoptosis and the pathogenesis of sepsis have resulted in some unanswered questions- (1) whether impairment of apoptosis as a method of down-regulating pro-inflammatory cells causally results in inappropriate persistence of inflammation under septic conditions and (2) whether increased apoptosis of immune effector cells results in immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to overwhelming infection? Neutrophils are the first immune cells to migrate to sites of inflammation and major functions include phagocytosis of bacteria,apoptosis of neutrophils may be one of the mechanisms of limiting tissue injury at sites of inflammation and phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from monocytes.

 Lower absolute neutrophil counts are associated with increased risk of hospitalization for serious infection among HIV infected patients.

 Because neutrophils are functionally impaired, we hypothesize that sepsis observed in HIV infection might be a result of accelerated apoptosis.

 This study will therefore try to define the mechanisms, direct or indirect, by which HIV infection may dysregulate apoptosis and cytokine production in the pathogenesis of sepsis.

 In summary puerperal sepsis remains a major cause of maternal mortality in South Africa.

 The clinical experience in Durban, is that postpartum infections are on the increase particularly in view of the high prevalence of HIV.

 Clear guidelines are needed for the role of antibiotics among women at risk for postdelivery morbidity associated with infections.

 Current recommendations by the NCCEMD of SA indicate that all women with AIDS and women having caesarean sections be treated prophylactically with antibiotics.

 However, guidelines regarding timing of antibitiotic prophylaxis remain unclear6.

 This study therefore sets out to establish reliable data on the incidence of postdelivery morbidity including puerperal sepsis, associated risk factors, laboratory markers and an effective antibiotic regimen to reduce the risk of postdelivery morbidity.

 AIM To evaluate the role of intrapartum prophylactic antibiotics in HIV infected women in reducing the incidence of postdelivery morbidity as assessed by clinical and immunological markers.

 HYPOTHESIS Antibiotics administered during labour can reduce postdelivery morbidity in HIV infected women STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary: To reduce the incidence of post-delivery infections by use of prophylactic antibiotics.

 Secondary: To investigate immunological parameters as markers of post-delivery infections.

 To identify risk factors for post-delivery infections.

 PRIMARY ENDPOINTS The primary efficacy endpoints for this study will be the incidence of post-delivery infectious morbidity diagnosed between delivery and 6 weeks post-delivery.

 STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective double blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial of prophylactic antibiotics for delivery.

 STUDY POPULATION The study will be conducted at King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban and Umtata Hospital, Transkei over a 2 year period.

 Women who have been counselled and tested for HIV during the antenatal period, and who have agreed to know their results, will be enrolled during the antenatal period.

 Informed written consent for participation in the study will be obtained from all voluntary participants.

 Immunological studies will be conducted in a subsample (25%) of patients in each study group.

 Inclusion Criteria - Women with known HIV status as documented by routine rapid HIV tests, following pre-test voluntary counselling and testing (VCT).

 - Women who gave informed study consent.

 Exclusion Criteria - Women on antibiotic therapy less than 2 weeks prior to study enrolment.

 - Women planned for elective caesarean delivery.

 - Obstetric complications such as preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, cardiac disease, antepartum haemorrhage.

 Randomisation will occur on admission to the labour ward.

 The following tests will be performed prior to randomisation i.

e at enrolment: full blood count(FBC), CD4 count and ano-genital swabs for microbiology.

 The women will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups, depending on HIV status: Group 1: HIV-POSITIVE given antibiotics (Cefoxitin 2g IVI stat dose) Group 2: HIV-POSITIVE given placebo Group 3: HIV-NEGATIVE (no placebo or cefoxitin = control group) Rationale for placebo and choice of antibiotic: The current standard practice is not to give prophylactic antibiotics for delivery to women without risk factors irrespective of HIV status.

 This justifies a placebo-controlled design.

 In this unit the current standard practice is to administer intravenous cefoxitin (2g stat dose) to women for whom prophylactic antibiotic is indicated.

 We therefore intend to use cefoxitin for the study.

 Sample Size: Considering a 15% puerperal sepsis rate among HIV positive women following vaginal and emergency caesarean section delivery a sample size of 343 will be required in each group (placebo and study group) to observe a 33% reduction in the sepsis rate.

 This would detect a significant difference at 5 % level (p C on two separate occasions due to genital tract infection and endometritis.

 Secondary measures will include other clinical infections, neonatal sepsis, duration of hospital stay and surgery for puerperal sepsis.

 Clinical infections include urinary tract infections, pneumonia and wound sepsis.

 Prophylactic Intrapartum Antibiotics and Immunological Markers for Postpartum Morbidity in HIV Positive Women@highlight

Postpartum infections are among the leading causes of maternal mortality world-wide, particularly in under-resourced countries.

 Available data suggests that HIV infected women are at greater risk of postpartum complications than uninfected women.

 In South Africa, HIV/AIDS and related infections are now cumulatively the leading causes of maternal deaths (though indirectly), with puerperal sepsis among the 5 most common causes.

 This was a prospective longitudinal cohort of HIV infected (n = 675) and uninfected (n = 648) women.

 These were women in whom vaginal delivery was anticipated, and were recruited at > 36 weeks of gestation during the antenatal period.

 Hypothesis - HIV infected women are at increased risk of postpartum infectious morbidity and this morbidity can be reduced by use of prophylactic intrapartum antibiotics.
