(fifthQuint)Study of Pralatrexate With Vitamin B12 and Folic Acid in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma.

 This is a Phase 2, single arm, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center study designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of pralatrexate when administered with vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation to patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL.

 Pralatrexate will be given over 3-5 minutes intravenously (IV), which means through a vein.

 If pralatrexate is tolerated well, the patient will receive IV injections of pralatrexate every week for 6 weeks, followed by 1 week without receiving pralatrexate.

 These 7 week cycles will be repeated depending on response and tolerability.
