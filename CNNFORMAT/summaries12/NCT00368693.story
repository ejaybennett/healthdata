(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety Study of Dermal-Living Skin Replacement to Treat Diabetic Foot Ulcers.

 This prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center study will test the efficacy of Dermal - Living Skin Replacement (Dermal - LSR) plus standard of care treatment against solely the standard of care treatment on participants with diabetic foot ulcers.

 The purpose of this study is to test Dermal - LSR combined with standard treatment.

 We want to see how well it works and the number and types of side effects, if any.

 We hope to learn more about how to heal diabetic foot ulcers better.

 You will: - be interviewed and examined - have weekly clinic visits - have blood drawn - have the ulcer photographed - wear a walking boot to reduce pressure on the ulcer.
