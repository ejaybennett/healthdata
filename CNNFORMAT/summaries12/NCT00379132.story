(fifthQuint)131-I-TM-601 Study in Adults With Solid Tumors.

 This is a multi-center, open label, non-randomized, sequential, within-patient dose-escalation study in patients with recurrent or refractory primary solid tumors with metastatic involvement (including brain metastases).

 Patients will be administered 1 to 3 (Test Doses A, B and Dose C) escalating doses of 131-I-TM-601 by intravenous (IV) administration, with dosimetry (imaging-based evaluation of the dose reaching the target sites) conducted prior to and following administration of each dose.

 Whole body dosimetry on critical structures including, but not limited to, bone marrow, bladder, brain, liver, and thyroid will be determined.

 The preliminary results from Test Dose Levels (A and/or B) for each patient will be analyzed prior to treating patients with Dose C.

 Patients will be followed until 28 days following the final dose, with a complete clinical assessment and imaging evaluations at the final follow-up visit.

 131-I-TM-601 Study in Adults With Solid Tumors@highlight

This study is designed to evaluate the ability of intravenously (IV)administered 131-I-labeled TM-601 (chlorotoxin) to provide tumor-specific localization(via radiographic imaging) in patients with recurrent or refractory primary solid tumors with evidence of metastatic involvement.

 (Refractory tumors are non-responsive to standard treatment.

) The safety and tolerability of IV administered 131-I-TM-601 in this patient population will be evaluated as part of this study.
