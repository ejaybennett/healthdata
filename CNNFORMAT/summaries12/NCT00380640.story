(firstQuint)The Efficacy of Trimethoprim in Wound Healing of Patients With Epidermolysis Bullosa.

 Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) comprises a series of hereditary disorders characterized by fragility of the skin and mucous membranes and the tendency of the skin to blister in response to minor friction or trauma.

 The care of patients with EB is a complex task that has to be carried out by a multi-professional team.

 In the absence of a cure, the goal of therapy is the prevention and healing of chronic wounds.

 In patients with EB, chronic inflammation interferes with proper wound healing.

 One treatment option is the use of anti-inflammatory antimicrobial agents, such as trimethoprim, to hasten wound healing and decrease blister formation.

 This treatment may lead to decreased pain and improvement of the quality of life for these patients.
