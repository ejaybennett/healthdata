(thirdQuint)Phase II Trial of Aprepitant & Palonosetron for CINV Prevention w FOLFOX.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the efficacy, in terms of nausea and vomiting control, of aprepitant, palonosetron hydrochloride, and dexamethasone, in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients receiving FOLFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.

 Secondary - Assess the percentage of patients with no emesis and no rescue therapy when treated with aprepitant, palonosetron hydrochloride, and dexamethasone during repeated courses of FOLFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy.

 - Assess the effects of aprepitant on nausea, appetite, taste changes (via visual analogue scale), nutritional intake, and mucositis in these patients.

 - Assess the safety of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

 Beginning 1 hour prior to the initiation of chemotherapy on day 1, patients receive oral aprepitant on days 1-3, oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, and palonosetron hydrochloride IV on day 1.

 Nausea is assessed daily for up to 4 courses of chemotherapy.

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
