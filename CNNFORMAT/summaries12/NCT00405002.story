(secondQuint)A Validation Study of a New System for Measuring the End Expiratory Lung Volume During Mechanical Ventilation.

 In this study we aimed to evaluate a new system dedicated to estimate the end expiratory lung volume, by measuring the VO2-VCO2, during mechanical ventilation compared to the Helium dilution technique and the CT scan.

 We will compare the data considering the CT scan data as the gold standard.
