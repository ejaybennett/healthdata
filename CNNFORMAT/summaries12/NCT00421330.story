(firstQuint)Dutch Randomised Endovascular Aneurysm Management (DREAM-) Trial.

 After the introduction of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), both benefits and drawbacks of this new technique have been reported.

 To assess whether the new technique is an adequate substitute of conventional AAA repair, a randomised study is required.

 The DREAM trial is a randomised multicenter trial enrolling patients eligible for elective treatment of infrarenal AAAs.

 The primary endpoint is combined operative mortality and morbidity.

 Secondary endpoints and additional assessments include event-free survival, quality of life,and costs.
