(secondQuint)Dendritic Cells in Patients Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.

 Blood and skin DC reconstitution shall be investigated in patients affected by hematological diseases and receiving HLA-matched, mobilized peripheral blood stem cells from related or unrelated donors.

 We plan to simultaneously collect and process double biopsies, i.

e.

 from graft versus host disease affected and non-lesional skin of patients at onset of acute graft versus host disease following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

 Emigration assay, Chimerism analysis and immunohistochemistry will be performed.

 Dendritic Cells in Patients Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation@highlight

We plan to investigate prospectively and simultaneously skin and blood DC subtypes, their donor/recipient origin and the correlation of DC reconstitution kinetics with treatment, clinical outcome and incidence of aGvHD in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
