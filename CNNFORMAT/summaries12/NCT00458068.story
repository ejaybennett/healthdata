(fifthQuint)Early Versus Late Enteral Iron in Infants Less Than 1301 Grams.

 Objectives.

 To examine whether early enteral iron supplementation (EI) would improve serum ferritin as a measure of nutritional iron status at 2 months of age and would prevent definite iron deficiency (ID) in infants with a birth weight of 100 mL/kg/day were tolerated (EI) or at 61 days of life (late enteral iron supplementation [LI]).

 Nutritional iron status was assessed: 1) at birth, 2) at 61 days of life, 3) when the infants reached a weight of 1.

6 times birth weight, and 4) before blood was transfused at a hematocrit of 50% one week after the onset of enteral iron supplementation.

 Restrictive red cell transfusion guidelines were followed and all transfusions were documented.

 Erythropoietin was not administered.

 The primary outcome variables were: 1) ferritin at 61 days and 2) the number of infants with ID.

 Results.

 Ferritin at 61 days was not different between the groups.

 Infants in the LI group were more often iron-deficient (26/65 vs 10/68) and received more blood transfusions after day 14 of life.

 No adverse effects of EI were noted.

 Conclusions.

 EI is feasible and probably safe in infants with birth weight <1301 g.

 EI may reduce the incidence of ID and the number of late blood transfusions.

 ID may occur in very low birth weight infants despite early supplementation with iron and should be considered in the case of progressive anemia.

 Early Versus Late Enteral Iron in Infants Less Than 1301 Grams@highlight

Background: Preterm infants are at risk of iron deficiency.

 The smaller the infants are at birth, the smaller the iron stores at birth and the higher the risk of iron deficiency.

 Hypothesis: Preterm infants with a birth weight of less than 1301g require iron supplementation earlier than previously recommended.

 Methods: Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial (1996-1999).

 Results: Early iron supplementation may reduce the incidence of iron deficiency and the need for late blood transfusions.
