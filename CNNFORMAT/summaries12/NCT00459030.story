(fifthQuint)Traditional Print Communication Methods, Simple Electronic Communication Methods, or Usual Care in Increasing How Often Older Women Undergo Colorectal Cancer Screening.

 OBJECTIVES: - Compare traditional print versus simple electronic communication versus usual care, in terms of increasing colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates, in average-risk women attending a routine OB/Gyn visit.

 - Explore the moderating role of attentional style and background variables on the impact of the interventions in these participants.

 - Determine the mediating effect of potential cognitive-affective factors related to CRC screening in these participants.

 - Investigate the comparative cost-effectiveness of these interventions to improve CRC screening adherence.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

 Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 screening arms.

 - Arm I: Participants are contacted by simple electronic communication methods by an email message linked to a personalized website.

 - Arm II: Participants are contacted by traditional print communication methods.

 - Arm III: Participants are observed (usual care).

 Participants in arms I and II are randomized a second time to receive messages about colorectal cancer screening that are matched or mismatched to their attentional style.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5,000 participants will be accrued for this study.

 Traditional Print Communication Methods, Simple Electronic Communication Methods, or Usual Care in Increasing How Often Older Women Undergo Colorectal Cancer Screening@highlight

RATIONALE: Finding out which communication method affects a participant's decision to undergo colorectal cancer screening may help increase the number of participants who undergo screening.

 It is not yet known which communication method is more effective in increasing how often participants undergo colorectal cancer screening.

 PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying traditional print communication methods to see how well they work compared with simple electronic communication methods or usual care in increasing how often older women undergo colorectal cancer screening.
