(thirdQuint)Psychological and Social Factors That May Increase the Risk of Developing Chronic Pain After Surgery in Women With Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the psychological and sociological factors that predispose post-mastectomy pain syndrome after surgery in women with resectable breast cancer.

 Secondary - Determine the psychological and sociological factors that predispose post-surgical pain in these patients.

 - Evaluate emotional distress over time in these patients.

 - Evaluate the acute and chronic pain over time in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients complete multiple questionnaires, including Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI), PCS, and QLQ-C30, to evaluate psychological variables (alexithymia, neurosis, repression of negative emotions, solicitude, dramatization, emotional distress) and quality of life.

 Post-mastectomy chronic pain (PMCP) syndrome is measured immediately after surgery and at 24 hours, day 6, and 5 months post-surgery.

 A subgroup of patients (20 with PMCP and 20 without PMCP) are followed at months 5 and 6 months post-surgery for medication use, pathological problems, morbid events, family history, and environmental factors.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study.
