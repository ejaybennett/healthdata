(firstQuint)Sleep Disturbance and Sleep Quality in Women With Fibromyalgia Syndrome.

 At least 50 women over 18 years of age are invited to volunteer in this study.

 Sleep quality and problems with sleep will be described using several kinds of measures.

 Questionnaires on sleep and Fibromyalgia will be completed by the volunteer.

 In addition, the volunteer will complete a sleep diary for at least 7 days and wear an Actiwatch (a wrist watch like device that measures sleep).

 At completion of the study, participants will be provided a print out of their sleep obtained from the Actiwatch.

 Participants may not be in the study if they work night shift (11 pm - 7 am) or have been diagnosed with a condition called sleep apnea.

 Participants need not live in Kentucky to participate in this study.
