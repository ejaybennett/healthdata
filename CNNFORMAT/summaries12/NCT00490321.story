(thirdQuint)VentrAssistTM LVAD for the Treatment of Advanced Heart Failure - Destination Therapy.

 Currently, patients with Stage D heart failure who are not transplant candidates are treated with a spectrum of therapies, including specialized medical management as well as mechanical support with an LVAD approved by FDA for destination therapy.

 However, there is substantial variation in the therapeutic approaches employed to treat these patients, with relatively low numbers of patients receiving DT LVAD therapy to date.

 Therefore, the VentrAssist DT trial is designed to provide maximal flexibility to the investigators/clinicians to incorporate their clinical judgment in managing these complex patients.
