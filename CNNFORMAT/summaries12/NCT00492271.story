(thirdQuint)First Time in Man Trial for Friulimicin B.

 Continued widespread use of antibiotics has promoted the spread of antibiotic resistance and has created an urgent need for antibacterial agents with no known cross resistance to other antibiotics available for humans.

 Friulimicin B has been shown to be highly active against a range of bacteria including such important pathogens such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Glycopeptide resistant Enterococcus spp.

 These organisms are the causative agents in serious infections such as skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, bacteremia and endocarditis, complicated urinary tract infections, and osteomyelitis.

 This study is the first use of Friulimicin B in man and will examine its safety and a preliminary study will assess if Friulimicin B in the plasma of subjects has activity against bacteria.

 The level of Friulimicin B will be measured in the subjects blood and urine.

 One part of the study will assess if Friulimicin B in the plasma of subjects has activity against bacteria.
