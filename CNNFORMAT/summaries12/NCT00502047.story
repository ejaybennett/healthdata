(secondQuint)Effect of the Plantago Ovata Husk on the Lipid Profile of Patients With Hypercholesterolemia.

 It has been demonstrated that high concentrations of cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL, high risk cholesterol) are the major risk factors for heart disease, myocardial infarction and angina pectoris.

 Moreover, these conditions represent the major cause of death in the Western world.

 Of the measures established to reduce blood cholesterol levels, the introduction of consumption of dietary fibre is a novelty.

 The term dietary fibre defines a variety of substances that are found in plants and are resistant to digestion by human gastrointestinal enzymes.

 The studies performed up until now to determine the effects of fibre on blood lipids have demonstrated that consumption of soluble fibre can reduce cholesterol.

The hypothesis of this study is that soluble fibre may contribute to a reduction of the low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and the combined effect with a statin may achieve an optimisation of the cholesterol-lowering effects in adults with several cardiovascular risk factors.
