(fifthQuint)Effectiveness of Iron-Fortified Milk on Iron Status and Anemia in Young Children in Mexico.

 Introduction.

 Iron deficiency anemia is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide (1-3).

Children less than 5 years are the most affected(4).

 Almost 24% of Mexican children 1-4 years of age are anemic and 52% iron deficient (5).

 The peak prevalence of anemia (38%) occurs in children 12-23 months of age (6).

 The prevalence is higher in low socioeconomic households (29 %) but remains high even in the highest quintile (17%).

 Anemia and iron deficiency in infants and young children are associated with adverse effects on neurodevelopment (7-12).

 During several decades, the Mexican government has sold whole milk at subsidized prices to low income households with children 1-11 y of age through a federal program (Liconsa).

 In 2000 a decision was made to fortify the subsidized milk with iron, vitamin C and other micronutrients to contribute to the reduction of IDA and other micronutrient deficiencies.

 At that time, 4.

2 million children 1-11 y old from low income families were beneficiaries of the program.

 There are very few examples of large scale public health interventions using iron fortified whole milk.

 The effectiveness of interventions such as food fortification for reducing anemia and iron deficiency is often questioned (14) and little information is available on the effectiveness of these strategies implemented through large scale programs.

 Reliable evidence of the effectiveness of these strategies applied in large-scale programs is needed for planning interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of iron and zinc deficiencies and anemia in children.

This study aims to document the effectiveness on iron and zinc deficiencies,anemia and stunting, in young children of a large-scale program that distributes iron and zinc fortified milk to low income households at subsidized prices.

 Methods The subsidized milk distribution program.

 The program was created in 1944 and is operated by a public organization (Liconsa)(15).

 It distributes whole milk at subsidized prices to families living in poverty.

 The milk distributed is intended mostly for children 1-11 y.

 It is distributed in milk distribution centers throughout the Country as dry powder in 240 g sachets which yield two liters of fluid milk after hydration or as a 1 L container of fluid milk.

 Children receive the equivalent of 400 mL of fluid milk per day either in dry or fluid form for reducing the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia and other micronutrient deficiencies, through the fortification of the product with iron, zinc, vitamin C and micronutrients that were deficient in the diet of low income children in Mexico (5, 16).

 The program serves approximately 5 million individuals of which about 4.

2 million are children 9.

 Venous blood samples were drawn from children at baseline and 6 and 12 mo after.

 Samples were centrifuged and serum was stored in color coded cryovials kept in liquid nitrogen until delivery to a central laboratory.

 Commercial kits were used to measure the SF concentrations, (Dade Behring Inc, Newark, DE 19714, U.

) and sTfR (Dade Behring, Maburg, Germany) by ELISA.

 C reactive protein (CPR) was determined by nephelometry, using monoclonal antibodies (Behring Nephelometer 100 Analyzer, Behring Laboratories, Messer Grisheim Gmbh,Frankfurt, Germany.

 Serun zinc concentrations were mesured by Atomic Absorption spectrometry by a Analyst 300 model with graphite furnace(Perkin Elmer).

 Length and weight were measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 mo after enrollment.

 Weight was measured to the nearest 10 g using an electronic scale (Tanita, Model 1583, Tokyo, Japan).

 Length was measured to the nearest millimeter using a locally made measuring board in children 6 mg/L.

 SF indicates the level of storage iron and sTfR reflects tissue iron deficiency.

 Zinc deficiency was defined as by the IZnCG ( 0.

5 were maintained in the model.

 The variables included in the factor were: flooring material, ceiling material, availability of piped water,sanitary service, possession of refrigerator and washing machine as well as the number of electric appliances in the household: radio, TV, video player,telephone, and computer.

 The resulting standardized factor scores were divided into tertiles which were further used to construct SES status categories.

 Statistical methods.

 Characteristics of study children at baseline and at 5 and 12 months and the socioeconomic status of their families were compared between intervention groups using t-test on continuous variables and Ji2 for categorical variables (24).

 Distributions which were not normal were transformed and were compared using t-test.

 When adequate transformations were not achieved, the Wilcoxon Rank-sum test was employed (24.

 Intervention effects at 6 and 12 moths were assessed using General Linear Mixed Models with three repeated measures (25).

 Dependent variables were the prevalences of anemia or iron deficiency by either SF or sTfR.

 The interaction term between intervention and indicator variables for 6 and 12 months were used as the measure of effects at 6 and 12 months adjusting for baseline measurements.

 All models were adjusted for cluster effects (Milk Distribution Centers) and covariates.

 Adjusted probabilities were obtained to illustrate effects in graphic form26.

 Main effects were considered statistically significant at p values < 0.

 Effectiveness of Iron-Fortified Milk on Iron Status and Anemia in Young Children in Mexico@highlight

Iron deficiency and anemia in infants and young children impair neurodevelopment.

 Efficacious interventions for reducing the prevalences of iron deficiency and anemia, under controlled conditions, are available.

 However, little information is published about the effectiveness of large-scale programs.

 Objective.

 Assess the effectiveness on iron deficiency and anemia in young children of a large-scale program that provides iron fortified milk at a subsidized price to low income households.

 Design, Setting, and Sampling.

 A randomized effectiveness study in 12 milk distribution clusters randomly selected from 542 clusters in 4 States in Mexico.

 Selected clusters were randomly assigned to receive iron-fortified milk FM, N=7) or non-fortified milk (NFM, N=5).

 Over 95% program beneficiaries with children 12-30 mo of age in the 12 clusters (490 in FM and 275 in NFM) were enrolled in the FM and NFM interventions and participated in a baseline survey.

 635 children (405 in FM and 230 in NFM) and 584 children (371 in FM and 213 in NFM) completed the 6 and 12-mo follow-up surveys, respectively.

 Intervention: A daily portion of FM contained 5.

28 mg of iron, 48 mg of sodium ascorbate and other added micronutrients.

 The FM and NFM were distributed to beneficiaries at a subsidized price in Milk Distribution Centers in the 12 clusters.

 Main outcome measures: Mild-to-moderate anemia (Hb: 90-109 g/L), mild anemia (Hb: 100-109 g/L), moderate anemia (Hb: 90-99 g/L),iron deficiency: Serum Ferritin (SF) 6 mg/L.

Serum Zinc deficiency (< 65ug/dL), and stunting (<2SD Height/Age.

 Intervention effects at 6 and 12 moths were assessed using General Linear Mixed Models with three repeated measures.
