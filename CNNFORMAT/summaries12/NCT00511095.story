(secondQuint)Open-Label Study of the Safety and Immunogenicity of HEPLISAV Hepatitis B Virus Vaccine.

 Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global health problem.

 Worldwide, it is estimated that 2 billion people have been infected previously and 350 million are chronically infected.

 While acute HBV infection is associated with significant illness, the risk of chronic infection is of great importance since 5-10% of infected adults will not clear the infection after the initial phase of the illness.

 About 25% of people who do not initially clear the infection will later develop chronic active hepatitis.

 This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two injections of HEPLISAV cent in subjects 11 to 55 years old.

 About 200 subjects will be included in the study.

 Once subjects have been consented and screened, they will receive a total of two injections over a 28-day period, with follow-up visits at 8, 12 and 28 weeks.

 Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by occurrence of adverse events, periodic laboratory tests, vital signs, and local/systemic reactogenicity.

 Comparison: This study does not include a control treatment; all subjects will receive treatment with HEPLISAV cent .

 Open-Label Study of the Safety and Immunogenicity of HEPLISAV Hepatitis B Virus Vaccine@highlight

The purpose of this study is to further evaluate the safety and seroprotective immune response of a new investigational hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine, HEPLISAV cent , in subjects 11-55 years old.

 The primary hypothesis is that HEPLISAV cent is well tolerated.
