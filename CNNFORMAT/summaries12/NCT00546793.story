(secondQuint)Ph I/II Study of Subcutaneously Administered Veltuzumab (hA20) in NHL and CLL.

 The first study of veltuzumab given IV weekly in NHL patients (IM-T-hA20-01) has shown excellent tolerability and even efficacy at weekly intravenous doses as low as 80-120 mg/m2 over 4 consecutive weeks.

 These clinical results confirm experiments laboratory studies.

 Laboratory studies using Veltuzumab administered subcutaneously showed potent activity based on B-cell depletion.

 The current study's goal is to determine if a subcutaneous (SC) dosing schedule of veltuzumab can be established in patients with NHL or CLL.
