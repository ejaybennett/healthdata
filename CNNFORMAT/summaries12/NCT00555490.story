(secondQuint)Long-Term Effect of Soy Consumption on Cardio-Renal Indices and CRP in Type 2diabetes With Nephropathy.

 Background: Several short-term trials on the effect of soy consumption on cardiovascular risks are available, but little evidence exists regarding the impact of long-term soy protein consumption among type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy.

 Objectives: To determine the effects of long-term soy consumption on cardiovascular risks, C-reactive protein and kidney-function indices among type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy.

 Design: This longitudinal randomized clinical trial was conducted among 41 type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy (18 men and 23 women).

 Twenty patients in soy protein group consumed a diet containing 0.

8 g protein/kg body weight (35% animal proteins, 35% textured soy protein, and 30% vegetable proteins) and 21 patients in control group consumed a similar diet containing 70% animal proteins and 30% vegetable proteins for 4-years.

we conducted a longitudinal 4-year clinical trial to determine the long-term effects of soy consumption on lipid profiles, renal-function indices and CRP level among type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy.
