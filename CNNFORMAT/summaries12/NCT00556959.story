(secondQuint)Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of CLONICEL to Treat Children and Adolescents With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

 Clonidine is a centrally acting alpha2 adrenergic agonist that has been used effectively since the early 70s to treat mild to moderate hypertension.

 In addition to hypertension, clonidine has been evaluated and used extensively for several other indications, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

 An easy to administer clonidine formulation is needed that retains the efficacy of the current oral formulation but has an improved safety profile.

 The current trial will investigate the safety and efficacy of clonidine delivered from the sustained release formulation of CLONICEL in the treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD.
