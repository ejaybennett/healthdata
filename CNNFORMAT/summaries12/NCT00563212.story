(fifthQuint)A Pilot Study of Aerosol Interferon-gamma for Treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.

 Patients with mild-to-moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) will be enrolled in a phase I study of aerosol interferon-gamma (IFN-).

 Prior to initiation of treatment, patients will undergo CT of the chest, pulmonary function testing, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.

 They will also undergo a lung deposition study to determine the lung dose of IFN- that will be delivered with each treatment.

 Patients will then receive aerosol IFN- 100mcg delivered three times weekly via nebulizer for one year.

 Study patients will be followed monthly to monitor potential side effects, vital signs, and progression of IPF symptoms.

 Labs will be drawn at regular intervals to monitor for side effects and to measure cytokine levels.

 Bronchoscopy will be performed at the 6 and/or 12 month visit to compare cytokine levels pre-, during, and post-treatment.

 A Pilot Study of Aerosol Interferon-gamma for Treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis@highlight

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease for which there is no effective treatment.

 Interferon-gamma is a medication that has been used for other lung diseases to decrease scarring and fibrosis.

 Studies of interferon-gamma injected under the skin did not show any improvement in survival in patients with IPF.

 We hypothesize that giving interferon-gamma as a nebulized mist directly into the lungs can affect the immune system in a way that decreases fibrosis.
