(secondQuint)Energy Specific Far Infrared Radiation Treatment for AIDS.

 Acquired immune deficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS or Aids) is a collection of symptoms and infections resulting from the specific damage to the immune system caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in humans.

 The late stage of the condition leaves individuals prone to opportunistic infections and tumors.

 Although treatments for AIDS and HIV exist to slow the virus' progression, there is no known cure.

 The investigators are postulating that energy specific electromagnetic radiation of the central nervous system, the viscera and the endocrine system has the potential to enhance the immune system; thereby enhancing the production of CD4+ T cells and other killer cells to fight and destroy the human immunodeficiency virus.

 The primary end point is to determine the therapeutic effects of far infrared radiation (51/2m to 201/2m wavelength) on HIV/AIDS.
