 RUSSE / Russian Spiriva Safety & Efficacy Study@highlight

At the moment, there is hardly any structured safety and efficacy data collection on Tiotropium in Russia.

 Therefore, the objective of this observational study is to collect and evaluate data on bronchodilator efficacy and safety of Spiriva(R) (18 mu g tiotropium inhalation capsules) delivered by HandiHaler(R), in a national sample of Russian patients with varying severities of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a real life setting over the 8 weeks.
