(fifthQuint)Ziprasidone in Pediatric Bipolar Disorder.

 This study will enroll approximately 60 children and adolescents aged 10-17 years who have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

 Their participation will last about 8 weeks (2 weeks of screening and 6 weeks of medication management) and enrollment will last for two years.

 After the screening period, all subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to either rapid or slow dose titration of ziprasidone.

 Subjects in the rapid titration group will reach their maximum dose of study drug over 2 weeks, subjects in the slow titration group over 4 weeks.

 The study doctor may deviate from the dosing schedule if clinically indicated.

 The primary data analysis of this pilot study will examine the effect of rapid- versus slow-dose titration of ziprasidone on manic symptoms.

 Ziprasidone in Pediatric Bipolar Disorder@highlight

This is a 6 week, open-label, blinded-rater, randomized, controlled, pilot study designed to determine the dosing, safety and efficacy of ziprasidone in the treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD).

 In this pilot study we are comparing the efficacy of rapid versus slow dose titration of ziprasidone in PBD.

 The investigators hypothesize that subjects on ziprasidone monotherapy will have a reduction in manic symptoms.

 Also, the investigators hypothesize that slower titration of ziprasidone will result in lesser side effects which will assist in medication compliance as measured by patient report and pill count.
