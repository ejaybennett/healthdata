(fifthQuint)Narrative Exposure Therapy Versus Group Interpersonal Psychotherapy.

 The 1994 genocide of Rwanda has left countless children orphaned.

 26 Rwandan orphans who fulfilled DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD were offered participation in a controlled treatment trial.

 A group adaptation of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT, n = 14) was compared to Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET, n = 12).

 Main outcome measures were symptoms of PTSD and depression assessed pre-treatment, 3 months after therapy (post-test) and 6 months after therapy (follow-up) using the CAPS, MINI and Hamilton Rating Scale.

 At post-test, participants in both treatment conditions showed reductions in posttraumatic stress symptoms and depression symptoms.

 At 6-month follow-up, NET proved to be more effective in the treatment of PTSD.

 Only 25% (n = 3) of NET-participants but 71% (n = 10) of the IPT-participants still fulfilled PTSD criteria at follow-up.

 Although there was a significant reduction in depression symptoms in both treatment groups from pre-test to follow-up, NET again proved to be more effective.

 This treatment-trial demonstrates that NET and group-IPT are suitable treatment modules even when most severe traumatic stress and difficult living conditions have led to chronic mental suffering.

 Narrative Exposure Therapy Versus Group Interpersonal Psychotherapy@highlight

The present study is a pragmatic trial that investigates the efficacy and usefulness of two treatment modules in a sample of Rwandan genocide orphans: Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) versus group-Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT).

 We used a half year baseline to measure the treatment-induced changes.

 We hypothesized that there would be a greater reduction in posttraumatic stress symptoms in the NET- than in the IPT-group and that IPT would be superior to NET in the reduction of depression symptoms.
