(fifthQuint)Screening for Familial Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Patients.

 You will be interviewed by a member of the study staff over the telephone.

 You will be asked about your awareness of screening tests for colorectal cancer, and your attitudes toward colorectal cancer screening.

 You also will also be asked about your family's past use of these screening tests, and how you discuss colorectal cancer risk and screening with your family and health care providers.

 Some demographic information also will be collected (such as your age or marital status).

 The questionnaire will take between 30 and 45 minutes to complete.

 Your answers to the questions and your personal information will be kept strictly confidential.

 This is an investigational study.

 Up to 325 colorectal cancer patients and their close relatives may take part in the study.

 Screening for Familial Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Patients@highlight

The goal of this psychosocial research study is to learn about the knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes that people have toward screening for colorectal cancer.

 Another goal is to study how families communicate about colorectal cancer risk and colorectal cancer screening, with each other and with health care providers.

 Objectives: 1.

 To evaluate psychosocial and external factors influencing colorectal cancer (CRC) patients' communication with their first-degree relatives (FDRs) about CRC risk and screening information.

 Using measures of knowledge, health beliefs and behavior, family closeness, openness and motivation to discuss CRC and screening, distress, provider support and background variables (sociodemographics, access to care, and medical history), we will conduct a cross-sectional study to evaluate factors influencing CRC patients' communication about CRC risk and screening information to their FDRs.

 2.

 To evaluate psychosocial and external factors associated with CRC screening behavior among first-degree relatives of CRC patients.

 Using measures of knowledge, health beliefs and behavior, family closeness and subjective norms, distress, provider interactions, benefits/barriers, and background variables (race/ethnicity, sociodemographics, access to care, and medical history), we will conduct a cross-sectional study of FDRs of CRC patients recruited under Aim 1 to evaluate factors associated with CRC screening behavior (specifically, colonoscopy adherence).
