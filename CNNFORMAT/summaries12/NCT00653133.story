(thirdQuint)Multicenter Continuous Peripheral Nerve Block Surveillance Study.

 Continuous peripheral nerve block techniques require the placement of catheters near target peripheral nerves.

 The placement of these catheters is guided by either ultrasound visualization, nerve stimulation or a combination of the two.

 This surveillance study was designed to look at the rates of catheter placement related complications with the two techniques.

This two tiered study is a multi-center, open label, surveillance study of the use of continuous nerve blocks with the ON-Q(R) C-bloc and either nerve stimulator or ultrasound guided continuous nerve block techniques.

 This study was developed to investigate specific aspects of complication rates related to continuous nerve block techniques in patients undergoing orthopedic surgical procedures.
