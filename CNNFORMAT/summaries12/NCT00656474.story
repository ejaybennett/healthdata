(firstQuint)Efficacy Study of GLYC-101 to Evaluate Outcomes After Post-laser Ablation.

 The proposed pilot-study will document feasibility, safety and efficacy of topically applied Glucoprime gel (GLYC-101 gel 1.

0 %) in promoting wound healing in healthy volunteer subjects undergoing retro-auricular Carbon Dioxide Laser Skin Resurfacing (CO2 LSR).

 The study will observe the effects of the topical agent over the course of 1 month following the treatment.

 as a preparation for study GLYC-101-1b (Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 Pilot Study to investigate the safety and efficacy of 1.

0 % topically applied GLYC 101 compared to placebo, in patients undergoing Carbon Dioxide Laser Skin Resurfacing).
