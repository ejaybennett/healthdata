(secondQuint)Combined Pulsed Dye Laser and Topical Ranibizumab for Treatment of Port Wine Stain Birthmarks.

 Combined use of pulsed dye laser to induce port wine stain blood vessel injury, and ranibizumab to prevent port wine stain blood vessel angiogenesis and recanalization after laser therapy, will improve port wine stain lesion blanching.

 After pulsed dye laser treatment of the entire port wine stain, topical ranibizumab will be applied to two of the test sites for two weeks following pulsed dye laser therapy.

 The degree of port wine stain blanching which will be quantified objectively using visible reflectance spectroscopy measurements.

 port wine stain test site blanching responses following the combined use of pulsed dye laser and topical ranibizumab will be compared with pulsed dye laser only and with the baseline controls.

The purpose of this study is to improve port wine stain therapeutic outcome in response to laser therapy.

 The researcher want to determine whether the combined use of pulsed dye laser therapy and topical ranibizumab will improve port wine stain therapeutic outcome.
