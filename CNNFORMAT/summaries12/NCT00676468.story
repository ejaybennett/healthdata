(secondQuint)Comparative Effects of Fish Oil Supplementation and a Montelukast on EIB and Airway Inflammation in Asthma.

 The aim of this study is to extend previous published findings that fish oil supplementation represents a beneficial treatment on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).

 An important question is how dietary fish oil supplementation fits in with the available armamentarium [e.

g.

, leukotriene (LT) modifiers] to decrease the expression of LTs, and whether fish oil supplementation may be additive, or used in its own right to block the EIB response.

 For example, it is possible that a combination of fish oil supplementation and a cyst LT1 receptor antagonist (LTRA) may provide a greater antiinflammatory effect against developing EIB that either agent alone.

Combining fish oil supplementation and Montelukast [a commonly used cyst LT1 receptor antagonist to treat exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB)] will provide a greater antiinflammatory effect against developing EIB that either agent alone
