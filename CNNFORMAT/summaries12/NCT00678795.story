(firstQuint)A Parallel Group Study to Compare Sativex With Placebo in the Treatment of Detrusor Overactivity in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis.

 This is a ten week, multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy of Sativex(R) on urge incontinence associated with neurogenic unstable bladder.

 Multiple sclerosis patients with incontinence symptoms are screened to determine eligibility and complete a two-week baseline period.

 They then return for a further eligibility check, randomisation and initial dosing.

 Subjects titrate and self-medicate with study medication between study visits at weeks two and five.

 They will also complete efficacy assessments in their diary-books and at visits.
