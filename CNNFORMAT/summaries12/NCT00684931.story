(secondQuint)Cerebellar Loops and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

 ADHD is a neurodevelopmental trouble characterized by attentional deficits, impulsivity and motor hyperactivity.

 Morphological neuroimaging studies in ADHD children have revealed cerebellar abnormalities, however data in adults regarding cerebellum alterations are scarce.

 In this study we will analyse the conectivity of the cerebellum of adults ADHD patients.

 We will use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique, and morphological data will be compared with the neuropsychological status.

 Cerebellar Loops and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)@highlight

The aim of this study is to investigate the integrity of connectivity between the neocortex and the cerebellum in the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

 Fibers integrity will be measured using magnetic Resonance Imaging Techniques.
