(fifthQuint)Fulvestrant With or Without Lapatinib and/or Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Progressed After Previous Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To compare the progression-free survival of postmenopausal women with progressive metastatic breast cancer treated with fulvestrant with or without lapatinib tosylate and/or aromatase inhibitor therapy.

 Secondary - To compare time to progression in these patients.

 - To compare overall survival of these patients.

 - To compare response rates in these patients.

 - To compare clinical benefit rates in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to timing of progressive disease (during adjuvant therapy vs > 12 months after completion of adjuvant therapy vs during treatment for metastatic disease).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on days 0, 14, and 28 of course 1 and on day 1 of all subsequent courses.

 Patients also receive oral placebo once daily on days 1-28.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 - Arm II: Patients receive fulvestrant and placebo as in arm I.

 Patients also receive aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy (e.

g.

, exemestane, anastrozole, or letrozole) according to standard treatment regulations.

 - Arm III: Patients receive fulvestrant as in arm I and oral lapatinib tosylate once daily on days 1-28.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 - Arm IV: Patients receive fulvestrant as in arm I and lapatinib as in arm III.

 Patients also receive AI therapy according to standard treatment regulations.

 Fulvestrant With or Without Lapatinib and/or Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Progressed After Previous Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy@highlight

RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells.

 Hormone therapy using fulvestrant and exemestane, anastrozole, or letrozole may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells and by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes.

 Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 It is not yet known whether fulvestrant is more effective with or without lapatinib and/or aromatase inhibitor therapy in treating breast cancer.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying fulvestrant with or without lapatinib and/or aromatase inhibitor therapy to compare how well they work in treating postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer that progressed after previous aromatase inhibitor therapy.
