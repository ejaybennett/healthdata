(thirdQuint)Bortezomib (PS-341) in Combination With Carboplatin and Docetaxel for Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 A chemotherapy efficacy plateau' has been reached for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

 Platinum-based two-drug combination is considered the current standard of care for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.

 There is a need to develop novel regimens to improve the outcome for patients with advanced NSCLC.

 The combination of carboplatin and docetaxel is effective for therapy of advanced NSCLC.

 This combination results in improved survival and quality of life for patients with advanced NSCLC.

 Docetaxel exhibits preclinical synergy with bortezomib.

 Hence we plan to perform a phase I/II study to define the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib that can be administered in combination with docetaxel and carboplatin and subsequently evaluate the efficacy of the regimen for patients with advanced NSCLC.

This is a phase I/II study.

 The phase I portion of the study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when administered in combination with carboplatin & docetaxel and to determine the efficacy of the combination for patients with advanced NSCLC.

 Phase II will determine time to progression and overall survival and determine changes in serum proteomics patterns before & after combination therapy.
