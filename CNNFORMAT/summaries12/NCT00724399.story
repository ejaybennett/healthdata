(firstQuint)Preventive Health Practices in Women.

 Increasingly, gender differences in manifestation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial infarction (MI) are being reported.

 Gender specific presentations of MI in particular have contributed to underdiagnosis of cardiac events in women.

 Furthermore, previous studies from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factors Screening Surveillance demonstrated decreased compliance with standard cardiovascular health practices in women compared to men.

 We seek to validate these findings in a population of women undergoing screening mammography and annual gynecology visit to identify current state of knowledge regarding cardiovascular risk in women.
