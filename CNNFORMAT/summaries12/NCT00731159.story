(firstQuint)Sperm Capacitation Assay as a Tool to Predict Sperm Potential to Fertilize in IVF Treatment.

 Capacitation is a physiologic process in which the sperm acquire the potential to fertilize oocytes.

 Capacitation can be measured, but the available technics are expensive, inaccurate and complex.

 A new method to evaluate sperm capacitation was developed in Bar Ilan University, Israel.

 We intend to measure the capacitation of semen that is used for fertilizing human oocytes in patients treated at the IVF unit at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center.

By this, to evaluate the potential of the new method to predict human oocyte fertilization.

If the method will be found valuable, it will enable to develop new drugs/methods that may improve sperm capacitation and by this to improve oocyte fertilization leading to more embryos, pregnancies and deliveries.
