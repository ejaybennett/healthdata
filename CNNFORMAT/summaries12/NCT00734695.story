(secondQuint)Comparing the Use of Vitamin c (Ascorbic Acid) in Eye Burn in Subconjunctival Injection to Topical or Oral Treatment.

.

 In order to prevent permanent and severe damage to the eye after eye burn early treatment is mandatory.

 It is well known and published that the use of Vitamin c may contribute to the healing process of such burns, including burns from chemicals or heat.

 We believe that the route pf administration of the medicine is as important as the kind of medicine and that subconjunctival injection will have better effect and will influence in a favorable manner on the the end result as well as on the time of the healing.

 In order to be able to compare between cases we made a new definition of the severity of the burn according to the extension of the damage on the cornea, conjunctiva and limbus, and according to the severity and depth of the ischemia.

 In 3 medical centers 3 protocols of treatment and followup will be compared while only in Baruch Pade Medical Center the main route of administration will be subconjunctival on top of the topical treatment.
