(firstQuint)Quality of Life After Routine Nasogastric Decompression After Distal Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer Patients.

 Nasogastric decompression tube is an intra-operative routine in most of the time to facilitate exposure of operative field during elective distal gastrectomy, however, whether it should be retained post-operatively is controversial.

 Nasogastric decompression tube helps to drain the gastric remnant in case there is edema around the gastrojejunostomy, ileus and delayed gastric emptying, which can theoretically relieve nausea and abdominal distension.

 However, nasogastric intubation could cause patients discomfort; also it has been shown that it would cause gastroesophageal reflux which may be associated with pulmonary complication.

The aim of the study is to evaluate whether distal gastrectomy without post-operative nasogastric decompression tube is better in terms of quality of life.
