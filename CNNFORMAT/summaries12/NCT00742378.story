(secondQuint)Discriminating Ability of the Cirrus High Definition (HD) Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) for Glaucoma.

 The Cirrus HD OCT is a newly developed imaging device of the spectral domain optical coherence tomography.

 Even though its resolution and speed are much better than the previous OCT, its reproducibility and diagnostic power for detecting the glaucomatous defect of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) have not known yet.

 In the present study, we will review the data of RNFL thickness measurement using the Cirrus HD OCT.

 After assessing the inter-test variability, the discriminating ability of the Cirrus HD OCT for glaucoma diagnosis will be determined by the ROC curves.

 Discriminating Ability of the Cirrus High Definition (HD) Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) for Glaucoma@highlight

The Cirrus HD OCT, a new spectral domain optical coherence tomography, has better resolution than the previous OCT.

 Reproducibility and discriminating ability of the Cirrus HD OCT for glaucoma detection will be studied.
