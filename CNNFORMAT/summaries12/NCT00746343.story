(fifthQuint)Reducing Medical Risks in Individuals With Bipolar Disorder - Full Study.

 IRRI is aimed at improving sleep/wake and social rhythm disturbance and achieving modest weight reduction by increasing physical activity and improving nutrition and dietary habits, while at the same time providing optimal psychiatric care and medical monitoring.

 This will allow us to investigate the role that improvements in sleep/wake and social rhythm regularity, diet, and physical activity have in improving psychiatric and functional outcomes.

 In order to examine another set or possible pathways (i.

e.

, that it is the amelioration or psychiatric symptoms that leads to the improvements in physical health), we will contrast outcomes of subjects receiving IRRI with those of subjects receiving psychiatric care with medical monitoring (PCMM), which incorporates the same optimal psychiatric care plus monitoring of medical conditions.

 These aims will be achieved in a 24-month randomized treatment trial of 144 adult subjects with bipolar I disorder.

 Reducing Medical Risks in Individuals With Bipolar Disorder - Full Study@highlight

The primary aim of this project is to understand whether it is possible to reduce medical risk factors in adults with bipolar disorder and, in doing so, to improve psychiatric and functional outcomes.

 We will examine the role of behavioral risk factors and presumed behavioral mediators and moderators of health risk in individuals suffering from bipolar I disorder.

 The investigators will employ an innovative behavioral intervention with guideline based psychiatric care ( Integrated Risk Reduction Intervention - IRRI) in order to target modifiable medical risk factors.
