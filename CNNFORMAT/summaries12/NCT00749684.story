(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety of High-dose Interferon Alfa-2b (Intron A) for the Adjuvant Treatment of Malignant Melanoma (Study P04083).

 Observational study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy (vs historical controls) of a high-dose therapy scheme with interferon--2b (IntronA(R)): Adjuvant treatment with interferon--2 has been demonstrated in a number of studies to have an antiproliferative effect on malignant melanoma.

 In these cases a response rate of up to 20% could be achieved with a dose of 10 million IU or more 3x/week or daily.

 Kirkwood et al.

 showed in a study carried out in ECOG (the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, study no.

 1684) that there was a clear and significant survival advantage versus the observation group with the following dose: 20 mio IU/m interferon--2b (IntronA(R)) 5x/week iv over the course of one month followed by 11 months with 10 mio IU/m 3x/week sc.

 Efficacy and Safety of High-dose Interferon Alfa-2b (Intron A) for the Adjuvant Treatment of Malignant Melanoma (Study P04083)@highlight

The aim of this observational study is to document the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose interferon therapy in adult participants with malignant melanoma at high risk of relapse and to compare them with the survival times and relapse rates in previous studies (historical control).
