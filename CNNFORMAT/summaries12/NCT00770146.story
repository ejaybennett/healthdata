(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Mipomersen (ISIS 301012) As Add-on Therapy in High Risk Hypercholesterolemic Patients.

 Hypercholesterolemia is characterized by markedly elevated low density lipoproteins (LDL).

 Elevated LDL is a major risk factor for CHD.

 Mipomersen is an antisense drug that reduces a protein in the liver cells called apolipoprotein B (apo-B).

 Apo-B plays a role in producing low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (the "bad" cholesterol) and moving it from the liver to one's bloodstream.

 High LDL-C is an independent risk factor for the development of CHD or other diseases of blood vessels.

 It has been shown that lowering LDL-C reduces the risk of heart attacks and other major adverse cardiovascular events.

 The purpose of this study is to determine whether mipomersen safely and effectively lowers LDL-C in patients with high cholesterol who are at high risk for CHD and who are already on the maximally tolerated dose of statin.

 This study consisted of a 26-week treatment period and a 24-week post-treatment follow-up period.

 Participants who finished treatment or who discontinued prematurely from the study for any reason were assessed for safety for 24 weeks after the last study drug dose.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dosing with mipomersen for 26 weeks in patients with high cholesterol who are on a maximally tolerated dose of statin and who have a diagnosis that puts them at least at high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).
