(secondQuint)Efficacy of Prostate Seed Implantation for Local Control of Early Stage Prostate Cancer.

 Charts of early stage prostate cancer patients receiving prostate seed implants with or without external beam radiotherapy and/or hormonal therapy will be reviewed and abstracted.

 The abstracted data will include pathology reports including Gleason score and T stage, PSA, treatment assignment and dosimetry parameters including dose and percent compliant with established criteria based on guidelines established by the American Brachytherapy Society.

 A database will be developed for capture of the abstracted data.

 Outcomes will be determined based on PSA levels at 2 and 5 years after prostate seed implantation.

 The role of hormonal therapy with prostate seed implantation and outcomes will be evaluated.

 The outcomes will be compared to national statistics.
