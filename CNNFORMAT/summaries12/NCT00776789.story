 Effect of Early Skin to Skin Contact on Breast Feeding Behaviour in Term Newborns: A Randomized Controlled Trial@highlight

Aims and Objectives Aim To determine the effect of delivery room Skin To Skin contact on breast feeding behavior of term neonates born by normal vaginal delivery at 36-48 hours.

 Objectives Primary objective To determine the effect of delivery room Skin To Skin contact on breast feeding behaviour of term neonates born by normal vaginal delivery, between 36-48 hours (as measured by Infant Breast Feeding Score) by video recording using a randomized controlled design.

 Secondary objectives To determine the effect of delivery room Skin to Skin contact on 1.

 Salivary cortisol at 6 hours as measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) 2.

 Weight at 48 hours as measured by digital infant weighing scale.

 3.

 Maternal perception of breast milk output, breast consistency, infant's feeding and activity at 36-48 hours as measured by a score graded as very satisfied, satisfied, acceptable and not satisfied.

 4.

 Number and duration of feeding sessions till 48 hrs according to the mother as assessed at 48 hours 5.

 Breast feeding rates at 6 weeks measured at the time of vaccination at the time of visit to the hospital for the same or as asked by telephonic conversation.

 Hypothesis Infants receiving skin to skin contact when compared with neonates not receiving it, demonstrate better breast feeding behaviour.
