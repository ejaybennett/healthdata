(fifthQuint)The Effect of Probiotics on Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.

 Probiotics may interfere with the development of NASH by several mechanisms.

 Data from an uncontrolled clinical trial in NASH patients show promising results, with improvement of liver enzymes in treated patients.

 RESEARCH GOALS: A.

 To assess the degree of SIBO in NAFLD patients vs.

 healthy controls.

 B.

 To evaluate the effect of probiotics vs.

 placebo on SIBO in NAFLD patients.

 C.

 To evaluate the effect of probiotics vs.

 placebo on disease severity (inflammation, steatosis, and fibrosis) in NAFLD patients.

 The Effect of Probiotics on Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease@highlight

Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) has been suggested to be the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the general population in the Western World.

 In advanced stages of NAFLD, steatohepatitis (NASH) develops characterized by: steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis progressing to cirrhosis in some patients.

 The knowledge of the role of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in the pathogenesis of NASH has led to the proposal of probiotics as a therapeutic strategy for this disorder.
