(secondQuint)Antero-posterior Versus Antero-lateral Electrode Position for Electrical Cardioversion of Typical Atrial Flutter.

 Typical atrial flutter is the second-most prevalent atrial tachyarrhythmia.

 No guidelines for treatment exist and few studies investigate treatment of atrial flutter.

 Mostly, guidelines for atrial fibrillation are followed for treatment of atrial flutter.

 Atrial flutter has a different pathomechanism as atrial fibrillation, therefore special guidelines for treatment are needed.

 Among drug treatment and ablation procedures, external electrical cardioversion is commonly used, especially for treatment of acute symptomatic patients.

 This study may help to further define safe and successful procedures for electrical cardioversion of atrial flutter.

 Antero-posterior Versus Antero-lateral Electrode Position for Electrical Cardioversion of Typical Atrial Flutter@highlight

The aim of this study is to identify the one electrode position out of two most commonly used for external electrical cardioversion of typical atrial flutter, which needs less delivered energy and less needed number of shocks for successful cardioversion.
