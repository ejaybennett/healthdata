(thirdQuint)Assessment of Molecular Remission by ASO-qPCR After Bortezomib-dexamethasone (Vel/Dex) Followed by ASCT.

 HDT-ASCT is so far considered the standard of care for younger patients with multiple myeloma (MM).

 Current evidence indicates that quality of response is an important prognostic factor for long-term survival in MM.

 There are only very few data on molecular remissions (MolR) determined by the most sensitive technique, allele-specific-oligonucleotide - real-time quantitative - polymerase chain reaction (ASO-RQ-PCR) in MM, and there are no data available on molecular responses after bortezomib-based induction therapy followed by HDT-ASCT.

 The main aim of this study is to determine molecular response rate after ASCT following bortezomib-based induction treatment compared to a historical control group with conventional VAD induction treatment.

 A sensitivity of ASO-RQ-PCR technique will be compared to immunofixation and with immunophenotyping by flow cytometry.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the rate of molecular remissions (MolR) assessed by ASO-RQ-PCR technique after induction treatment with bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vel/Dex) prior to high-dose therapy with melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT-ASCT), and after HDT-ASCT in patients with multiple myeloma.
