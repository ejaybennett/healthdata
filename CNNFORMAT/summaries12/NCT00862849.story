(fifthQuint)Pharmacokinetic and Glucodynamic Crossover Study of Subcutaneously (SC) Administered Insulin Lispro + Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) and Regular Human Insulin + rHuPH20 Compared to Insulin Lispro Alone.

 The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, breakdown and elimination) of regular human insulin + recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) versus insulin lispro alone, and to compare the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro + rHuPH20 versus insulin lispro alone.

 The effects of regular human insulin + rHuPH20, insulin lispro + rHuPH20, and insulin lispro alone on the body will be evaluated by blood glucose measurements and by calculating the rate at which a glucose solution is infused to maintain blood glucose within a certain range.

 The safety and tolerability of insulin lispro with and without rHuPH20 and regular human insulin with rHuPH20 will be studied.

 The study drugs will be administered by subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.

 Pharmacokinetic and Glucodynamic Crossover Study of Subcutaneously (SC) Administered Insulin Lispro + Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) and Regular Human Insulin + rHuPH20 Compared to Insulin Lispro Alone@highlight

Insulin lispro and regular human insulin are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.

 Recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) is approved by the FDA as an aid to the absorption and dispersion of other injectable drugs.

 In this study, rHuPH20 will be co-administered with both insulin lispro and regular human insulin in order to determine if it improves the absorption of these insulins to more closely mimic the body's natural increase in insulin in response to a meal.
