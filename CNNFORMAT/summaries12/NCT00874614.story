(fifthQuint)A Study Evaluating Ultratrace Iobenguane I131 in Patients With Malignant Relapsed/Refractory Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma.

 AZEDRA(R) (Iobenguane I 131) is a very high-specific-activity iobenguane I 131, produced using proprietary Ultratrace(R) platform.

 Based on the well-characterized cellular active transport mechanism, the high specific activity of allows for effective cellular uptake of radioactivity and hence greater tumor uptake.

 During this study the subjects will receive two (2) Therapy Doses that are given approximately three (3) months apart.

 Prior to administration of the first Therapy Dose, subjects will be given an Imaging Dose of AZEDRA(R) and will undergo iobenguane I 131 scans to evaluate tumor uptake and to measure normal organ distribution and allow for the calculation of radiation dose to normal organs.

 Screening procedures for eligibility will need to be done before imaging or therapeutic doses of AZEDRA(R) are administered.

 Hospitalization is required for approximately one (1) week after each of the two (2) Therapeutic Doses.

 Frequent follow up is necessary for the first year and some of the follow up visits may be done by a visiting health care professional in the subjects' homes.

 Subjects will be followed in the treatment study for one (1) year and for an additional four (4) years in long-term follow up.

 A Study Evaluating Ultratrace Iobenguane I131 in Patients With Malignant Relapsed/Refractory Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma@highlight

This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the effectiveness and collect additional safety information on AZEDRA(R) (iobenguane I 131) for the treatment of metastatic or relapsed/refractory (to other treatment) or unresectable pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.

 The purpose of this trial is to test the use of AZEDRA(R) as a treatment for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, a rare disease.

 This Phase II study will help determine primarily if using the drug reduces the amount of blood pressure medication being taken as a result of the cancer and secondarily to determine such things as the effectiveness of the study drug in treating the cancer, additional safety measures, and to assess if the drug helps the quality of life and use of pain medication.

 All subjects will receive an imaging dose with scans followed by two therapeutic doses given approximately 3 months apart.
