(thirdQuint)The Use of Autologous Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Articular Cartilage Defects.

 All procedures are carried out after obtaining informed written consent from patients.

 Bone marrow is aspirated from the iliac crest (hip bone) of patients with osteochondral defects intraoperatively under complete sterile, aseptic conditions and under proper anaesthesia (general, local).

 The bone marrow aspirate is placed in tubes and transferred under aseptic conditions to the Tissue Culture Unit in the Biochemistry Department at the Cairo University School of Medicine where it is processed and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are isolated and grown in culture for 2-3 weeks.

 After this time interval, the cells are reprocessed and the cell pellet is obtained.

 Implantation of the cell pellet into the osteochondral defect of the joint after embedding it on a proper scaffold is performed followed by subsequent defect coverage with an autologous periosteal flap obtained from the proximal tibia to seal the defect and maintain the cell pellet in place.

 The patients will be assessed clinically with scoring systems preoperatively as well as 6 and 12 months postoperatively to assess relief of symptoms and joint function.

 Radiological assessment (X-rays and MRIs)of the affected joints will be performed at the same time points aforementioned to assess integrity of the formed cartilage.

 Second look arthroscopy and biopsy will also be performed to histologically assess the repair tissue and grade it via arthroscopic grading system according to the International Cartilage Repair Society guidelines.

 The Use of Autologous Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Articular Cartilage Defects@highlight

This study is conducted to assess whether implanting autologous, culture-expanded, mesenchymal stem cells obtained from the bone marrow of patients with early osteoarthritis, cartilage defects or cartilage and underlying bone and cartilage (osteochondral) defects in joints is effective in the treatment of such conditions and alleviation of patients symptoms.
