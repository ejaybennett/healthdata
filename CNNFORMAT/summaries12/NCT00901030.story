(thirdQuint)Association Between Perioperative Platelet Function and Major Adverse Perioperative Events.

 Patients who have had stents in their coronary arteries (PCI) have to stay on antiplatelet agents to prevent clotting of their stents.

 These patients often require non-cardiac surgery (NCS) at some stage after their PCI.

 The rate of major cardiac complications (MACE)in this population is very high and it is unclear why they are at higher risk than the general population.

 It is possible their antiplatelet is not adequate, or that surgery causes them to be more clot prone.

 This is a prospective, multicentre observational study.

 Association Between Perioperative Platelet Function and Major Adverse Perioperative Events@highlight

This study will examine the degree of blood thinning (platelet function) in patients coming for non-cardiac surgery on antiplatelet agents using platelet function tests called thromboelastography (TEG) and platelet mapping assay (PMA) and major cardiac complications that occur any time after surgery (perioperative).
