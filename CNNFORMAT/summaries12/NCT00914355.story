(fifthQuint)Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) Hepatocellular Carcinoma (COLD 2).

 From July 2003 to May 2007, over 40 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma participated in two studies at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) designed to determine the safety of treating hepatocellular carcinoma with SBRT.

 These studies have shown that SBRT can be delivered safely to the majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

 The treated tumour was controlled (shrank or remained the same size) in 78% of patients at one year following treatment.

The median survival of patients was 11 months (i.

e.

 half of patients survived longer and half shorter than 11 months).

 This survival rate is better than that expected in patients treated with supportive care only (no treatment other than care to make you feel better).

 Supportive care patients have a median survival rate of 3-9 months.

 We expect that the benefits of SBRT in this study will be similar to those observed in our initial studies.

 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) Hepatocellular Carcinoma (COLD 2)@highlight

This study is designed to see whether stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) can reduce tumour size, slow progression of the disease, prolong life and improve quality of life of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, a cancer of the liver, that cannot be removed surgically (unresectable) and cannot be treated with ablative therapy (e.

g.

 radio-frequency ablation) or trans-arterial chemo-embolization (TACE) therapy (delivery of chemotherapy through an artery that feeds into the liver).

 SBRT is concentrated focused radiation therapy delivered very precisely to the liver tumour.

 It is hoped that knowledge obtained from this study will improve our ability to treat patients with liver tumours that cannot be treated with surgery and other methods, and that SBRT may prove to be a treatment that can lead to long-term and permanent control of liver tumours for some patients.
