(thirdQuint)Diagnosis and Characterization of Dengue Fever in Children.

 This is a biology protocol with no treatment regimen associated.

 Blood collection will be drawn from subjects in El Salvador to be tested in an effort to improve detection and test sensitivity and specificity of a dengue NS1 Ag ELISA, dengue NS1 Ag STRIP, and clinical suspicion for the detection of dengue virus infection in children in San Salvador, El Salvador compared to the gold standard, PCR.

 This protocol will also seek to identify and compare gene transcription patterns characteristics of each dengue virus disease phenotype in children.

 Diagnosis and Characterization of Dengue Fever in Children@highlight

Dengue virus is an arbovirus transmitted by mosquitoes which causes significant morbidity and mortality among children in tropical regions, especially in resource limited countries.

 The objective of this protocol is to compare the sensitivity and specificity of clinical gestalt and two rapid antigen tests for dengue virus and to compare the gene expression of leukocytes in distinct dengue fever disease phenotypes module-based RNA microarray technology.
