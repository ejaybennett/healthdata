(firstQuint)Study of Efficacy and Safety of 300 IR Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT) Tablets in Adult Patients With Allergic Grass Pollen Rhinoconjunctivitis.

 Allergy is one of the most common chronic disease in the world currently affecting between 10% and 25% of the general population.

 Allergies to pollens characteristically result in seasonal rhinitis symptoms and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is characterized by sneezing, congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal or palatal itching and itchy, watery, red and swollen eyes.

 Even if several drugs effectively manage allergic rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms, immunotherapy is considered more appropriate for patients in whom these symptoms are not optimally controlled with relief medications.

 In the study, each of the six rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, nasal congestion, itchy eyes, watery eyes) will be evaluated daily and relief medication intake (oral antihistamines, eye drop antihistamine, nasal corticosteroid, oral corticosteroid) reported daily during the grass pollen season.

 Efficacy and good safety profile of 300IR SLIT tablet administered once per day for approximately six months (starting 4 months before and over the season) will be demonstrated during the grass pollen season compared to placebo.
