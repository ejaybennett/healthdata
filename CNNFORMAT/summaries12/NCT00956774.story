(fifthQuint)Comparison of Three Cannulas for Hysterosalpingography.

 This study is a prospective, randomized trial of women undergoing HSG as part of their infertility evaluation.

 At the time of scheduling, the patient will be randomized to either the cervical vacuum cup, balloon catheter (H/S catheter set, UA Medical, Biotech America), or the acorn-tipped cannula using stratified blocked randomization.

 100 subjects will be randomized to one of the three cannulas.

 Patients will be stratified into 4 groups representative of the four reproductive endocrinologists in order to overcome any potential interoperator bias.

 Four reproductive endocrinologists will perform the HSG procedures in a standardized fashion.

 Fluoroscopy will ensure proper location of the cannula and check for uterine filling of contrast.

 Digital images will document tubal filling and spilling of contrast.

 The patient will be rolled to right and left side to confirm free spillage of contrast in the peritoneal cavity.

 The last image will be taken after the balloon tip is deflated or the cannulas are removed to best evaluate the lower uterine segment.

 Comparison of Three Cannulas for Hysterosalpingography@highlight

The aim of this study is to compare the three commonly used hysterosalpingography (HSG) injection devices on the basis of patient pain perception, total fluoroscopic and procedural time, and side effects in a prospective, randomized study.

 An important and novel secondary outcome is the comparison of the quality of images obtained with these three devices.

 The investigators hypothesize that the balloon catheter and cervical vacuum cup will be less painful than the acorn tipped cannula and that there will be no difference in image quality between the three groups.
