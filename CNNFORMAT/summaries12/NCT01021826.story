(firstQuint)Perioperative Hyperglycaemia in Primary Total Hip and Knee Replacement.

 Postoperative infections remain one of the most frequent reasons of failure of hip and knee prostheses.

 Diabetes increases the risk of infections.

 In other fields of surgery, hyperglycemia induced by surgical stress (stress/perioperative hyperglycemia) has been associated with higher rates of postoperative infections and complications.

 Such studies have not yet been performed in the field of joint replacement surgery.

 Unlike several other risk factors of infected joint replacements, hyperglycemia is potentially modifiable and therefore its prevalence, predisposing factors and association with postoperative infections are of interest.

 Perioperative Hyperglycaemia in Primary Total Hip and Knee Replacement@highlight

The purpose of this study is to analyze how common stress hyperglycaemia (abnormally high blood glucose) is in primary hip and knee replacement surgeries and which factors predispose to hyperglycaemia.
