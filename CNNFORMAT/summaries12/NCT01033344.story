(thirdQuint)Cat-PAD Exposure Chamber Study.

 This study is designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Cat-PAD in cat allergic subjects with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis,subjects may also have controlled asthma.

 The efficacy of Cat-PAD will be explored in subjects using an(Environmental Exposure Chamber)EEC.

 The study will consist of 3 study periods.

 In Period 1, Screening will be performed up to a maximum of 12 weeks before randomisation and may consist of one or two visits to the clinic, at the Investigator's discretion.

 Baseline Challenge will consist of 4 visits to the EEC at least 3 days before randomisation.

 In Period 2, subjects in each cohort complying with the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomised to one of three groups and will receive treatment every 2 weeks (2 days) for 14 weeks.

 In Period 3, Post Treatment Challenge will consist of 4 visits to the EEC 18-22 weeks after the first administration in the treatment period and assessments will be performed identical to those at the baseline challenge.

 Follow-up will be conducted 3-10 days after PTC.

 Cat-PAD Exposure Chamber Study@highlight

Cat allergy is an increasingly prevalent condition, affecting 10-15% of patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma.

 Cat-PAD is a novel, synthetic, allergen-derived peptide desensitising vaccine, currently being developed for the treatment of cat allergy.

 This study will look at the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two doses of Cat-PAD in cat allergic subjects following challenge to cat allergen in an EEC.
