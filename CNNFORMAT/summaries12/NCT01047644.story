(thirdQuint)Port Will be Flushed Every 3 Months Instead of Every 4-6 Wks, as Recommended by Port Manufacturer.

.

 This is a phase II, non-blinded, non-inferiority prospective cohort trial of patients with ports (PAC) after a systemic therapy to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PAC flushes in 3 months intervals.

 Patients with any type of cancer are eligible.

 The study will extend 1 year from enrollment of the last patient.

 Each enrolled patient will have his or her port flushed five times in 3 month intervals.

 Patients will be enrolled after the completion of systemic therapy and after completion of the restaging follow up, which is the time period from 4 weeks to 3 months after discontinuation of the chemotherapy.

 Once patients are enrolled to extended interval PAC flushes, they will be followed for one year.

 At the end of the year patients will return to standard PAC flushes.

 If patients experience any PAC malfunction, it would be considered a PAC failure and the flushing will reverted back to the schedule recommended by the manufacturer.

@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of port (PAC) flushes every 3 months rather than every four to six weeks.

 It is routine practice to flush ports every four to six weeks, according to the manufacturer's recommendations, using salt solution followed heparin if needed.

 This study examines the effectiveness of port flushes at an alternative interval of 3 months, reducing the number of visits to the health-care provider.
