(secondQuint)Reduction of Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infection With a Daily Nursing Review of the Indication.

 Healthcare-associated infection (HAI)in hospitalized patients are very frequent, especially the catheter-associated urinary tract infection, which prolongs the hospital stay and costs, and is about 3 times more likely to die during hospitalization than patients not infected.

 The measures of aseptic insertion and closed systems of collection, as well as the rational use of the probe reduce the risk for infection.

 A checklist that contains the agreed indications of catheter, related to obstruction, incontinence, skin lesions in sacral region, monitoring or surgical procedures allows the daily review of the indication of the probe.

 If the patient doesnt meet at least one of the criteria, should be recommended the withdrawal of the catheter.
