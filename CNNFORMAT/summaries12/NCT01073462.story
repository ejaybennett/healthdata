(thirdQuint)Study to Evaluate the Effect of Intravenous (IV) Paricalcitol (Zemplar) on Cardiac Morbidity in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 5 Over 2 Years.

 Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a frequent complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 receiving dialysis.

 SHPT is an adaptive response to CKD and is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) and consecutively high calcium levels.

 Elevations in calcium levels, phosphate levels, and PTH are correlated with CKD disease progression as well as development or aggravation of cardiovascular impairment.

 Many CKD patients cannot be treated well with Vitamin D analogues because of effects on calcium.

 Hypercalcemia is a well - known factor for cardiac disease.

 No data are available in Austria for a cohort with cardiac disease treated with Zemplar (paricalcitol IV).

 Study to Evaluate the Effect of Intravenous (IV) Paricalcitol (Zemplar) on Cardiac Morbidity in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 5 Over 2 Years@highlight

The purpose of this study was to ascertain the percentage of cardiac patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 treated with paricalcitol IV achieving intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels in target range of Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) treatment guidelines (150 - 300 pg/mL) after 2 years.
