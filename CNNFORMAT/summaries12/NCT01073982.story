(firstQuint)Efficacy of Tart Cherry Juice to Reduce Pain and Inflammation Among Patients With Inflammatory Osteoarthritis.

 Numerous antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents have been identified in tart cherries, and a study among healthy, non-exercising individuals demonstrated that cherry consumption decreased serum inflammatory biomarkers after 14 days.

 Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common syndrome affecting 65 million Americans characterized by pain, inflammation, and disability.

 Such natural anti-inflammatory effects of cherry consumption may be beneficial for the management and treatment of osteoarthritis and inflammatory diseases.

 The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study is to examine individuals with inflammatory OA and assess the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of tart cherry juice as compared to a placebo drink among twenty 30-70 y/o OA subjects.
