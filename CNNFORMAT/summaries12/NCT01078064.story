(thirdQuint)Gastric Accommodation and Gastroesophageal Reflux.

 Gastroesophageal reflux events happen during relaxations of lower esophageal sphincter not related to swallowing, called transient.

 These transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (tLESR) are generally triggered by gastric distension and its physiological purpose is to vent the stomach.

 The gastric accommodation is a physiological process in which the gastric fundus actively relaxes during a meal in order to accommodate it.

 This study is driven by the hypothesis that impairment of the gastric accommodation may facilitate triggering tLESR and, therefore, reflux events.

 We aim to evaluate the relation between gastric fundic relaxation and the number of gastroesophageal reflux events in children.

 We also aim to evaluate if there is a relation between the gastric emptying and the number of reflux episodes.

 Gastric Accommodation and Gastroesophageal Reflux@highlight

Gastroesophageal reflux events generally happen during relaxation of lower esophageal sphincter.

 This relaxation is a reflex that is triggered by gastric stimuli.

 The investigators hypothesize that abnormal relaxation of the gastric wall after a meal may lead to reflux events.

 To test this hypothesis, a study was designed to measure the gastric accommodation in patients undergoing esophageal impedance monitoring.
