(secondQuint)Study to Evaluate the Safety of a Single Escalating Dose of ACRX-100 in Adults With Ischemic Heart Failure.

 This open label, 16 subject, Phase 1 dose-escalation study will demonstrate the initial safety of using ACRX-100 to treat heart failure in subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

 Safety will be tracked at each dose by documenting all adverse events (AEs), with the primary safety endpoint being the number of major cardiac AEs at 30 days.

 In each cohort (n=4 in low dose, n=6 each in mid and high dose), subjects will receive a single dose of ACRX-100.

 Preliminary efficacy will be evaluated by measuring the impact on cardiac function via standard echocardiography measurements, cardiac perfusion via SPECT imaging, and improvement in NYHA classification.

 Study to Evaluate the Safety of a Single Escalating Dose of ACRX-100 in Adults With Ischemic Heart Failure@highlight

The purpose of this Phase 1 study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of single escalating doses of ACRX-100 delivered via endomyocardial injection in adults with ischemic heart failure.
