(thirdQuint)Boston Scientific Post Market S-ICD Registry.

 EFFORTLESS is an observational, post market, standard of care, Registry to be conducted at approximately 50 centers worldwide in patients requiring an ICD for the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

 Patients included in the registry will have been implanted with the S-ICD system since its CE mark (commercial regulatory approval) and will be followed for up to 60 months.

 The patients' perception of their therapy will be evaluated using Quality of Life assessments and the Registry will include an exploratory analysis of resource utilization and costs based on measures of clinical outcome such as complication rates, unscheduled hospitalizations and length of stay.

 The objective will be to enable comparison of costs of the S-ICD system versus a standard transvenous system.

 A Sub-Study will extend the EFFORTLESS S-ICD Registry in order to achieve an average of approximately 8 years of follow-up from index procedure.

 A subgroup of approximately 200 patients will be enrolled at a sub-set of EFFORTLESS sites.

 The data analysis will focus on long-term S-ICD system-related adverse events, S-ICD replacements and device longevity.
