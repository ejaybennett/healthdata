(secondQuint)Antihypertensive Medication Exposure as Risk for Impaired Glucose Tolerance: A PEAR Sub-Study.

 Beta-blockers and diuretics have a well-established role in treating hypertension and are frequently used first-line.

 However, it is increasingly evident that these medications have harmful metabolic effects.

 The Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses (PEAR - NCT00246519) study was a greater than 700 participant, randomized, parallel assignment trial, aimed at determining the genetic factors that influence response to both a beta-blocker (atenolol) and a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ]).

 The PEAR trial design includes evaluation at baseline, after monotherapy with either medication, and after combination therapy with both medications.

 This pilot, PEAR sub-study aims to characterize the ability of two diagnostics tests (fasting glucose versus glucose 2-hours after an OGTT) to detect prediabetes development prior to blood pressure medication use, after monotherapy (with atenolol or HCTZ) and after combination therapy (with atenolol and HCTZ).

The purpose of this study is to determine if, in a subset of patients treated with a beta-blocker and diuretic, prediabetes is detectable to a greater extent through a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) compared to fasting glucose measurement.
