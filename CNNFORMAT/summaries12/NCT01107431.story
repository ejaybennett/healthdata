(secondQuint)Effects of a Dietary Supplement Containing L-Arabinose and Trivalent Patented Food-source of Chromium on Blood Glucose and Insulin.

 This study concluded that consumption of the LA-Cr supplement in conjunction with a 70-gram sucrose challenge led to a significant reduction of capillary blood glucose and venous insulin as compared to the sucrose challenge without the LA-Cr supplement.

 This finding may provide an important tool to reduce the adverse effects associated with elevated glucose and insulin levels.
