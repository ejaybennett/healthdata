(firstQuint)Diacerein as Adjuvant to Diclofenac Sodium in Indian Patients of Osteoarthritis (OA) Knee.

 Currently symptomatic relief is provided by the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but they do not reverse the basic pathology of disease, rather may accelerate it, like degeneration of cartilage, inhibition of chondroitin synthesis and suppression of proteoglycans synthesis by the chondrocyte.

 Research shows that IL-1 plays a fundamental role in osteoarthritis pathophysiology and cartilage destruction.

 Diacerein, a purified compound with anthraquinonic structure, inhibits IL-1, retarding all pathological processes initiated in OA.

 Also, Diacerein has proven analgesic efficacy comparable to that of diclofenac in patients of osteoarthritis knee12.

 Because of these factors, the present study has been planned to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of diacerein as add on therapy to diclofenac sodium in Indian patients of symptomatic OA knee.
