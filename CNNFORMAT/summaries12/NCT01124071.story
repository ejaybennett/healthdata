(secondQuint)Korean Diet Efficacy Clinical Trial.

 The primary endpoint (Korean diet acceptability) will be assessed by reliability tested questionnaire, dietary compliance, and quantities of food returned over the 12 weeks.

 Analysis of differences in weight loss will be based on all participants with a baseline and a 12-week weight assessment.

 In order to investigate the impact of missing data, all subjects will be analysed using last weight observation carried forward and baseline weight carried forward.

 Other secondary endpoints will determine the effect of the Korean diet on blood pressure, metabolic parameters and chronic metabolic disease control in the Australian population.
