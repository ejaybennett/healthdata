(secondQuint)Oral Bioavailability of Bilastine.

 Single centre, open label, cross-over, randomised, controlled, single dose study.

 The primary endpoint is the determination of plasma concentrations versus time (17 samples per subject at various time intervals after dosing) in order to assess the oral bioavailability of bilastine in healthy volunteers.

 Therefore the primary pharmacokinetic variable will be the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-).

 Additionally the following pharmacokinetic variables will also be assessed: Cmax, AUC 0-t, tmax, Ae, Clr, t1/2.

 Additional objectives are to describe the safety and tolerability of a single administration of oral and endovenous bilastine in healthy volunteers.

 Twelve healthy volunteers will be included.

 Each volunteer will take in random order one single dose of 20 mg oral bilastine and 10 mg IV bilastine with a minimum washout period of 14 days between them.

 Bilastine plasma concentrations will be measured using a liquid chromatography/mass mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) micro method.

 Oral Bioavailability of Bilastine@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess the absolute bioavailability of an oral bilastine formulation (test drug) compared to the endovenous administration of an IV bilastine formulation (control drug) in healthy volunteers.
