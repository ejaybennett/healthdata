(fifthQuint)Bioavailability Study of Colcrys Crushed and Sprinkled on Applesauce.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the relative bioavailability of a single 0.

6 mg tablet of Colcrys(R) (colchicine, USP) when crushed and sprinkled on applesauce (1 tablespoon) relative to the same dose given as an intact tablet to healthy subjects following an overnight fast.

 Sixteen healthy, non-smoking, non-obese, male and female volunteers between 18-55 years of age will be randomly assigned in a crossover fashion to receive each of two dosing regimens in sequence with a 14 day washout period between dosing periods.

 In each of the dosing periods, after an overnight fast, subjects will receive one intact Colcrys(R) 0.

6 mg tablet (followed by 240 mL of water) or one Colcrys(R) 0.

6 mg tablet crushed and sprinkled on 1 tablespoon of applesauce (followed by 240 ml of water) according to the randomization schedule.

 Blood samples will be drawn from all participants before dosing and for 48 hours post-dose at times sufficient to adequately define the pharmacokinetics of colchicine.

 Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature) will be measured prior to dosing, 1 hour 30 minutes post-dose and upon discharge from the clinical facility.

 Subjects will be monitored throughout their participation in the study for adverse reactions.

6 mg tablet of Colcrys(R) (colchicine, USP) when crushed and sprinkled on applesauce (1 tablespoon) relative to the same dose given as an intact tablet to healthy subjects following an overnight fast.

 A secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen in healthy volunteers.

 All study subjects will be monitored for adverse events throughout the study period.
