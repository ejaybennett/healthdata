(thirdQuint)Descriptive Study of Cardiac Output During Rehydration With Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase in Pediatrics.

 This is an open-labeled, single-center Phase IV clinical trial.

 The study will consist of patients with moderate hypovolemia/dehydration requiring parenteral rehydration.

 It is expected that this study will describe the onset or change in cardiac output using Hylenex augmented subcutaneous rehydration from ages 2 months up to 3 years and at a flow rate satisfying clinical needs, especially in reference to changes in cardiac output observed in standard intravenous rehydration.

 Descriptive Study of Cardiac Output During Rehydration With Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase in Pediatrics@highlight

The purpose of this study is to non-invasively study the reflective changes in cardiac output as response to fluid therapy in the pediatric moderate hypovolemia/dehydrated pediatric patients using sub-q rehydration using Hylenex augmented subcutaneous infusion of fluids and electrolytes compared to intravenous methods.
