 Fluoxetine in Multiple System Atrophy Patients@highlight

This is a French national trial, conducted using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised design involving 15 centers and 88 patients of both sexes.

 The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the effect of a selective inhibitor of serotonin reuptake, the Fluoxetine, at a higher dose (40 mg/day) than usually recommended for depressed patients, after three months in patients suffering from an atypical Parkinson's disease called Multiple System Atrophy, compared to the placebo effect.

 Secondary objectives of the trial are the evaluation of the effects of Fluoxetine after six weeks at the dose of 20 mg/day, after six months at the dose of 40mg/day, and assess the effects on mortality, quality of life, autonomic disorders, particularly orthostatic hypotension, mood and others symptoms such as sleep, apathy, pain and fatigue.
