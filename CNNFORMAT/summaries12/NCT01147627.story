(secondQuint)Effect of Different Interventions on Glycemic Control and -cell Function in Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic Patients.

 One of the fundamental defects in type 2 diabetes mellitus is declining -cell function.

 Exenatide targets multiple metabolic disturbances in type 2 diabetes and exerts direct effects on -cell, which indicates that it may not only contribute to the glucose control but also delay disease progression.

 There are trials demonstrated efficacy, safety and tolerability of exenatide.

 However, no study has compared the effects of exenatide with other hypoglycemic therapies with cell protective function in newly diagnosed and drug-naive type 2 diabetic patients.

 This current study is thus designed to evaluate the effects of exenatide, insulin and pioglitazone on glycemic control and -cell function in newly diagnosed drug-naive type 2 diabetic patients.
