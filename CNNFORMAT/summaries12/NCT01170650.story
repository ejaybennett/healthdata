(thirdQuint)Study for Women With Platinum Resistant Ovarian Cancer Evaluating EC145 in Combination With Doxil (PROCEED).

 This is a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of EC145 and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD; available in the United States as Doxil(R) and outside the United States as Caelyx(R)) compared to PLD and placebo.

 Enrollment of 640 patients including approximately 500 that are folate receptor positive is planned.

 EC145 is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cancer cells via the folate vitamin receptor (FR) that is not generally found on normal cells.

 Experimental evidence shows that this target receptor is expressed on virtually all ovarian cancers.

 Early clinical evidence in a small number of Phase I participants, in a subset of participants in a completed single-arm Phase II study, and interim data from an ongoing randomized Phase 2 study (PRECEDENT) suggests that EC145 may have antitumor effect in women with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and that EC145 alone and in combination with PLD is generally well-tolerated.

 This evidence suggests that EC145 may be useful as chemotherapy against platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

 All participants will undergo imaging with the FR-targeting investigational diagnostic agent EC20 during the screening period to assess binding of the imaging agent EC20 to tumors.

 This non-invasive procedure will provide additional information on the utility of using EC20 imaging to identify subjects with the FR molecular "target" prior to treatment with EC145 therapy.

The purpose of this study is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) (based upon investigator assessment using RECIST v1.

1) in participants with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who receive combination therapy with EC145 and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (EC145+PLD) with that in participants who receive PLD and placebo.
