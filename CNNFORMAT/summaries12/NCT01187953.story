 This is a two-armed parallel group, prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy,multicenter Phase 3 clinical study to establish the efficacy and safety of LCP-Tacro Tablets (tacrolimus, LifeCycle Pharma A/S, Horsholm, Denmark) once daily for the prevention of allograft rejection in de novo adult male and female recipients of a primary or secondary kidney transplant evaluated by a combined efficacy endpoint comprised of acute rejection, graft loss and patient loss.

 The trial is designed to determine if the test drug, LCP-Tacro, is not inferior to an unacceptable extent to the reference compound, Prograf.

 Recipients of a kidney transplant who sign an informed consent form and fulfill all other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to once-daily therapy with LCP-Tacro Tablets or to twice-daily therapy with Prograf Capsules (tacrolimus, Astellas Pharma US, Inc.

, Deerfield, IL), each concomitantly administered with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids.

 All patients will also receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antagonist (e.

g.

,Simulect(R), basiliximab; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ).

 Following screening,transplantation, and randomization, study visits will be conducted over a 12-month treatment period; with additional visits during a 12 month extension period on treatment and a follow-up safety assessment by visit or telephone interview 30 days after withdrawal from study drug.

This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of LCP-Tacro (tacrolimus) Tablets administered once-a-day compared to Prograf (tacrolimus) Capsules twice-a-day as immunosuppression for the prevention of organ rejection in newly transplanted adult kidney transplant recipients.

 Patients will be treated for a 12 month study period followed by a 12 month, blinded extension treatment period To show that LCP-Tacro Tablets are clinically similar to Prograf Capsules in the prevention of acute rejection.
