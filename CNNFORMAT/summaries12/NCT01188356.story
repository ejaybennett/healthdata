(firstQuint)EMERALD - AssEssment of CoMorbidities & Atrial ArRhythmiA Burden in DuaL-Chamber PaceD Patients.

 The study will focus on the number of patients moving to persistent Atrial Fibrillation as a function of cumulative %Vp (40%), in a general dual-chamber pacemaker population through a 2 year follow-up (n=2188).

 The same endpoint will be analyzed in sub populations (Sinus Node Disease and AVB) at 4 years follow up (n=4290).
