(thirdQuint)A Study to Investigate the Potential Pharmacokinetic Interaction of Perampanel With Oral Contraceptives in Healthy Female Subjects.

 This will be an open-label, non-randomized, fixed sequence study in healthy female subjects.

 The study has 2 parts: Part A investigating the effects of steady state perampanel on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single-dose oral contraceptive (OC) containing ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LN) (Microgynon-30) and Part B investigating the effects of repeated dosing of an OC containing EE and LN (Microgynon-30) on the PK of a single dose of perampanel.
