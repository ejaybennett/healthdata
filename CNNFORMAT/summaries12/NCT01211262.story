(thirdQuint)Study to Assess the Tolerability of a Bispecific Targeted Biologic IMCgp100 in Malignant Melanoma.

 IMCgp100 is a bispecific biologic incorporating an engineered T cell receptor (TCR) specific for a peptide antigen derived from the protein gp100 presented in the context of HLA A2 on the surface of melanoma cells.

 The TCR is fused to an anti-CD3 antibody single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that recruits and activates non-melanoma specific T cells (killer T cells) in physical contact with the cancer T cell.

 This is a Phase I study designed to assess the safety profile and establish a tolerable dose of IMCgp100 in HLA A2 positive malignant melanoma patients.

 The study has two treatment arms with different treatment schedules, weekly or daily dosing.

 Each treatment arm in the study has two parts.

 In the first part, dose escalation, the safety and tolerability of the drug are examined and the optimal dose of drug is established.

 In the second part of the trial, patients will receive an extended course of treatment with a view to assessing the effect of the drug on disease.

 Study to Assess the Tolerability of a Bispecific Targeted Biologic IMCgp100 in Malignant Melanoma@highlight

IMCgp100 is a new biological therapy designed for the treatment of melanoma skin cancer.

 The drug is designed to target melanoma cells and stimulate immune cells to kill them.

 This trial is designed to establish the level of drug that can be given to a patient that is tolerable.

 It also designed to establish the best dosing schedule for the drug and to look for signals that the drug is working as intended.
