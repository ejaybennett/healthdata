(firstQuint)Comparison of Slow Efficiency Daily Dialysis (SLEDD) With Unfractionated Heparin Versus Citrasate in Critically Ill Patients.

.

 Objective : To compare the feasibility, safety and efficacy of Sustained Low Efficiency Daily Hemodialysis (SLEDD) using regional anticoagulation with Citrasate(R) compared to systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin in critically ill patients.

 Design : Prospective, randomized, single-center clinical trial Setting : mixed medical-surgical 45 bed ICU in a tertiary university hospital Patients : 250 patients with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) stage III needing renal replacement therapy Interventions : Patients are randomized to receive SLEDD using standard dialysate and systemic anticoagulation with UF versus SLEDD using Citrasate(R)-dialysate with no additional UF.

 Measurements and main results : Primary end point : - The incidence of premature interruptions of the dialysis procedure attributed to hemofilter clotting.

 Secondary end points : - The incidence of bleeding episodes as defined by the WHO-criteria - The transfusion requirements - The incidence of technique failure - The incidence of metabolic derangements (metabolic alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia, hypernatremia, hyponatremia) - The incidence of citrate intoxication - The dialysis efficiency expressed as Kt/V and URR Tertiary end points : - All cause mortality at day 28 and day 90 after inclusion.
