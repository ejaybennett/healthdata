(thirdQuint)Online Study of Individuals With Genetic Changes and Features of Autism: Simons Variation in Individuals Project (Simons VIP).

 In Phase 2 (currently enrolling), the study has expanded to include more families with genetic changes by including additional genetic changes of interest and offering participation through a remote (online, phone) format.

 This allows English-speaking families from across the world to participate at times convenient to their schedule.

 Biospecimens will be collected from participants and linked to clinical data in order to understand the relationship between specific genetic changes and the brain's development.

 In Phase 1 (now closed to enrollment), the project assembled a team of experts at seven premier medical centers to collect detailed clinical information from families through in-person visits.

 This information has helped clinicians and families understand the relationship between specific genetic changes and the brain's development.

 Information from the project will be stripped of any personal identifying information and made available to qualified scientists around the world.

 The Simons Foundation, a New York-based private foundation, is committed to finding science-based solutions and working towards the development of targeted treatments to improve the lives of individuals with genetic and developmental differences.

 Online Study of Individuals With Genetic Changes and Features of Autism: Simons Variation in Individuals Project (Simons VIP)@highlight

The Simons Variation in Individuals Project (VIP) is characterizing the medical, behavioral, and learning features of individuals with specific documented genetic changes associated with features of autism and developmental delay with the goal of improving clinical care and treatment for these individuals.
