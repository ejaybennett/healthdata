(thirdQuint)Metformin Hydrochloride as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Prostate Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - To determine the activity and safety of metformin hydrochloride as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral metformin hydrochloride twice daily on days 1-28.

 Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Previously collected and post-treatment tumor tissue may be analyzed for PTEN status and PI3kinase-dependent pathway activation via immunohistochemistry.

 Blood samples may also be collected periodically and analyzed for biomarkers, pharmacogenetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months.

RATIONALE: Metformin hydrochloride may make some enzymes active.

 These enzymes may block other enzymes needed for cell growth and stop the growth of tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the safety of giving metformin hydrochloride as first-line therapy in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.
