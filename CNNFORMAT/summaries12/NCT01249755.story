(secondQuint)International Validation of a Delirium Prediction Model for ICU Patients.

 Delirium is a serious and common disorder in ICU patients.

 It is increasingly recognized that screening of ICU patients is a valuable tool for early detection and treatment of delirium, which may reduce its incidence, severity and duration.

 Apart from treatment of delirium, delirium prevention (pharmacological and nursing interventions)is an important issue.

 However, it is time consuming to take preventive measures in all ICU patients.

 The recently developed prediction model facilitates the conduct of preventive measures focused on high risk groups.

 This prediction model is developed and validated in the Netherlands.

 The aim of our study is to investigate the predictive value of the model in ICUs in other countries.

 International Validation of a Delirium Prediction Model for ICU Patients@highlight

Recently our ICU research group developed and validated a delirium prediction model in the NetherlandsThis.

 This model has a high predictive value.

 We want to examine what the predictive value is in ICUs of other European countries.
