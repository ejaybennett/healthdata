(thirdQuint)Nordic Adjuvant IFN Melanoma Trial.

 This is an open multicenter, prospective randomised phase III trial evaluating the efficacy of two different schedules of Interferon-alpha2b (IFN-alpha2b) administered in an adjuvant setting after adequate surgery in high risk cutaneous melanoma patients (T4N0M0/TxN1-2M0).

 The patients have been operated for either a thick primary melanoma (> 4 mm) without evidence of distant metastasis or have undergone surgery for regional lymph node metastases.

 The study consists of a control arm (A) and two treatment arms, B and C.

 The outcome in arms B and C with adjuvant treatment with IFN-alpha2b will be compared to the outcome of arm A in which the patients will only be observed after the surgery.

 The primary endpoint is overall survival.

 Secondary endpoints are relapse-free survival, safety-toxicity and health-related quality of life.

 Nordic Adjuvant IFN Melanoma Trial@highlight

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of giving adjuvant treatment with intermediate doses of interferon-alpha2b to patients operated for high risk melanoma.

 Patients are randomly assigned to either observation only or interferon treatment for 2 different durations.

 The outcome with respect to overall survival, relapse-free survival, side effects and quality of life is analysed.
