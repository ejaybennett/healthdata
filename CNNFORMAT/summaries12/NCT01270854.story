(firstQuint)Normal Saline Versus Plasmalyte in Initial Resuscitation of Trauma Patients.

 Electrolyte-containing intravenous fluids are routinely administered to patients in the first few hours after acute traumatic injury.

 Although Normal Saline (0.

9% sodium chloride) is commonly used in this setting, it causes a hyperchloremic acidosis that may exacerbate metabolic derangements that occur after acute injury.

 Plasmalyte A is a solution that more closely matches physiologic electrolyte levels.

 In this study, we will evaluate whether Plasmalyte A results in less disturbance of the base deficit 24 hours following traumatic injury than does Normal Saline.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether an intravenous salt solution called "Plasmalyte" causes less abnormality of the body's acid levels than a solution called "Normal Saline.
