(secondQuint)Study of the Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon Catheter in Bifurcated Coronary Lesions.

 The bifurcated coronary lesions are still a challenge for interventional cardiologists, since there is no suitable technique or strategy to manage such lesions.

 This multicenter randomized prospective trial in bifurcated coronary lesions will compare the new technology of the paclitaxel-eluting balloon with the until now "gold standard" technique of the "provisional stenting" with the paclitaxel DES in the main branch.
