(thirdQuint)PuLsE 2-Observational Long-Term Effectiveness Follow-Up Study of PuLsE 1.

 In 2005 Cyberonics, Inc.

 initiated PuLsE: an open, prospective, randomized, parallel group study directly comparing Best Medical Practice with and without adjunctive VNS Therapy.

 In July 2008, the decision was made to discontinue this study due to lower than expected enrolment, impairing the possibility to meet the primary objective with appropriate statistical power.

 However, the relatively large number of participants (n=121) randomized in the original PuLsE study offers the possibility to generate scientifically valuable and original findings if additional follow-up data can be gathered.

 After consultation with the PuLsE Investigators, Cyberonics decided to implement an observational long-term follow-up of the participants enrolled in the original PuLsE study.
