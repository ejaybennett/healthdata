(fifthQuint)Yttrium Y 90 Anti-CD45 Monoclonal Antibody BC8 Followed by Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, or Myelodysplastic Syndrome.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiation delivered via 90Y-DOTA-BC8 (90Y-BC8) when combined with FLU and 2 Gy TBI as a preparative regimen for patients aged >= 18 with advanced AML, ALL, and high-risk MDS.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine disease response and duration of remission.

 II.

 To determine the rates of engraftment and donor chimerism resulting from this combined preparative regimen, and to correlate level of donor chimerism with estimated radiation doses delivered to hematopoietic tissues via antibody.

 OUTLINE: PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive 90Y-BC8 via central line on approximately day -12 and FLU intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2.

 TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo TBI followed by allogeneic PBSC or bone marrow transplant on day 0.

 GRAFT-VS-HOST DISEASE (GVHD) PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive mycophenolate mofetil orally (PO) or IV every 12 hours on days 0-27 (for patients with related donors) or every 8 hours on days 0-40 with taper to day 96 (for patients with unrelated donors).

 Patients also receive cyclosporine PO or IV every 12 hours on days -3 to 56 (for patients with related donors) or 100 (for patients with unrelated donors) with taper to day 180.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months, and then annually thereafter.

 Yttrium Y 90 Anti-CD45 Monoclonal Antibody BC8 Followed by Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, or Myelodysplastic Syndrome@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects and maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 anti-cluster of differentiation 45 (CD45) monoclonal antibody BC8 (90Y-BC8) followed by donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that is likely to come back or spread.

 Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine phosphate (FLU), and total-body irradiation (TBI) before a donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or bone marrow transplant helps stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells.

 Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as 90Y-BC8, can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

 When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

 Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.

 Giving FLU, 90Y-BC8, and TBI before the transplant together with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.
