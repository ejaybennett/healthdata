(fifthQuint)A Trial of Tivozanib (AV-951) in Combination With Capecitabine (Xeloda) in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study of orally administered tivozanib in combination with capecitabine to approximately 24 subjects with advanced solid tumors and, in the expanded MTD cohort, subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast or colorectal cancer.

 This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetic, and antineoplastic activity.

 The number of cohorts evaluated and the maximum doses to be administered will depend upon the observed tolerability.

 Dose level "0", tivozanib HCl 1.

5 mg and capecitabine 1000 mg/m BID, is the starting dose level.

 Once assigned to a cohort, each subject will continue to be treated at the same dose level and schedule throughout the course of the study.

 A Trial of Tivozanib (AV-951) in Combination With Capecitabine (Xeloda) in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors@highlight

This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-finding study of tivozanib administered in combination with capecitabine.

 During the dose-escalation portion, sequential cohorts of subjects with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled in order to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

 If the MTD is not reached, the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined.

 In the expansion cohort, subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast or colon cancer will be enrolled at MTD (or RP2D) to further evaluate safety and activity of this combination in these tumor types.
