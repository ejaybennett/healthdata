(firstQuint)Massage in Treating Painful Shoulder.

 The joint system of the shoulder girdle is exposed to frequent overloading, which can cause painful shoulder.

 The therapeutic methods applied in the treatment of painful shoulder syndrome include among others oral pharmacotherapy, joint injections, kinesitherapy, ultrasound, electrotherapy, laser.

 Manual therapy, chiropractic and surgery could also be used.

 Attempts have also been made to apply classical massage in treating painful shoulder, although it is not often used due to its low effectiveness.

This study compares classical massage and massage based on the tensegrity rule which is not commonly known.
