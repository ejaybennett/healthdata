(fifthQuint)Efficacy and Safety Study of TOOKAD Soluble for Localised Prostate Cancer Compared to Active Surveillance.

.

 This is a Phase 3, multicentre, open label, randomised controlled study in subjects diagnosed with low risk prostate cancer on TransRectal Ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy.

 Subjects will be randomised to either Active Surveillance or TOOKAD(R) Soluble VTP.

 Subjects will remain in the study for approximately 24 months following randomisation.

 A total of 400 subjects will be entered into the study; 200 will receive Active Surveillance and 200 will receive TOOKAD(R) Soluble-VTP.

 Efficacy and Safety Study of TOOKAD Soluble for Localised Prostate Cancer Compared to Active Surveillance.

@highlight

The aims of this study are: - to assess the impact of TOOKAD(R) Soluble-Vascular Targeted Photodynamic Therapy (VTP) on the rate of absence of definite cancer using patients on active surveillance as a comparison (co-primary objective A) and - to determine the difference in rate of treatment failure associated with observed progression of disease from low risk prostate cancer to moderate or higher risk prostate cancer in men who undergo TOOKAD(R) Soluble-VTP compared to men on active surveillance (co-primary objective B).
