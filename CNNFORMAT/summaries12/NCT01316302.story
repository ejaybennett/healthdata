(firstQuint)12-Week Study of Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine) Social Anxiety Disorder.

 Lifetime prevalence has been estimated at 13% in the National Comorbidity Survey.

 There is good reason to think that Pristiq(R) would be effective in Social Anxiety Disorder.

 Effexor XR, which is mechanistically similar to Pristiq(R), was found effective for subjects with Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder in all five of the placebo controlled trials in which it was studied.
