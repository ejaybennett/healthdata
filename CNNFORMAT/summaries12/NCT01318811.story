(fifthQuint)A Comparison of Dilute Versus Concentrated Heparin for CRRT Anticoagulation.

 Our study will compare two protocols using heparin for anticoagulation of the extra-corporeal circuit during CRRT.

 Study subjects will be recruited from patients started on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) in all intensive care units at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC).

 Once enrolled, patients will be pragmatic cluster-randomized (by month of entry) into one of two study arms.

 Arm A will receive dilute heparin and arm B will receive standard concentrated heparin as both approaches are standard practices at VUMC.

 Heparin will be delivered as an intravenous infusion proximal to the dialysis filter in both groups.

 Replacement of the extra-corporeal circuit, including the dialysis filter, is performed under several circumstances: stopping of CRRT when the subject is transported out of the ICU for a procedure or study, machine malfunction, and clotting of the filter.

 All CRRT circuits and filters, regardless of patency, are replaced at 72 hours per our dialysis unit protocol.

 Only data from the first filter used for CVVHD will be used and the study subject's enrollment will end with replacement of the extracorporeal circuit and filter.

 Study subjects will receive standard care for the duration of the study and the inpatient Nephrology team will control all aspects of the dialysis treatment.

 Changes to the heparin infusion rates will be made based on the heparin nomogram for this study and it applies to either arm.

 A copy of this nomogram will be provided to the inpatient Nephrology team who will make adjustments to the heparin infusion as required to maintain blood anticoagulation levels at goal.

 The principle investigators (PIs) will be available at all times by pager and phone to address questions regarding proper adjustment of the heparin infusion and will monitor each heparin dosing change to ensure consistency in implementation of the study protocol.

 The following is a summary for the two interventions (arms): Treatment Algorithm Dilute heparin: Patients in the dilute heparin arm (enrolled in odd calendar months) will receive a systemic loading dose of heparin of 15 units per kilogram of weight (all heparin doses will be rounded to the nearest 100 units) by rapid (80, infusion (stop for 2 hours), infusion rate change (decrease 20%), repeat aPTT (in 3 hours); For the purposes of this study, data will only be collected from the first filter used during the CVVHD treatment.

 Following the end of the study enrollment period patients will continue on CVVHD and heparin infusions at the discretion of their treating physicians.

 Heparin infusions will continue to be adjusted based on the heparin nomogram.

 A Comparison of Dilute Versus Concentrated Heparin for CRRT Anticoagulation@highlight

Heparin is commonly used for anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) but the optimal mode of delivery has not yet been validated.

 Our study will compare dilute heparin to a standard concentration of heparin.

 The investigators hypothesize that heparin delivered in a dilute solution will augment coating of the filter fibers with anticoagulants, decreasing clotting events and increasing filter life.

 By improving delivery of heparin to the filter and circuit, where clotting events can disrupt dialysis, less heparin would be required for the extra-corporeal circuit and thus less heparin would be delivered back to the patient with blood return from the machine.

 By exposing the patient to less heparin it is hypothesized that fewer bleeding events would occur, making the dialysis treatment safer.

 If more of the filter's fibers remain patent and the filter is functional for a longer period of time, the CRRT would also be more effective.
