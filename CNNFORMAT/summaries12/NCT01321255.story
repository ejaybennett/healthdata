(fifthQuint)Fixed Dose Combination Drug (Polypill)for Secondary Cardiovascular Prevention.

.

 The specific objective of the FOCUS project is to prove that: 1.

 Better knowledge of factors relates to inappropriate use of secondary cardiovascular prevention drugs and lack of adherence to treatment will help to design new strategies for improving patients' management.

 2.

 A Fixed Dose Combination (FDC, polypill) including three components with a well demonstrated efficacy will improve secondary prevention in coronary patients by decreasing inappropriate prescribing and by reducing complexity of treatment and lack of adherence.

 - Phase 1 is a descriptive, non-interventional study.

 Its aim is to provide a comprehensive analysis of potential factors precluding adequate secondary prevention, including Health system characteristics, drugs affordability and availability, as well as patients' characteristics.

 Differences between the two studied regions (Europe and South America) will be analyzed.

 - Phase 2 is an interventional, randomized trial with prospective economic evaluation.

 It will be organised as a two-arm, randomised, parallel, multinational study.

 Patients completing the Phase 1, and fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (see below), will be included in Phase 2.

 Patients will be randomized to receive a FDC of ramipril, simvastatin and acetylsalicylic acid or the three medications separately.

@highlight

The aim of the FOCUS project is to test the Fixed Dose Combination concept for cardiovascular prevention in populations of different socio-economic characteristics.

 At the same time, FOCUS aims to understand the factors determining inappropriate prescribing for secondary cardiovascular prevention and those for poor patients adherence to treatment.

 This will allow FOCUS to establish recommendations for a better use of medication in patients with ischemic heart disease.

 In addition, after a successful completion of FOCUS, secondary prevention medication will be available and affordable for a large number of patients in both developed as well as developing countries.

 There are two Phases in this study: Phase 1: Is a descriptive, non interventional study.

 Phase 2: Is an interventional, randomized trial with prospective economic evaluation.
