(secondQuint)Ischemic Time and Extent of Myocardial Infarction (MI) With Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) in Patients With ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) and Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Study.

 Background: Cardiac magnetic resonance image (CMRI) is the preferred method of assessing myocardial infarct size and function.

 However,the relationship between CMRI changes and the ischemic time [symptom onset to device activation time (S2D)] in patients with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is not well understood.

 Hypothesis: The investigators will test the primary hypothesis that there is strong (at least 70%) direct correlation between the S2D time and infarct size by CMRI and inverse correlation with myocardial salvage.

 Method: The investigators will study a prospective cohort of 80 consecutive patients with STEMI and primary PCI.

 The investigators will perform CMRI at day 3 to 1 post STEMI and a repeat CMRI 30 to 40 days post STEMI.

 Exclusion Criteria: The investigators will exclude patients with 1)-culprit lesion in the distal artery, 2)-glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 400lb, 5)-history of allergic reactions to gadlinium based contrast agents, and 6)-those unwilling to participate in the study protocol.

 Outcome Measurement: The primary outcome measure is the CMRI myocardial infarct size (scar).

 The secondary outcomes include the CMRI transmurality of scar, area at risk, myocardial salvage index, microvascular obstruction (MVO), left ventricle (LV) thrombus, and LV ejection fraction (EF).

 Important covariates include symptoms and ST segment resolution before and after the PCI, peak cardiac troponin (cTn), and angiographic TIMI flow and myocardial perfusion grade.

 Follow-up: Patients will be followed with repeat CMRI at 30 to 40 days and with phone survey at 6 months and 12 months.
