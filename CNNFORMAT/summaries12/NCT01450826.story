(thirdQuint)Emend and Ondansetron Compared to Ondansetron Alone to Prevent CINV in Glioma Patients Receiving Temozolomide.

 Sixty-eight (68) patients will be randomized to each arm of the study.

 Patient randomization will be stratified by grade of tumor (1 or 2 versus 3 or 4) and the number of prior progressions (0 or 1 versus 2).

 Within each of the 4 strata defined by these factors, a permuted block randomization scheme will be used to assign patients to receive either aprepitant in combination with ondansetron or ondansetron alone.

 Though the study is comparative, the goal of the study is to determine whether aprepitant is worthy of further investigation in this setting, and not to make definitive statements about the comparative effectiveness of ondansetron treatment with or without aprepitant.

Patients diagnosed with malignant glioma who are receiving temozolomide will be accrued in this open label, phase 2, randomized single institution trial of aprepitant in combination with ondansetron versus ondansetron alone for the prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).

 Sixty-eight (68) patients will be randomized to each arm of the study.
