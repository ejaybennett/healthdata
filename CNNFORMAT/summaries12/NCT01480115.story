(fifthQuint)A New Tool for Automatic Ovarian Follicle Count and it Abilities to Evaluate Ovarian Reserve.

 Antral follicle count (AFC) is one of the methods to evaluate ovarian reserve.

 But this method is not that straightforward with a lot of inter and intra observe variation.

 In attempt to overcome this problems we going the verified a new software for automated AFC.

 At the first step we will compare the human count and the software count of the AFC in 150 exams of ovaries at 3D US.

 At the second step we will use the software to evaluate ovarian reserve at 50 women before fertility treatment.

 This woman will be questioned about epidemiologic data (age, ethnicity, medical history) and evaluate at the early follicular phase with blood test for follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone , E2, anti-mullerian hormone , Prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, Testosterone, Progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-Sulphate.

 The evaluation of the AFC by US will be at early follicular phase, late follicular phase and mid luteal phase.

 A New Tool for Automatic Ovarian Follicle Count and it Abilities to Evaluate Ovarian Reserve@highlight

The ultrasound unit in Meir Medical Center developed new software to automated ovarian follicle count on the basis of 3D US.

 The investigators intent to evaluate this software at two steps: - To compared the abilities of the software to physician follicle count.

 - To evaluate with the software the antral follicle count, as expression to ovarian reserve at 3 different time of the month.

 The investigators believe that the software measurement of the small follicle can be better than the common antral follicle count that is use today, and by this accurate evaluation of the small follicle the investigators can evaluate the ovarian reserve at any time of the mount, and not only at the early follicular phase that use today.
