(secondQuint)Assessing the Symptoms of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

 Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition characterised by periods of narrowing of the pharyngeal airways during sleep causing hypoxic and hypercapnic episodes with the cessation of ventilation.

 Considering the high number of overweight and obese individuals in Western society the understanding of the pathomechanisms behind OSA are important.

 This observational study aims to investigate the correlations between the severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea assessed by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and different health outcomes associated with the OSA.
