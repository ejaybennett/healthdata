(firstQuint)Oophorectomy Followed by Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone in Colorectal Cancer Patients.

 A recent study demonstrated that colorectal cancer with ovarian metastases were less responsive to chemotherapy compared to extraovarian metastases.

 The survival impact of oophorectomy has not been defined yet in this clinical setting.

 The incidence of microscopic ovarian metastasis has been reported to be approximately 10%.

 Therefore, the investigators propose a prospective study of oophorectomy followed by standard chemotherapy versus standard chemotherapy alone to determine whether oophorectomy increases survival.
