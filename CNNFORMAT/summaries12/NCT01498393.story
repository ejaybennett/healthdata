(secondQuint)1320 nm Nd:YAG Laser for Improving the Appearance of Onychomycosis.

 Toenail fungus (onychomycosis) is a common fungal infection of the nail that affects roughly 10% of Americans.

 Onychomycosis may be a precursor to many complications like ulcers, or skin infections, which may rarely result in amputation.

 Current treatment options have relatively limited long-term success and recurrence is common.

 The researcher can determine that the laser therapy can heat the nail and destroy and decrease the fungus infecting the nail to improving the appearance of the nail.
