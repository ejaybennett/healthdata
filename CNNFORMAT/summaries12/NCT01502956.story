(fifthQuint)Refractory Overactive Bladder: Sacral NEuromodulation v.

 BoTulinum Toxin Assessment (ROSETTA).

 Primary Aim: To compare the change from baseline in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes (UUIE) over 6 the six month follow-up period in women randomized to sacral neuromodulation (InterStim(R)) therapy, versus those randomized to intra-detrusor injection with 200 units of botulinum toxin A (Botox A(R)).

 Secondary Aims: - Long Term Efficacy: To compare the long-term (12 and 24 month) efficacy outcomes in women randomized to sacral neuromodulation(InterStim(R)) therapy, versus those randomized to intra-detrusor injection with 200 units of botulinum toxin A (Botox A(R)).

 Secondary efficacy outcomes, collected at 12 and 24 months as well as 6 months,include adequate control of their urge urinary incontinence, change in bothersome symptoms of urinary urge incontinence (UUI), severity of urge incontinence, urinary frequency, nocturia, subject satisfaction with therapy, quality of life measures and bowel and sexual function.

 - Cost Effectiveness: To compare utilization of medical resources for cost effectiveness analysis and cost-utility between treatment groups.

 - Treatment Safety and Burden: To assess safety profile and treatment burden of both interventions by comparing adverse event incidence between treatment arms, and also by obtaining estimates of incidence of treatment-specific safety and burden outcomes.

 Safety and burden outcomes for Botox A(R) injections include receipt of additional injections and intermittent catheterization due to voiding dysfunction/partial urinary retention.

 Safety and burden outcomes for InterStim(R) device include infection, pain, lead migration, reprogramming (and reasons for) and surgical revision (and reasons for).

 BoTulinum Toxin Assessment (ROSETTA)@highlight

The purpose of this randomized, open-label, active-control trial is to compare the effectiveness of intra-detrusor botulinum toxin A (Botox A(R), Allergan) versus sacral neuromodulation (InterStim(R), Medtronic) for the treatment of refractory urge urinary incontinence.

 In addition, the study will evaluate select technical attributes of the interventions as well as the effect of these two interventions on other lower urinary tract and pelvic floor symptoms.

 Hypothesis: InterStim(R) therapy will result in a greater reduction in daily urge urinary incontinence episodes over the 6-month follow-up period as compared to Botox A(R) injection.

 A supplemental study investigates whether biological markers including those related to inflammation and connective tissue remodeling change following treatments with Botox A(R) and Interstim(R).
