(fifthQuint)Telephone-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Bariatric Surgery Patients: A Pilot Study.

 Preliminary research suggests that CBT might be effective in reducing eating pathology and improving surgical outcomes.

 However, previous studies have examined group-based CBT delivered in person, and most patients cannot feasibly attend weekly therapy appointments at the hospital.

 Telephone-based CBT offers greater convenience because the service can be delivered during the evening and weekends, and eliminates the need to leave work and travel to hospital appointments.

 No published studies have examined the effectiveness or feasibility of telephone-based CBT for bariatric surgery patients.

 This study will examine the effectiveness of Tele-CBT as an adjunctive treatment to the usual standard of care in bariatric surgery patients.

 Telephone-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Bariatric Surgery Patients: A Pilot Study@highlight

Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for patients with extreme obesity.

 Psychological interventions are not routinely offered in Bariatric Surgery Programs.

 Preliminary evidence suggests that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) might be effective in reducing binge eating and improving surgical outcomes.

 The current study will examine whether the addition of telephone-based CBT (Tele-CBT) to the usual standard of care is more effective than the usual standard of care alone, and whether it is more effective when delivered prior to or following bariatric surgery.
