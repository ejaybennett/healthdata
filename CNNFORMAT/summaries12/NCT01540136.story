(firstQuint)Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy With Nedaplatin Versus Cisplatin in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.

 Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic in Southern China and Southeast Asia.

 Several prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy was superior to radiotherapy alone in the treatment of locoregionally advanced NPC.

 Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been shown to have higher response rates in NPC than noncisplatin regimens.

 However, the patients' compliance was unsatisfactory because the obvious gastrointestinal toxicity of cisplatin.

 Nedaplatin is the new second generation platinum and it has slight gastrointestinal reaction.

 Our trial is in order to study the effectiveness of nedaplatin or cisplatin with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) chemoradiotherapy in treating patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.
