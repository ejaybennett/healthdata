(thirdQuint)Mild Cognitive Impairment, Buddy Supported Exercise/ My Buddy Study.

 The overall objective of this pilot study is to determine feasibility and gather data that will inform the design of a larger, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial.

 Specifically, the investigators aim to: 2.

1 Determine the feasibility of recruiting persons with MCI and a buddy for an exercise intervention.

 - For MCI participants who do not identify a buddy, the investigators will determine the interest and feasibility of recruiting volunteers from the community to be an exercise buddy.

 2.

2 Determine the effects of having an exercise buddy on: - adherence to the protocol - 400 meter walk time, an objective measure of improved physical fitness - retention and satisfaction for both participant with MCI and buddy 2.

3 Establish a scientific partnership with a community based exercise facility.

 Mild Cognitive Impairment, Buddy Supported Exercise/ My Buddy Study@highlight

This is a small pilot trial of a 5 month aerobic exercise intervention in participants with MCI (n=20) to begin to compare the effects of randomization to use an exercise buddy or to exercise without an assigned buddy.

 The investigators hypothesize that participants with MCI who exercise with a buddy will have higher adherence to the protocol and greater improvement in 400 meter walk time.
