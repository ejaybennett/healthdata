(thirdQuint)Prospective Phase II Trial on Prophylactic Perihepatic Lymphadenectomy in Patients With Colorectal Cancer With Liver Metastasis.

 Lymph node status is a definite prognostic factor in oncologic surgery and significantly affects long-term survival, as reported by the tumor staging system of the International Union Against Cancer (IUCC), which is the most widespread classification of malignant tumors worldwide.

 Regional lymphadenectomy is already the standard procedure that completes hepatic resection in the case of carcinoma arising from the extrahepatic bile duct.

 However, the indication, extent, and role of lymph node excision are still a matter of discussion, and no clear guidelines exist in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis.

 Prospective Phase II Trial on Prophylactic Perihepatic Lymphadenectomy in Patients With Colorectal Cancer With Liver Metastasis@highlight

Objective: To evaluate the role of regional lymphadenectomy in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis.

 Background: Lymph node status is 1 of the most important prognostic factors in oncologic surgery; however, the role of lymph node dissection remains unclear for colorectal cancer liver metastasis.
