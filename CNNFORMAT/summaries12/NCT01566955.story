(fifthQuint)Feasability Study of Removing the Ovaries and Fallopian Tubes.

 We will show the feasibility for transgastric adnexectomy in 10 patients.

 Patients for participating in the study suffer of benign adnexal deseases and there is an indication for removing them for diagnostic, prophylactic or therapeutic reasons.

 A flexible gastric scope is put transgastric into the abdomen, developing an pneumoperitoneum and removing the adnexes with a monopolar knife.

 The adnexes then are put out of the abdomen either transvaginally after colpotomy or even transgastric.

 We already performed an appendectomy in 24 patients and were able to show the feasibility in acute infectios situations.

 Feasability Study of Removing the Ovaries and Fallopian Tubes@highlight

The main reason for this trial is to show the feasibility of removing the ovarien and fallopian tubes through the gaster (transgastric adnexectomy).

 The background for it is to look for more indications of scarless surgery and we will show that the transgastric adnexectomy can be performed in an easy way.

 It is necessary that there is an indication for removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes and if the patient agree we will do it instead of through the belly through the gaster and maybe with an additional inzision in the vagina.

 All patients with indication for adnexectomy are potential candidates.
