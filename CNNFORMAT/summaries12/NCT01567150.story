(thirdQuint)Wound Fluid Protease Levels During Use of Novel Wound Dressing.

 Abnormal wound healing is characterized by prolonged inflammation and excess degradation of the extracellular matrix through the activity of proteinases and other enzymes.

 Wound fluids can provide biochemical information about the healing status of chronic wounds and the effects of wound treatments.

 In this study the investigators will obtain samples of wound fluid and measure healing in wounds randomized to receive the novel dressing or a control.

 The findings will be compared between the two groups.

 Wound Fluid Protease Levels During Use of Novel Wound Dressing@highlight

This study is being conducted to characterize the way leg wounds respond to a new type of wound dressing, compared to wounds in patients who are not using the new dressing.

 The investigators will collect wound fluid for biochemical analysis, and they will measure the wound healing that occurs with and without the new dressing.
