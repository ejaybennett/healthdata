(secondQuint)Immune Regulation in Multiple Sclerosis: MicroRNA and Antigen-Presenting Cells.

 MicroRNAs regulate gene expression.

 The abnormal expression of microRNAs has been reported in many human diseases.

 The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if microRNA expression is changed in untreated and interferon-beta-treated patients with multiple sclerosis.

 The expression of microRNA will be analysed in cell subsets separated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
