(secondQuint)Diabetic Retinopathy in HIV Subjects Treated With EGRIFTA.

 To date, EGRIFTA(R) has not been studied for longer than 1 year in human subjects, nor has EGRIFTA(R) been studied in Type 2 diabetic HIV-infected subjects who are receiving oral hypoglycemic agents, GLP-1 analogues, or insulin.

 The present study will assess the potential of EGRIFTA(R) to induce or exacerbate DR in HIV-infected subjects on antiretroviral therapy who have concomitant abdominal lipohypertrophy and T2DM, and explore the long-term effects of EGRIFTA(R) on glycemic control and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) in this population.
