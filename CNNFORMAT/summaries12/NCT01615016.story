(fifthQuint)MISurf Versus InSurE.

 A Comparison of Minimally Invasive Surfactant Application Techniques in Preterm Infants.

 1.

 The Need for a Trial What is the problem to be addressed? Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a major clinical challenge affecting 60% of babies born before 30 weeks gestation and significantly contributes to mortality and morbidity in very preterm infants, including chronic lung disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

 Given that the immature lungs of these tiny infants are developmentally deficient in surfactant, exogenous surfactant administration might be beneficial to prevent pulmonary atelectasis.

 The traditional method in preterm infants is via endotracheal tube accompanied by mechanical ventilation using positive pressure.

 The latter predisposes to permanent lung injury.

This study seeks to assess the feasibility of conducting a large-scale clinical trial to compare two minimally invasive methods of surfactant administration to very low birth weight preterm infants.

 As such a comparative study has not been reported, the proposed study is a pilot trial to test the feasibility of the study design and to gather preliminary data on the comparison of two methods of surfactant administration.

 Results from this study will inform the design of a larger clinical trial including appropriate power calculation.

 Current management of lung disease in preterm infants RDS significantly contributes to mortality and morbidity in very preterm infants and is, itself, a major determinant of chronic lung disease (CLD) in the premature infant.

 One of the most common causes of RDS is surfactant deficiency; therefore, exogenous surfactant is frequently used for the treatment of RDS of the preterm infant.

 Endogenous surfactant is typically produced by alveolar cells type II and this substance, among other functions, decreases and modulates the surface tension in the small gas exchanging units of the lung, the alveoli.

1 It has been shown that surfactant treatment is more effective when used within first hours of life rather than later as rescue therapy.

 The traditional method of surfactant administration is via an endotracheal tube where the infant is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with the latter often resulting in a pulmonary inflammatory response.

 This response is known to be a significant contributor to the development of CLD which is the main pulmonary morbidity, both in the short and long term, associated with premature birth, thus traditionally supporting the need for mechanical ventilation in a highly vulnerable phase of lung development.

 Despite advances in management of respiratory distress, about 30% of infants born under 1000$, depending on product and country) as well as long term, considering the burden costs of CLD, with children needing specialist care for the first years of life.

 The Proposed Trial Study Design We propose to assess the feasibility of a masked, prospective randomized controlled trial, with two intervention arms, to compare surfactant application using the InSurE technique versus the MISurf technique.

 As early CPAP therapy is currently the standard of care for patients less than 33 weeks gestation, patients in both arms of the study will receive this intervention.

 What are the planned trial interventions? 1.

 MISurf: Minimally invasive intratracheal surfactant application without mechanical ventilation by feeding tube device 2.

 InSurE: Surfactant application by InSurE strategy (Intubation - surfactant - extubation sequence).

 Both interventions will be performed by intervention teams, comprised of an attending physician, a neonatal fellow, a respiratory therapist, nurse practitioner and nurses.

 The physical visualization and application of surfactant will be performed by the attending physician or the neonatal fellow, who is part of the intervention team.

 For the MISurf intervention, it was decided to use the minimally invasive method via feeding tube exclusively due to concerns about possibility of airway injury with the iv cannula device.

 Surfactant Two porcine derived surfactant products have been used in the published trials for minimal invasive surfactant application, Curosurf(C) and Survanta(C).

 Due to safety reasons we will use these products also in our pilot study however, only the latter is currently available in Canada.

 Hence we will use Survanta(C) 100 mg/kgBW, equivalent to 4 ml/kgBW per dose.

 Medication Considering the non invasiveness of the procedure, medication (anaesthetic agents, analgosedation) will not be administered for study interventions.

 What are the proposed practical arrangements for allocating participants to trial groups? This pilot trial will allocate participants to groups using simple randomization with sealed nontransparent envelopes.

 Every eligible patient for whom parental consent has been obtained will be randomized after birth.

 What are the proposed methods for protecting against sources of bias? Details of masking procedure Intervention teams will be established and will be comprised of health professionals (as above) who are not part of the infants' care team within the first 3 days of life.

 The procedure itself will be performed either in a different room (infant stabilization room (ISR)), or behind a folding screen.

 Blinding of health professionals in the circle of care Eligible patients will be randomized at birth or as soon thereafter as possible, once parental consent has been obtained.

 Professionals in the infant's circle of care and those assessing outcome will be blind to their study group.

 What are the planned inclusion/exclusion criteria? Eligible are all preterm infants born 30 weeks gestation at McMaster Inclusion criteria - CPAP of 5-6 cm H2O and FiO2 0.

35 or CPAP of 7-8 cm of H2O and FiO2 0.

30 - Less than 36 hours of age - Worsening clinical signs of RDS such as retractions (clinical judgment of the responsible physician) Exclusion Criteria - Previous Intubation or in imminent need of invasive mechanical ventilation because of e.

g.

 apnea, severe bradycardia or other deterioration not attributed to RDS, e.

g.

 shock - Congenital anomaly or conditions that might adversely affect breathing - Pneumothorax before intervention - No parental consent What is the proposed duration of treatment period? Infants are eligible to enter the study for intervention within 36h of life.

 The intervention itself will take 5 to 15 minutes.

 A second (one repeat) non invasive intervention is allowed in case of a second surfactant dose to be required.

 What is the proposed frequency and duration of follow up? Outcome will be assessed within first 3 days of life, within 48 hours after intervention and until discharge.

 What are the proposed primary and secondary outcome measures? 3.

 Primary feasibility outcome cent Proportion of included infants who were treated according to protocol 4.

 Secondary feasibility outcome - Recruitment rate - Consent rate - Proportion of intervention procedures in which masking has not been successful - Proportion of interventions, when intervention team has not arrived in time leading to emergency intervention - Success rate in antenatal approach for consent 5.

 Primary clinical outcome Failure rate of the intervention, where failure is defined as: - Need for invasive ventilation, requiring either FiO2 more than 0.

6 or pCO2 more than 65 mm Hg and pH 50 % of recruited patients treated according to protocol and a recruitment and consent rate indicating that a large scale trial with a estimated sample size of 150 to 200 patients within 2 to 3 years can be performed will determine success of this pilot trial.

 Sample size The sample size was primarily determined based on feasibility considerations.

 To test the feasibility of the study design a total of 40 patients (that is, 20 patients in each arm).

In general, we estimate that 200 preterm infants are admitted to McMaster NICU per year and 40% of these would fulfill the eligibility criteria for this trial.

 Thus, we will have sufficient numbers to assess the feasibility of recruitment for the main trial.

 Main study: The sample size will be calculated based on results of the pilot study.

 What is the planned recruitment rate? How will the recruitment be organized? Over what time period will recruitment take place? What evidence is there that the planned recruitment rate is achievable? Where possible, recruitment will take place antenatally.

 The research coordinator will screen the Labour & Delivery high risk patients for eligibility.

 Mothers will then be informed of the study and approached for consent, if they provide consent to contact.

 A recruitment rate of more than 70% should be achievable based on previous experience with clinical studies in our unit with this population.

 All infants of gestational age < 30 weeks are eligible.

 Based on the data for McMaster NICU from Vermont Oxford Network and Canadian Neonatal Network around a proportion of 40% of these patients is estimated to meet the inclusion criteria for the intervention.

 What is the proposed type of analyses? The reporting of this pilot trial will be in accordance with the CONSORT Statement (www.

consort-statement.

org).

 The demographics and baseline characteristics of the trial participant will be analyzed using descriptive statistics reported as mean standard deviation [SD] or median (minimum, maximum) for continuous variables depending on the distribution, and count (percent) for categorical variables.

 The feasibility outcomes will be reported as percentages.

 For clinical outcomes, we will use the t-test for comparing groups on continuous outcomes and chi-squared test for categorical variables.

 All tests will be performed at alpha = 0.

05 level of significance.

 We will not adjust the overall level of significance for multiple testing as the tests will be primarily exploratory.

 All analyses will be performed using SAS 9.

2 (Cary.

 NC).

 What is the proposed frequency of analyses? Interim analysis will be conducted following inclusion of first 20 patients, which is expected at around 6 months, under the assumption of a population of 200/year, recruitment rate of 70% and an eligibility rate for entering one of the intervention arms of 40%.

 Safety DSMB: Considering the patient population and the intervention a DSMB will be established.

 This will comprise of an external trialist/statistician, an external neonatologist and an external experienced clinical researcher outside the subject area.

 SAEs: SAEs will be captured and reported to DSMB within 24h.

 Alternative treatment: There is a considerable amount of patients (around 25%) who will not require intervention and will remain on CPAP treatment alone.

31 The alternative pathway would be intubation and mechanical ventilation due to various causes of respiratory failure.

 Ethical considerations Full approval of the FHS/HHS REB will be obtained prior to commencement.

 7.

 Risks to the safety of participants involved in the trial Although this is the first time these interventions have been compared neither intervention is considered technically challenging or new.

 Hence no enhanced risk compared to the classical surfactant application is expected.

 The thresholds for intervention are chosen according to best practice recommendations and similar to other surfactant trials.

14-21,26,28,29 Adverse events related to the intervention such as pneumothorax, tube blockage, pulmonary hemorrhage will be treated with current best practice intensive care as any other complication.

 They will be reported as described under 2.

15.

 8.

 Informed consent Written informed parental consent will be obtained by the research coordinator or by a physician who is not involved in the intervention team or the infant immediate care, when the coordinator is not available.

 Efforts will be undertaken to obtain parental consent prenatally.

 This should be feasible in most cases as more than 80% of the women with imminent preterm birth receive an antenatal consult by Neonatology and can be informed about the study at that point.

 When antenatal consent is not possible, consent will be taken as soon as achievable after birth, if the infant meets eligibility criteria.

 MISurf Versus InSurE.

 A Comparison of Minimally Invasive Surfactant Application Techniques in Preterm Infants@highlight

The lungs of infants born too early are extremely underdeveloped.

 Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) is a condition that frequently develops in infants born more than 10 weeks early and leads to the collapse of their lungs.

 Because the lungs had not had enough time to mature, they lack a substance, called surfactant that prevents their collapse.

 To treat this problem, physicians apply surfactant to the lungs within the first few hours of life by way of the infant's airway using mechanical stimulation (ventilation).

 Although this treatment has significantly decreased the number of infants who die from RDS, the mechanical ventilation can cause damage to the tiny lungs that may lead to long term lung disease and breathing problems.

 The need for more gentle and less invasive methods of deliver the surfactant to the infant has led to the development of two new methods that require little or no mechanical ventilation.

 While both methods are known to work there is no study that has assessed whether one method is better than the other or causes fewer complications for the infant.

 The proposed study will determine if it is practical to conduct a clinical trial to compare both methods of surfactant administration and to gather preliminary data on which method gives better results.

 Should this study look promising, the resulting data will be used to design a larger clinical trial to compare the methods of mechanical ventilation.

 Results of such a trial would help us to understand the best way to administer surfactant to preterm infants and thus help doctors to better care for tiny infants at risk of lung disease.
