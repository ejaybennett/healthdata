(secondQuint)The 36-month Extension to Follow up Sub Study.

 The post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a frequent, burdensome and costly condition that occurs in about one third of patients after an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

 Affected patients have chronic leg pain and swelling, and sometimes develop skin ulcers.

 At present, there is little to offer for the treatment of this condition.

 Prevention of PTS is the key to reducing its burden on patients and society.

 Elastic compression stockings (ECS) for two years following DVT could be helpful in preventing or delaying onset of PTS at three years, however data supporting this is limited.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate leg health for one additional year in patients with symptomatic proximal deep venous thrombosis who did not already develop Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS) during the 2 years of follow up in the SOX Trial.
