(firstQuint)Effect of a High-Protein Diet and/or High-Intensity Training on Metabolic Syndrome.

 High-protein diet interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing triglycerides and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations.

 Low-volume, high-intensity cycling exercise has shown to elicit positive effects on metabolic syndrome risk factors such as triglyceride concentrations.

 The objective of this study was to determine the combined effects of a high-protein, reduced carbohydrate diet and high-intensity interval training on metabolic syndrome risk factors in women.

 The second primary aim is to investigate the effect of the macronutrient content of the post-exercise meal consumed following an acute bout of interval training on postprandial metabolism.
