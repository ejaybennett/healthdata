(fifthQuint)Calprotectin-Directed Humira Maintenance Therapy (CADHUM).

 Patients frequently discontinue maintenance medications in Crohn's disease, particularly when in remission.

 Patients want to know that they truly need to take a medication, yet they don't want to have flares.

 As a biomarker, fecal calprotectin < 167 has a 100% negative predictive value for flare within the next 12 weeks (Gisbert, 2009).

 Adalimumab has low antigenicity, and can be safely stopped and restarted later with good clinical effect (Colombel, 2007).

 Patients want intermittent therapy, if it can be delivered in a timely fashion when pre-clinical inflammation starts, in order to avoid clinically-significant flares.

 This study will combine monitoring for pre-clinical inflammation with fecal calprotectin and as-needed dosing with Adalimumab to maintain remission in patients who have obtained remission with Adalimumab.

 This will be compared to two comparator arms: standard maintenance therapy and complete cessation of therapy (Step-Down approach).

This is a study that invites adults with Crohn's disease and have been responding well to Adalimumab (Humira (R)) for at least 6 months.

 Patients frequently discontinue maintenance medications in Crohn's disease, particularly when in remission.

 Patients want to know that they truly need to take a medication, yet they don't want to have flares.

 The purpose of this study is to see that if we monitor the patient, along with looking at changes in their stool samples, we can safely stop the maintenance medication Adalimumab for up to 48 weeks, or add as-needed dosing only, and keep them in remission.
