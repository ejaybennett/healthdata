(secondQuint)Screening for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm and Abdominal Aortic Atherosclerosis by Hand-Held Ultrasonography.

 Pilot study that prospectively study a cohort of men over 50 years with cardiovascular risk factors: active smokers, former smokers, or hypertensive patients, attended in primary health care center.

 General Practitioner complete an ultrasonography training in an Ultrasound Unit under supervision of experienced radiologists using an standard ultrasound equipment and hand-held ultrasound (Trademark: VScan(R), Manufacturer: General Electric, USA).

 All images and video recorded are blindly evaluated by a radiologist in order to establish the concordance in the interpretation of images between general practitioner and radiologist.

 Kappa index is calculated to study the agreement on the presence or absence of AAA and AA-At.

 Logistic regression analysis is used to determine the factors that influence the presence of AA-At.
