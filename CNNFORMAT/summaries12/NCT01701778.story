(firstQuint)Caudal Versus Intravenous Dexmedetomidine for Supplementation of Caudal Analgesia in Children.

 Single shot caudal epidural block is one of the most widespread technique for pediatric pain management after infraumbilical surgical procedures.

However, in a significant proportion of patients, despite good initial analgesia from a caudal block with local anesthetic, pain develops after the block resolves.

 Dexmedetomidine is used increasingly in pediatric anesthesia practice to prolong the duration of action of caudal block with a local anesthetic agent.

But which route of administration of clonidine is the most beneficial remains unknown.

 The investigators performed prospective randomized double-blind study to compare the effects of caudal dexmedetomidine with intravenous dexmedetomidine on postoperative analgesia after caudal levobupivacaine for inguinal herniorrhaphy or orchidopexy surgery.

 90 children (ASAIorII,aged 2-5 yr) undergoing unilateral orchiopexy or inguinal herniorrhaphy were included in this study.

 Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane via a facemask, followed by placement of a laryngeal mask airway.

 Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 2-3% in oxygen-air.

Then,caudal block was applied.

 Patients were randomly assigned in three groups.

 Group Cau-DEX (n = 30): Caudal Levobupivacaine 0.

25% 1ml/kg plus dexmedetomidine 1 mu g/kg and 10 ml normal saline i.
