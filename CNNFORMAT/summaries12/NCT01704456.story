(fifthQuint)Integrated Mindfulness-based Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Versus Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Provoked Vestibulodynia.

 PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine whether an 8-session MBCT intervention for PVD is no worse than an 8-session CBT intervention for improving women's pain intensity and reducing their sexual distress, catastrophizing and hypervigilance towards pain.

 The investigators will also examine whether pain improvements at follow-up are mediated by changes in self-compassion and mindfulness (in the MBCT arm only) and moderated by pre-treatment credibility, personality, and anxiety sensitivity.

 HYPOTHESES: 1.

 At follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment), women in the MBCT arm will experience a greater decline (vs.

 pre-treatment) in vestibular pain intensity compared to women in the CBT arm.

 2.

 At follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment), women in the MBCT arm will experience a greater decline (vs.

 pre-treatment) in sex-related distress, pain catastrophizing, hypervigilance, and self-reported pain during intercourse/other penetrative sex compared to women in the CBT arm.

 3.

 The investigators hypothesize that improvements in pain intensity during vestibular touch will be mediated by changes in self-compassion and mindfulness in the MBCT arm only at 6 and 12 months follow-up.

 4.

 The investigators hypothesize that pre-treatment credibility, personality, and anxiety sensitivity will significantly moderate improvements in pain intensity during vestibular touch at 6 and 12 months follow-up.

 5.

 The investigators hypothesize improvements in both arms on the "Patient Global Impression of Change Scale" and significantly greater improvements in the MBCT arm relative to the CBT arm at follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment).

 Integrated Mindfulness-based Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Versus Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Provoked Vestibulodynia@highlight

This randomized trial, nicknamed the COMFORT (Cognitive therapy or Mindfulness FOR Treatment of pvd) study, will compare the effects of an 8-session group Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) to an 8-session group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for women with provoked vestibulodynia (PVD).

 Women with PVD will be randomly assigned to attend either eight sessions of group MBCT or CBT.

 Each session is 2.

25 hours long and spaced 1 week apart.

 The purpose of this study is to determine whether the 8-session MBCT intervention for PVD is no worse than an 8-session CBT intervention for decreasing women's pain intensity, sexual distress, catastrophizing and hypervigilance towards pain.
