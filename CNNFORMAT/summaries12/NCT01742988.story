(thirdQuint)Phase I Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of CUDC-907 in Patients With Lymphoma or Multiple Myeloma.

 This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center dose-escalation trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of CUDC-907 as a single agent administered orally, once daily, to patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma or multiple myeloma.

 The following dosing schedules may be examined, all consisting of 21-day cycles and including: (i) continuous once daily (QD), (ii) twice weekly on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18 (BIW) (iii) thrice weekly on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19 (TIW) (iv) four days on/three days off on Days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18 (4/3), and (v) five days on/two days off on Days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19 (5/2) Sequential dose escalation cohorts of oral CUDC-907 are planned.

 Subject enrollment and dose escalation will proceed according to a standard 3+3 design.

 In the absence of DLT, each subject will be treated for a minimum of 21 days, and may continue to receive additional treatment until disease progression has been documented or other treatment discontinuation criteria have been met.

 MTD or BED expansion cohorts of up to 36 evaluable (e.

g.

, up to 12 subjects in each of 2 or 3 specific tumor types or subtype) to better define the safety, tolerability and preliminary antitumor and pharmacodynamic activity of the study treatment, as well as suitability as an RP2D and schedule.

 Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events as determined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.

03).

 A Safety Review Committee (SRC) comprised of the Medical Monitor, Principal Investigators, and Sponsor representatives, will be convened to review safety information and to decide upon dose escalation and further subject enrollment.

 The antitumor activity of study treatment will be assessed according to standard response criteria as appropriate for each individual subject's tumor type (e.

g.

, Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma).

 Exploratory biological markers of activity will be assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), plasma and tissue specimens (skin, tumor and bone marrow samples, where available).

 Phase I Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of CUDC-907 in Patients With Lymphoma or Multiple Myeloma@highlight

This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of CUDC-907 in patients with refractory or relapsed lymphoma or multiple myeloma.

 CUDC-907 is a multi-targeted agent designed to inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)and histone deacetylase (HDAC).

 The study is designed to assess the safety, including the maximum tolerated dose, biologically effective dose, the pharmacokinetics, and the anti-cancer activity of CUDC-907.
