(fifthQuint)The Effects of Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Renal Transplantation.

 There have been few interventional studies regarding the clinical effect of omega-3 fatty acids in renal transplantation.

 The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on renal function and cardiovascular risk markers in renal transplant recipients.

 This study is a randomized double blinded placebo controlled interventional study of 132 Norwegian renal transplant recipients.

 It will investigate, on the one hand, the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on renal function and, on the other, the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular risk markers in renal transplant recipients.

 8 weeks after transplantation, if renal function has stabilized, patients with a eGFR>30 will be randomized to receive either 2,7 g eicosapentaenoic plus docosahexaenoic acid (3 capsules of Omacor a 1 g) daily or placebo.

 Baseline measurements will be performed before they start taking the study medication.

 The same measurements will performed again1 year after transplantation and the patients stops taking the study medication.

 The Effects of Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Renal Transplantation@highlight

Omega-3 fatty acids are provided through dietary intake of fish and seafood.

 Several dietary supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids are also commercially available.

 Some studies have described beneficial effects from omega-3 fatty acids, among them are anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-arrhythmic, anti-hypertensive and lipid-modulating effects.

 Other studies have not confirmed these findings.

 This study will investigate the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on renal function and cardiovascular risk markers in renal transplant recipients.
