(thirdQuint)Pegylated Interferon Alpha-2b in Early Primary Myelofibrosis.

 Subjects will be randomized into one of the study groups: one in which subjects get treated with PEGINTRON and the other in which subjects are closely followed and get best supportive care until disease progression (the presently accepted standard approach for early disease).

 Subjects on the observation arm will be carefully monitored for clinical or laboratory progression of disease during scheduled study visits.

 However, they will not be treated with an active drug like Interferon alfa or others such as Hydroxyurea, Revlimid, Thalidomide, Pomalidomide, and the newly approved JAK2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib (Jakafi).

 If their disease progresses, they will be eligible for cross-over into the treatment arm with PEGINTRON.

 Subjects randomized to the treatment arm will receive PEGINTRON once weekly.

 Pegylated Interferon Alpha-2b in Early Primary Myelofibrosis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of giving patients who have been newly diagnosed with untreated early stage primary myelofibrosis (PMF) a study drug called PEGINTRON (also known as pegylated interferon alfa 2b).

 This intervention will be compared to the widely employed "watch and wait" (best supportive care) approach for early stage PMF, in which patients are followed closely and treatment initiated only if the disease progresses.
