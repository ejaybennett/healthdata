(fifthQuint)Experimental Study of the Impact of a Group Therapy Psychological Intervention for Caregivers of Alzheimer's Disease Patients.

 The aim of this study is to conduct group therapy with Alzheimer's caregivers at three centers in the province of Barcelona: Hospital El Carme Badalona, Sanitary Center of Les Corts and Sarria.

 The therapy sessions are conducted by an expert in group therapy (from the sponsor Pasqual Maragall Foundation) and the social worker of each of the centers.

 The study takes place for four months and consists of weekly therapy sessions of an hour and a half each (14 sessions in total), based on cognitive and behavioral theory.

 The participants and the control group are evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the study in terms of mood, quality of life, anxiety and depression.

 This study aims to demonstrate that Alzheimer's patient's caregivers can benefit from group counseling, resulting in an improvement in their emotional state, perceived burden, quality of life and a more positive attitude coping with the new situation.
