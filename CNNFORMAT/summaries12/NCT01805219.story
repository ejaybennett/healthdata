(thirdQuint)Global Positioning Satellite and Accelerometry to Assess Human Locomotion (ACTI GPS).

 The assessment of the physical activity (PA) and the energy expenditure (EE) is very important to estimate the morbi-mortality.

 However, each of these tools has its advantages and disadvantages but none of them provides a measure of all components dimensions that characterize the associated PA and EE.

 The current scientific prospects for measurement of PA tend to associate several measuring devices.

 To date, these perspectives are facilitated by technological developments and miniaturization of various devices.

 Thus, the purpose of the study is to evaluate wether GPS associated with accelerometer are able to assess the humain locomotion and energy expenditure during exercises.
