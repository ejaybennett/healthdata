(secondQuint)A Safety Study of Sativex in Combination With Dose-intense Temozolomide in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma.

 Patients will receive Sativex and dose-intense Temozolomide in an open-label phase.

 The incidence of adverse events will be monitored (Part A).

 An investigator led Safety Review Team will assess the safety profile of the open-label patients and decide whether the study can progress to the randomisation phase (Part B).

 Patients who enrol in the randomisation phase patients will receive either Sativex or placebo.

 The safety of Sativex compared to placebo will be assessed by pharmacokinetic analysis of Temozolomide and its metabolites, clinical laboratory tests, adverse events and vital signs.
