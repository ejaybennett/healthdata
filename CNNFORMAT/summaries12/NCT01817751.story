(thirdQuint)Sorafenib Tosylate, Valproic Acid, and Sildenafil Citrate in Treating Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma.

 The combination of sorafenib, valproic acid, and sildenafil may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of recurrent high-grade glioma in the clinic.

 The combination of sorafenib and valproic acid is predicated on the basis that sorafenib activity is enhanced by HDAC inhibition.

 The addition of sildenafil is based on its ability to block ABCB1 and ABCG2 drug efflux pumps.

 As the ABCG2 transporter is the primary transporter involved in the efflux of sorafenib at the BBB, blocking its action is predicted to increase the concentration of sorafenib in the brain.

 Sorafenib Tosylate, Valproic Acid, and Sildenafil Citrate in Treating Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well sorafenib tosylate, valproic acid, and sildenafil citrate works in treating patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.

 Sorafenib tosylate, valproic acid, and sildenafil citrate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
