(fifthQuint)Study to Assess Efficacy & Safety of Reparixin in Pancreatic Islet Transplantation.

 Pancreatic islet transplantation has become a feasible option in the treatment of T1D which offers advantages over whole pancreas transplantation.

 Several strategies are being evaluated, including anti-TNF, aimed to prevent early inflammatory events that limit islet engraftment.

 Among possible mechanisms CXCL8 could play a crucial role in triggering the inflammatory reaction and might represent a relevant therapeutic target to prevent early graft failure.

 Preliminary data obtained in transplanted patients recruited in the ongoing pilot trial coupled with the safety shown in human phase 1 and 2 studies provide a sound rationale for further development of reparixin in islet transplantation and prompted the conduct of this phase 3 clinical study aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of reparixin in preventing graft dysfunction after islet transplantation in T1D patients.

 At least 42 patients receiving pancreatic islet transplant will be involved.

 Patients may receive up to 2 islet transplants, with the second transplant on average 6 months after the first one.

 Patients will be randomly (2:1) assigned to receive either reparixin or placebo (control group).

 The Investigational Products will be administered as an added on treatment to the immunosuppressant regimen.

The chemokine CXCL8 plays a key role in the recruitment and activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in post-ischemia reperfusion injury after organ transplantion.

 Reparixin is the first low molecular weight blocker of CXCL8 biological activity in clinical development.

 Thus, the use of reparixin may emerge as a potential key component in the sequentially integrated approach to immunomodulation and control of non specific inflammatory events surrounding the early phases of pancreatic islet transplantation in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients.
