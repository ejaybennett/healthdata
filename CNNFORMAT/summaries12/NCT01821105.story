(thirdQuint)2 Phase Comparison of Pre-operative CT and PET Images for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the feasibility of rigidly (linearly) registering PET to CT images and applying this fused dataset to guide surgery with an image-guided navigation system and a handheld positron probe in order to facilitate disease detection and improve resection accuracy in advanced stage colorectal cancer.

 II.

 To complete development of software for the nonlinear registration of PET and CT datasets.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo preoperative whole-body PET scans and CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis.

 Patients then receive 18 F fludeoxyglucose (FDG) intravenously (IV) 60-90 minutes prior to surgery and undergo intraoperative CT scans using a handheld probe and computer navigation system.

 2 Phase Comparison of Pre-operative CT and PET Images for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer@highlight

This pilot phase II studies how well computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging works in detecting disease in patients undergoing surgery for metastatic colorectal cancer.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as CT and PET scans, done before and during surgery may help find colorectal cancer and help guide surgery
