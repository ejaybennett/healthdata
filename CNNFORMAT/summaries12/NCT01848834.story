(fifthQuint)Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors (MK-3475-012/KEYNOTE-012).

 Protocol Amendment 01 (08 Aug 2013) included a new study arm (Cohort D) for approximately 32 participants with advanced gastric cancer.

 Of these 32 participants, 16 will be from sites in the Asia Pacific (AP) region and the other 16 will be from sites outside the AP region.

 Protocol Amendment 02 (07 Apr 2014) added a new study arm (Cohort B2) for approximately 110 participants with advanced head and neck cancer who will receive a lower dose of pembrolizumab every three weeks (Q3W).

 Both programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)- positive and PD-L1-negative participants will be enrolled into this cohort.

 Protocol Amendment 03 (26 May 2015) removed the secondary objective of investigating the relationship between programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibition and up-regulation of cytokines biomarkers predicting response (e.

g.

 Interleukin-10 [IL-10]) from the protocol.

 Participants who stopped study treatment without progression (e.

g.

 completed 2 years) may have been eligible for up to 1 year of retreatment upon subsequently experiencing disease progression.

 With Amendment 05 (11 Dec 2017), once study participants have achieved the study objective or the study has ended, participants will be discontinued from this study and enrolled in an extension study to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment.

 Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors (MK-3475-012/KEYNOTE-012)@highlight

This study is being done to investigate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Cohort A), advanced head and neck cancer (Cohorts B and B2), advanced urothelial cancer (Cohort C), or advanced gastric cancer (Cohort D).

 Additionally, for Cohort D, data is presented for Asian Pacific (AP) participants.

 Only participants with programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressing tumors were enrolled in Cohorts A, B, C and D.

 Participants in Cohort B2 were enrolled irrespective of PD-L1 status.

 The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab is safe and well-tolerated.
