(thirdQuint)Walking Adaptability Post-Spinal Cord Injury.

 Eligible individuals without spinal cord injury that are enrolled in the study will participate for 1-2 days.

 These individuals may undergo a variety of non-invasive neurophysiological tests which evaluate spinal reflexes and integrity of specific spinal pathways.

 In addition, their movement may be assessed during walking on a treadmill and overground in a variety of different conditions (e.

g.

 with mirrors, without mirrors, with obstacles, without obstacles).

 Eligible individuals with spinal cord injury that are enrolled in the study will undergo the same testing as described above for the healthy controls.

 In addition, a small subset of these individuals may receive locomotor training (3 weeks of basic locomotor training followed by 3 weeks of adaptive locomotor training, separated by a 3 week washout period).

 For the individuals receiving locomotor training, they will be tested before and after each 3 week training session.

 Walking Adaptability Post-Spinal Cord Injury@highlight

The purpose of this study is: (1) to establish assessment techniques (in our laboratory) to identify the functional integrity of long spinal tracts associated with adaptive walking recovery post-spinal cord injury and (2) to preliminary investigate locomotor outcomes associated with an adaptive locomotor training approach post-spinal cord injury.
