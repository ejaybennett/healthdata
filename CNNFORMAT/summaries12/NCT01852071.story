(thirdQuint)Autologous Transplant of EFS-ADA Modified Bone Marrow Cells for ADA-Deficient Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID).

 The study will be open to twenty (20) infants and children diagnosed with ADA-deficient SCID who do not have a medically eligible, HLA-identical sibling donor for bone marrow transplantation.

 The EFS-ADA lentiviral vector with the human ADA cDNA will be used to transduce autologous CD34+ cells from the bone marrow of these subjects.

 The subjects will receive 4 mg/kg busulfan prior to re-infusion of their gene-modified cells.

 Safety is the primary endpoint.

 During the follow-up phase, the investigators will determine whether the cells can engraft and produce mature cells that contain and express the corrected ADA gene in the absence of PEG-ADA enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which will be withheld at Day +30 following transplant.

 Efficacy studies to evaluate level of immune reconstitution will begin in the first year and will continue in the second year.

 This Phase I/II clinical trial will be performed at Mattel Children's Hospital, UCLA and at the Mark O.

 Hatfield Clinical Research Center, NIH.

In this current study, the investigators will determine whether using a lentiviral vector (based on HIV-1) will be more effective and safer at gene transfer to hematopoietic stem cells compared to previous gene transfer vectors based on murine (mouse) retroviruses for ADA-deficient SCID.

 The level of gene transfer in blood cells and immune function will be measured as endpoints.
