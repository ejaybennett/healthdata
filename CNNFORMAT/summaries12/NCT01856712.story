(fifthQuint)Oral vs.

 Injectable Naltrexone for Hospitalized Veterans With Alcohol Dependence.

 The proposed project is a pilot feasibility study of inpatient veterans with problem alcohol use at the William S.

 Middleton VA Hospital.

 The over-arching goal is to understand the impact of medication adherence upon engagement in behavioral treatment for alcohol use disorders.

 Participants will be randomized to one of two parallel study conditions: (1) an initial 50 mg oral dose of naltrexone prior to hospital discharge plus a 30-day prescription for oral naltrexone, or (2) a single 380 mg intramuscular injection of naltrexone (duration of action = 30 days) administered prior to discharge followed by a second injection one month later.

 The central hypothesis is that hospital-administered, long-acting injectable naltrexone, when compared to daily oral naltrexone, will reduce alcohol use in the days immediately following hospitalization.

 This reduced consumption, we hypothesize, will be followed by improved engagement in substance abuse treatment.

 Primary Aim: Demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed recruitment methods and study design.

 This aim comprises two measures with corresponding goals: (1) Recruitment/enrollment-with a recruitment goal of 50 eligible and consenting subjects in an 8 month time period, and (2) Follow-up data collection with a goal of post-hospitalization follow-up data on no less than 70% of enrolled subjects.

 Secondary Aims: As a pilot feasibility study, we may not anticipate sufficient power to attain statistical significance on patient-oriented outcome measures.

 However, it will be important for us to consider and to evaluate pertinent outcomes and potential moderators in order to (1) develop and fine-tune study design, and (2) determine effect sizes for primary outcomes so that we may calculate appropriate sample sizes for future larger study.

 As such, the secondary aims for the current study are: 1.

 To compare injectable naltrexone study to oral naltrexone in terms of attendance to recommended outpatient substance abuse treatment.

 We hypothesize that injectable naltrexone will be associated with improved likelihood of attending initial visits for substance abuse treatment.

 2.

 To compare treatment attendance in adherent vs.

 non-adherent patients in the oral naltrexone condition.

 Adherence will be defined as taking 80% of daily naltrexone doses determined via pill counts.

 We hypothesize that, while controlling for addiction severity, mental illness measures, and motivation to change, adherence to daily oral naltrexone will predict treatment engagement following hospital discharge.

 3.

 To compare study arms in terms of ongoing alcohol consumption.

 We hypothesize that (1) improved medication adherence in the oral naltrexone arm and (2) assignment to injectable naltrexone will be associated with reduced alcohol consumption (number of heavy drinking days in the past 14 days) following hospital discharge.

 Exploratory Aims will involve the examination of the relationships between study outcomes and (1) disorders prevalent in the veteran population (post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and traumatic brain injury) and (2) stigma related to alcohol dependence.

 The proposed project is a pilot feasibility study of inpatient veterans with problem alcohol use at the William S.

 Middleton VA Hospital (Madison, WI).

 Participants will be randomized to one of two parallel study conditions: (1) an initial 50 mg oral dose of naltrexone prior to hospital discharge plus a 30-day prescription for oral naltrexone, or (2) a single 380 mg intramuscular injection of naltrexone administered prior to discharge and a second injection one month later.

 The central hypothesis is that hospital-administered injectable naltrexone, when compared to daily oral naltrexone taken at home, will reduce alcohol use in the days immediately following hospitalization.

 Injectable naltrexone has been efficacious vs.

 placebo in addition to behavioral treatment in several studies.

 However, it has yet to be examined in head-to-head comparison with oral naltrexone, or in the hospital setting as an intervention that might facilitate behavioral treatment follow up after discharge.
