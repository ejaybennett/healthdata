(fifthQuint)Phase Ib Trial of LEE011 With Everolimus (RAD001) and Exemestane in the Treatment of Hormone Receptor Positive HER2 Negative Advanced Breast Cancer.

 The primary purpose of the phase Ib part of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose(s) (MTD(s)) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of LEE011 + everolimus + exemestane in patients with ER+ Her2- advanced breast cancer.

 This part of the study will also assess safety, tolerability, and PK of the LEE011 + exemestane, LEE011 + everolimus + exemestane combinations.

 The Dose Expansion part of the study will evaluate the triple combination of LEE011 + everolimus + exemestane and the double combination of LEE011 + exemestane for safety and tolerability.

Dose Escalation part of the study: To estimate the MTD(s) and/ or RP2D of LEE011 in combination with everolimus + exemestane, and LEE011 in combination with exemestane, and to characterize the safety and tolerability of the combinations of everolimus + exemestane + LEE011 and LEE011 + exemestane in patients with ER+ HER2- advanced breast cancer Dose Expansion part of the study: To characterize the safety and tolerability of the triplet combination of LEE011 + everolimus + exemestane in patients naive or refractory to CDK4/6 inhibitor based therapy, and the safety and tolerability of the doublet combination of LEE011 + exemestane in patients refractory to CDK4/6 inhibitor based therapy (except patients treated with prior LEE011 are not allowed in Group 3).
