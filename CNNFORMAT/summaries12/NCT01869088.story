(secondQuint)TACE Plus Recombinant Human Adenovirus for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is currently one of the mainstays of palliative treatments worldwide for patients with unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC).

However, the long term outcomes were generally poor for HCC patients treated with TACE.

 Recombinant Human Adenovirus Type 5, an E1B gene deleted adenovirus, is known to have a significant antitumor activity.

 In addition, local injection of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 can enhance the effect of antitumor therapies (chemotherapy and radiotherapy).

 The hypothesis is that patients with unresectable HCC may benefit from recombinant human adenovirus type 5 in combination with TACE.
