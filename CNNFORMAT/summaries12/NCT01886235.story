(secondQuint)Intravital Microscopy for Identifying Tumor Vessels in Patients With Stage IA-IV Melanoma That is Being Removed by Surgery.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the feasibility of performing intravital microscopy on accessible human melanoma tumors during their standard course of treatment (i.

e.

, wide local excision).

 (Part I) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the blood flow velocity of the tumor vessels and tissue penetration of fluorescein (fluorescein sodium) as a marker of tumor vessel permeability.

 (Part II) OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorescein sodium intravenously (IV) followed by intravital microscopic observation over 10-15 minutes during excision of the melanoma.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 weeks and then periodically for 5 years.

 Intravital Microscopy for Identifying Tumor Vessels in Patients With Stage IA-IV Melanoma That is Being Removed by Surgery@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies intravital microscopy for identifying tumor vessels in patients with stage IA-IV melanoma that is being removed by surgery.

 New imaging procedures, such as intravital microscopy, may determine the extent of melanoma.
