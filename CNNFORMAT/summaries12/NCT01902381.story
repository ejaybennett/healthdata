(fifthQuint)CPI-613 in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes Who Failed Previous Therapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the safety and anti-cancer activities of CPI-613 in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients who have failed previous agents (such as decitabine [Dacogen], azacitidine [Vidaza], growth factors or lenalidomide).

 OUTLINE: Patients receive 6, 8-bis (benzylthio) octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 4 of weeks 1-3.

 Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

 CPI-613 in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes Who Failed Previous Therapy@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies 6, 8-bis (benzylthio) octanoic acid (CPI-613) in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes who failed previous therapy.

 Sometimes when chemotherapy or biological therapy is given, it does not stop the growth of tumor cells.

 The tumor is said to be resistant to treatment.

 6, 8-bis (benzylthio) octanoic acid may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and may be an effective treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes that did not respond to previous therapy.
