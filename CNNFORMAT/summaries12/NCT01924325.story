(fifthQuint)Apixaban Versus Dual-antiplatelet Therapy (Clopidogrel and Aspirin) in Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events.

 The ADANCE study is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial with a target enrollment of 3,000 Chinese patients.

 Two subtypes of patients will be enrolled: I, acute disabling ischemic stroke (<24 hours of symptoms onset); II, acute TIA (<24 hours of symptoms onset).

 Patients will be randomized into 3 groups: I Receiving a 75 mg dose of clopidogrel and 75mg dose of aspirin from day 1 to day 21, with placebo apixaban twice daily.

 II Receiving a 2.

5-mg twice daily of apixaban, with placebo clopidogrel and placebo aspirin from day 1 to day 21.

 III Receiving a 5-mg twice daily of apixaban, with placebo clopidogrel and placebo aspirin from day 1 to day 21.

 From day 22 to 3 months, all patients will receive 75-mg dose of clopidogrel long-term antiplatelet therapy.

 The primary efficacy end point is percentage of patients with new stroke (ischemic or hemorrhage) at 90 days.

 Apixaban Versus Dual-antiplatelet Therapy (Clopidogrel and Aspirin) in Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events@highlight

Nondisabling cerebrovascular events represent the largest group of cerebrovascular disease with a high risk of recurrent stroke.

 A recent trial indicated that clopidogrel and aspirin treatment reduced the risk of recurrent stroke and was not associated with increased hemorrhage events, compared with aspirin monotherapy.

 Apixaban, a new oral anticoagulant, is proved to be as effective as traditional anticoagulants with less risk of bleeding events.

 To estimate whether apixaban is beneficial for acute TIA or minor stroke, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled clinical trial has been designed.

 The investigators will assess the hypothesis that a 21-days apixaban regimen is superior to clopidogrel and aspirin dual-therapy for the treatment of high-risk patients with acute nondisabling cerebrovascular event.
