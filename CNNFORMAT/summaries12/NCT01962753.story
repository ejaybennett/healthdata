(firstQuint)Depression in the Elderly and Cerebral Amyloid Plaques: Characterization by [18F] AV-45 Affectives Symptoms and Amylod Plaques (ASAP).

 The main aim of this study is to assess the brain amyloid load in treated depressed elderly subjects using PET with [F18]AV45.

 The investigators hypothesize that the brain amyloid load will be higher in non or partially remitting depressed subjects treated with antidepressants than in fully remitting ones.

 An additional two years follow-up will allow comparing the brain amyloid load at baseline between those who will have evolved towards MCI or MA and those who will not, including ApoE genotype, the cognitive performances at baseline, the hippocampus volume as assessed by MRI, the type and profile of mood disorder (number of past episodes, age at first episode, vascular risk factor profile, response profile to antidepressants), as covariates.

The primary objective of the study is to compare the brain amyloid load in fully, partially and non remitting depressed elderly patients at 8 weeks of antidepressant therapy, by using PET with [F18]AV45.
