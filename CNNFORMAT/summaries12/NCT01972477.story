(fifthQuint)DLBS1449 in Diabetic Patients With Low HDL.

 There will be three groups of treatment by dosage regimen in this study.

 Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive any of the following regimens: 1) DLBS1449 at a dose of 1 x 75 mg daily, or 2) DLBS1449 at a dose of 1 x 150 mg (two capsules of DLBS1449 75 mg) daily; or 3) placebo, once daily.

 Study medication should be administered once daily, in the evening with meal, for eight weeks.

 Clinical and laboratory examinations to evaluate investigational drug's efficacy and safety will be performed at baseline and at interval of four weeks over 8-week course of therapy.

 DLBS1449 in Diabetic Patients With Low HDL@highlight

This is a parallel, 3-arm, randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled, and double-blind clinical study for eight weeks of therapy to investigate the clinical efficacy of DLBS1449 in elevating high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in diabetic patients.

 The hypothesis of interest for the study is: the administration of DLBS1449 will elevate HDL-cholesterol level from baseline to the end of study significantly higher than the elevation resulted by placebo.

 In addition, the administration of DLBS1449 at the dose of 150 mg daily will provide a significantly better response than that of the lower dose (DLBS1449 75 mg daily).
