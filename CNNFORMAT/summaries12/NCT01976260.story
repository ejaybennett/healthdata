(secondQuint)A Pilot Study Testing Fractional Radiofrequency Versus Fractional Photothermolysis for the Treatment of Acne Scars.

 Participants in this study will be patients at the dermatology clinic with icepick and boxcar acne scars on at least one 2 x 2 cm area on each side of face.

 Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive fractional radiofrequency treatment to either the right or left side of the face and the contralateral side will receive 1550-nm fractional photothermolysis.

 Subjects will receive treatments at baseline, week 4, and week 8 for a total of three treatments.

 Follow up visits will take place at week 16, two months following the last treatment visit.

 This study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these procedures.
