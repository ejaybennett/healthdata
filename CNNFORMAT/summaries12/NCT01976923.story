(fifthQuint)Pre-Operative Intravitreal Bevacizumab for Tractional Retinal Detachment Secondary to Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy.

 This will be a prospective, randomized, active-controlled study of 374 eyes of patients with the diagnosis of TRD secondary to PDR.

 Participants will be screened for eligibility.

 Eligible patients will be examined at baseline to determine their ocular condition and randomized into 2 arms.

 Patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to the study arm.

 1.

 Control arm: PPV without pre-operative bevacizumab (Sham injection).

 2.

 Study arm: Pre-operative bevacizumab (3-5 days) before PPV.

 In the study arm, an intravitreal bevacizumab injection at a dose of 1.

25 mu g/0.

05 mL will be scheduled 3 to 5 days before minimally invasive vitreoretinal surgery (MIVS).

 The purpose of the current study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of an intravitreal injection of 1.

25 mg of bevacizumab as a pre-operative adjunct to PPV in eyes with TRD secondary to PDR.

 Pre-Operative Intravitreal Bevacizumab for Tractional Retinal Detachment Secondary to Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy@highlight

The purpose of this is study is to assess the efficacy of pre-operative intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) (Genentech, South San Francisco CA) in improving visual acuity, reducing operative time, complications, intra-operative and post-operative hemorrhage following small gauge pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) (23-gauge, 25-gauge or 27-gauge ) compared to small gauge PPV (23-gauge, 25-gauge or 27-gauge) alone in eyes with tractional retinal detachment (TRD) secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).

 Hypothesis: Preoperative IVB may be beneficial for membrane dissection in diabetic tractional retinal detachment with minimally invasive vitreoretinal surgery (23-gauge transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy [TSV]).

 In addition, post-operative rebleeding may be decreased.
