(firstQuint)Examination of the Pancreas in New-onset Diabetes.

 Compared to the general population, subjects >50 years of age with new-onset diabetes (DM) are 8-times more likely to have pancreatic cancer (PaC).

 The likelihood of PaC in new-onset DM is further increased in those who have weight loss or elevated CA19-9.

 In this study patients with newly diagnosed diabetes will be prospectively identified.

 Those with weight loss and/or elevated pancreatic cancer marker (CA 19-9) will undergo pancreatic imaging.

 All subjects will be followed up to 24 months.

 If successful in identifying surgically removable PaC, this study will fundamentally change our practice and will be a major breakthrough in PaC treatment and research.
