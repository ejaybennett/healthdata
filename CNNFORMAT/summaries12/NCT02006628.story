(thirdQuint)A Study of GWP42003 as Adjunctive Therapy in the First Line Treatment of Schizophrenia or Related Psychotic Disorder.

 This eight-week (six week treatment period and two week follow-up), multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group study aims to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of GWP42003 in patients with schizophrenia or a related psychotic disorder.

 Eligible subjects will enter the study at a Screening and Randomisation Visit (Visit 1, Day 1), where the following information will be obtained for each participant: 1.

 Informed consent 2.

 Demographics 3.

 Physical examination 5.

 Electrocardiogram (ECG) 6.

 Vital signs 7.

 Pregnancy test (if appropriate) 8.

 Safety blood test (biochemistry and haematology) 9.

 Efficacy blood test (plasma cannabinoid levels, serum High Density Lipoprotein [HDL]-Cholesterol [C] levels, serum prolactin levels and markers of inflammation) 10.

 Urinalysis (including drugs of abuse screen) 11.

 Concomitant medications (current and recent) 12.

 Assessment of schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder symptom severity (positive, negative and general) 13.

 Severity of mental illness 14.

 Assessment of functional ability (social, occupational and psychological) 15.

 Severity of Parkinsonian symptomatology (rigidity) 16.

 Assessment of cognition 17.

 A second (Visit 2, Day 8) and third (Visit 3, Day 22) visit will take place mid-treatment, where the following assessments will be performed: 1.

 Assessment of schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder symptom severity (positive, negative and general) 2.

 Severity of mental illness and level of change since baseline 3.

 Assessment of functional ability (social, occupational and psychological) 4.

 Severity of Parkinsonian symptomatology (rigidity) 5.

 Assessment of cognition 6.

 Waist circumference In addition, a safety blood test and efficacy blood test will also be performed during the third visit (Visit 3, Day 22).

 A further visit will take place at the end of treatment (Visit 4, Day 43), where the following assessments will be performed: 1.

 Assessment of schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder symptom severity (positive, negative and general) 2.

 Severity of mental illness and level of change since baseline 3.

 Assessment of functional ability (social, occupational and psychological) 4.

 Severity of Parkinsonian symptomatology (rigidity) 5.

 Assessment of cognition 6.

 Safety assessments (AEs) 12.

 ECG 13.

 Safety blood test 14.

 Efficacy blood test 15.

 Urinalysis (including drugs of abuse screen) 16.

 Pregnancy test (if appropriate) 17.

 Physical examination 18.

 Vital signs 19.

 Body weight 20.

 BMI 21.

 Waist circumference 22.

 Review of dependence disorders (if applicable) There will be a safety follow-up telephone following the end of treatment (Visit 5, Day 57), which will involve a review of any new or ongoing AEs and changes to concomitant medications.

 A Study of GWP42003 as Adjunctive Therapy in the First Line Treatment of Schizophrenia or Related Psychotic Disorder@highlight

A study to compare the change in symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder when treated with GWP42003 or placebo, added to existing anti-psychotic therapy over a period of six weeks.

 Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of GWP42003 on quality of life and cognition and to assess the safety and tolerability of GWP42003.
