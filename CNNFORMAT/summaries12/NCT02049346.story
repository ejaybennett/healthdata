 Study Subjects All haemodialysis patients of the main dialysis centers in Qatar (Doha, Alkhour and Alwakra) were screened.

 Study Design This is a prospective, randomized, comparative, open label study.

 The study has passed through three phases; the first phase was screening period for 4 weeks, the 2nd phase was titration period for 12 weeks and the third phase was evaluation period for 24 weeks.

 All patients have entered a 4-week screening/baseline period during which they continued to receive their previous Epoetin beta or alfa treatment.

 Eligible patients were then randomly assigned (1:1:1), either to continue on the previous same dose and route of administration of Epoetin alpha or beta (Epoetin group), or to receive Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp (R) Amgen) every week or 2weeks (Darbepoetin group) or methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera (R) Roche ,F.

 Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) once monthly (C.

 group).

 In the second group Subjects who were receiving Epoetin alpha/ beta two or three times a week were switched to Darbepoetin alfa once a week, while those receiving Epoetin alpha or beta once a week were switched to Darbepoetin alfa once every 2 weeks.

 Two hundred IU Epoetin: 1 mcg Darbepoetin alfa ratio was used to determine the starting dose of Darbepoetin alfa.

 If a dose of Epoetin alpha or beta does not equate exactly to a unit dose of Darbepoetin alfa at switching, then the nearest available unit dose of Darbepoetin alfa was used.

 Darbepoetin alfa doses were adjusted according to the approved prescribing information, without additional restrictions.

 In the third group Mircera(R) (F.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.

, Basel, Switzerland) is provided as pre-filled syringes.

 Intravenous monthly administration was carried out.

 The initial dose was 120 mcg, 200 mcg or 360 mcg, provided that patient had previously received a weekly dose of Epoetin alpha/ beta of less than 8000 IU, between 8000 to16 000 IU or more than16000IU respectively.

 The study was conducted in accordance with the revised Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by our internal research committee.

 Written informed consent was obtained from all studied patients.

 The study has primarily evaluated the whole population of haemodialysis patients in Qatar.

 Laboratory assessment of the haemoglobin, haematocrit, white blood cell count, platelet count was measured at weekly intervals.

 Aspartate amino transferase, alanine aminotransferase, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, C- reactive protein, potassium, phosphorus, serum ferritin, serum iron, serum transferrin, total iron-binding capacity were measured at monthly intervals.

 Physical examinations including chest, heart, abdomen examination and evaluation of the volume status were performed at baseline, monthly and at the final visit.

 Fractional clearance of urea (Kt/V) or urea reduction ratio was used to assess adequacy of haemodialysis at baseline then monthly as unit protocol.

 Data were collected in data collection forms.

 Data Management and Analysis plan Collected data was fed in excel sheet and then converted to SPSS 14.

0 statistical package for analysis.

 Descriptive statistics were performed for all the continuous and categorical variables appropriately.

 Parametric and non parametric statistical techniques were applied to see significance difference between the groups.

 P value 0.

05 (two tailed) or less was considered as statistical significant level.

 Comparison Among Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents@highlight

* Background: Despite extensive use, to the best of our knowledge, no trial has simultaneously compared the three currently used erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) in a prospective manner, in treatment of anemia of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.

 * Patients and Methods: All haemodialysis patients in Qatar who were treated with short acting Epoetin alfa or beta were screened.

 Eligible patients were randomized, either to continue on the previous regimen of Epoetin, or to receive Darbepoetin alfa or continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (C.

 All groups were assessed at the end of the study for safety and efficacy parameters.
