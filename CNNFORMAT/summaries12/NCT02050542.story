(thirdQuint)Study of Current Practice Which Compare the Rate of Prostate Cancer by Using 2 Kind of Transrectal Biopsies: 3 by IRM-echography Image Fusion and 12 Systematized Guided Echographies.

.

 The act of current practice evaluated by this research is the act of prostate biopsies : the patient will have to undergo 12 systematized transrectal echography guided biopsies of the prostate and 3 additional biopsies targeted on the suspicious lesion detected with MRI, which are both done in current practice.

 - A first operator is not informed of the location of the target.

 He will perform a series of 12 systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies of the prostate.

 - Immediately after the second operator will perform 3 additional targeted biopsies on the suspicious image detected by IRM, guided by a fusion of MRI and ultrasound- images with the Koelis (R) system Act added by the research: Using a fusion of MRI - ultrasound images software system (Koelis (R)).

@highlight

The purpose of the study is to show that 3 targeted biopsies on the suspicious image detected by IRM, guided by a fusion of MRI and ultrasound- images with the Koelis (R) system, will get no lower rate of cancer detection than those obtained by 12 systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies of the prostate.
