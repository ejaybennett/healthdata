(thirdQuint)Changes in Bacterial Flora Among Patients With Pelvic Bedsores: a Prospective Pilot Study.

 The secondary objectives of this study are: A.

 To compare bacterial communities collected from superficial versus deep samples of stage 3 or 4 sacral bedsores using metagenomics and standard culturing methods.

 B.

 To characterize the evolution of digestive bacterial flora in the same patients over a period of 28 days.

 Changes in terms of pathogenic, potentially pathogenic and non-pathogenic will be described, as well as the appearance of resistance phenotypes.

 C.

 To characterize the evolution of urinary bacterial flora in the same patients over a period of 28 days.

 Changes in terms of pathogenic, potentially pathogenic and non-pathogenic will be described, as well as the appearance of resistance phenotypes.

 Changes in Bacterial Flora Among Patients With Pelvic Bedsores: a Prospective Pilot Study@highlight

The main objective of this study is to characterize the evolution (over a period of 28 days) of superficial and deep bacterial skin flora in patients with stage 3 or 4 sacral pressure ulcers (bedsores).

 Changes in terms of pathogenic, potentially pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial species at the intra-individual and population levels.
