This is an expanded access program (EAP) for participants who have progressed after prior systemic therapy including ipilimumab, and V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) inhibitor or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) enzyme inhibitor when indicated.

 Participants cannot be eligible for or have participated in any pembrolizumab (MK-3475) clinical trial with the exception of a participant enrolled in the pembrolizumab protocol MK-3475-006 who received treatment on the ipilimumab treatment arm and progressed; such participants will be eligible to participate in the EAP, regardless of prior treatment with a BRAF/MEK inhibitor, as long as all other eligibility criteria for MK-3475-030 are met.
