(secondQuint)An Open-label Randomized Multicenter Phase III Clinical Study Comparing Safety and Efficacy of Algeron (Cepeginterferon Alfa-2b) and and PegIntron (Peginterferon Alfa-2b) in Combination With Ribavirin as Combined Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 Infected Patients.

 The course of treatment in both groups shall be 12 weeks, and efficacy analysis, i.

e.

 rate of rapid (after the 4th week) and early (after the 12th week) virologic response will be based on polymerase chain reaction data.

 For patients with treatment failure after the 12th week the antiviral therapy shall be discontinued.
