(fifthQuint)ICG Use in Angiography for Nasoseptal Flap Harvest.

 This study is being done to determine if it is feasible to use angiography during endo-nasal surgery.

 During the angiography indocyanine green (ICG) will be injected into the patients IV tubing to help see the arteries.

 ICG is routinely used in vascular surgeries on the brain but not for endo-nasal surgery.

 The purpose of this study is to see how well intraoperative angiography using ICG can be done during endonasal surgery.

 ICG Use in Angiography for Nasoseptal Flap Harvest@highlight

This is a feasibility study in which indocyanine green (ICG) will be administered during routine expanded endonasal approach (EEA) for cranial base pathologies in which a nasoseptal flap harvest will be necessary.

 The research entails administering ICG, which is already widely used during open neurosurgical procedures, to identify the blood supply at two distinct stages of endonasal cranial base surgery: during nasoseptal flap harvest and after final positioning of the nasoseptal flap to ensure its viability before ending the case.
