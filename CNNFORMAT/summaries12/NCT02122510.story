(secondQuint)Transverse Abdominal Block for Analgesia in Casarean Section.

 The investigators will study 60 ASA [American Society of Anesthesiologist] physical status I and patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery at tanta University Hospital, in a prospective, randomized, comparative, clinical trial.

 Patients will be randomly allocated to two equal groups (n = 30) using closed envelopes labeled 1,and 2 reflecting group 1and 2 respectively.

 The drugs are prepared by the anesthesiologist who is not involved in the study or data collection.

 Group I: (n=30) will receive pre-delivery bilateral TAP block with 10 ml of bupivacaine 0.

5 % mixed with 10 ml saline and 10 1/2g dexmetonedine in 20 ml syringe labeled G 2.

 Group II: (n=30) will receive post-delivery bilateral TAP block with 10 ml of bupivacaine 0.

5 % mixed with 10 ml saline in 20 ml syringe labeled G2.
