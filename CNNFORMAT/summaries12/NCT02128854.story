(thirdQuint)Tablet-Aided BehavioraL Intervention EffecT on Self-management Skills.

 The proposed study will assess the feasibility of recruitment of African American adults residing in rural South Carolina who will assist with improving the usability of tablet computers.

 In addition, we will implement a pilot trial of the TABLETS (Tablet-Aided BehavioraL intervention Effect on Self-management skills) intervention for diabetes, using motivational strategies, among rural African Americans.

 The proposed project is designed to address 3 important issues: recruitment for a hard-to-reach population, utility of technology-enabled intervention, and development of a tablet-aided intervention tailored to understand best practices for diabetes self-management.
