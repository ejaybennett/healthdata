(firstQuint)AURA-LV: Aurinia Urinary Protein Reduction Active - Lupus With Voclosporin (AURA-LV).

 Voclosporin is a next generation CNI intended for use in the prevention of organ graft rejection and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

 The aim of the current study is to investigate whether voclosporin added to the standard of care treatment in active LN is able to reduce disease activity, as measured by a reduction in proteinuria.

 Two doses of voclosporin will be studied and compared in a placebo controlled trial on a background of MMF and corticosteroids.

 Patients with active, flaring LN will be eligible to enter the study.

 They are required to have a diagnosis of LN according to established diagnostic criteria (American College of Rheumatology) and clinical and biopsy features suggestive of active nephritis.

 Efficacy will be assessed by the ability of the drug combination to reduce the level of proteinuria while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.
