(fifthQuint)Sorafenib Tosylate With or Without Everolimus in Treating Patients With Advanced, Radioactive Iodine Refractory Hurthle Cell Thyroid Cancer.

 This randomized Phase II trial will compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of sorafenib and everolimus versus sorafenib alone in patients with radioactive iodine refractory hurthle cell thyroid cancer.

 Prior studies have shown that the median PFS is generally around 4.

5 months for sorafenib alone in this disease population.

 It is hoped that the combination of everolimus and sorafenib can increase the median PFS to at least 9 months.

 In addition to PFS, this trial will also compare the confirmed response rate, overall survival (OS) and adverse event rates between sorafenib and everolimus vs.

 sorafenib alone.

 The primary and secondary objectives for the study are listed below.

 Primary Objective: To compare the progression free survival between sorafenib and everolimus versus sorafenib alone in patients with radioactive iodine refractory Hurthle cell thyroid cancer Secondary Objective: To compare the confirmed response rate, overall survival and adverse event rates between sorafenib and everolimus versus sorafenib alone.

 Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable adverse events.

 Patients will be followed for 5 years after randomization.

 Sorafenib Tosylate With or Without Everolimus in Treating Patients With Advanced, Radioactive Iodine Refractory Hurthle Cell Thyroid Cancer@highlight

This randomized phase II trial studies the effects, good and bad, of using everolimus along with sorafenib tosylate versus sorafenib tosylate alone in treating patients with advanced radioactive iodine refractory thyroid cancer.

 Sorafenib tosylate and everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 The addition of everolimus to sorafenib tosylate may cause more shrinkage of thyroid cancer and may prevent it from growing but it could also cause more side effects than sorafenib tosylate alone.

 It is not yet known whether this treatment with sorafenib tosylate and everolimus is better, the same, or worse than sorafenib tosylate alone.
