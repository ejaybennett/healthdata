(fifthQuint)Automatic Self Transcending Meditation Versus Treatment as Usual.

 Late life depression and cardiovascular autonomic function: Major depressive disorder in the elderly (in those >60 years of age), also known as late life depression (LLD), is common, disabling and associated with a high mortality rate caused by suicide as well as cardiovascular events compelling appropriate treatment.

 Research shows that in a naturalistic setting response rate to at least one antidepressant trial of adequate dose and duration alone is around 30-40%thereby necessitating usage of additional interventions.

 Such therapies include psychological therapies, and, recently, various forms of treatments loosely defined as mind-body therapies such as biofeedback, energy healing, meditation, guided imagery, and yoga.

 Mind-body therapies are being increasingly embraced by patients as they have negligible side effects, are easy to administer and display beneficial effects on the quality of life as well as comorbid anxiety.

 There is increasing research on the mechanisms and benefits of such therapies, however, good quality trial data is scant.

 It is well established that antidepressants work by mostly modifying neurotransmitter levels in the brain.

 On the other hand, some mind-body therapies target multiple organ systems and hence could offer neurobiological advantages as depression is now recognised as a multi-system disorder.

 This is particularly relevant to the LLD population where there is increased prevalence of comorbid cardiovascular disorders .

 Hence, some mind body therapies when offered in combination with antidepressants might have a beneficial effect on both depression and the cardiovascular system.

 One of the ways of assessing the cardiovascular system is through measurement of various autonomic parameters i.

e.

 heart rate, blood pressure and heart rate variability.

 The most commonly reported is heart rate variability (HRV) which is a manifestation of the interplay of the central nervous system and the autonomic nervous system on a beat-by-beat basis.

 One of the ways of its estimation is by calculating the elapsed time between two consecutive waves, called R waves, on a person's electrocardiogram (ECG).

 A consistent finding has been that there is reduced HRV in people who have suffered a myocardial infarction (MI), and this phenomena is a predictor of subsequent cardiac arrhythmia and even death.

 In addition, through previous work the PI has found that in LLD there are significant cardiovascular autonomic disturbances compared to age matched controls after controlling for various risk factors.

 Other studies conducted in depression across the human life span have found similar results.

 Hence, if there is a mind-body treatment that specifically targets autonomic dysfunction and has a positive benefit on depressive symptoms, it would be valuable to asses.

 The investigators would like to investigate such a therapy which has been selected based on previous reports of beneficial effects but has not been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial of LLD patients.

 Automatic self-transcending meditation (ASTM).

 ASTM is a class of meditation that helps quiet the mind and induces physiological and mental relaxation whilst the eyes are shut.

 It utilizes a specific sound value (mantra) to draw attention inward and permit the mind to experience a restful but alert state of consciousness.

 Research suggests that ASTM is easier to learn and to teach in comparison to other meditation techniques including mindfulness.

 Studies of adult and elderly ASTM practitioners have documented reductions in depressive symptoms, as well as improvements in cardiovascular function among elderly with and without cardiovascular disease.

 A study of adults with CVD further demonstrated improvements in HRV.

 Research further suggests ASTM may be particularly well suited to elderly populations.

 In a randomized controlled trial of elderly retirement home residents which evaluated ASTM with two other meditative techniques and treatment as usual, ASTM produced significantly greater improvements in cognitive function, cardiovascular function and quality of life than all other treatment conditions.

 A subsequent meta-analysis of all-cause mortality rates among hypertensive elderly who had participated in stress reduction interventions found that ASTM practitioners had a 30% lower cardiovascular mortality rate than four other meditative or relaxation interventions20.

 The investigators predict that ASTM augmentation is an effective intervention that ameliorates the autonomic disturbance associated with LLD, and possibly has beneficial effects on depressive symptoms as compared to a control treatment as usual (TAU) group.

 Primary hypothesis: The investigators hypothesise that in patients with LLD, ASTM+TAU will lead to a significant increase in HRV from baseline to end of study period as compared to TAU.

 Secondary hypotheses: The investigators hypothesise that ASTM+TAU will cause a) significant fall in depression scores b) significant improvement in other autonomic parameters including heart rate and blood pressure changes in presence of a physiological stress test (hand grip) c) significant improvement in depression related symptom pathologies including impaired quality of life and anxiety; compared to TAU.

 Automatic Self Transcending Meditation Versus Treatment as Usual@highlight

Depression is a leading contributor to global burden of disease.

 Antidepressants do not provide adequate response for many patients.

 Mind-body therapies are often safe, increasingly embraced by patients albeit the limited good quality clinical trial data.

 The PI has shown that there is autonomic instability in patients with late life depression (LLD).

 Through his team of across discipline researchers he will investigate benefits of one adjunctive mind-body intervention, automatic self transcending meditation on autonomic instability in LLD and depressive symptoms compared to treatment as usual.

 If results are positive, such an intervention could be used for management of LLD across all levels of care.

 WHAT IS THE INNOVATION AND MAIN QUESTION/HYPOTHESIS UNDERLYING THIS PROPOSAL? The main study objectives are to assess heart rate variability (HRV), other autonomic parameters and depression scores in patients with late life depression undergoing an innovative mind-body therapy 'automatic self-transcending meditation' (ASTM) not previously evaluated in a randomized controlled manner in the treatment of late life depression:The investigators hypothesise that in patients with LLD treatment as usual(TAU) +ASTM will lead to a significant increase in HRV from baseline to end of study period as compared to treatment as usual TAU.

 The investigators also hypothesise that ASTM+TAU will cause a significant difference in other autonomic parameters including heart rate and blood pressure changes in presence of a physiological stress test (hand grip), depression and depression related pathologies such as anxiety and improve quality of life compared to TAU.

 It is expected that adding ASTM to TAU will be better than TAU in improving HRV, depression severity and other autonomic parameters in the treatment of LLD.

 It is expected that this intervention will produce significant anxiolytic and enhanced quality of life outcomes and will have no major side effects.

 If the results of this study are positive, it is possible that this intervention could be considered as treatment option for the management of this disabling illness in primary, secondary and tertiary care.

 Such treatment option would be more cost and staff effective, and self empowering than the current standard of care.

 It could also provide treatment options for patients who are currently resistant to their antidepressants.
