(fifthQuint)rTMS to Improve Cognitive Function in TBI.

 The goal of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and durability of benefits of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) as a promising non-invasive therapeutic treatment for executive function deficits reported in Veterans with mild to moderate Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients.

 Although much progress has been made towards understanding the various deficits following TBI, progress has yet to be made towards identifying and assessing therapeutic treatment options that are responsive to TBI symptoms.

 Many returning OEF/OIF Veterans with concussion histories report cognitive symptoms that may last for months or years, and affect every day function.

 Symptoms faced by Veterans with mild to moderate TBI include executive function deficits such as impaired attention (including shifting sets), verbal fluency, poor planning, reduced working memory, and mental flexibility.

 The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of rTMS in Veterans with mild to moderate TBI in improving executive functioning.

 A recent VA study reported improvements in PTSD and related symptoms in Veterans with PTSD who received rTMS (Watts et al.

, 2012).

 Repetitive TMS is a method of delivering therapeutic, non-invasive brain stimulation that is currently being used at the VA Palo Alto and Stanford University in a number of clinical trials.

 For this pilot study the investigators propose to enroll 40 Veterans diagnosed with mild to moderate TBI (age range 20-65).

 Inclusion Criteria: mild and moderate TBI will be defined as: post-traumatic amnesia (PTA x 1 SD on either the Trail Making Test part B, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System [D-KEFS] Verbal Fluency and/or D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test).

 Additional analysis will include: Sustained Improvement on executive function composite score; secondary consequences of TBI scores on Quality of Life (QOL) scale, moderators of response such as age, severity of symptoms at baseline, type of comorbidity (e.

g.

, PTSD); and, functional brain activity changes with rTMS treatment.

 This pilot study will be one of the first to demonstrate rTMS as a treatment for executive function deficit in Veterans with mild to moderate TBI.

 Additionally, it would also report on the efficacy of using functional MRI (fMRI) as a biomarker to capture this improvement in executive function.

 rTMS to Improve Cognitive Function in TBI@highlight

This project will study 40 Veterans identified with symptoms understood to characterize mild to moderate Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

 Following screening and informed consent, Veterans will be randomly assigned to treatment with repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) or sham rTMS (placebo).

 Additional examinations will compare brain imaging (structural and functional MRI scans at rest) across participants at baseline, after acute rTMS treatment, and at 6 month followup.

 The VA population differs significantly from populations that have been included in prior trials of rTMS for many conditions such as depression, chronic pain, and PTSD.

 Many returning Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) personnel and Veterans with concussion histories report cognitive problems, such as impaired attention, verbal fluency, poor planning, reduced working memory, and mental flexibility.

 The investigators hope to show the efficacy and durability of rTMS in treating these symptoms safely in Veterans with co-morbidities.
