(fifthQuint)Thermal Compression Device for Maintenance of Perioperative Normothermia.

 Cases of inadvertent perioperative hypothermia (IPH) within a hospital setting are often overlooked and should be where the incidence of hypothermia can be eliminated.

 Heat loss occurs predominantly via convective heat transfer, particularly through glabrous surfaces such as the palms and soles.

 A decrease in core body temperature can be categorized into mild (32 deg C-36 deg C), moderate (28 deg C-32 deg C), or severe (C.

 This was shown previously to be the higher limit and optimal preoperative warming temperature.

 This was shown previously to be the higher limit and optimal preoperative warming temperature.

 The experiment showed that core temperature was maintained in three of the four subjects with one patient becoming hypothermic in the pre device on period.

 Arm temperature was constant and hypothermic during the experiment.

 Leg temperature increased with the device on.

 Thermal comfort and general comfort levels showed the prototype was well tolerated.

 The investigators hope to learn from the study: Prototype development What are the best configurations to apply the device to the patient? Safety Will the device maintain a consistent temperature at the skin? Will there be no burns occuring? Will the patient not get hyperthermic? Efficacy Will the device keep the patient from getting cold? If so, what are the relative effects of warming at the soles of the feet and / or with waring at the popliteal fossa? If efficacy is established, is it better than / equivalent to the gold standard of the forced air warming blanket? Usability Does the device fit into the operative workflow What are the opinions of the users (patients, nurses, doctors) about the usability of the device? Will the device causes patient discomfort while they are awake? Does it improve their thermal comfort?.

 Thermal Compression Device for Maintenance of Perioperative Normothermia@highlight

Getting cold (not maintaining normothermia) around surgery (perioperative period) leads to many negative outcomes for patients including increased wound complications, abnormal heart rhythms and increased blood loss.

 These all lead to increased length of hospital stay and higher requirements for post operative monitoring.

 These add to around $3500 of extra costs per patient.

 The investigators aim to study the effects of a warming device, placed around the patient's legs and/or feet, to determine it's safety, efficacy and eventually compare to the current gold standard of a forced air warming blanket.

 Forced air warming has been associated with the spread of germs over the surgical field.

 Hence the need for warming equipment that won't do that.
