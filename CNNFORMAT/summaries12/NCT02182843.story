The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients who undergo ACDF procedures using Cellentra Viable Cell Bone Matrix (VCBM), cortical allograft spacers, and the MaxAn(R) Anterior Cervical Plate System.

 Cellentra VCBM will be compared to published data for autograft in NDI (Neck Disability Index) improvement and radiographic success of fusion.
