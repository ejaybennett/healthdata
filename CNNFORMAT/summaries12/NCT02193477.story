(secondQuint)Effect of TEAS on the Incidence Rate of SIRS in Patients Undergoing Abdominal Surgery.

 Patients undergoing elective radical surgery for gastric cancer under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to three groups, control group , TEAS group and sham TEAS group.

 TEAS group receiving TEAS before general anesthesia induction , 1th day and 2nd day after surgery.

 TEAS was given through electrodes attached to specific acupoints.

 The time for TEAS was 30min.

 Sham TEAS group receiving sham TEAS before general anesthesia induction , 1th day and 2nd day after surgery.

 Sham TEAS was given through electrodes attached to non-acupoints.

 The time for sham TEAS was also 30min.

 Control group were given no TEAS.

 Incidence rates of SIRS in each group were compared .

Venous blood samples from all groups(control group , TEAS group and sham TEAS group) were collected before general anesthesia induction,1th day and 3rd day after surgery.

 Inflammatory cytokines index including interleukin-6,interleukin-10,Tumor Necrosis Factor- alpha(TNF-),Interferon-(IFN-),Monocyte Chemotactic Protein 1(MCP-1),IgG,IgM were measured.

 Effect of TEAS on the Incidence Rate of SIRS in Patients Undergoing Abdominal Surgery@highlight

The purpose of this study is to access the effect of Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation(TEAS) on the Incidence rate of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) in patients undergoing radical surgery for gastric cancer
