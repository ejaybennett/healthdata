(thirdQuint)Leipzig Adipose Tissue Childhood Cohort.

 The investigators aim to identify how adipose tissue dysfunction in childhood contributes to the development of obesity and related comorbidities and to characterize factors that play a role in the development of adipose dysfunction in children.

 The investigators will employ a translational approach which is based on the characterization of adipose tissue biology in samples of children to determine alterations leading to adipose tissue dysfunction.

 These include assessment of the composition (including BAT), remodeling, function, metabolism and inflammation of adipose tissue as well as the adipokine profile.

 For the assessment of clinical relevance, these experimental data will then be correlated with the clinical phenotype.

 Finally, we aim to identify factors responsible for early adipose tissue dysfunction and characterize them for their clinical and functional relevance.

 Leipzig Adipose Tissue Childhood Cohort@highlight

In this study the investigators hypothesize that pathological alterations in adipose tissue biology already occur during the development and progression of obesity in children and adolescents.

 The investigators aim to identify and characterize mechanisms and molecular targets that affect the development of adipose tissue and ensuing obesity in childhood and adolescence.
