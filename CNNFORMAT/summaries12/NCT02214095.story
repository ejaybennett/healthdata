(thirdQuint)Glucosamine Periodontal Adjunctive Therapy.

 Targeting the inflammatory response may be a rational approach to the medical treatment of chronic periodontitis.

 Glucosamine sulphate (GS) was proven to have anti-inflammatory actions with minimal side effect profile.

 Objectives; The main objectives of this study were to evaluate clinically the efficacy of GS; as a novel adjunctive host modulating agent in periodontal therapy and to investigate its effect on gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) level of IL-1.

 Methods; Forty patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis (CP) were included in this study.

 They were randomly divided into two groups.

 Group I (G1) patients (n=20) received 500 mg GS capsules three times daily for 3 months following full mouth scaling and root planing (SRP), while group II (G2) patients (n=20) received a placebo for the same period following full mouth SRP.

 Clinical periodontal parameters and GCF IL-1 levels were analyzed at baseline and 3 months following therapy.

 Glucosamine Periodontal Adjunctive Therapy@highlight

This study is the first evidence based work evaluated the systemic use of glucosamine as an adjunctive therapy to closed mechanical debridement in chronic periodontitis.

 The use of glucosamine sulphate was correlated with clinical outcomes and IL1- level in the GCF of patients with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis
