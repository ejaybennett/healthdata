(firstQuint)Muscle Insulin Resistance in Aging (Mirage).

 Study Objectives: 1.

 To determine the effects of diet-induced weight loss with and without the addition of exercise on mitochondrial biogenesis and energetic capacity, cellular redox state and insulin resistance.

 2.

 To determine the effects of diet-induced weight loss with and without the addition of exercise on intramyocellular lipid profiles.

 3.

 To determine the effects of diet-induced weight loss with and without exercise on skeletal muscle proteins mediating a program of autophagy and either loss or maintenance of muscle mass.
