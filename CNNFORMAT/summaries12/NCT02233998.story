(fifthQuint)A Clinical Trial to Test the Effect of Marketed Mouth Rinses on Decreasing Plaque and Gum Inflammation.

 A sufficient number of generally healthy subjects (approximately 165) that meet the required inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in this 21 day, examiner-blind, single center, randomized, parallel-group controlled clinical trial to ensure that at least 150 subjects (50 per treatment group) complete this study.

 At baseline, the prescreened subjects will present to the clinic site for baseline examinations (oral tissue assessment, gingivitis, bleeding and plaque assessments) having refrained from oral hygiene for at least 8 hours, but no more than 18 hours.

 After the baseline oral examinations, assessment of other inclusion/exclusion criteria qualifying subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups.

 Immediately following this randomization, subjects will begin use of their assigned test product following the label instructions.

 If randomized to the control group, subjects will brush twice daily in their usual manner with an ADA accepted fluoride toothpaste and a soft bristled toothbrush followed by rinsing twice daily with a 5% hydroalcohol control rinse (W002194-221P).

 If randomized to an active treatment group; subjects will brush twice daily in their usual manner, followed by rinsing twice daily with their assigned mouth rinse formulation (19292-116A or 11965-059).

 Subjects will be instructed to follow label instructions 20ml for 30 seconds twice daily for mouth rinse product.

 The first product use will be conducted under the supervision of study personnel.

 All other brushing and rinsing will be unsupervised and the subjects will be required to maintain a diary card to document twice daily product use, brushing and rinsing times.

 Compliance will be evaluated by weighing residual volumes of returned mouth rinse and by reviewing the subject diary.

 Subjects will receive an ADA- accepted fluoride-containing dentifrice and a soft bristled toothbrush at their baseline visit.

 Subjects may continue to use floss to remove impacted food between the teeth if it is part of their usual oral care regimen during the course of the study; no other oral hygiene procedures will be permitted, including teeth cleaning, whitening or dental procedures except for an emergency treatment.

 The decision to withdraw a subject due to emergency dental treatment will occur at the discretion of the Investigator.

 At baseline and three weeks (2 days) visits, subject will not have brushed or have used their product for at least 8 hours, but no more than 18 hours.

 Oral tissue safety, Modified Gingival Index (MGI), Bleeding Index (BI), and Plaque Index (PI) will be assessed.

 A Clinical Trial to Test the Effect of Marketed Mouth Rinses on Decreasing Plaque and Gum Inflammation@highlight

The reduction of existing plaque and gum inflammation will be evaluated using two marketed mouth rinses along with tooth brushing after 21 days of use compared to a placebo mouth rinse.

 165 healthy volunteers will be enrolled in this three week study.

 Volunteers who qualify to be in this study will have an equal chance of being assigned to one of the three treatment groups.

 Volunteers will have a total of three visits including 1) Screening/Baseline Day 1 2) Day 11 (after 10 days of use) and 3) Day 22 (after 21 days of use).

 Volunteers will maintain a diary at home to record each treatment use and will be asked to come to the clinic without brushing or use their product for at least 8 hours, but no more than 18 hours.

 Examinations for oral hard/soft tissue, gingivitis, bleeding and plaque assessments will be completed at Screening/Baseline and repeated at Clinic Visit 3, which is Day 22.
