(fifthQuint)Phase I Trial Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oxfendazole.

 This Phase I study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of the safety and pharmacokinetics of escalating single oral doses of oxfendazole (0.

5 to 60 mg/kg) in healthy volunteers.

 Up to 70 healthy males and females (non-chldbearing potential), ages 18-45 volunteers recruited from one site will participate in this study.

 The study duration is approximately 18 months with subject participation of 2 weeks.

 The primary objective assess the safety and tolerability of oxfendazole in healthy adults.

 The secondary objectives assess the pharmacokinetic profile of oxfendazole and assess the metabolism of oxfendazole.

 Two sentinel subjects will receive the study product (1 drug/1 placebo) in each group and be monitored 48 hours for adverse events prior to completing enrollment of the remaining 8 subjects in the group.

 Phase I Trial Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oxfendazole@highlight

The objectives of the Phase I study are to evaluate the safety and tolerance of increasing single oral doses of oxfendazole in healthy volunteers.

The secondary objectives assess the pharmacokinetic profile of oxfendazole and assess the metabolism of oxfendazole.

 The description of agent used is single oral dose of an aqueous suspension of oxfendazole, a benzimidazole carbamate antiparasitic drug.

 Each new cohort will be dosed only after the two week safety data for the preceding group have been reviewed.

 If a clinically significant AE is observed, and if this event is drug-related the safety monitoring committee will be convened to determine whether the study should continue.
