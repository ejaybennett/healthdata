(fifthQuint)Safety and Performance Study of Large Hole Vascular Closure Device.

 This study will be a prospective, multi-centred, non-randomized study to investigate the safety and performance of the VIVASURE CLOSURE DEVICE cent .

 The study shall not be blinded prior to, during or post the procedure.

 All patients undergoing a procedure requiring an arteriotomy in the range of 18 to 24 F, via the common femoral artery will be screened against the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

 If the patient meets the requirements of the clinical investigation, they shall be invited to participate, provide informed consent and shall subsequently be assigned a subject number.

 All subjects shall have an immediately post procedure, 24 hour, 1, 3 and 12 month follow-up assessment.

 Safety data from the follow-ups will be assessed by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee.

 Safety and Performance Study of Large Hole Vascular Closure Device@highlight

The purpose of this Clinical Investigation is to validate that the clinical use of the VIVASURE CLOSURE DEVICE cent is safe for the operator, patient and third parties, and to confirm its performance to percutaneously close femoral arterial puncture sites in the range of 18-24 F, post endovascular procedures.

 This is a non-inferiority study based on safety.

 Safety will be assessed by incidence and severity of major complication rates directly related to the VIVASURE CLOSURE DEVICE cent up to 3 months from implantation is no worse than those associated with cut-down and sutured close.
