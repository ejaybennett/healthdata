(fifthQuint)Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Dolutegravir in Pregnant HIV Mothers and Their Neonates: A Pilot Study.

 Antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy is able to effectively reduce mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV.

 If untreated, the risk of transmission is around 25% (greater with high viral loads) but ART administered optimally during pregnancy may reduce this risk to 1-2%.

 In order to successfully prevent infection, ART should be started in the first or second trimester, and should reduce maternal plasma viral load to undetectable levels.

 Unfortunately throughout low-middle income countries, MTCT rates are unacceptably high with an estimated 430 000 newborn children infected annually.

 The main causes for this are undiagnosed or late diagnosis of maternal infection, suboptimal adherence to therapy and drug resistance, particularly in mothers who have previously received single dose nevirapine.

 In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), women frequently engage with health services late in pregnancy, and new HIV diagnoses in the third trimester (28 weeks of pregnancy) are not uncommon.

 Risk of MTCT is high, especially as NNRTI-based therapy takes a median of 2 months to significantly reduce the HIV viral load, making it unlikely that commencement of these drugs in late pregnancy will offer protection of the infant from intrapartum transmission.

 Vertical transmission of HIV remains a significant challenge in developing countries and antiretroviral prophylaxis for PMTCT is an important tool towards elimination of paediatric infections.

 Between 2009 and 2010, coverage of antiretroviral prophylaxis for prevention of mother to child transmission was 42% and an estimated 1.

48 million infants were born to women living with HIV (WHO 2010).

 Global efforts are geared towards improving access to antiretrovirals for PMTCT by simplifying antiretroviral treatment protocols while ensuring optimal outcomes for HIV-infected women and their children (WHO 2010; WHO 2012).

 Under consolidated antiretroviral guidelines issued by the WHO in 2013, efavirenz-based ART is now recommended the preferred NNRTI option for HIV-1 infected patients, including among women of childbearing age and pregnant women (WHO 2013).

 In 2012, Uganda adopted the Option B+ strategy for PMTCT of HIV.

 Under this strategy, lifelong ART is offered to all pregnant ART naive women irrespective of CD4 count with efavirenz-based ART as the preferred treatment option.

 However, the effectiveness of this regimen could be compromised in the event of large populations of women who may have been either exposed to single dose nevirapine in the past or among women with transmitted NNRTI resistance.

 The justification for studying DTG in pregnancy includes: 1.

 Likely widespread availability of generic DTG in the coming years.

 The manufacturer has indicated its willingness to make DTG available in low income countries, and is currently engaging with generic manufacturers.

 Estimates from the Clinton Foundation suggest that generic manufacture of DTG will make this drug affordable either as an alternative first line, or else second line agent (Hill 2013).

 Clinical guidelines from the US and Europe currently rank INSTIs such as raltegravir and elvitegravir alongside NNRTIs as preferred first line agents.

 INSTIs may replace NNRTIs in first line regimens due to their good safety and toxicity profile, lower propensity for drug interactions, and superior efficacy.

 Large phase III RCTs comparing raltegravir (Rockstroh, Dejesus et al.

 2013), elvitegravir (Sax, DeJesus et al.

 2012) and dolutegravir (van Lunzen, Maggiolo et al.

 2012) against efavirenz-based therapy have shown superior virological outcome at 48 weeks, faster time to undetectable viral load, lower incidence of adverse events, and fewer treatment discontinuations, and these findings have recently been confirmed in a meta-analysis (Messiaen, Wensing et al.

 2013).

 2.

 Low risk for serious drug-drug interactions.

 The potential for drug-drug interactions is significantly less for INSTIs compared with other antiretrovirals (relative risk compared with raltegravir: boosted protease inhibitors [RR = 4.

96], non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [RR = 2.

48](Patel, Abdelsayed et al.

 2011).

 These are particularly important considerations for low/middle income country settings where adults with newly diagnosed HIV infection often present with tuberculosis, or during antenatal screening in late pregnancy.

 Here DTG may carry significant advantages over NNRTIs, and other INSTIs.

 In the absence of alternatives to rifampicin-based TB therapy, DTG and raltegravir exposures are only moderately reduced (Dooley, Sayre et al.

 2013), compared to larger (50-90%) reductions in concentrations of boosted PIs, nevirapine and elvitegravir.

 Dolutegravir is metabolized by glucuronidation (UGT1A1) with some contribution from CYP3A.

 3.

 Rapid viral load drop potentially beneficial in late diagnosis during pregnancy.

 In Sub-Saharan Africa, pregnant mothers tend to engage with health services later in pregnancy compared with Europe, and new HIV diagnoses resulting from universal testing at 28w gestation are frequent.

 DTG results in a very rapid reduction in viral load; median time to undetectable viral load in the SINGLE study was 28 days vs.

 84 days with Atripla (P28w gestation will be randomized 1:1 to receive a DTG-based regimen compared with standard of care (regimen not containing INSTI).

 Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Dolutegravir in Pregnant HIV Mothers and Their Neonates: A Pilot Study@highlight

Aim: To evaluate dolutegravir (DTG) pharmacokinetics in pregnant HIV-infected women Rationale: In developing countries many women present with a new HIV diagnosis in late pregnancy, and are at high risk of transmitting infection during delivery.

 Moreover, women may acquire NNRTI resistance from primary transmission, or use of nevirapine (NVP) in previous pregnancies.

 In these circumstances, DTG is likely to be more effective in reducing mother to child transmission of HIV than NNRTI-based regimens.

 Study design: HIV positive pregnant women presenting with untreated HIV infection in late (28 -36 weeks gestation) pregnancy will be randomised 1:1 to receive DTG (50mg once daily) or standard of care (nevirapine or efavirenz) + 2 NRTIs.

 PK (0-24h) profile will be sampled in third trimester and post-partum.

 Although this is primarily a PK study (and has been powered as such) randomisation is included to allow comparison of plasma HIV VL responses against standard of care (NVP or EFV) and is essential for evaluation of secondary endpoints of safety and efficacy of DTG in pregnancy.
