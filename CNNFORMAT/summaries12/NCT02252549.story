(thirdQuint)An International Randomized Study to Compare SPIES Versus WLI.

 This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which the recurrence rates of cancer between SPIES assisted and WLI assisted TURB are compared.

 Randomization is stratified by tumor multiplicity (single or multiple), tumor status (primary or recurrent) and macroscopic findings (papillary or flat, where CIS is scored as flat lesion).

 Patients randomized into the experimental arm (Arm A) will undergo SPIES and WLI assisted TURB, whereas the patients in the control arm (Arm B) will undergo WLI only assisted TURB.

 WLI is chosen as control, since it is considered the gold standard for detecting bladder tumors.

 Short and long term follow up will be recorded in order to evaluate the health gains for patients over a longer period.

 Perioperative (30 days) complications will be compared between the two treatment arms to evaluate the safety of SPIES.

 An International Randomized Study to Compare SPIES Versus WLI@highlight

This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which the efficacy between SPIES assisted and WLI assisted TURB are compared.

 Subjects in the experimental arm (Arm A) will undergo SPIES assisted TURB, whereas subjects in the control arm (Arm B) will receive treatment with WLI assisted TURB only.

 Baseline characteristics will be recorded, as well as short and long-term follow up.
