(thirdQuint)Molecular Triaging and Diagnostic Imaging to Guide Neoadjuvant Therapy.

 Study Visits: If you are eligible to take part in this study and agree, you will have the following tests and procedures: At Baseline (your first visit): - You will have a biopsy for biomarker and molecular testing.

 Biomarkers are found in the tissue and may be related to the tumor's response to therapy.

 To perform a biopsy, the affected area is numbed with anesthetic and a sample of tissue is removed using a hollow core needle that has a cutting edge.

 The biopsy may be an image-guided core biopsy.

 To perform an image-guided core biopsy, a needle is inserted into the affected area in the breast using imaging such as mammogram, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to collect a small piece of tumor tissue.

 The doctor will use the imaging to guide the needle into the area.

 - If an ultrasound has not been performed within 4 weeks, you will also have an ultrasound.

 You will receive standard-of-care chemotherapy for 4 cycles.

 A cycle of treatment may be given once every 2 or 3 weeks depending upon your doctor's decision.

 After Cycle 2, you will have a standard-of-care ultrasound to check the status of the disease.

 You will receive the results of the ultrasound.

 If you are receiving your standard-of-care treatment closer to home, then the ultrasound is optional.

 After Cycle 3 or 4, you will receive the molecular testing results if they are available.

 After Cycle 4, you will have a standard-of-care ultrasound and will receive the results of that test.

 Together, you and your doctor will decide if you should go forward with additional standard chemotherapy treatments or consider a clinical trial.

 The choice of standard chemotherapy is made by your doctor and the cost will not be covered by the study.

 The study team will continue to collect information from your medical record throughout the study and for up to 5 years.

 If the study doctor thinks it is needed, after the first 4 cycles of chemotherapy to help choose treatment options, you will have a standard-of-care biopsy.

 This biopsy may be an image-guided core biopsy or another type of biopsy depending on the study doctor's decision.

 If you have this biopsy, an extra tissue sample will be collected and stored in a research bank at MD Anderson for use in future research related to cancer.

 There will be no cost to you for this procedure.

 Some of your genetic and health information may be stored in different types of research databases.

 These databases may be available: - only to MD Anderson researchers - only to researchers who apply and are approved to access the restricted data, no matter if they work in or outside MD Anderson, and/or - publicly on the internet Before your samples and/or data can be used for research, the researchers must get approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of MD Anderson.

 The IRB is a committee of doctors, researchers, and community members.

 The IRB is responsible for protecting study participants and making sure all research is safe and ethical.

 Your samples and data will be given a code number.

 No identifying information will be directly linked to your samples.

 Only the researcher in charge of the bank or database will have access to the code numbers and be able to link the samples or data to you.

 This is to allow medical data related to the samples to be updated as needed.

 MD Anderson will not include research records in your medical records.

 Length of Study Participation At the end of 4 cycles of chemotherapy your study doctor will discuss further treatment options with you.

 Taking part in this study will not affect your treatment.

 If you are scheduled to have surgery for the disease, you will still have surgery as scheduled.

 Molecular Triaging and Diagnostic Imaging to Guide Neoadjuvant Therapy@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the use of imaging response evaluations and molecular testing on tumors can improve response to treatment in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by guiding patients with chemotherapy-sensitive tumors to receive standard chemotherapy and chemotherapy-insensitive tumors to consider a clinical trial.

 Up to 360 patients will take part in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
