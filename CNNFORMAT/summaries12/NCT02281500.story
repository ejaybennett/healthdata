(firstQuint)Pharmacokinetics, Efficacy, and Safety of Human Plasma-Derived Fibrinogen (FIB Grifols) in Patients With Congenital Afibrinogenaemia.

 This study is a Phase I-II, multi-center, prospective, open-label, single-arm, clinical trial to evaluate PK, efficacy, and safety of human plasma-derived fibrinogen concentrate FIB Grifols in adult and pediatric patients with congenital afibrinogenaemia.

 Approximately 10adult subjects ( 18 years) with congenital afibrinogenaemia will be administered with a single dose of study drug at 70 mg/kg body weight.

 and will be followed for PK, efficacy, and safety assessments.

 After the safety of fibrinogen concentrate FIB Grifols is assessed in at least 10 adult subjects and no safety issues are raised by the sponsor, the study will start to enroll approximately 10 pediatric subjects who will be dosed with study drug and followed for PK, efficacy, and safety assessments.

 All enrolled subjects (both adult and pediatrics) will have documented congenital fibrinogen deficiency manifested as afibrinogenaemia but will not have received any fibrinogen-containing product therapy within the preceding 21 days before the infusion of study drug.

 All subjects (both adult and pediatrics) will be infused with the investigational product at 70 mg/kg body weight.

 PK parameters that will be calculated from plasma fibrinogen levels measured at different time points] include: in vivo recovery [IVR], area under the curve (AUC) calculated as AUC from zero to 14 days (AUC0-14days) and AUC from zero to infinity (AUC0-), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to the observed maximum plasma concentration (tmax), half-life (t1/2), mean residence time (MRT), volume of distribution (Vd), and clearance (Cl).

 Hemostatic efficacy of the investigational product will be assessed by means of thromboelastographic measure of Maximum Clot Firmness (MCF) at baseline and one-hour post-infusion.

 Other thromboelastographic measures as well as standard coagulation tests will be also determined pre- and post-infusion.

 Clinical safety, viral safety, and immunogenicity will be assessed in this clinical trial.

 Safety variables include adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical assessments, laboratory tests, viral markers, and antibodies against human fibrinogen.

 A monitoring plan will be implemented by the sponsor to carefully monitor and evaluate allergic/hypersensitivity reactions and thrombotic events (TE) during the study.

 Stopping criteria will be established for immunogenic and thrombogenic events.

 If a single case of any these events is reported after a subject being dosed with study drug, any further enrollment and dosing of subjects in the study will be suspended until the event can be adequately assessed by the sponsor.

 The enrollment and dosing will only reassume if the sponsor deems it is safe to do so.
