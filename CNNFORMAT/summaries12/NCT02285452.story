 The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of different thorax wraps in healthy subjects.

 Subjects undergo three different interventions (wraps with ginger flour, mustard flour or warm water (placebo)) on three different days.

 Heart rate variability and respiratory activity is measured for ten minutes before, during (up to 20 minutes) and for ten minutes after each thorax wrap.

 To investigate the effects on heat development and regulation, photos are taken with a thermographic infrared camera at various moments in time.

 Participants are asked to fill in questionnaires referring to their subjective perceptions of warmth, bodily warmth distribution and wellbeing.
