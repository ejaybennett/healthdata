(secondQuint)Phase 1/2 Study of the ERK1/2 Inhibitor BVD-523 in Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndromes.

 The study is being performed to assess the safety and tolerability of BVD-523 given orally, twice daily for 21-day cycles.

 Part 1 of the study will establish dose limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

 In Part 2 of the study, additional patients with particular tumor types and/or cancers harboring specific genetic mutations will be recruited for treatment at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).

 Patients may also be assessed pharmacodynamic measures in healthy or malignant tissues, using biomarker assays for phosphorylation, cytotoxic or cytostatic measures.
