(fifthQuint)Assessing Microvascular Resistance Via IMR To Predict Cumulative Outcome in STEMI Patients Undergoing Primary PCI.

 Prospective, multicentre study designed to evaluate IMR ability to predict events occurrence, defined as Cardiovascular death, re-MI, re-hospitalization for HF, resuscitation or ICD appropriate shock, during a 1 year follow-up period.

 All participants will have the culprit lesion treated following clinical practice and guidelines; Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) and IMR will be measured after the primary PCI procedure to evaluate treatment success and myocardial viability.

 Non-culprit lesions will be functionally evaluated through FFR index and will be treated if FFR will show functional stenosis.

 FFR and IMR will be measured to evaluate treatment success and myocardial viability.

 Patients will be followed-up at 1m, 6m and 1y periods.

 Assessing Microvascular Resistance Via IMR To Predict Cumulative Outcome in STEMI Patients Undergoing Primary PCI@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess whether the Index of Microcirculatory Resistance (IMR) can be considered a prognostic predictor for the occurrence of events at one year of follow up after primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) patients.

 Any correlation between IMR and the short and medium term outcomes, defined as cardiovascular death, re-Myocardial Infarct (MI), re-hospitalization for Heart Failure (HF), resuscitation or Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) appropriate shock, will be assessed in the study.
