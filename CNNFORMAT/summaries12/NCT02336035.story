(firstQuint)Distal Radius Fractures in Patients Over 65 Years, Operation or Cast?.

 The investigators want to investigate if there is a difference between operative treatment with volar locking plates and cast immobilization in patient above 65 years with unstable distal radius fractures AO/OTA type A and C .

 Eligible patients that meets the radiological criteria (see inclusion criteria) will be randomized to cast immobilization or operation with volar locking plate.

 The investigators are planning a non-inferiority design.

 The current study will test the following null hypothesis: In patients over 65 years of age with unstable distal radius fractures AO/OTA type A and C,volar locking plates are superior to cast immobilization by more than 8 points, as evaluated by quick-DASH at 12 months follow-up.

 The investigators will perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing QALYs (Quality-adjusted life years) and costs with the two interventions the first year of follow-up.
