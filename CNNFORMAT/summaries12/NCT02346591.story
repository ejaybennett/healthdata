(fifthQuint)Mobile-Web Emotion Self-management Tool.

 The overarching goal of the Jauntly mobile app was to experience exercises that encourage one to take care of oneself emotionally, improve positive emotions, and decrease stress and other negative emotions.

 The user interacted with the app through evidence-based activities (e.

g.

 writing gratefulness notes, helping others, practicing mindfulness).

 The activities were selected based on the goals the user selected upon initiation of program and throughout engagement with the app.

 In order to promote sustained use of the program and mastery of the positive emotion based skills, the design of the program included activities that range in difficulty so that the user could progress and improve (i.

e.

, simple "1 and done" types of goals versus multi-week goals).

 Research in positive psychology interventions suggests that increases in well-being are highest when the activity: 1) fits the person's interests and values and 2) is performed neither too frequently nor too seldom.

 Because of our desire to have a product with long-lasting usability and sustained engagement, it was critical that there were a diverse number of activities from which individuals could choose based on interest, current mood, and past success.

 The Jauntly user experience is structured around free use of the app partnered with regular emails, in-app messaging, videos, and articles.

 Emails remind users to utilize program content (including users in the control group who were reminded to visit the stress-management website).

 Use of the app and viewing of videos and other content is not restricted and users are able to self-tailor use according to their interest.

The investigators developed a responsive mobile-web app, "Jauntly," which was designed to take advantage of the known connections between positive emotions, stress reduction and stress resilience.

 The app's goal was to lead users through research-proven positive emotion-enhancing exercises and relevant educational materials.

 Intervention activities covered five well-being-generating content areas: 1) promoting the experience and recognition of gratitude; 2) encouraging positive social relationships and feelings of social support; 3) improving stress resilience via mindfulness and other relaxation-focused activities; 4) focusing and capitalizing on individual strengths (as opposed to limitations and weaknesses); and 5) general positive mood inducing activities.

 Program content was adapted from a variety of stress-relevant research areas including health psychology/psychosomatic medicine, social/personality psychology, positive psychology, and clinical psychology.
