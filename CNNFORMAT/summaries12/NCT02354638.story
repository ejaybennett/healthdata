 Impact of Smoke Free Public Places (Smoke Free Cabs) on Cab Drivers in Mumbai@highlight

In addition to the passengers smoking inside the cab, the taxi drivers,are themselves addicted to smoking and/ or use of smokeless tobacco.

 Since tobacco is highly addictive, the cab drivers using tobacco need help in quitting.

 It is also necessary to raise the awareness of the cab drivers with respect to the hazards of tobacco and significance of the smoke free legislation.

 It's been six years since the implementation of rules prohibiting smoking in public places and a re-look at the compliance to this regulation is necessary.

 The study will also help tobacco users to quit their habits.

 They will get screened for oral premalignant and malignant lesions.

 Also, the cab drivers may pass on some effective messages regarding importance of keeping oneself away from tobacco, to the customers while commuting.

 In view of the above background, the current study is proposed to look at all these aspects.

 The findings of the study will be certainly generating useful information with regards to lacunae in the existing system for appropriate implementation and for strengthening anti tobacco advocacy in our country.
