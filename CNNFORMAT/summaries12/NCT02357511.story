(firstQuint)Validation of Pulse Waveform Analysis-based Continuous Noninvasive Blood Pressure Measurement Sensor.

 A novel continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitor is compared to invasive arterial measurement at postoperative care unit after a planned operation.

 Monitor captures also saturation and ECG, which are compared to traditional monitoring.
