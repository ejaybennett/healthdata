(fifthQuint)Trial Comparing SOC +Skin IQ MCM vs SOC for Pressure Ulcer (PU).

 This prospective, randomized, controlled study is designed to capture, evaluate and compare the effects of Skin IQ cent MCM coverlet placed over commercially available pressure redistribution surfaces versus commercially available pressure redistribution surface (SOC) used by itself to manage patients at risk for tissue breakdown.

 Anticipation is that 160 Subjects will need to be screened and consented to achieve the desired sample size of 136 Subjects at up to 5 centers.

 Individual Subject, Standard Time of Observation: Up to 60 days for incidence of PU development; beyond 60 days, only hospital discharge date and disposition will be collected.

 The safety endpoint is the incidence of device-related serious adverse events (SAEs).

 Trial Comparing SOC +Skin IQ MCM vs SOC for Pressure Ulcer (PU)@highlight

The study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical study evaluating the effects of microclimate management using Skin IQ cent MCM coverlet placed over commercially available pressure redistribution surfaces compared to standard of care (SOC).

 The objective of this study is to evaluate if a commercially available pressure redistribution surface when combined with the Skin IQ cent MCM coverlet will significantly reduce pressure ulcer (PU) incidence as compared to use of a commercially available pressure redistribution surface by itself by decreasing the effects of excessive moisture and temperature at the skin and surface interface.
