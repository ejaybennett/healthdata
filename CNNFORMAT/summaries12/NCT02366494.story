(firstQuint)Micro RNAs to Predict Response to Androgen Deprivation Therapy.

 1.

 Identify novel exosomal RNA signatures at pretreatment that predict response to ADT.

 We will collect blood samples from patients with systemic disease pretreatment (at enrollment), 3 months post treatment and at the time of progression of disease (or at two years post ADT for patients still in remission at that time point) and then perform next generation sequencing using serum exosomal RNAs derived from these patients.

 We plan to identify exosomal RNAs signatures that change between pre-treatment (at enrollment) and during treatment (at 3 month) and further explore the effect of these changes on disease response.

 We also plan to compare exosomal RNA levels between patients relapse within the first 2 years versus those in remission at 2 years.

 Among patients with progression, we plan to compare exosomal RNA signatures at progression of disease to signatures at pretreatment and during treatment.

 2.

 Validate exosomal RNA markers that predict response to ADT by real-time RT-PCR.

 Secondary objectives:Selected RNAs, identified through the above process will be validated using real-time RT-PCR assay to test reproducibility of RNA sequencing results.

 We expect to select and validate approximate 5 RNA markers that predict duration of response to ADT.
