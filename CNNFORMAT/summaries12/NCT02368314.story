(firstQuint)A Safety and Efficacy Study of BCD-080 Compared to Clexan for Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis at Orthopedic Surgeries.

 The study will include 116 patients who are planned for hip or knee replacement.

 Patients will randomized in 2 groups.

 1-st group will receive BCD-080 at dose 30 mg every 12 hours during 14 days after surgery, 2-d group will receive Clexane at the same dose.

 Efficacy assessment will include frequency of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (proximal and/or distal; symptomatic or asymptomatic), symptomatic nonlethal thromboembolia of the pulmonary artery (PATE) and venous thromboembolism death.

 Safety assessment will include frequency of "big", "small" and other bleedings and frequency of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

The assessment of efficacy and safety parameters will be made during the treatment and follow-up period (till 60 day).
