(thirdQuint)Onabotulinumtoxin A Versus Kenalog for Chronic Pelvic Pain.

 Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common and often debilitating problem among women.

 The musculoskeletal system is an important factor in chronic pelvic pain.

 Studies have demonstrated that women with CPP had more frequent musculoskeletal findings.

 On physical examination, myofascial trigger points have been found.

 Trigger points are hyperirritable bands of muscle that can be felt from the vaginal wall.

 They are often knot-like or taut and are painful when pressure is placed on them.

 Intravaginal injections of these trigger points using steroids including Kenalog (triamcinolone) have been done and produced decreases in pelvic pain.

 Trigger point injections of Onabotulinumtoxin A has also been shown to decrease pain in subjects with CPP.

 This study will compare these two drugs and assess pain (using subject questionnaires) at one, three and six months post injection.

 Onabotulinumtoxin A Versus Kenalog for Chronic Pelvic Pain@highlight

The goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two different medications used in intravaginal trigger point injections (injections into extremely painful areas of a muscle) to treat chronic pelvic pain.

 The study compares onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX(R)) (a drug prepared from the bacterial toxin botulin which temporarily paralyzes muscles) to Kenalog (a synthetic corticosteroid used as an anti-inflammatory agent).
