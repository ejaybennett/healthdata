(fifthQuint)Questionnaires in Identifying Upper Extremity Function and Quality of Life After Treatment in Patients With Breast Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To characterize patients' upper extremity functionality (using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH] questionnaire) and their perception of quality of life (using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast [FACT-B] questionnaire) one to ten years after breast cancer surgery and compare it to the general population.

 II.

 To investigate whether patients' upper extremity functionality and their perception of quality of life after completion of breast cancer treatment changes over the duration of time between 1 -10 years after breast cancer surgery.

 III.

 To characterize patient perception of the impact of breast cancer on their quality of life in relation to current upper-extremity functionality 1-10 years after breast cancer surgery.

 IV.

 To characterize patients' upper extremity functionality (using the DASH questionnaire) and their perception of the impact of breast cancer on their quality of life (using the FACT-B questionnaire) in a sub group of individuals with stable metastatic breast cancer 1-10 years after initial diagnosis and surgery.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assist the multidisciplinary team to identify musculoskeletal barriers (if any) that impact a patient's long-term recovery with respect to the breast cancer treatments they have received.

 II.

 To assist in developing and implementing a physical therapy component within the Personalized Medicine to Breast Cancer Care Plan; this includes early detection of potential physical barriers, physical therapy intervention models, and development of survivorship planning for cancer-related musculoskeletal impairments.

 OUTLINE: Patients complete the DASH and FACT-B questionnaires over 30-45 minutes.

 Questionnaires in Identifying Upper Extremity Function and Quality of Life After Treatment in Patients With Breast Cancer@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies questionnaires in identifying arms, shoulder, and neck (upper extremity) function and quality of life after treatment in patients with breast cancer.

 Patients may experience arms, shoulder, and neck impairments that negatively affect their functioning and quality of life after cancer-related treatment.

 Studying upper extremity function and quality of life in patients after breast cancer treatment may help doctors determine the prevalence and severity of long-term functional impairments and the relationship between the perception of impairments due to breast cancer treatment and its' impact on quality of life.
