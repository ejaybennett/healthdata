(thirdQuint)Evaluation of the Antibiofilmogramme Test During Diabetic Foot Infections.

 The secondary objectives are: A.

 Should a first regimen of antibiotics fail, to describe the bacterial community present in the wound, and its potential to create biofilms.

 B.

 To investigate the role of antibiogramme-antibiofilmogramme concordance (in terms of S.

 aureus strains and prescribed antibiotics) in wound healing.

 C.

 To study the potential role of additional antibiofilmogramme data, as well as that of other pre-defined co-factors, in predicting wound changes.

 D.

 Create an S.

 aureus strain collection for future ancillary studies.

 Evaluation of the Antibiofilmogramme Test During Diabetic Foot Infections@highlight

This is an observational study that does not change routine care.

 The primary objective of this study is to investigate the role of antibiogramme-antibiofilmogramme concordance (in terms of S.

 aureus strains and prescribed antibiotics) in the presence/absence of S.

 aureus strains at the end of a first regimen of antibiotics.
