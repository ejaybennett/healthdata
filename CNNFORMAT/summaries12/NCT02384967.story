(thirdQuint)Evaluation of a Dose Reduction of Darunavir (400 mg/d) in Virologically Suppressed HIV-1 Patients.

 Principal objective: To evaluate the proportion of subjects virologically suppressed at week 48 (viral load=VL 50 cp/mL) under a tri-therapy containing the darunavir at the dose of 400 mg/d.

 Secondary objectives: To evaluate between baseline and week 48: proportions of subjects: in virological failure (confirmed VL > 50 cp/mL) confirmed by a 2nd measure made between 2 to 4 weeks, with VL 50 cp/mL and between 20 and 50 cp/mL, emerging drug resistance if virological failure, CD4 cell count evolution, HIV DNA evolution, morphological and glucido-lipid parameters modifications, digestive treatment tolerance , adherence to treatment, overall cost of antiretroviral therapy, factors associated to virological failure including baseline and nadir CD4 cell count, darunavir plasma level, baseline HIV DNA viral load.

 Evaluation of a Dose Reduction of Darunavir (400 mg/d) in Virologically Suppressed HIV-1 Patients@highlight

Phase II trial assessing the efficacy of a reduced dose strategy of darunavir to 400 mg/d in HIV-1 infected patients virologically suppressed under a once daily regimen including darunavir 800 mg/d and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), to maintain the viral load lower than 50 copies / mL at 48 weeks of treatment.
