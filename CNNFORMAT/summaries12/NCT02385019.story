(secondQuint)A Phase 1/2 Trial of Donor Regulatory T-cells for Steroid-Refractory Chronic Graft-versus-Host-Disease.

 Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating safety (Phase 1) and preliminary efficacy (Phase 2) of donor regulatory T cells for patients with steroid-refractory chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

 Patients must have persistent signs and symptoms despite the use of prednisone or equivalent at 0.

25 mg/kg/day (or 0.

5 mg/kg every other day), for at least 4 weeks without complete resolution of signs and symptoms.

 Occasional patients requiring lower doses of prednisone will be eligible if associated with other immunosuppressive drugs.

 Phase 1 clinical trial will include groups of 5 patients sequentially treated with: 0.

5 x 106, 1.

0 x 106, 2-3 x 106 donor Treg/kg.

 Phase 2 clinical trial will include another 5 to 10 patients treated with MTD.

 Donor Treg will be selected by the following sequential steps: 1.

 - negative depletion of CD8 and CD19 cells 2.

 - positive selection of CD25 cells.
