 Concurrent administration of any other antitumor therapy including chemotherapy, target therapy, immunotherapy, and hormone therapy 9.

 Psychiatric disorders that would compromise the patient's compliance or decision Criteria for evaluation: QoL: QoL will be measured using the EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D), World Health Organization Quality-of-Life, brief version (WHOQOL-BREF), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaires.

 Efficacy: Tumor response rate will be determined by RECIST 1.

1.

 Data of progression-free survival and overall survival will be collected for all subjects.

 QA-PFS and QALE: Investigators will adjust the progression-free survival by the utility values of QoL measured from the EQ-5D to obtain the QA-PFS.

 In addition, investigators will extrapolate the survival function to lifetime based on the survival ratios between patients and age- and sex-matched referents simulated from the life tables of Taiwan.

 After adjusting the lifetime survival by the utility values of QoL, the QALE will also be estimated using quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) as the unit.

 Cost-effectiveness: The monthly healthcare expenditures, which included National Health Insurance-reimbursed and out-of-pocket direct medical costs, will be obtained from the reimbursement database of National Cheng Kung University Hospital.

 These values were multiplied by the corresponding survival probabilities to calculate the lifetime costs or costs during the progression-free period.

 Hence, costs/life-year or costs/QALY can be obtained for comparison of cost-effectiveness.

 Adverse events: Safety parameters include laboratory adverse events (e.

g.

, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, creatinine, AST, ALT) and non-laboratory adverse events (e.

g.

, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, mucositis/stomatitis, anorexia, diarrhea, constipation, infection, febrile neutropenia, pain, sensory neuropathy, rash, edema, watery eye).

 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.

0 will be used to grade toxicities.
