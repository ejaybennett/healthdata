(secondQuint)Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Groin Dissection.

 Patients may develop inguinal lymph node metastases from a variety of cutaneous neoplasms.

 A number of factors conspire to cause a high rate of wound breakdown and other complications in this patient group.

 Reported rates of wound healing complications vary in the literature, but tend to affect > 40% of patients.

 A new negative pressure wound therapy device is recommended for use in clean, closed surgical wounds (PICO cent system, Smith & Nephew Healthcare, UK).

 Patients will be randomised to receive either PICO cent system for up to seven days, or conventional dressings, and then assessed for wound healing and other outcome measures.
