(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy of GX-188E DNA Therapeutic Vaccine Administered by Electroporation After Observation.

 This is a follow-up study to investigate the change of immunogenicity and lesion condition in subjects with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 who have enrolled and participated GX-188E phase II trial(GX-188E_CIN3_P2).

 Subjects will make visits 7 times for about three years from the last visit of GX-188E phase 2 trial (GX-188E_CIN3_P2).
