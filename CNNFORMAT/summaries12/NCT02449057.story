(fifthQuint)An Evaluation of JUST Court in Yuma County, AZ.

 Arizona's Juveniles Under Supervision and Treatment (JUST) Court is a pilot project initiated by the Arizona Governor's office.

 It is designed to test whether the principles of Swift, Certain, and Fair (SCF) Supervision-clear rules, close monitoring, and swift and certain, but modest, penalties for each violation can succeed when applied to juveniles under community supervision.

 The Arizona Administrative Office of the Courts piloted JUST in two counties: Yavapai and Yuma.

 The Yuma program was launched in March 2011.

 The goal of JUST is to (a) reduce the violation rate so as to reduce the number of petitions filed to revoke probation (the purpose is to reduce the use of juvenile detention), and (b) reduce recidivism overall.

 All juveniles in Yavapai are supervised under JUST (evaluation using an RCT is therefore unfeasible).

 JUST in Yuma is now being scaled up, which affords the opportunity for an RCT.

 The goal of the RCT is to compare the performance of youth supervised under JUST with those supervised under probation-as-usual.

 An Evaluation of JUST Court in Yuma County, AZ@highlight

Arizona has created a pilot program for juvenile probationers called Juveniles under Supervision and Treatment (JUST), which includes swift and certain, but modest responses, to technical violations of the terms of juvenile probation.

 JUST targets high- and medium-risk juvenile probationers and its stated objective is to reduce violations and overall incarceration of youth in the program.

 The JUST pilot is being implemented under the authority of the Arizona Governor's Office for Children, Youth and Families (GOCYF) and the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC).
