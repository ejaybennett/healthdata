(thirdQuint)An Intervention to Improve Nutrition and Physical Activity in Preschoolers in Cuenca, Ecuador.

 In Ecuador and in the city of Cuenca, the prevalence of obesity is high (approximately 22% of the population).

 Simultaneously, there is high prevalence of chronic malnutrition (e.

g.

, stunting).

 In a previous study in school-aged children in Cuenca, the prevalence of overweight or obese was 30%.

 The objective of this study is to design an intervention to improve nutrition and physical activity habits and behaviors in preschoolers.

 The study will begin with a baseline survey that will be used to develop the educational and behavioral intervention.

 The intervention will consist of didactic material for teachers, educational material for parents, and activities for the children.

 The investigators will carry out the intervention over the course of the school year.

 The intervention will be primarily delivered in the preschool setting, but will also include workshops for parents.

 The investigators hope that this study will help promote the health of children in Cuenca and can be a pilot study to test similar interventions in larger populations in Ecuador.
