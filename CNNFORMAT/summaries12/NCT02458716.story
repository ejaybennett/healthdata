(fifthQuint)Cytoreductive Prostatectomy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed, Metastatic Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the safety and feasibility of cytoreductive prostatectomy (to remove as much of the primary cancer as possible) in men with newly diagnosed clinical T1-3N1M0 or T1-3N0M1a-b prostate cancer (herein, collectively referred to as metastatic prostate cancer).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Time to prostate specific antigen (PSA) nadir and castration resistance following cytoreductive prostatectomy and subsequent standard systemic therapy, androgen deprivation.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo RARP or conventional open RRP.

 Immediately following surgery, patients receive standard systemic androgen deprivation therapy.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 90 days for 3 years.

 Cytoreductive Prostatectomy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed, Metastatic Prostate Cancer@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects of cytoreductive prostatectomy in treating patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer that has spread from the primary site to other places in the body.

 Cytoreductive prostatectomy is a type of surgery that removes the prostate and as much of the tumor as possible.

 When combined with hormone therapy, robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) or conventional open retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) may prolong survival in patients with prostate cancer that has spread.
