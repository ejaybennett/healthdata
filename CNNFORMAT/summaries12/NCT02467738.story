(fifthQuint)Surgical Resection and Intraoperative Cesium-131 Brachytherapy for Head and Neck Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess the impact of cesium 131 (cesium Cs 131) on recurrence rate, disease free survival and over all survival.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess complications associated with cesium 131 treatment in subjects with head and neck cancer.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo brachytherapy using cesium Cs 131 during surgical resection.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months for 24 months.

 Surgical Resection and Intraoperative Cesium-131 Brachytherapy for Head and Neck Cancer@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies cesium Cs 131 brachytherapy in treating patients with head and neck cancer that has come back (recurrent) and can be removed by surgery.

 Brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy, uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells.

 Radioactive drugs, such as cesium Cs 131, may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells.

 Permanently implanting cesium Cs 131 into the wound bed after surgery may help treat microscopic cancer cells that may be in the tissue after surgical removal of the tumor.
