(fifthQuint)The Oligonucleotide Chip Analysis for Allergic Rhinitis Treatment in Herbal Plaster and Acupuncture.

 This projectThe oligonucleotide chip analysis for allergic rhinitis treatment in herbal plaster and acupuncture will be performed at Genomic Medicine Research Core Laboratory- GMRCL in Chung Gang Memorial Hospital.

 Allergic rhinitis patient will receive herbal plaster treatment in the first year, blood sample was attained before and after therapy.

 Then investigators use oligonucleotide chip to analyze the immunomodulatory effects of TCM in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

 In the second year, the patient received herbal plaster and Acupuncture treatment in the same time.

 Many allergic rhinitis patients accept TCM treatment here in Taiwan.

 According to recent journal reports, Traditional Chinese medicine performed in accordance with the principles of TCM would show significant immune-modulating effects, herbal plaster is an effective, safe and convenient treatment for allergic rhinitis.

 The mechanism of its efficacy needs further study.

 This project plan to combine the experience of clinical doctor and GMRCL Microarray for the mechanism of herbal plaster on allergic rhinitis.

 Investigators study the effects of herbal plaster treatment for allergic rhinitis in the first year.

 And study the combine effect of herbal plaster and Acupuncture treatment in the second year.

 All patients during 18-45 years old were treated over a time period of 4 weeks.

 Patients' general well-being and several peripheral blood parameters were determined before and after the herbal plaster treatment.

 RNA was extracted from the blood and pooled into patient pool.

 Oligonucleotide chips were used to analysis the pooled RNA each year.

 The microarray analysis for the genomic change before and after the herbal plaster treatment or herbal plaster with Acupuncture treatment was studied .

 The Oligonucleotide Chip Analysis for Allergic Rhinitis Treatment in Herbal Plaster and Acupuncture@highlight

Using Oligonucleotide Chip Analysis, investigators compared gene expression levels in allergic rhinitis patients before and after a series of acupoint herbal plaster and Acupuncture treatment.

 In the first year, Twenty-three participants with persistent allergic rhinitis each received four acupoint herbal plaster treatments, applied using the moxibustion technique, and clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ).

 Peripheral blood samples were analyzed using an ImmunoCAP Phadiatop test, and patients were classified as phadiatop (Ph)-positive or -negative.

 Microarray results were examined for genes that were differentially expressed between (1) Ph-positive and -negative patients treated with herbal paste; and (2) before and after herbal paste treatment in the Ph-positive patient group.

 In the second year, Twenty-seven participants with persistent allergic rhinitis each received four acupoint herbal plaster treatments and 8 courses of acupuncture treatment over 4 weeks in the same time.
