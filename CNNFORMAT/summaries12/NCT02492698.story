(thirdQuint)Changes in Body Adiposity by Dual Probiotic Strains Positively Correlated With Changes in Lp-PLA2 Activity in Overweight Adults.

 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 120 subjects with age between 20 and 65 years, nondiabetic (fasting blood glucose body mass index (BMI) < 30 kg/m2).

 Over a 12 week test period, the probiotic group consumed 2 g of powder twice a day containing L.

 curvatus HY7601 and L.

 plantarum KY1032, while the placebo group consumed the same product without probiotics for 12 weeks.

 curvatus) HY7601 and Lactobacillus plantarum (L.

 plantarum) KY1032 on weight loss, body adiposity and inflammatory markers including lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity in overweight subjects.
