 Comparison of Smoking and Vaping in Families@highlight

Electronic cigarette use may be less harmful than cigarettes in adults, however, limited data exists examining passive electronic cigarette exposure and child health outcomes.

 The current study seeks to compare health-related outcomes among youth who reside with non-smokers, cigarette smokers, and electronic cigarette users.

 The investigators propose to conduct a small pilot study with 30 youth, ages 6-17 and a caregiver.

 Three groups of 10 parent-child dyads will be recruited: 1) control group: parents who are non-smokers/non-vapers, 2) smoking group: parents who are exclusive cigarette smokers, and 3) vaping group: parents who are exclusively ECIG users.

 Groups will be compared across the following variables: child lung function and biomarkers of nicotine.
