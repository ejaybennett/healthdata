(firstQuint)Analgesic Effect of Ropivacaine Plus Fentanyl vs Ropivacaine for Continuous 3-in-1 FNB After Total Knee Arthroplasty.

 Forty patients of American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status Ior II undergoing total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia would be enrolled and randomly divided into two groups (R, "3-in-1" using a 30 ml of ropivacaine 0.

375% and a continuous 3-in-1 with a ropivacaine 0.

2%(8mL/h) for 48 h after operation, RF: Fifty ug of fentanyl will be added to a bolus(30ml ropivacaine 0.

375%) and 1ug/ml of fentanyl will be mixed to a continuous infusion(8mg/h, ropivacaine 0.

2%).

 Spinal anesthesia will be done after the insertion of femoral catheter.

 IV PCA with hydromorphone(0.

15mg/ml, 0-1-10), will be used for rescue analgesics.

 Visual analgesia scale, hydromorphone consumption, side effects until 48h after operation and satisfaction will be compared.
