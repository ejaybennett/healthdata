(firstQuint)Comparison of Vaccination Routes: Subcutaneous Versus Intramuscular Application of FSME-Immun.

 Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine (FSME-Immun(R)) is registered for intra-muscular application.

 Due to medical reasons (e.

g.

 anticoagulant therapy, adipositas) intra-muscular application is not always possible.

 The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate whether a comparably good immunogenicity can be achieved via the subcutaneous vaccination route.

 Thus humoral and cellular immune responses after intramuscular and subcutaneous TBE vaccination in healthy volunteers will be compared.

 Comparison of Vaccination Routes: Subcutaneous Versus Intramuscular Application of FSME-Immun@highlight

FSME-Immun(R) is registered for application into the muscle.

 This study investigates if application under the skin leads to a comparable immune response.
