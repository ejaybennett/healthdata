(secondQuint)CAREGIVER2, Caregiver's Health Assessment : Clinical and Biological Markers.

 The investigators hypothesize that an accumulation of stressful events related to care giving may induce a stress response to the caregiver.

 This stress response can be measured by biological markers (inflammation, transcription and immunity) and also by clinical markers (frailty, physical performance, nutrition).

 This stress response can be influenced by the subjective burden of the caregiver and by the severity of the disease of the care receiver (Activity of daily life capabilities, cognitive function, behavioral disturbance).
