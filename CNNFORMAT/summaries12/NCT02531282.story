(fifthQuint)Effect of a Health Promotion Intervention for People With Chronic Pain at a Healthy Life Centre.

 Previous research indicates that if self-management interventions are developed within a health promotion framework focusing on the participants' strengths, there is a beneficial effect on patient activation and thus on self-management behaviour.

 However, there is a lack of knowledge about which interventions will improve patient activation for persons with chronic pain.

 To be sustainable, such interventions should be delivered using the least possible amount of resources needed to get an effect.

 One way to do so is to deliver the intervention in primary care instead of in hospitals.

 The Healthy Life Centre is ideally situated to deliver these interventions.

 This is especially true due to their task of focusing on health promotion but also because they are set up to deliver low level interventions, meaning that it should be easy for everyone to access their services.

 Effect of a Health Promotion Intervention for People With Chronic Pain at a Healthy Life Centre@highlight

The study's primary objective is to test the hypothesis that a group-based health promotion intervention with patient education and practical exercises delivered at a Healthy Life Centre increases patient activation in people living with chronic pain.

 Due to many people living with chronic pain, interventions focusing on self-management and coping are on the agenda in primary care.

 This study will investigate whether a Healthy Life Centre in a municipality is a suitable setting for interventions targeting people living with chronic pain.

 Short and long term effect of an intervention developed in a health promotion and salutogenic framework will be investigated in a randomized clinical trial.
