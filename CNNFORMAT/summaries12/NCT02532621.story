(fifthQuint)Clinical Evaluation of a Vascular Anastomotic Connector System.

 This is a pivotal multicenter, prospective, non-randomized adaptive design study.

 The planned study enrollment is a minimum of 104 evaluable subjects who require AV graft placement for hemodialysis and who meet the entry criteria.

 However, the study will allow for a maximum enrollment of 252 subjects, including up to 185 evaluable subjects, up to 30 roll-in cases, up to 25 subjects in a separate cohort study (described below), and a provision for 12 subjects lost to follow-up.

 Roll-in cases will not be included in the primary analysis, but will be analyzed separately.

 This maximum number of subjects allows for an upward adjustment in sample size, if warranted, based on a pre-specified midpoint evaluation of the primary endpoint.

 Additional subjects may be enrolled up to a maximum of 185 evaluable subjects after review of interim analysis results.

 In addition to the main study, a separate study cohort may enroll up to 25 subjects in whom the VIG is used for the venous anastomosis, together with a standard sutured arterial anastomosis.

 Such subjects may be identified based on pre-surgery imaging or at the time of the surgery (e.

g.

, cases in which the subject meets the initial inclusion criteria, but the target artery is determined to be unsuitable for anastomosis with the AIG at the time of surgery).

 Data from this cohort will not be included in the primary analysis, but will be analyzed separately.

 The study will include up to 15 participating clinical centers.

 Study site investigators will be physicians skilled in AV access graft placement and interventional techniques.

 Study data will be collected up to the point at which each subject has completed the 6 month endpoint.

 Clinical Evaluation of a Vascular Anastomotic Connector System@highlight

This study is a prospective multicenter evaluation of the performance of the InterGraft System for anastomosis of a hemodialysis graft.

 The InterGraft System includes an arterial InterGraft (AIG) connector and a venous InterGraft (VIG) connector used with a standard arterial-venous (AV) graft.

 The study is intended to demonstrate that the 6 month cumulative patency of grafts connected with the InterGraft Connectors is similar to that of grafts connected using standard sutured anastomoses.

 In addition, the study will also include a separate cohort of up to 25 subjects in whom the VIG is used for the venous anastomosis, together with a standard sutured arterial anastomosis, in situations where the target artery is not suitable for use of the AIG.
