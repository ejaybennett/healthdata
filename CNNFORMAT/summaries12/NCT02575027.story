(thirdQuint)Palliative 4pi Radiotherapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the accuracy of dose delivery and patient comfort with treatment time.

 II.

 To evaluate normal tissue dose volume statistics and compare to standard planning.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo 4pi radiation simulation and planning followed by 5 to 10 daily fractions of 4pi palliative radiotherapy.

 If an acceptable plan cannot be achieved using 4pi planning, then the patient will be treated with standard radiation therapy planning for palliative re-irradiation.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks.

 Palliative 4pi Radiotherapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies the feasibility of palliative 4pi radiotherapy in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme that has come back after standard chemoradiation.

 A new radiotherapy delivery planning system, called 4pi radiotherapy, may help improve radiation delivery by improving dose coverage to the treatment target, while reducing the dose to surrounding normal tissues.
