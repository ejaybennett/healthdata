(fifthQuint)Proteomic Analysis of Mononuclear Cells After a High-Fat, High-Carbohydrate Meal With or Without Orange Juice.

 BACKGROUND: A high-fat, high-carbohydrate meal (HFHC) induces an increase in inflammation in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in healthy subjects.

 A few studies have shown that orange juice, when consumed together with the high-fat meal, is able to revert the increase in inflammatory markers.

 OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of a single HFHC meal taken with water, orange juice (500ml) or an isocaloric glucose drink on protein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy individuals.

 DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: Twelve healthy, normal weight individuals consumed a HFHC meal with water, water with glucose or orange juice in a cross-over design with at least one week interval between the meals.

 Blood samples were collected before, 1, 3 and 5h after the meals.

 Blood glucose, insulin and lipid profile were measured.

 Also, proteome analysis using TMT labeling was performed on peripheral-blood mononuclear cells collected before and at times 3 and 5h after the meal.
