(thirdQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Multiple Doses of JNJ-56021927 on the Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Cytochrome P450 and Transporter Substrates in Participants With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.

 This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study in participants with CRPC.

 The study will consist of a Screening Phase to determine eligibility, a Pretreatment Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow-up Phase.

 The study is designed to estimate the magnitude of the effects of JNJ-56021927 on the pharmacokinetics of probe substrates.

 In vitro studies have indicated that JNJ-56021927 and its active metabolite JNJ-56142060 (M3) have the potential to affect multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8) and drug transporters proteins (P-glycoprotein [P-gp] and breast cancer resistance protein [BRCP]) via inhibition or induction.

 In human hepatocytes, JNJ 56021927 and JNJ-56142060 (M3) were found to be inducers of CYP3A4.

 The induction of CYP3A4 suggests that JNJ-56021927 and M3 will induce other CYP isozymes and drug transporters (eg, CYP2C and P-gp via activation of pregnane X receptor).

 The study is designed to confirm the in vivo significance of these non-clinical findings.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of repeat dosing of JNJ-56021927 on the pharmacokinetics for single-dose multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8) and transporter (P-gp and BRCP) substrates in participants with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
