(fifthQuint)Viral Suppression After Analytic Treatment Interruption in Thai Patients Who Initiated Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy During Acute HIV Infection.

 This is a two step open label study of ATI in patients who initiated ART in the earliest detectable stage (Fiebig I) of HIV infection.

 In step I, eight subjects will discontinue ART for a period of up to 24 weeks.

 An interim assessment will be conducted after all eight subjects in step I complete follow-up for 12 weeks.

 If at least one out of eight subjects maintains viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA 24 months and have HIV-1 1,000 copies/ml was chosen because clinical symptoms of HIV infection or significant decline in CD4 count would not be expected at this low level of viremia.

 The Fiebig I patients in the SEARCH 010 cohort had a median (range) HIV-1 RNA of 4.

 In addition, the ANRS Visconti study found that patients who are virologic controllers (sustained VL 400 copies/ml and 18% had VL between 50 and 400 copies/ml.

 Therefore, low-level viremia may not always be indicative of viral rebound and can potentially reverse.

 Specific criteria for re-initiation of ART after ATI are: 1.

 HIV-1 RNA above 1,000 copies/ml on 2 consecutive determinations at least 3 days apart.

 OR 2.

 HIV-1 RNA rise of 0.

5 log10copies/ml per day provided that the last HIV-1 RNA is above 1000 copies/ml OR 3.

 A single HIV-1 RNA above 10,000 copies/ml OR 4.

 CD4+ T-cell counts below 350 cells/mm3 on 2 consecutive determinations at least 2 weeks apart.

 OR 5.

 CD4+ T-cell count decline of > 50% from baseline prior to ATI.

 OR 6.

 Clinical progression to CDC Category B or C disease.

 OR 7.

 Diagnosis of Acute Retroviral Syndrome.

 OR 8.

 Pregnancy OR 9.

 Subject requests re-initiation of ART.

 Viral Suppression After Analytic Treatment Interruption in Thai Patients Who Initiated Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy During Acute HIV Infection@highlight

This is a Phase 2, two-step, open-label study of the outcome of analytic treatment interruption (ATI) on patients who started antiretroviral therapy (ART) during Fiebig Stage I of acute HIV infection (AHI), defined as detectable HIV-RNA without detectable p24 antigen or HIV IgM.

 The primary endpoint will be rate of sustained viral suppression, defined as HIV-1 RNA < 50 cps/ml at 24 weeks after treatment interruption.

 During ATI subjects will be monitored closely for safety and will have ART re-initiated if they meet predefined clinical, virological, or immunological criteria.

 In step I, there will be 8 subjects who undergo ATI.

 An interim analysis for safety will be conducted after 12 weeks.

 If none of the subjects maintain viral suppression at 12 weeks then no further subjects will be enrolled into the study.

 If at least 1 out of 8 subjects maintains viral suppression at 12 weeks then an additional 7 subjects will be enrolled in step 2.

 At ATI all antiretroviral drugs will be discontinued.

 Subjects will be monitored with clinical exam, immunological (CD4), and virological (HIV-RNA) testing at baseline and then on a fixed schedule for 24 weeks.

 ART will be re-initiated immediately if subjects meet any pre-defined clinical, immunological or virological safety endpoints during the monitoring period.
