(secondQuint)Motor Control Exercises vs Standard Exercises in Unspecific Low Back Pain.

 Eighty-four subjects with unspecific low-back pain were randomly recruited for the present study.

 The subjects were randomly allocated into control group (who received one hour of standard physiotherapy exercises every days during ten days) or intervention group (who received one hour of control motor exercises every days during ten days).

 One month after finishing these ten days, patients should perform a home-based exercises program during two months (control group performed home-based standard physiotherapy exercises; intervention group performed home-based motor control exercises).

 Pain (visual analogic scale), incapacity index (Roland Morris questionnaire) and medicine intake (diary) were evaluated before the intervention, one month and three months after ending the first ten days of intervention.
