(secondQuint)Pharmacokinetic (PK) Bioequivalence and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of Julphar Insulin N and Huminsulin Basal.

 Daily injections of insulin are a necessity for many patients with diabetes mellitus in order to treat hyperglycemia.

 Julphar Insulin N and Huminsulin(R) Basal are both intermediate-acting human isophane insulins, i.

e.

 consist of a suspension containing a crystalline precipitate of isophane human insulin (NPH) complexed with protamine sulphate and zinc.

 The new insulin, Julphar Insulin N, is biosimilar to Huminsulin(R) Basal.

 Demonstration of similar absorption (PK) and effects (PD) are necessary to achieve market approval of Julphar Insulin N.

 Pharmacokinetic (PK) Bioequivalence and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of Julphar Insulin N and Huminsulin Basal@highlight

This study in healthy volunteers aims to demonstrate similar PK and PD properties of the new human isophane Insulin, Julphar Insulin N, and the already approved reference Insulin, Huminsulin(R) Basal.

 All participants will receive both study treatments on two separate dosing days.
