(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy of G-Pen Compared to Lilly Glucagon for Hypoglycemia Rescue in Adult Type 1 Diabetics.

 This is a blinded, randomized, Phase 3 comparative efficacy and safety study in adults with type 1 diabetes.

 Patients will complete screening procedures up to 60 days before randomization to determine eligibility before enrollment to the treatment phase.

 The procedure for evaluating the efficacy of the G-Pen cent (glucagon injection) consists of inducing hypoglycemia by intravenous administration of regular insulin diluted in normal saline.

 Each participant will undergo two episodes of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and in random order will receive 1 mg G-Pen cent (glucagon injection) during one episode and 1 mg Lilly Glucagon during the other episode.

 There will be wash out period of 7-28 days between treatment visits.

 Blood glucose levels will be monitored post-dosing, with a return of plasma glucose to a concentration > 70 mg/dL within 30 minutes signifying successful hypoglycemia rescue.

 As a confirmation of efficacy, subjects will complete a questionnaire concerning changes in symptoms of hypoglycemia following treatment with glucagon.

 Subjects will return for a follow-up safety visit 3-14 days following administration of the final dose of glucagon.
