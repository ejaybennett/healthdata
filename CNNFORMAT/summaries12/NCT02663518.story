(firstQuint)A Trial of TTI-621 for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies and Selected Solid Tumors.

 This is a trial of TTI-621 in subjects with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies and selected solid tumors.

 TTI-621 (SIRPFc) is a soluble recombinant fusion protein created by directly linking the sequences encoding the N-terminal CD47 binding domain of human SIRP with the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin (IgG1).

 TTI-621 acts by binding human CD47 and preventing it from delivering an inhibitory "do not eat" (anti phagocytic) signal to macrophages.

 This trial will be conducted in 2 phases: Phase 1a (escalation phase) and Phase 1b (expansion phase).

 In the dose Escalation Phase (phase 1a), subjects with lymphoma will be enrolled in sequential dose cohorts to receive TTI-621 to characterize safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD).

 In the Expansion Phase (phase 1b), TTI-621 will be given to subjects with a variety of hematologic malignancies and selected solid tumors to further define safety and to characterize efficacy.

 In the Expansion Phase, the safety and efficacy of TTI-621 will also be assessed when it is given in combination with other anti-cancer drugs.

 The dose of TTI-621 to be delivered in the Expansion Phase of the study may be increased or decreased based on the subject's tolerability and on the subject's response to treatment.

 Secondary objectives include further characterization of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and development of ADA; and to gain preliminary evidence of the anti-tumor activity of TTI-621 in subjects with a variety of hematologic malignancies and selected solid tumors.
