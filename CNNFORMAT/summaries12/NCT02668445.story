(thirdQuint)Molecular Response After Concurrent Exercise With Low Glycogen.

 Two experimental exercise trials; a low carbohydrate (= LOW) and a high carbohydrate (= HIGH) trial.

 During both experimental days subjects will complete an continues submaximal cycling bout in the morning followed by a resistance exercise session in the early afternoon.

 During the LOW trial subjects will receive a low carbohydrate mixed meal, during the HIGH trial subjects will be provided with a high carbohydrate meal.

 In addition, on both experimental days subjects will receive adequate protein beverages.

 Lastly, protein will be provided post resistance exercise.

 Molecular Response After Concurrent Exercise With Low Glycogen@highlight

This is a randomized, counterbalanced crossover design, in which 14 male subjects will complete two experimental trials.

 Each trial will be separated by a minimum of at least 12 days (range: 12-30 days).

 The study aims to investigate the effects of low glycogen availability on skeletal muscle molecular response after a concurrent exercise day.
