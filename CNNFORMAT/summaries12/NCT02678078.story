(firstQuint)Characterization of Cancer Tissue Using 3D Biosynthetic Material.

 The investigators' biomaterial lab has developed an in vitro diagnostic system in which a cancer tumor is placed inside a 3D hydrogel.

 This material has similar properties to the human tissue and can visualize cell migration and proliferation.

 In this system, the investigators have already characterised human metastatic cells obtained from nude mice tumors.

 The diagnostic assay is able to evaluate the reduction in cell growth associated with anti-cancer drug therapy.

 The next step is to test the in vitro diagnostic system using human tissue samples from human patients, and to validate the system as a simple and effective a priori diagnostic tool for characterizing patient tumours.

 Using liver biopsy from stage 4 cancer patients, the investigators will evaluate and characterize the metastatic cells.
