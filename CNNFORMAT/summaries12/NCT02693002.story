(secondQuint)Estrogen Diastolic Heart Failure.

 This preliminary, feasibility study will randomize 28 peri-menopausal women to either hormone replacement therapy or placebo for 12 weeks.

 Prior to randomization, each participant will undergo echocardiography, measurements of activity using the Duke Activity Status Index, measurements of quality of life and laboratory data, including b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) measurements.

 Following the intervention for 12 weeks, these measurements will all be repeated.

 Estrogen Diastolic Heart Failure@highlight

Peri-menopausal women will be randomized to hormone replacement therapy or placebo for 12 weeks to determine if markers of systolic and diastolic function change by echocardiography as well as laboratory markers of heart failure, including b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP).
