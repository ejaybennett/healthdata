(fifthQuint)Effects of Eplerenone on Cardiovascular Disease in HIV (MIRACLE HIV Study).

 This is a 12 month randomized, placebo controlled study enrolling HIV-infected individuals with no known history of cardiovascular disease.

 Eplerenone is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, which can block aldosterone activation.

 This medication is approved by the FDA for high blood pressure and heart failure.

 This study aims to investigate the effect of eplerenone on other measures of cardiovascular disease in HIV.

 Using PET, MRI, and CT imaging technology, this study will evaluate whether eplerenone can improve coronary flow reserve and myocardial inflammation/fibrosis, in addition to atherosclerotic plaque build-up among the HIV population.

 The study also includes teaching on lifestyle modification to promote a healthy diet and exercise program.

There are 3 overnight visits in addition to safety visits.

 Effects of Eplerenone on Cardiovascular Disease in HIV (MIRACLE HIV Study)@highlight

HIV-infected individuals treated with antiretroviral medications are living longer, but have an increased risk of heart disease when compared to non-HIV-infected individuals.

 A hormone called aldosterone, which regulates blood pressure and sodium balance, is elevated in the HIV population in association with with increased belly fat and altered glucose metabolism.

 Elevations in aldosterone hormone may also be associated with abnormal blood flow, inflammation, and coronary plaque in the heart.

 This study is being conducted to evaluate whether therapies to reduce the actions of aldosterone may decrease the burden and progression of heart disease in the HIV population.
