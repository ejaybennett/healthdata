(thirdQuint)Sequential Intensive Chemotherapy Followed by RIC for Refractory and Relapse ALL.

 All patients with refractory and relapse lymphoblastic leukemia will receive a high-dose chemotherapy regimen consisting of fludaraibine+cytarabine+ cyclophosphamide+etoposide.

 At day 7 after chemo, a bone marrow aspiration and MRD study by flow-cytometry is planned.

 For those patients with no residual blasts will undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation with reduced intensity condiotning regimen consisting of 5-day fludarabine and 3-day busulfan and post-infusion cyclophophamide (D+3 and +4) as GVHD prophylaxis.

 Sequential Intensive Chemotherapy Followed by RIC for Refractory and Relapse ALL@highlight

Patients with refractory and relapse lymphoblastic leukemia had poor outcome even with marrow ablative conditioning mostly standard iv-Bu-Cy or Cy-TBI.

 In this study, we focus on a new treatment strategy with high-dose chemotherapy regimen consisting of fludaraibine+cytarabine+cyclophosphamide+etoposide followed by reduced intensity condiotning regimen consisting of fludarabine, busulfan and post-infusion cyclophophamide.
