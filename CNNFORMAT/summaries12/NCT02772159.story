(thirdQuint)TD-4208 Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) Study in Healthy Male Subjects.

 This is an open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period study in up to 12 healthy male subjects.

 The present study is designed to fully characterize the rates and routes of elimination of TD 4208 using radiolabeled drug administered via the oral and IV route.

 This study will provide information regarding the metabolic fate of TD 4208, the need for evaluation of potential drug-drug interactions, the need for studies in special populations and the absolute oral bioavailability of TD-4208.

 The results from this study will allow a comprehensive comparison between animal and human routes of elimination and metabolic profiles of TD 4208.

 This study will be conducted in a small number of healthy male subjects (up to n=12) to minimize the number of individuals exposed to radioactivity.

 Each subject will receive the following treatments: Treatment A (Period 1): 20 1/2g IV infusion of [14C] TD-4208 administered in a fasted state over 30 minutes.

 Treatment B (Period 2): 200 1/2g oral solution of [14C] TD-4208 administered in a fasted state.

 Blood, urine, feces, and vomitus (if applicable) will be collected until the subject is released during Periods 1 and 2.

 In Periods 1 and 2, subjects may remain in the clinical research unit for a maximum of 15 days.

 Between the dosing in periods 1 and 2, there will be washout intervals of at least 28 days.

 TD-4208 Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) Study in Healthy Male Subjects@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of an investigational medication used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

 The study drug will be tested in 6 healthy normal males.

 Dosing will include a single dose of study drug administered via an IV Infusion and an Oral Dose.

 There will be a 28 day washout period between each of the 2 dosing routes.
