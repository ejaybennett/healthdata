(secondQuint)Evaluation of Myocardial Perfusion Reserve.

 Coronary artery disease is a public health problem.

 The measurement of myocardial perfusion reserve is a prognostic factor supplemental.

 Its measure should influence the treatment and the follow up of the patients.

 The measurement of CRF by by one pressure-temperature sensor-tipped guide wire is a validated technique to evaluate the myocardial perfusion reserve but it is an invasive technique.

 In this study, the investigators will compare this method with a non-invasive method: completely automated analysis and quantification of myocardial blood flow from DICOM files corresponding to stress and rest images was developed with a new camera CZT SPECT.

 Evaluation of Myocardial Perfusion Reserve@highlight

The proposed study is to validate a non-invasive imaging technique to evaluate the myocardial perfusion reserve in comparison with a validated invasive technique, the measure of coronary flow reserve (CRF) with thermodilution.
