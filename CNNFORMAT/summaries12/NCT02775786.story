(fifthQuint)Prospective Evaluation of MRI Biomarkers in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.

 This is a prospective cohort study of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), which includes diffusion weighted imaging (DWI-MRI) in participants with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who are undergoing surgical resection.

 Participants will have up to two MRI scans with and without intravenous contrast.

 The MRI will be performed using either an extracellular contrast agent or using a macromolecular contrast agent.

 These contrast agents are routinely used in body MRI and are on formulary at this institution.

 Quantitative parameters of volume transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) will be calculated from the MRI sequences and each parameter will be compared to histopathology measures of mean vascular density and grade of fibrosis, respectively.

 The influence of the contrast agent (extracellular and macromolecular) on agreement between imaging parameters and histopathology will be assessed and agreement in Ktrans as derived from a one compartment and a two-compartment model will be assessed.

 The purpose is to establish a standard protocol for future clinical trials of treatments that would use MRI parameters as quantitative markers of treatment effect.
