(fifthQuint)Meta-analyses of the Effect of 'Catalytic' Doses of Fructose and Its Epimers on Carbohydrate Metabolism.

 Background: Despite advances in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes, its prevalence continues to rise worldwide.

 There is a need for new modalities to improve glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes and those who are overweight or obese and at risk for type 2 diabetes.

 Contrary to the concerns raised about the adverse role of fructose in metabolic health, there may be a role for fructose and its epimers, the rare non caloric sugars allulose (C-3 epimer of fructose), tagatose (C-4 epimer of fructose), and D-sorbose (C-3 and C-4 diastereomer of fructose).

 All are naturally found in small quantities in dried fruits and maple syrup.

 Bother allulose and tagatose are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration in the US and are marketed as low-calorie sugar substitutes that have anti-hyperglycemic effects.

 Various lines of evidence suggest that fructose and its epimers may improve the metabolic handling of glucose through inducing glycogen synthesis.

 Recent small trials in humans suggest that 'catalytic' doses (==1-week diet duration investigating the effect of small 'catalytic doses (==10 studies, then the investigators will also explore sources of heterogeneity by a priori subgroup analyses by participant phenotype, dose, comparator, baseline measurements, risk of bias, study design (parallel, crossover), energy balance (positive, neutral, negative), and duration of follow-up.

 Metaregression will assess the significance of categorical subgroup analyses and model continuous dose response relationships.

 Where no evidence of a linear relationship is observed, meta-regression spline curve modeling will be undertaken (the MKSPLINE procedure) to assess a dose threshold by characterizing segments of the dose-response curve where separate linear approximations may best describe the data.

 If there are more than 10 trial comparisons, then Publication publication bias will be assessed by inspection of funnel plot and the Egger and Begg tests.

 If publication bias is suspected, then an adjustment for funnel plot asymmetry will be attempted by imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim-and-fill method.

 Evidence Assessment: The strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).

 Knowledge translation plan: Results will be disseminated through traditional means such as interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in high impact factor journals.

 Innovative means such as webcasts with e-mail feedback mechanisms will also be used.

 Knowledge Users will act as knowledge brokers networking among opinion leaders and different adopter groups to increase awareness at each stage.

 Four Knowledge Users will also participate directly as members of nutrition guidelines committees.

 Target adopters will include industry and research communities.

 Feedback will be incorporated and used to guide analyses and improve key messages at each stage.

 Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the effects of fructose and its epimers on postprandial carbohydrate metabolism.

 This project aims to inform future design of single-meal feeding trials on fructose and its epimers by establishing the dose range for their effects on postprandial carbohydrate metabolism.

 Meta-analyses of the Effect of 'Catalytic' Doses of Fructose and Its Epimers on Carbohydrate Metabolism@highlight

Despite advances in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes, its prevalence continues to rise worldwide.

 There is a need for new modalities to improve metabolic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes and those who are overweight or obese and at risk for type 2 diabetes.

 Contrary to the concerns raised about the adverse role of fructose in metabolic health, various lines of evidence suggest that fructose and its epimers may improve the metabolic handling of glucose through inducing glycogen synthesis.

 Recent small trials in humans suggest that catalytic doses (=<10g/meal) of fructose and its epimers (allulose, tagatose, and sorbose) may reduce postprandial glycemic responses to carbohydrate loads (i.

e.

, oral glucose tolerance test or a starch load) in people with and without type 2 diabetes.

 There is also limited evidence that these acute effects may manifest as longer term improvements in glycemic control.

 There is an urgent need to synthesize the evidence of the effects of fructose and its epimers on postprandial carbohydrate metabolism.
