(thirdQuint)VEGA Prospective Kiel.

 This non-interventional clinical study (NIS) is conducted to clinically confirm the safety and performance of the Aesculap(R) VEGA System(R) PS components under routine conditions.

 The VEGA System(R) PS is an established TKA design, and there is a long-lasting experience in the use of PS components in particular; thus a NIS is thought to be sufficient to give the required confirmation.

 For this NIS only CE-marked medical devices have been used and will be used within their intended purpose and no additional invasive or other stressful examinations have been and are to be carried out (acc.

 to MPG 23b).

 This voluntary NIS is part of the post-marketing surveillance for the product under investigation.
