(thirdQuint)Evaluation of an Integrated Imaging System For In Vivo Detection of Fluorescently Labeled Lesions.

 Primary Objective -Positive fluorescence signal in SLNs imaged by the SmartGoggles system.

 Secondary Objectives - Confirmation of ICG within lesions per histologic tissue exam by SLN biopsy.

 - Comparison of lesions detected by the SmartGoggles vs.

 lesions detected using SPY Elite vs.

 gold standard of gamma probe and blue dyes.

 Exploratory Objectives -Collection of preliminary data for a future, powered study for lymphatic mapping in breast cancer Study Design This is an unpowered pilot study to determine the sensitivity of the new SmartGoggles device, for detection of ICG fluorescence in SLNs of breast cancers in a clinical setting.

 The investigators have chosen to examine ICG as the contrast agent and breast cancer as the clinical target, because this agent is FDA-approved and is regularly used for lymphatic mapping (skin cancers).

 The study team will be applying ICG for the same length of time as the standard-of-care procedures including radiotracers and blue dyes.

 The study involves a single visit, lasting ~3-4 hours total.

 Multiple biopsies will be performed if multiple SLNs are identified.

 The study will enroll 6 patients, and then be suspended for an interim analysis.

 If it is determined that more data are needed to reliably determine the endpoints, then 4 additional patients will be recruited, for a total of 10 patents.

 Evaluation of an Integrated Imaging System For In Vivo Detection of Fluorescently Labeled Lesions@highlight

This is a pilot study to test and characterize the ability of the SmartGoggles system to detect fluorescently labeled sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs).

 Specifically, this study will test the sensitivity and specificity of the SmartGoggles to detect indocyanine green (ICG) accumulation in sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer patients after peritumoral injection of ICG (Cardio-GreenTM), under standard-of-care application conditions.
