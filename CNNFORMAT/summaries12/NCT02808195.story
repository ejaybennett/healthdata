(firstQuint)Comparative Effectiveness of a Kinect-based Unilateral Arm Training System vs Constraint-Induced Therapy for Children With Cerebral Palsy.

 The specific aims of this study project will be: To compare the effectiveness of intervention groups using Kinect-based ULMTS with constraint-induced therapy on motor improvement in children with hemiplegic CP.

 The investigators hypothesize that motor improvement in using Kinect-based ULMTS will be comparable to constraint-induced therapy.
