(secondQuint)To Assess the Bioequivalence of Two Pacritinib Drug Product Formulations and FMI Formulation Following Oral Administration in Healthy Subjects.

 This study will be a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment sequence crossover study to determine the bioequivalence of pacritinib following administration of 400-mg doses of P3CT (Reference) and FMI (Test) formulations and to characterize the PK of pacritinib.

 Each subject will receive 2 treatments (a 400-mg oral dose of four 100-mg pacritinib P3CT [reference] formulation capsules and a 400-mg oral dose of four 100-mg pacritinib FMI [test] formulation capsules) in a 2-period crossover design.

 Each treatment will be administered as monotherapy during 1 of 2 treatment periods.

 A 9-day washout will separate the 2 administrations of study medication.

 Subjects will remain confined to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) throughout the study for safety observation and PK blood sample collection.
