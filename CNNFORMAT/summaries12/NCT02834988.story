(fifthQuint)Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection (SLND) in Patients With Apparent Early Stage Endometrial Cancer.

 This is an interventional, prospective, and non-therapeutic study evaluating the clinical utility of SLND for detecting nodal metastasis of early stage endometrial cancer.

 Patients will undergo surgical staging for EC (sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) via laparotomy, laparoscopy or robotic surgery, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO)).

 Pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy may (or may not) also be performed in addition to SLND, at the discretion of the Surgeon.

 Sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) will be removed; that is, all patients will have SLND.

 Pelvic washings may also be obtained.

 Pathology assessment of nodal metastasis will be performed in all nodes removed (SLN or any other enlarged or removed lymph nodes).

 Patients will be staged using International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) criteria and classified into risk strata (either low or high risk EC) as per the Modified Mayo Criteria.

 Based on the pathologic risk assessment and FIGO stage, patients may then be assigned to receive adjuvant treatment at the discretion of the treating Investigator and as per institutional guidelines; no per-protocol treatment is planned.

 Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection (SLND) in Patients With Apparent Early Stage Endometrial Cancer@highlight

The investigators hypothesize that performing SLND (instead of complete lymphadenectomy) will decrease complications such as hemorrhage, lower extremity lymphedema and lymphocyst formation while enhancing quality of life in EC patients with low risk for nodal involvement.

 The investigators also hypothesize that SLND is an effective method of staging these patients.

 Studies have shown that SLN mapping identifies positive lymph nodes in women with newly diagnosed EC and this prognostic information obtained from SLND could guide selection of adjuvant treatment and improve overall survival.

 Using SLND as an alternative may also have additional medical and economic impacts.

 Prolonged hospitalization and associated costs can be avoided by shortening overall surgery duration.
