(firstQuint)A Trial of the Jejunal to Ileal Diversion Endoscopic Procedure (Side-to-Side Anastomosis).

 The Jejunal to Ileal Diversion procedure is an adaptation of a biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, which is a surgical procedure used to treat metabolic syndrome conditions.

 The small bowel diversion of the jejunum into the ileum by creating a single anastomosis just beyond the ligament of Trietz will be studied.

 Up to 15 eligible subjects will be enrolled into the trial.

 Enrollment will stop once 10 subjects have undergone the Jejunal to Ileal Diversion procedure.
