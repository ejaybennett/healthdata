(fifthQuint)Soft Tissue Thickness on Submerged and Non Submerged Implants.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and radiographical results of submerged and nonsubmerged implants with thin (3 mm) soft tissue over 1.

5 year after implant placement.

 All submerged and nonsubmerged implants were randomly placed as split-mouth.

 Clinical periodontal parameters were recorded.

 Crestal bone levels were analyzed from the day of implants inserted to 1.

5 year after prosthetic loading on digitally standardized radiographs.

 Non-parametric test were used for statistically analysis.

 Soft Tissue Thickness on Submerged and Non Submerged Implants@highlight

Changes in the marginal bone level surrounding the implant are the frequently used parameters in assessing the short- and long-term success.

 Multiple biological and biomechanical factors have been reported to adversely affect marginal bone level.

 Recently, initial vertical mucosal tissue thickness has also been reported to have an impact on bone stability.

The hypothesis of present study is that soft tissue thickness on implant placement has no positive impact of crestal bone remodeling.
