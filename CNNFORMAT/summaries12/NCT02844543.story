(firstQuint)EYE-TRAC Advance: Technology Verification (ETA-TV) Cohort 1.

 The investigators propose to prospectively study a cohort of 18-25-year-old athletes.

 Athletes will be tested with the EYE-SYNC eye-tracking device prior to the start of an athletic practice or competition (pre-test) and then after the conclusion of the practice/competition (post-test).

 The investigators hope to understand if eye-tracking scores are effected by exercise and non-concussive bodily contact commonly incurred during athletic play.
