(fifthQuint)Intermittent Portal and Graft Purge in Living Donor Liver Transplantation.

 Patients are subjected to living donor liver transplantation.

 In this type of grafts, cold ischemia time is minimal and the graft contents of preservative solution are less than cadaveric grafts.

 The investigators in the current research use HTC as a preservative solution.

 These factors justified the possibility of purging the graft and portal blood contents into the patient systemic circulation.

 The exposure to these fluids in this trial will be in an intermittent manner: the portal vein will be declamped for 5 seconds followed by 30 seconds of portal clamping.

 This will be repeated twice.

 The primary outcome objective in this trial will be the incidence of post-reperfusion syndrome.

 Secondary objectives include the severity of PRS, the incidence and severity of ischemia-reperfusion injury, graft and patient's survival.

 Intermittent Portal and Graft Purge in Living Donor Liver Transplantation@highlight

Post-reperfusion syndrome and ischemia-reperfusion insult are a common well-known complication in liver transplantation.

 Several trials investigated variables that my contribute to the generation of these two complications for reducing their incidence and magnitude.

 The investigators will investigate the effect of acute conditioning of the recipients circulation to the vasoactive mediators in the graft as well as the congested intestine through intermittent purging of graft contents into the patient's systemic circulation in living donor liver transplantation.
