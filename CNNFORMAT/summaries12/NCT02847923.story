(secondQuint)Software for Alternative Communication.

 Communication is a fundamental element that contributes to the development of the human being, promoting their coexistence in society.

 However, several factors, among them the Cerebral palsy (CP), can cause changes in muscle tone, causing injury in phono-articulatory which prevent or impair the speech production.

 This research aims to the development of a mobile application to promote the augmentative and alternative communication for people with CP, which adapt to the characteristics of motor limitations of these users.

 A mobile application was developed with pictographic resources and a voice synthesis engine, which can be customized according to the level of motor impairment and need for communication of the user.

 Were recruited 30 volunteers with CP who have speech difficulties and motor impairment.

 By means of a test script, these volunteers have used the mobile application and evaluated their usability using the questionnaire System Usability Scale (SUS), which contains 10 questions related to the ease of learning, efficiency, ease of memorization, occurrence of runtime errors of execution and level of user satisfaction.
