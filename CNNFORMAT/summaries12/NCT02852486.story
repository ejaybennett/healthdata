(secondQuint)Study of Imatinib Discontinuation in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia With Deep Molecular Response.

 Treatment of chronic myeloid leucemia (CML) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) changed dramatically the prognosis of CML, with high rates of cytogenetic and molecular remission and increase of overall and progression-free survival.

 However, the long-term treatment of CML has a high cost to the health system, due to the price of these drugs and the need for continued use.

 In addition, chronic adverse effects may compromise the quality of life of patients.

 Discontinuation trials of TKIs have been developed in order to identify groups of patients who may benefit from treatment discontinuation if they have obtained deeper molecular responses.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate treatment free remission (TFR) after imatinib discontinuation in patients treated for more than 3 years with imatinib and with deep molecular response stable for two years (defined in the present study as a molecular response of 4.

 Study of Imatinib Discontinuation in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia With Deep Molecular Response@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate treatment-free remission after imatinib discontinuation in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia with deep molecular response.

 Before discontinuation, patients will receive pioglitazone associated with imatinib during 3 months.
