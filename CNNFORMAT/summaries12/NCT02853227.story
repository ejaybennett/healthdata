(fifthQuint)The Telemark Score: a Reliable Method for Evaluation of Results After Breast Surgery.

 Background: Validated instruments for assessing results after breast surgery are sparse.

 Investigators want to present a method used for the past 10 years at their institution for evaluation of the outcome after breast conserving surgery (BCS) and microsurgical breast reconstruction.

 Methods: 346 consecutive patients subjected to BCS for cancer and 30 patients operated with a deep inferior epigastric flap (DIEP ) were assessed at least one year after the operation.

 The Telemark Breast Score is a method based on standard two-dimensional photographs assessing the outcome after breast surgery in terms of volume, shape and symmetry.

 Three different panels including plastic surgeons, breast surgeons and nurses were invited to test the Telemark Breast Score.

 Consistency of agreement between and inside the panel groups was studied Results: Inter- and intra observer reliability was acceptable.

 Good stability of ratings could be shown in test-retests.

 Conclusion: The Telemark Breast Scale is inexpensive, statistically reliable and can be applied for quality control after breast surgery.

 The Telemark Score: a Reliable Method for Evaluation of Results After Breast Surgery@highlight

This paper will present a specific tool for evaluation of cosmetic results after breast conserving surgery (BCS) and secondary breast reconstruction with free DIEP-flap.

 Introduction of a breast score system using digital photography seems to be a reliable tool for estimation of cosmetic results after breast surgery.

 The method has been employed on a specific group of 346 consecutive patients operated for breast cancer with breast conserving surgery.

 For the purpose of this study breast score system was tested on patients with free flap breast reconstruction (DIEP flap).
