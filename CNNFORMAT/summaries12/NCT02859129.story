(firstQuint)Study to Evaluate the 2-Way Interaction Between Multiple Doses of Epanova and a Single Dose of Rosuvastatin (Crestor).

 The PK of rosuvastatin will be monitored following single-dose administration of rosuvastatin with and without multiple-dose administration of 4 g Epanova cent for 13 consecutive days in order to detect a possible interaction between rosuvastatin and Epanova cent .

 The PK of total EPA, total DHA and total EPA+DHA will also be monitored following multiple-dose administration of Epanova cent with and without single-dose administration of 40 mg rosuvastatin.

 A single dose administration for rosuvastatin has been judged sufficient to yield plasma concentrations that will be detectable with an adequate validated analytical method and characterize adequately the PK of rosuvastatin.
