(secondQuint)Simultaneously Integrated Dose Escalation for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer.

 Concurrent radiation therapy and chemotherapy is the standard of care for locally advanced cervical cancer.

 While there are several acceptable means to boost the disease in the low pelvis (i.

e.

 brachytherapy, IMRT, or external beam), there is limited research into minimal invasive surgical resection after maximal downstage.

 This protocol is designed to determine the dose escalation of both chemo and radiation for treating tumor bearing regions within the abdomen and pelvis, using an two drug chemotherapy in first cycle of mitomycin/cisplatin or taxol/cisplatin along with simultaneously integrated boost technique to Biological target area defined by PET scan.

 This dose escalation is to downstage disease for minimal invasive surgical resection.

 Simultaneously Integrated Dose Escalation for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of minimal invasive surgical resection through simultaneously integrated dose escalation given concurrently with chemotherapy for locally advanced squamous cell cervical cancer.
