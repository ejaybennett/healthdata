(secondQuint)Individualizing Dose of Growth Hormone to Maintain Normal Growth Velocity After Fulfilled Catch up Growth in Children.

 The aim of the trial is to study the effect of adapted GH treatment in order to find an individualized GH dose maintaining normal growth velocity close to target height SDS and normal metabolism after fulfilled catch up growth in prepubertal children treated with individual doses of GH within the trail 98-0198-003 (1).

 The overall aim is to find for the individual the lowest effective GH dose during maintenance period, maintaining normal growth velocity and metabolism, i.

 a satisfacto1y biological active dose.

The objective was to study whether normal growth velocity can be maintained with adapted GH dosage in GH treated prepubertal children who have responded to GH treatment with fulfilled catch up growth (=difference to target height reached, less than - 0.

6 SDS).
