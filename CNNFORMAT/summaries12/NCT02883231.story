(firstQuint)Plasma Level of Mitochondrial DNA in Patients With ARDS and Its Clinical Significance.

 60 patients who diagnosed as ARDS were included in this study.

Then keep blood samples from these patients in the first day,the third day and the sveventh day,detect the mitochotndrial DNA level in plasma by real-time quantitative PCR.

 Recored Severity of illness and survival status of every patient within 28 days.

Objective to evaluate the correlation between the level of mitochondrial DNA in plasma and the prognosis of the patients.
