(secondQuint)Effectiveness of Oral Alfacalcidol for Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Chronic Hemodialysis Patients.

.

 ESRD patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism in 3 hemodialysis centers were enrolled.

 They were assigned to either oral daily or pulse (trice a week) alfacalcidol treatments using block-of-4 randomization.

 Alfacalcidol in both groups were equal at the dose of 6 microgram per week.

 Clinical and laboratory data were obtained at baseline and were monitored every 4 weeks for 12 weeks.

 Primary outcome was the difference of the mean PTH reduction between two groups at the end of the study by unpaired-T test.

 All possible adverse events were carefully monitored.

Primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy between daily and pulse oral alfacalcidol treatment of SHPT in chronic hemodialysis patients, a 12-week treatment.

 Secondary objective was to observe the adverse effects between these two treatment regimens.
