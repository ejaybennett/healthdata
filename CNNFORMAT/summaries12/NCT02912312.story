(thirdQuint)Shortening Adjuvant Photon Irradiation to Reduce Edema (SAPHIRE): Hypofractionated Versus Conventionally Fractionated Regional Nodal Irradiation for Invasive Breast Cancer.

 Shorter radiation, delivered over 3 to 4 weeks, is standard treatment for women receiving radiation to just the breast.

 Clinical research studies with 10 years of follow up show that shorter radiation, delivered over 3 to 4 weeks, provides similar cancer control as longer radiation, delivered over 5 to 6 weeks, for women receiving radiation therapy to the breast.

 Additionally women receiving shorter radiation were less likely to develop radiation side effects.

 Shorter radiation has not been as well studied for women receiving radiation therapy delivered to the lymph nodes near the breast lymph.

 However, shorter radiation may also reduce side effects from radiation to the lymph nodes near the breast.

 If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete questionnaires about your general health, your arm function, your and your family's history of cardiac risks and blood pressure, and how your breast or chest currently looks and feels.

 This should take about 15 minutes to complete.

 The size and volume of your arms will be measured with a perometer.

 The arm is inserted into a vertical or horizontal frame and the size and volume of the arm is measured using light beams.

 You will also have a physical exam and your medical history will be recorded.

 Study Groups: You will then be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups.

 You will have an equal chance of being assigned to each group.

 Group 1 will receive shorter radiation.

 Group 2 will receive standard radiation.

 If you are in Group 1, you will receive about 3 weeks of radiation (15 treatments) to the entire breast or chest wall and the lymph nodes in that area.

 If you are in Group 2, you will receive about 5 weeks of radiation (25 treatments) to the entire breast or chest wall and the lymph nodes in that area.

 Participants in both groups will also have 5-8 additional treatments of radiation as a "boost".

 The boost will be delivered to the part of the breast where the disease first started if you had a lumpectomy and will be delivered to the chest wall if you had a mastectomy.

 You will receive separate consent forms for the radiation therapy.

 Study Visits: You will have blood drawn (about 1 teaspoon) for routine tests within 3 months prior to receiving radiation or within the first week before starting radiation treatment.

 While you are receiving radiation, during your routine visits, you will be asked about any side effects you may be having each week.

 Follow-up Visits: You will return to the clinic for follow-up visits about 6 and 18 months after radiation.

 You will then have visits every year until 10 1/2 years after completion of radiation.

 At Months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 66, and 126 months after radiation therapy, you will complete the questionnaires about your general health and arm function and will have your arm volume measured.

 Length of Study: Your participation on this study will be over after the 126 month (10 1/2 year) visit.

 This is an investigational study.

 Both the standard and the shorter radiation courses are delivered using FDA-approved and commercially available methods.

 The goal of this study is to compare the 2 treatments.

 Up to 290 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

The goal of this clinical research study is to compare how often arm swelling develops after 4 weeks of radiation treatment to how often arm swelling develops after 6 weeks of radiation treatment in patients who receive radiation therapy delivered to the lymph nodes near the breast.

 Researchers also want to know about other side effects that can develop during or after radiation treatment.
