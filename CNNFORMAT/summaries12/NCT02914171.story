(fifthQuint)Study of Autologous Bone Marrow Derived Mononuclear Cells for Treatment of Ebstein Anomaly.

 This study is an open label Phase I trial to determine the safety and feasibility of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells to the right ventricle of subjects with Ebstein anomaly at the time of a planned surgical Ebstein repair compared to the control group undergoing the same planned surgical intervention without the cell delivery add-on procedure.

 Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visits at Mayo Clinic and interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered participation in this trial.

 Subject/Family will decide to participate in cell delivery or control arm.

 Once informed consent has been obtained, subjects will undergo identical evaluation (other than Hematology consultation and BM harvest occurring only in the cell-treatment group),preoperative values will be established/confirmed and a selection committee will review subjects within three days prior to planned procedure to confirm inclusion and exclusion criteria.

 This will require a non-study cardiologist to review the clinical case and confirm the baseline cardiac function with evidence of right ventricle dysfunction.

 However, individuals at high-risk, primarily neonates and those with preoperative advanced right heart failure will NOT be included such that the risk of this add-on procedure may not be acceptable.

 Following surgical Ebstein repair for the control group and following cell-based product delivery for the treatment group, all subjects will be followed for 24-months according to a pre-determined schedule that includes imaging studies along with a questionnaire, electrophysiology and laboratory studies at 1, 6, and 24 months post procedure.

 All subjects will be contacted for surveillance by phone at 3, 12, and 18 month post procedure.

 Study of Autologous Bone Marrow Derived Mononuclear Cells for Treatment of Ebstein Anomaly@highlight

The objective of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of autologous mononuclear cells (MNS) collected from bone marrow (BM) and using an add-on intramyocardial delivery for individuals with Ebstein anomaly undergoing surgical intervention compared to the control group undergoing the same surgical procedure without cell delivery.

 This add-on procedure has the potential to foster a new strategy for individuals with congenital heart disease.

This is an open-label study of autologous MNC derived from bone marrow with a 2-year follow-up to document 1) incidence and severity of adverse event and 2) monitor changes in cardiac structure and function.
