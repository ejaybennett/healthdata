(thirdQuint)Early Progressive Feeding in Human-Milk Fed Extremely Preterm Infants: A Randomized Trial.

 Qualifying participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups: 1) Early progressive feeding without MEF or 2) Progressive feedings preceded by 4 days of MEF.

 Regardless of study group assignment, donor human milk will be offered if not enough of the mother's expressed breastmilk during the intervention phase of the trial.

 Intervention group: Progressive feeding of 20-24 ml/kg/d on day 1 of feeding, followed by daily increments of 24-25 ml/kg/d as tolerated until full enteral feeding achieved.

 Control group: MEF with feeding volumes of 20-24 ml/kg/d for 4 days followed by progressive feeding (daily increments of 24-25 ml/kg/d) as tolerated until full enteral feeding achieved.

 Both groups will receive fast progressive feeding (>/= 24 ml/kg/day) If parent agrees, stool "dirty" diapers will be collected 5 times (at birth, 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks of life).

 Early Progressive Feeding in Human-Milk Fed Extremely Preterm Infants: A Randomized Trial@highlight

To test the hypothesis that progressive feeding without minimal enteral feeding (MEF) compared to progressive feeding preceded by a 4-day course of MEF will result in an increased number of days alive on full enteral feeding in the first 28 days after birth in extremely preterm infants receiving human milk.
