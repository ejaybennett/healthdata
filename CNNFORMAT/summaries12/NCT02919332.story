(fifthQuint)Delayed 18F-FDG PET/CT in Improving Visualization of Brain Tumors in Patients With Glioblastoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To improve the visualization/delineation of glioblastoma lesions using delayed 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F-18 intravenously (IV).

 Patients then undergo a standard of care PET/CT scan at 60 minutes and a second PET/CT scan at 240 minutes after injection.

 Note: Standard Uptake Value (SUV) is defined for state-of-the art PET/CT scanners as Standardized uptake values = count activity per ml within region of interest (MBq/ml)/[injected dose (MBq)/body weight (kgx1000)].

 Delayed 18F-FDG PET/CT in Improving Visualization of Brain Tumors in Patients With Glioblastoma@highlight

This clinical trial studies how well delayed fludeoxyglucose F-18 (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in improving visualization of brain tumors in patients with glioblastoma.

 Radiotracers such as 18F-FDG are highly taken up by tumors in the brain and are visualized using PET/CT.

 Increasing the interval of time between 18F-FDG administration and PET/CT scan may improve the visualization of brain tumors in patients with glioblastoma.
