(secondQuint)Change in Serum Chloride Level After Loading Dose of Sterofundin Solution Compared With Normal Saline Solution.

 10 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either normal saline or sterofundin for the first solution in dose of 30 mL/kg (max 2 L) over 1 hour.

 Blood was collected at baseline (T0), at 60 minutes (T1), 120 minutes (T2), and 240 minutes (T4) from baseline.

 Time to fist void after initiation of fluid and urine volume were also recorded.

 After wash-out period of at least 1 week, crossover studies were performed with another fluid.
