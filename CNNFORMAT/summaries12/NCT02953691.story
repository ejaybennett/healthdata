(fifthQuint)Exploring the Impact of Perioperative Galacto-Oligosaccharides (GOS) on Stress, Anxiety and Cognition.

 AIM 1: In anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) subjects, explore the association between prebiotics, anxiety, and pain.

 Studies have recently elucidated a link between certain prebiotics and lower perceived anxiety as well as biomarkers of stress.

 In this aim the investigators will explore the association between consumption of prebiotics and their relationship to perioperative anxiety / physiological stress response.

 The investigators hypothesize that subjects who receive prebiotics will have lower perioperative anxiety and stress versus control as measured by standardized surveys and biomarkers.

 Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that lower anxiety will result in lower postoperative pain scores.

 AIM 2: In ACDF patients, explore the association between GOS and post-operative cognitive dysfunction.

 Stress and anxiety is known to impair cognitive function.

 In addition, in preclinical studies, the administration of distinct keystone bacterial strains improves cognitive function in an anxious mouse model.

 In humans, prebiotics and probiotics have been shown to ameliorate the stress response.

 In this aim the investigators seek to explore the association between prebiotics and perioperative cognitive outcomes in humans.

 The investigators will perform cognitive function testing using the same time-tested battery used in the department to study post-operative cognitive decline (POCD).

 Subjects will be tested for cognitive function preoperatively (T1) and at 1.

5 months post-op (T4).

 The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving prebiotics during the perioperative period will show less post-operative cognitive dysfunction than controls.

 A total of 8 subjects will be recruited from the Neurosurgery Clinics of Duke University Health System.

 The target population will include subjects undergoing ACDF.

 Exclusion criteria will include: pregnant women, age<21 years, a diagnosis of depression, mental or behavioral disorder, recent anxiolytic use, long-term opiate use, oral contraceptive use, or recent antibiotic use.

 Exploring the Impact of Perioperative Galacto-Oligosaccharides (GOS) on Stress, Anxiety and Cognition@highlight

The overall objective of this proposal is to explore the association between the administration of the prebiotics GOS (trade name: Bimuno Travelaid; generic name:B galacto-oligosaccharides) with pain, anxiety, and cognitive function in the perioperative period.

 The investigators' central hypothesis is subjects who consume GOS in the perioperative period will demonstrate lower levels of salivary cortisol before, during, and after their operative procedures.

 In addition, the investigators expect subjects who consume GOS to have lower perceived levels of anxiety during the perioperative period.

 Finally, the investigators hypothesize that subjects who consume perioperative GOS will perform better on tests of cognition in the postoperative period.

 Such a finding would be beneficial in that administration of GOS in the perioperative period offers a safe and inexpensive adjunct to current medical management of perioperative anxiety.
