(firstQuint)CAR T Cells for Refractory B Cell Malignancy.

 The CAR consists of a CD19 targeting antibody scFv with three intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta, CD28 and 4-1BB.

 Autologous T cells will be gene engineered with the CAR gene using a lentivirus vector.

 Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment.

 After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy.
