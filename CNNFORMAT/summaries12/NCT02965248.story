(secondQuint)Adjuvant Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) Versus no HIPEC in Locally Advanced Colorectal Cancer (APEC Study).

 Peritoneum is one of the common sites of metastasis in advanced stage colorectal cancer patients, resulting in a poor prognosis.

 Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is effective to colorectal peritoneal metastasis and may play a significant role in reducing the risk of metachronous peritoneal metastasis among patients with locally advanced colorectal cancer.

 Oxaliplatin is routinely used for HIPEC in the Europe and Raltitrexed may be another ideal drug for HIPEC.

 The present phase II multicenter, randomized controlled trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant HIPEC with raltitrexed or oxaliplatin versus no HIPEC in locally advanced colorectal cancer.
