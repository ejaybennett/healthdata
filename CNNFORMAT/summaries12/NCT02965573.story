(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetics of ARGX-113 in Patients With Myasthenia Gravis Who Have Generalized Muscle Weakness.

 Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized in most cases by T cell and antibody responses to neuromuscular junction proteins such as skeletal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR).

 Antibodies against epitopes of the AChR of the neuromuscular junction cause failure of neuromuscular transmission, resulting in the characteristic fatigue and weakness associated with this severe disorder.

 The study will evaluate an innovative candidate in MG.
