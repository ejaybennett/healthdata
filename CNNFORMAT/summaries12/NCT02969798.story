(thirdQuint)Pre-diabetes in Subject With Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) and Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT).

 SPECIFIC AIMS: 1.

 To examine the effect of the following pharmacologic interventions on beta cell function, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance status in individuals with isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): (i) treatment with the renal Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor inhibitor, dapagliflozin; (ii) treatment with the inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase 4, also DPP4, saxagliptin ; (iii) treatment with the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone; (iv) treatment with the biguanide, metformin.

 2.

 To examine the effect of the following pharmacologic interventions on beta cell function, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance status in individuals with isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG): (i) treatment with the renal SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin; (ii) treatment with the DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin; (iii) treatment with the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone; (iv) treatment with the biguanide, metformin.

 3.

 To examine the effect of the following pharmacologic interventions on beta cell function, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance status in individuals with combined impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) plus impaired fasting glucose (IFG): i) treatment with the renal SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin; (ii) treatment with the DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin; (iii) treatment with the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone; (iv) treatment with the biguanide, metformin.

 Pre-diabetes in Subject With Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) and Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT)@highlight

HYPOTHESIS: Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) have distinct pathophysiologic etiologies.

 Therefore, therapeutic interventions designed to correct the specific underlying pathogenic abnormalities in IGT and IFG will be required to optimally prevent the progressive beta cell failure and development of overt type 2 diabetes.
