(firstQuint)Auditory-somatosensory Stimulation to Alleviate Tinnitus.

 This study consented 35 adult subjects.

 21 subjects qualified and were randomized into the study.

 This project will develop and test a device with the ultimate goal of providing a patient operated device to alleviate phantom sound perception, or tinnitus, based on patient-feedback for stimulus presentation.

 The device, an electrical-acoustical stimulus timing, is based on physiological findings of stimulus-timing-dependent plasticity in somatosensory and auditory nuclei,that when aberrant, contribute to tinnitus.
