(thirdQuint)PyroTITAN Humeral Resurfacing Arthroplasty (HRA).

 The study is designed as a single center, post-market, non-randomized, open-label, observational clinical study with retrospective and prospective enrollment to evaluate the 2-year post implantation survivorship of the PyroTITAN cent HRA device following the implementation of a new proof test to identify and eliminate devices with sub-standard mechanical integrity.

 The results will be compared to data collected in a prior study conducted before implementing the new proof test.

 The PyroTITAN cent HRA Shoulder prosthesis device configuration will include humeral resurfacing CAP without cement.

 Patients will be selected retrospectively and prospectively for recruitment into the study based upon the normally accepted criteria for primary shoulder resurfacing arthroplasty.

 137 subjects with PyroTITAN cent HRA Shoulder prosthesis arthroplasties will be implanted and followed for up to 60 months.
