(secondQuint)Piloting Healthcare Coordination in Hypertension.

 GOAL: Conduct a prospective randomized pilot clinical trial embedded within the care delivery system at University of California Medical Center (UCSF MC).

 It is intended to evaluate the efficacy of a decision support clinical reasoning artificial intelligence in improving medication treatment management for patients with poorly controlled hypertension (HTN).

 Its primary goal is to de-risk the implementation of a subsequent randomized and powered for clinical efficacy trial.

 RECRUITMENT: patients with uncontrolled HTN (10 mmHg above BP national guidelines goal) at UCSF MC Cardiology Clinic.

 STUDY: Three-arms study: (a) optima4BP surveillance and treatment recommendation support (O4BP); (b) usual care (UC) - usual care seen as needed by the treating physician; (c) enhanced care (EC) - UC + raw remotely collected BP values sent to the treating physician.

 All patients will undergo at least 2 in-office visits, a baseline visit and an exit visit.

 All patients will be asked to provide every 30 days the following information: (a) adherence to current HTN treatment; and (b) experienced side-effects and severity.

 Health-e-Heart (HeH) automated system (https://www.

health-eheartstudy.

org/) will collect the Qardio(R) data, as frequently as the patient records them, and provide patients with a unique link to a secure web interface for reporting of side-effects, adherence, and symptoms.

 Every 30 days, the collection of patient information will be followed by an arm-specific action.

 For identified patients in need of a medication change, O4BP physicians will receive a treatment change recommendation for review.

 UC physicians will not receive any information, while EC physicians will receive curated BP values reported by the patient.

 ANALYSES: The impact of O4BP arm on coordination of care will be determined by: - evaluating interoperability between multiple platforms in collecting-structuring-exchanging data - evaluating improvement in quality of care (physician adoption) and quality of life (patient adoption) versus EC and UC care.

The purpose of the PRECISION study is to compare a clinical reasoning artificial intelligence for hypertension treatment management with usual care (UC) and enhanced care (EC) in patients with poorly controlled hypertension.
