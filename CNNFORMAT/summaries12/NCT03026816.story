(thirdQuint)Epidural Stimulation After Neurologic Damage.

 Epidural spinal cord stimulation for the purpose of facilitating volitional movement is a new and novel neuromodulatory treatment.

 Epidural SCS has a long history of use for chronic pain with established medical device platforms.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate and establish the use of SCS for volitional movement.

 Specifically, establishing the disinhibitory effect of SCS in a greater population with inherent greater variability.

 In addition to establishing the disinhibitory effect of SCS for cSCI, our study attempts to explore the parameter space of the spinal cord stimulator platforms in order to optimize stimulation settings for patients through the creation of a clinical decision support system (CDSS).

 Preliminary evidence suggests benefit to autonomic function, and this study also begins to explore the effects of SCS on cardiovascular function, urinary function, psychiatric outcomes, and quality of life, which all offer significant potential for patients suffering from chronic spinal cord injury.

This study will evaluate a method to optimize parameter settings in epidural spinal cord stimulation used to recover lower extremity volitional movement.

 The study will also characterize improvement in autonomic function (such as blood pressure control) and other functions related to spinal cord injury.
