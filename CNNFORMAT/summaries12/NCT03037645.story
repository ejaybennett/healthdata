(fifthQuint)Safety, PK, PD, and Antitumor Activity of SNS-062 (Vecabrutinib) in B Lymphoid Cancers.

 Phase 1b (Dose Escalation) This portion of the study will evaluate the safety and pharmacology of a range of SNS-062 (vecabrutinib) dose levels administered to subjects with previously treated B-lymphoid malignancies, including: chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the activated B-cell subtype (DLBCL-ABC), and follicular lymphoma (FL).

 All subjects will self-administer SNS-062 orally BID.

 The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) window will be 4 weeks (1 cycle in length).

 Assessments on study will be performed in 4-week cycles.

 Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled at progressively higher dose levels of SNS-062 using a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design.

 Based on the pattern of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed in the first cycle (4 weeks), escalation will proceed to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or a recommended dose (RD) that may be the MTD or a lower dose.

 An additional 6 subjects may be accrued at the MTD or the RD to confirm SNS-062 safety and pharmacology as a prelude to further clinical evaluation.

 Assessments regarding DLTs and dose escalation will be performed by a Safety Review Committee (SRC) comprising, but not limited to, the principal investigators, the medical monitor and the study sponsor drug safety representative.

 Phase 2 (Cohort Expansion) This portion of the study provides cohort expansion to further explore the clinical activity, safety, and pharmacology of SNS-062 monotherapy.

 Accrual will occur independently for each of the 4 disease and mutation-specific cohorts.

 Subjects will self-administer SNS-062 orally at the RD of SNS-062 identified in the Phase 1b portion of the study.

 The SRC will meet regularly to assess the efficacy and safety for each cohort.

Phase 1b (Dose Escalation) in primarily CLL/SLL patients will evaluate safety and pharmacology of self-administered twice a day oral doses beginning at 25 mg/dose for 4 weeks with succeeding cohorts at escalating doses until establishing dose limiting toxicity or, recommended Phase 2 dose.

 Patient data will be assessed before authorizing dose escalation cohorts.

 Phase 2 (Cohort Expansion) will follow in cohorts using the recommended dose to explore clinical activity, safety, pharmacology of SNS-062 (vecabrutinib) as monotherapy.
