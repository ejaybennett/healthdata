(thirdQuint)Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound in Critically Ill Patients With Cardiovascular Comorbidities.

 Intracranial hypertension is associated with altered transcranial doppler parameters measured in the middle cerebral artery such as decreasing diastolic velocity and increasing pulsatility index with higher intracranial pressure (ICP).

 Chronic vascular diseases in modifying arterial resistance may interfere with transcranial Doppler ultrasound assessment mimicking intracranial hypertension profile.

 The aim of this prospective, single centre study enrolling critically ill patients without any acute neurological disease is to to determine the pattern of transcranial Doppler ultrasound variables amongst patients with and without chronic vascular diseases.

 Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound in Critically Ill Patients With Cardiovascular Comorbidities@highlight

Transcranial Doppler ultrasound is bedside tool use to assess cerebral blood perfusion in critically ill patients.

 We sought to conduct a prospective, single centre study aiming to determine whether chronic vascular diseases may be a confounder in transcranial Doppler ultrasound assessment in critically ill patients.
