(fifthQuint)Natural History and Advanced Genetic Study of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiencies.

 Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiencies are a major class of mitochondrial diseases, limiting oxidation of carbohydrate for energy production, which is especially important in the brain.

 So far, there is not a definitive treatment for these disorders.

 This study, "Natural History and Advanced Genetic Study of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiencies," will create a database with information that is collected over a long period of time about patients with PDC deficiencies.

 This database will be a part of the existing North American Mitochondrial Disease Consortium (NAMDC) Patient Data Registry and Biorepository database.

 The study will collect data specific to PDC deficiencies, including data that is derived from patients/families.

 Approximately 150-200 subjects with confirmed PDC deficiencies will be enrolled over 4 years.

 The genetic basis and pathophysiology will be explored in up to a third of confirmed PDC deficient patients, who currently have not been found to have an identified mutation in DLD or any of the five "primary" PDC-specific genes (PDHA1, PDHB, DLAT, PDHX, and PDP1), and who might benefit from different treatments.

 The specific aims are: 1.

 Create a Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC) Deficiencies specific database within the NAMDC Patient Data Registry 2.

 Use advanced genetic analysis technologies to find mutations in those people in whom none has been found 3.

 Identify connections between these clinical and genetic findings to see if there are different types of PDC deficiencies that may respond to different treatments, and to identify outcomes and forms of treatment that could be tested in ongoing and future studies.

 About this Study: This study will collect comprehensive (complete) longitudinal natural history clinical data for proven Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC) deficiencies, including data about diagnoses, symptoms, and outcomes.

 The study will include data from patients/parents as well as medical data.

 The investigators will use medical records and a detailed questionnaire targeted to collect in-depth information about critical outcomes.

 This questionnaire will collect information from the subject and parent about the importance of different outcomes and allow families to discuss other outcomes that they may consider important at home.

 These data will be updated cyclically on an annual basis (every 6 months in infants) from medical and laboratory records and family questionnaires/interviews.

 Additional details of treatment will be sought to maximize our knowledge about their effects.

 The investigators will obtain from enrolled subjects, on an annual basis, deproteinized whole EDTA-blood samples for analysis of lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHB), thiamine and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), as markers of disease status and treatment efficacy.

 Data analysis will focus on the spectrum of neurological manifestations of PDC deficiency, clinically relevant outcome measures, and responses to therapeutic interventions.

 Such analyses will serve to inform future clinical trials.

 Natural History and Advanced Genetic Study of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiencies@highlight

Children and adults with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency are participating in a research study seeking to better understand the genetic causes, symptoms, usefulness of current treatments, and outcomes for these disorders.

 The research project involves completing a questionnaire about the individual or family's medical history and experiences with PDC deficiency, review of medical records by the researchers, and in some cases, advanced genetic testing.

 A blood draw will be requested, and an optional skin biopsy is part of the study for some participants.
