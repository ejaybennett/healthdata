(firstQuint)Contralaterally Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation Plus Video Games for Hand Therapy After Stroke.

 A single-blinded randomized controlled trial will be carried out to assess the effects of 12 weeks of Contralaterally Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation (CCFES) +Hand Therapy Video Games (HTVG) compared to CCFES.

 Dexterity, upper limb impairment, and activity limitation will be assessed at 0 (baseline), 3, 6, 9, 12 (end of treatment), 24, and 36 wks.

 Cortical activation (measured with fMRI) will be assessed at 0 and 12 wks.

 The treatment dose will be the same for both groups: 10 sessions per week (7.

5 hrs) of self-administered treatment at home plus 2 sessions per week (3 hrs) of group-specific occupational therapy in the lab.
