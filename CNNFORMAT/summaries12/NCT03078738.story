 Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of OMT-28 in Healthy Subjects@highlight

The aim of this first-in-human study is to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and exploratory pharmacodynamics (PD) of single and multiple oral ascending doses of OMT-28 in healthy male subjects to support further clinical development of OMT-28 in the indication of atrial fibrillation (AF) and to obtain data on food and gender effects of OMT-28 to guide dosing for Phase II trials.
