(secondQuint)Sublingual Versus Endovenous Fentanyl for the Prehospital Analgesia in Patients With Limb Trauma on the Slope.

 Fentanyl endovenous (ev) is an excellent analgesic drug for pain relief in acute traumatic pain.

 Fentanyl sublingual (Abstral (R)) is an excellent analgesic drug in the breakthrough cancer pain relief in oncologic patients.

 The immediate (less than 10 minutes) effect and the ease of administration of sublingual fentanyl is a feasible drug administration for immediate analgesia in remote areas such as mountain rescue missions eg.

 the slope.

 Patients will be recruited according to a randomized list to fentanyl ev or fentanyl sublingual versus placebo oral or placebo ev.

 Safety issues like control of vital signs will be warranted.
