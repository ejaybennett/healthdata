(thirdQuint)The Effect of Social Relationships on Psychological Distress and Disease Progression in Patients With Diabetes.

 This is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded comparative group clinical trial of 48 participants receiving social interaction in addition to standard diabetes care or standard diabetes care alone.

 All participants will have a baseline and 6 month follow-up visit where assessment of their A1C, diabetes distress, and social support will be performed.

 Participants randomized to the social interaction cohort will meet on a monthly basis for a two hour group session designed to build social connections.

 In addition, participants will be paired with another study participant in this group, and will be asked to meet on a monthly basis for a minimum of 45 minutes.

 All participants in the social support cohort will continue to receive best standard diabetes management.

 Participants in the control group will be treated with standard diabetes care.

 At the end of the 6-month study, they will have the opportunity to engage in the same social interventions offered to the social interaction group.
