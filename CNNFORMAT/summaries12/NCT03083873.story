(thirdQuint)Study of LN-145 Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes in the Treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head & Neck.

 LN-145 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

 The cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving a NMA lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen, followed by infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.
