(firstQuint)Fingers Hook Technique to Facilitate Nasotracheal Intubation.

 It is necessary to adequately exposure of glottis during naso-tracheal intubation using video-stylet.

 However, inadequate upward epiglottis or over-elevation of arytenoids all inhibit the tube tip smoothly into trachea.

 Therefore, the study is to investigate either jaw thrust or fingers-hook technique is advantages of nasotracheal intubation.
