(fifthQuint)Nordic Walking Training for Older People.

 Introduction: Considering the increase in the elderly population and their life expectancy, together with the expansion of Nordic walking (NW) interventions as a training method for the elderly, there is a need of preventive studies of RCTs and with methodological good quality approach to enable physical education, health and rehabilitation professionals to make decisions regarding the type, the volume and the intensity of NW exercise in promoting the health of the sedentary elderly.

 Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate, through a randomized clinical trial, the effects of eight weeks of NW and FW training on quality of life (QoL), static balance, dynamic variability, self-selected treadmill walking speed (SSWSTreadmill), Locomotor rehabilitation (LRI) Parameters of Pendular Mechanism (external, internal and total mechanical work -Wext, Wint, Wtot, Recovery -R,Cost of Transport - C), Electromyographic parameters (Average signal and co-contraction of the AD, TB, VL, BF, AT and MG muscles), heart rate of exercise - HRexercise and the rate of perceived exertion (RPE), in sedentary elderly.

 of sedentary elderly.

 Experimental Design: Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial (RCT).

 Study Site: School of Physical Education, Physiotherapy and Dance (ESEFID), Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

 Methods: The sample comprised 33 sedentary participants randomly divided into two groups (Nordic walking group and Free walking group who will perform training for 8 weeks.

Objective: to assess by means of a randomized clinical trial the effects of eight weeks of Nordic walking and free walking training on quality of life (QoL), static balance, dynamic variability, self-selected walking speed (SWS) and locomotor rehabilitation index (LRI), parameters of pendular mechanism [external (Wext), internal (Wint) and total mechanical work (Wtot), Recovery (R), Cost of Transport (C)], Electromyographic parameters (Average signal and co-contraction of the Anterior deltoid (AD), triceps brachii (TB), vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF), anterior tibial (AT) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles, heart rate of exercise (HRexercise) - and the rate of perceived exertion (RPE), in sedentary elderly.
