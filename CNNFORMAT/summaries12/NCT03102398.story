(secondQuint)A Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability Profile of TR399 in Healthy Volunteers and Erectile Dysfunction Patients.

 Several oral medications containing PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil (Viagra(R), Pfizer), vardenafil (Levitra(R), Bayer) and tadalafil (Cialis(R), Lilly), have been marketed for the treatment of ED.

 Many considerations should be taken before patients are prescribed with PDE5 inhibitor medications, which may cause systemic side effects and should not be taken with nitrates or alpha-blockers.

 The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of TR399 is 5% Vardenafil HCl3H2O.

 Non-clinical studies have shown that the topical use of TR399 can enhance erection and sexual behavior in animal models without causing irritancy and phototoxicity.

 This study is designed as a single-arm and open-label fashion in order to explore the safety and PK of TR399 in healthy volunteers, as well as the safety, PK and efficacy of TR399 in patients with ED.
