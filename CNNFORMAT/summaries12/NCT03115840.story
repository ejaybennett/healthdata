(fifthQuint)Measuring Outcomes of Activity in Intensive Care.

 The MOSAIC observational study will measure activity in critically ill patients for up to 28 days in the hospital using two different, objective measures, a clinical mobility scale and accelerometry.

 We will evaluate the independent association between activity and outcomes 3 and 12 months after ICU discharge.

 Specifically, Aim 1 will determine the relationship between activity and disability in ADLs and mobility.

 Aim 2a will determine the relationship between activity and physical and cognitive function.

 Aim 2b will evaluate physical and cognitive function as mediators of long-term disability.

 Aim 3a will determine the relationship between activity and biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation.

 Aim 3b will determine the relationship between these biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation and disability, physical and cognitive function.

 Measuring Outcomes of Activity in Intensive Care@highlight

Millions of older adults are hospitalized for a critical illness each year and although they are more likely than ever to survive this illness, they commonly face significant morbidity in the form of disabilities in basic self-care activities and in mobility in the months and years afterwards.

 A better understanding of the underlying risk factors for disability following critical illness is greatly needed, including the effect that activity during hospitalization may have on these outcomes.

 Therefore, we designed the Measuring OutcomeS of Activity in Intensive Care (MOSAIC) observational study to evaluate the relationship between activity (measured more rigorously than in prior investigations) and disability, physical function, and cognitive function in survivors of critical illness 3 and 12 months after ICU discharge.
