(fifthQuint)Total Therapy XVII for Newly Diagnosed Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Lymphoma.

 Participants will be classified into one of three categories (low-, standard-, or high-risk) based on the presenting age, leukocyte count/lymphoma staging, presence or absence of CNS-3 status or testicular disease, immunophenotype, molecular genetics, DNA index, and early response to therapy.

 Treatment will consist of three main phases: Remission Induction, Consolidation, and Continuation.

 Early Intensification therapy will be given prior to Consolidation to patients with provisional standard-risk or high-risk ALL/LLy or any provisional low-risk patients with Day 15 MRD 1% as well as provisional low-risk LLy patients who do not obtain complete response at the end of Induction.

 Brief outline of treatment plan: Patients will be assigned to treatment based on risk group: Low-Risk, Standard-Risk and High-Risk and cell type (T or B cell).

 Remission Induction initially consists of prednisone (28 days), vincristine (4 weekly doses), daunorubicin (1 to 3 weekly doses), and pegaspargase (2 doses).

 The second part (given over 2 weeks and overlapping with the last week of the first part of induction) consists of cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and mercaptopurine combinations.

 Patients with B-ALL will be randomized for administration of a dose of rituximab on Day 3 prior to the first dose of pegaspargase to prevent sensitization to asparaginase and subsequent asparaginase reaction and to improve anti-leukemia outcome.

 Dasatinib will be added for patients with Ph+ and Ph-like ABL1-class fusions and bortezomib will be given to patients with no targetable lesions and Day 15 minimal residual disease (MRD) >5%.

 Early Intensification will be given prior to Consolidation to patients with provisional standard-risk or high-risk ALL/LLy or any provisional low-risk patients with Day 15 MRD 1% as well as provisional low-risk LLy patients who do not obtain complete response at the end of Induction.

 For patients with Ph-like ALL that is targetable with JAK inhibitor and Day 15 MRD level 5% or end of Remission Induction 1% as well as all patients with early T cell precursor (ETP) ALL, ruxolitinib will be used.

 This includes, but is not limited to CRLF2, JAK2, and EPOR rearrangements and sequence/structural changes in JAK1/2/3, TYK2, IL7R, and SH2B3.

 Ruxolitinib will be added in LLy patients with activation of JAK-STAT signaling whose responses do not qualify complete response at the end of Remission Induction.

 Activation of JAK-STAT signaling is defined in ALL/LLy that contains genetic alterations associated with JAK-STAT pathway.

 Dasatinib will continue for patients with ABL1-class fusions.

 Bortezomib will be added for patients with no targetable lesions and Day 15 MRD >5% or Day 42 MRD >1% and LLy patients without targetable lesions whose responses do not qualify complete response at the end of Remission Induction.

 Consolidation Therapy will consist of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) (every other week for 4 doses); daily mercaptopurine and IT chemotherapy on the same dates of HDMTX.

 Standard and high-risk patients will also receive pegaspargase.

 Dasatinib will continue for patients with ABL1-class fusions.

 Ruxolitinib will continue for patients with activation of JAK-STAT signaling and Day 15 MRD 5% or Day 42 MRD 1% (or for LLy patients who do not qualify complete response at the end of Remission Induction) and all cases with ETP ALL.

 Immunotherapy with blinatumomab will be given to High Risk B-ALL and B-LLy patients.

 Reintensification therapy will be offered to certain High Risk patients with persistent MRD after Immunotherapy (B-ALL and B-LLy) or Early Intensification (T-ALL and T-LLy), or those who cannot receive Immunotherapy.

 Continuation Treatment will consist of 120 weeks of risk-directed therapy.

 Dasatinib will continue in patients with ABL1-class fusion.

 Ruxolitinib will continue in patients with activation of JAK-STAT signaling and Day 15 MRD 5% or Day 42 MRD 1% (or for LLy patients who do not qualify complete response at the end of Remission Induction) and all cases with ETP ALL.

 ALL Patients with the CEP72 rs904627T/T genotype (16% of patients) will be randomized (unblinded design except those who evaluate neuropathies) to receive either 1.

5 mg/m^2 or 1 mg/m^2 of vincristine after Continuation Week 1.

 Patients with either a CEP72 rs904627 C/T or C/C genotype (84% of patients) will be randomized to receive vincristine and dexamethasone pulses through Week 49 of Continuation Treatment or through Week 101 of Continuation Treatment.

 Total Therapy XVII for Newly Diagnosed Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Lymphoma@highlight

The overarching objective of this study is to use novel precision medicine strategies based on inherited and leukemia-specific genomic features and targeted treatment approaches to improve the cure rate and quality of life of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (LLy).

 Primary Therapeutic Objectives: - To improve the event-free survival of provisional standard- or high-risk patients with genetically or immunologically targetable lesions or minimal residual disease (MRD) 5% at Day 15 or 1% at the end of Remission Induction, by the addition of molecular and immunotherapeutic approaches including tyrosine kinase inhibitors or blinatumomab for refractory B-ALL, and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib for those lacking targetable lesions.

 - To improve overall treatment outcome of T-ALL by optimizing pegaspargase and cyclophosphamide treatment and by the addition of new agents in patients with targetable genomic abnormalities (e.

g.

, activated tyrosine kinases or JAK/STAT mutations) or by the addition of bortezomib for those who have a poor early response to treatment but no targetable lesions.

 - To examine in a randomized study design whether the administration of one dose of rituximab to children with B-ALL during early Remission Induction therapy decreases allergic reactions to pegaspargase.

 - To determine in a randomized study design whether the incidence and/or severity of acute vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy can be reduced by decreasing the dosage of vincristine in patients with the high-risk CEP72 TT genotype or by shortening the duration of vincristine therapy in patients with the CEP72 CC or CT genotype.

 Secondary Therapeutic Objectives: - To estimate the event-free survival and overall survival of children with ALL and LLy.

 - To examine whether the administration of one dose of rituximab can lower the minimal residual disease (MRD) levels.

 - To determine the tolerability of combination therapy with ruxolitinib.

 Biological Objectives: - To use data from clinical genomic sequencing and sequencing-based MRD in bone marrow, blood and cerebrospinal fluid.

 - To assess clonal diversity and evolution of pre-leukemic and leukemic populations.

 - To identify germline or somatic genomic variants associated with drug resistance of ALL cells.

 - To compare drug sensitivity of ALL cells from diagnosis to relapse.

 Supportive Care Objectives - To conduct serial neurocognitive monitoring of patients and to evaluate the benefits of a computer-based cognitive intervention.

 - To evaluate the impact of low-magnitude high frequency mechanical stimulation on bone mineral density and markers of bone turnover.

 Exploratory Objectives: - To identify pharmacogenetic, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic predictors of treatment outcome.

 - To perform a detailed assessment of thiopurine metabolism and 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) tolerance, toxicity, and treatment outcome.

 - To establish xenografts of representative subtypes of ALL.

 - To prospectively determine the risk and epidemiology of breakthrough infection or febrile neutropenia and adverse effects of antibiotics.
