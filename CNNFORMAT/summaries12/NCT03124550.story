(fifthQuint)Development of An Exergame for Caregivers of Family Members With Alzheimer's Disease.

 The number of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) caregivers providing informal care for family members is rising dramatically, and supportive programs are vitally needed.

 Caregivers of AD patients have relatively high levels of stress and depression and limited physical activity and social engagement.

 Technology-driven programs can offer engaging, sustainable, and scalable opportunities to give caregivers critically-needed supports for health and well- being.

 This pilot study uses cognitive behavioral methods to develop an innovative social exergame to increase physical and social activity among AD caregivers.

 Leveraging wearable activity monitors, physical activity data collected throughout the day and in varied settings will serve as input to the game experience.

 Caregivers will assess the suitability of alternative prototypes with an array of features including (1) instructional exercise modules, (2) feedback from activity data, (3) digital rewards for physical activity that can be used to create virtual gardens and artwork galleries, and (4) opportunities to connect virtually with other caregivers to share and comment on their creative products.

 Aim one is to develop and build the exergame, with the AD caregivers providing extensive input into the features.

 Twenty AD caregivers will participate in the design and development phase.

 The second aim is to evaluate enjoyment of the exergame and its feasibility to increase moderate and vigorous physical activity, virtual social contact, and exercise self-efficacy.

 A new group of 20 caregivers will test the program on a computer, tablet, or smart phone for four weeks.

 The findings will be used to develop larger-scale intervention studies to test the efficacy of the exergame in the future.

 Tailoring an exergame for caregivers of AD has the potential to increase physical activity and to improve overall health and well-being in this vulnerable population, which in turn can benefit the Alzheimer's patients for whom they provide care.

 Development of An Exergame for Caregivers of Family Members With Alzheimer's Disease@highlight

The study goal is to design and build an exergame to increase physical activity and social connections for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) caregivers using participatory design methods.

 AD caregivers will contribute extensively to the design and development of the content and motivational components of the exergame.

 The investigators will evaluate user experience with the exergame and the feasibility of using it to increase physical activity, exercise self-efficacy, and social connections among AD caregivers.
