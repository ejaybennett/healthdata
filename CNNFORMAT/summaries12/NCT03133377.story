(fifthQuint)Treatment of Invasively Ventilated Adults With Early Activity and Mobilisation.

 The TEAM Trial is a definitive phase III multi-centre randomised controlled trial in mechanically ventilated patients.

 Supported by compelling preliminary data, the trial will determine whether early activity and mobilisation during mechanical ventilation improves days alive and at home at 6 months compared to standard care.

 Recruiting 750 patients, this will be the largest trial ever conducted of early mobilisation.

 Patients allocated to the early activity and mobilisation protocol (intervention group) will be assessed by a physiotherapist daily during the ICU stay to determine the highest level of mobility.

 This will determine the dosage and type of exercise that will be delivered, led by the physiotherapist with assistance from the multidisciplinary team.

 For both groups, concomitant care will be guided by the treating clinician.

 In addition, all post-ICU patient management will be at the discretion of the patient's ward-based treating physicians.

 Patients will be randomized via web-based system and de-identified data will be collected on the following: baseline demographics; comorbidities; sedatives, analgesics, corticosteroids and neuromuscular blockers; pain/sedation/delirium scores; tracheostomy, intubation and renal replacement therapy.

 The intervention will be administered during the ICU stay and the 180 day follow up will conducted centrally from the ANZIC-RC.

 Treatment of Invasively Ventilated Adults With Early Activity and Mobilisation@highlight

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of early activity and mobilisation during prolonged IMV on the composite outcome "days alive and out of hospital to day 180".

 The effect of the intervention on mortality, physical, cognitive and Psychological function at 180 days, as well as cost-effectiveness of the intervention, will also be evaluated.

 The study will also explore process of care measures and baseline physiology and ICU mobility outcomes.

 The hypothesis is that, in ICU patients expected to require prolonged IMV, early activity and mobilisation increases the number of days alive and at home to day 180 when compared with standard care.
