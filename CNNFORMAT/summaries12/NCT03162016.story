(secondQuint)Treatment Off Gingival Recession Defects Using a Xenogenic Acellular Dermal Matrix Compared to Connective Tissue Graft.

.

 Connective tissue graft harvested from the palate does not always have sufficient size to cover multiple recession defects.

 Moreover, connective tissue graft shows significant postoperative morbidity to treat generalized multiple gingival recessions.

 The goal of this study is to show if Mucoderm could be considered has a substitute of connective tissue graft in the coverage of gingival recession defects.

 Treatment Off Gingival Recession Defects Using a Xenogenic Acellular Dermal Matrix Compared to Connective Tissue Graft.

@highlight

Limitation of donor site and significant postoperative morbidity are often described in connective tissue graft harvesting.

 We want to show if mucoderm used in tunnel technique to recover miller class I and II recessions defects could be an alternative to connective tissue graft.
