(thirdQuint)Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Calm Moments Cards Program Implemented by School Personnel.

 In order to explore the effectiveness of the Calm Moments Cards program on school personnel's ability to recognize signs of stress and the implementation of embedded strategies to reduce stress and enhance emotional well-being, we conduct a mixed-methods research study using pretest-posttest surveys (assessing knowledge, beliefs, and actions) and qualitative analysis of written reflections about the meaning and use of the Calm Moments Cards.

 The focus of the intervention is on prevention of stress and anxiety based on situational stressors (e.

g.

 taking a test, completing an assignment) so that students can focus on and succeed in doing their schoolwork.

 Occupational therapy practitioners oriented school personnel to the signs of stress and the use of the 17 Calm Moments Cards using a 1 hour inservice.

 This was followed by informal coaching to foster implementation.

 A one-group (N 93) mixed-methods design using a pretest-posttest survey and qualitative analysis of their written reactions was used to explore the meaning and outcomes of the Calm Moments Cards program.
