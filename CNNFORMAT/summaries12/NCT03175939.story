(secondQuint)Elimination of Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Selected Stage II and III Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.

 The standard treatment for stage II-III nasopharyngeal carcinoma is radiotherapy with concomitant chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy.

 A subset of these patients has very low risk for distant metastasis that adjuvant chemotherapy is probably unnecessary.

 The investigators would like to know if same therapeutic effect and survival rate can be achieved without adjuvant chemotherapy, (i.

e.

 less chemotherapy, same effect).

 Elimination of Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Selected Stage II and III Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma@highlight

This study evaluates whether some patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma but with low risk of distant metastasis can be treated with only radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy but without additional adjuvant chemotherapy.
