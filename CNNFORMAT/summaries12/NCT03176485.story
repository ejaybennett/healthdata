(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Pathway Modulation by Raf, MEK, & Kinase Inhibitors.

 The study will evaluate the modulatory effect of systemic Raf inhibition in the MEK/ERK and PI3 /Akt/mTOR pathways in patients undergoing targeted therapy for metastatic disease.

 Changes in relevant proteins will be evaluated using a combined protein expression methodology that in includes immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse phase protein microarray (RPPA) technology.

 The primary endpoint of this study will be assessed in normal skin and skin acutely exposed to solar simulated light.

 Evaluation of Pathway Modulation by Raf, MEK, & Kinase Inhibitors@highlight

This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the cutaneous effect of systemic inhibition of the tyrosine kinase pathway in the presence or absence of solar simulated light exposure.

 A maximum of 45 subjects will be accrued into the overall study we anticipate approximately 25 patients in the Raf inhibitor group and 10 patients each into the Tyrosine Kinase and MEK inhibitor arms of the study.
