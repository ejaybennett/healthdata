(secondQuint)Clinical Validation of the M5L Lung CAD.

 The main aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic performance of CAD assisted interpretation with that of unassisted reading in the detection of lung metastases in consecutive patients staged for extrathoracic malignancies.

 This study also aims at validating a new Web/Cloud based workflow for the use of CAD systems in clinical practice, not requiring installation of additional software or hardware and potentially representing a cost-effective CAD solution for clinical facilities.
