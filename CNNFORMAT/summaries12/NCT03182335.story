(secondQuint)Vasopressor SAT Study.

 This observational study will compare mean arterial pressure and vasoactive drug dose recorded at two time points: 1.

 prior to awakening from sedation 2.

 during the awakening from sedation trial The vasoactive infusion will be titrated to a mean arterial pressure as determined by the medical team prior to study enrollment.

 Each enrolled patient will have measurements taken only on the first day of enrollment.

 Enrolled subjects will also have a delirium assessment using the CAM-ICU tool before the awakening from sedation trial and during the awakening from sedation trial.

 Vasopressor SAT Study@highlight

To assess the impact of daily awakening from sedation on the amount of vasoactive medication required in the ICU.

 The hypothesis of this proposal is that the amount of vasoactive drug required to maintain an adequate mean arterial blood pressure will be reduced during a daily awakening from sedation.
