(firstQuint)Dose-escalation Study to Investigate the Safety, PK, and PD of ISU304/CB2679d in Hemophilia B Patients.

 This study is a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ISU304/CB2679d in previously treated hemophilia B patients.

 This study is comprised of 5 cohorts.

 Each cohort will receive an identical intravenous administration of 75 IU/kg, with subcutaneous administrations doubling from 75 IU/kg until 150 IU/kg.

 During the study period, a subject may be hospitalized to facilitate the collection of blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis.

 The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be operated after the end of Cohorts 1 to 4.

 These committees will monitor the PK/PD and safety data from each cohort to determine the continuation of next cohort (Cohorts 2 to 5), target dose, and blood sampling period for PK/PD (including timing of collection).

 Additional subjects may be enrolled in all cohorts or cohorts may be canceled depending on the results of PK/PD analysis.
