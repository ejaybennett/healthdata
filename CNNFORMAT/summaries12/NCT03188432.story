(fifthQuint)Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy or Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in Comparing Quality of Life in Patients With Stage IIIC-IV Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To compare quality of life in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) versus NAC followed by CRS and postoperative intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy at 6 weeks post-treatment.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To compare quality of life in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC followed by CRS with HIPEC versus NAC followed by CRS and postoperative IP chemotherapy at 3 and 6 months post-treatment.

 II.

 To compare neurotoxicity in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC followed by CRS with HIPEC versus NAC followed by CRS and postoperative IP chemotherapy III.

 To compare abdominal discomfort in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC followed by CRS with HIPEC versus NAC followed by CRS and postoperative IP chemotherapy IV.

 To compare toxicities in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC followed by CRS with HIPEC versus NAC followed by CRS and postoperative IP chemotherapy.

 V.

 To compare the response rate in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC followed by CRS with HIPEC versus NAC followed by CRS and postoperative IP chemotherapy.

 VI.

 To compare progression free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC followed by CRS with HIPEC versus NAC followed by CRS and postoperative IP chemotherapy.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Beginning 4-8 weeks after 3 courses of chemotherapy, patients undergo CRS.

 Beginning 4-8 weeks after CRS, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin intraperitoneally (IP) over 30-60 minutes on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Beginning 4-8 weeks after 6 courses of chemotherapy, patients undergo CRS.

 Patients then receive carboplatin IP over 120 minutes immediately following CRS.

 After completion of chemotherapy, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months.

 Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy or Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in Comparing Quality of Life in Patients With Stage IIIC-IV Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer@highlight

This randomized phase II trial studies hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy or intraperitoneal chemotherapy in improving quality of life in patients with stage IIIC-IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

 In hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, the chemotherapy is warmed before being used and may help the drugs get into the cancer cells better, minimize the toxicity of the drugs on normal cells, and help to kill any cancer cells left over after surgery.

 Intraperitoneal chemotherapy is delivered directly to the abdominal cavity to help treat cancer.

 It is not yet known whether hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy or intraperitoneal chemotherapy works better in improving quality of life in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.
