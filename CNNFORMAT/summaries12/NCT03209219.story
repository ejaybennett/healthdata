(thirdQuint)Interferon 2a Versus Cyclosporine for Refractory Behet`s Disease Uveitis.

 Detailed description: Both CsA and IFN2a have been shown to be effective for long-term control of BDU, however, randomized prospective comparative studies are scarce, particularly in East Asian populations.

 Our preliminary data gave us the impression that IFN2a might be more effectiveness than CsA in long-term control of refractory BDU, and this study aimed to compare their effectiveness and safety profiles in a well-designed prospective study.

 Refractory BDU is defined as relapse of posterior or pan- uveitis with at least 10mg daily prednisone (or equivalent) and one traditional immunomodulatory treatment (IMT) agents.

 The acute attack is controlled with large dose oral corticosteroid (60mg daily prednisone) for 4 weeks, and then the patients are randomly assigned to the IFN arm and the CsA arm, in which patients are treated with IFN2a (3*10^6 IU qd for 4 weeks and qod thereafter) and CsA (100mg bid), respectively, along with a fixed tapering regimen of corticosteroid.

 Patients were followed up until relapse, or for 12 months.

 Interferon 2a Versus Cyclosporine for Refractory Behet`s Disease Uveitis@highlight

Brief summary: This study compares the long-term efficacy and safety of interferon (IFN) 2a and cyclosporine (cyclosporin A, CsA) following suppression of acute attack by high-dose oral glucocorticosteroid in patients with refractory Behcet`s uveitis (BDU).

 Half of the participants will receive IFN2a while the other half will receive CsA.
