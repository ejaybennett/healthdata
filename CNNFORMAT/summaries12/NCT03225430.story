(fifthQuint)Evaluation of a Cognitive Psychophysiological Treatment for Tourette Syndrome and Tic Disorders.

 Tics are defined as repetitive non-voluntary contractions of functionally related groups of skeletal muscles in one or more parts of the body.

 Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (TS) forms a separate diagnostic category with multiple tics including vocal (phonic) tics occurring several times per day, for at least 1 year with onset before age 18.

 Persistent (chronic) tic disorder (TD) may involve a single motor or vocal tic.

 Tics peak around age 11 but can persist into adulthood with a prevalence of 1% and if untreated cause significant impairment.

 The current treatment guidelines for managing the tics recommend a Behavioural treatment, "habit reversal", which focuses on reversing the tic habit, now developed as a Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics (CBIT).

 CBIT involves multiple stages including awareness, relaxation, contingency training, positive reinforcement for not do the tic and the practice of a competing response antagonistic to the tic.

 A recent large scale multisite study compared CBIT with supportive therapy and found a significantly greater decrease in adults and children tics treated with CBIT.

 However, in both adult and child studies, 48-62% of samples were classified as non-responders.

 Effect sizes were medium (Cohen's d= 0.

55 - 0.

68) compared to supportive therapy with mean tic decrease of 25-30% and samples remained symptomatic at follow-up.

 Research over the last 10 years (funded by the CIHR) have led to elaboration of a cognitive behavioural psychophysiological model of treatment (CoPs) of tic disorders.

 The CoPs is multi-modal and targets cognitive, behavioural and physiological processes characteristic of tic disorders rather than focusing on reversing the actual tic at onset.

 In the last funding period 2009-2013 the investigators have successfully applied the program to all subtypes and severity of adults with TS/TD both with and without comorbidity and compared outcome with a natural waitlist control.

 Results showed a clinically significant reduction of tic frequency following CoPs (Cohen's d- 1.

43-2.

34), maintained at 6-month follow-up.

 Validity of the CoPs model was supported by a change in behavioural and psychosocial as well as tic symptom measures post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up, and a post-treatment normalization of participants' performance on neuropsychological and electrophysiological measures.

It is a randomized controlled trial to compare two behavioural treatments, namely CBIT and CoPs.

 This study would be the first head-to-head randomized trial between two established treatments rather than supportive counseling or wait-list control.

 Thirty-six adults and 36 children with TS/TD will be recruited into each of the two (CBIT, CoPs) modalities requiring a total recruitment of 72 adults and 72 children over 5 years, which permits, even for a small-medium effect size, a robust power calculation.

 Motor performance measures will give concurrent validity to changes pre-post in TS/TD motor processes.

 Recruitment of both males and females will permit sex comparisons.

 The participants meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed at pre-post 1 month and 6 months following treatment on standardized tic scales and global assessment of functioning.

 Participants will be treated individually on a weekly basis by therapists with an allegiance to each modality and outcome assessed by masked evaluation.

 The treatments are manualized and will last 10 weeks with 4 weeks of home practice at post-treatment with 6-month follow-up assessment on all outcome measures, plus motor performance measures post-treatment.

 All treatment sessions will be audio-recorded and assessed with implementation of treatment integrity procedures scales.

 The hypotheses are that: (1) the CoPs group will show superiority in clinically significant improvement on standard tic scale score, global functioning and quality of life than the CBIT group; and (2) changes in recognized parameters on selected motor tests scored according to published norms will change towards normalization post CoPs but not post CBIT.

 The outcome data from the two treatments will be analyzed by a mixed linear model adaptation of repeated measures MANOVA and daily diary measures will allow for an additive time series design over the 10 weeks treatment session.

 This design will allow computation of the size of treatment effects at different stages of therapy.

 The study results will impact on the treatment of choice and access to treatment for tic disorders and on the conceptualization of tic disorders.
