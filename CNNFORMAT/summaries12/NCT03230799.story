(thirdQuint)Comparison of Minimal Invasive Lens Surgery and Traditional Cataract Surgery.

 A Prospective, non-randomized controlled study of eyes with dense nucleus were enrolled.

 Patients were assigned to two groups: Group I: the participants had a minimal invasive lens surgery, while in Group II, the participants had a traditional cataract surgery.

 Investigators give two groups a secondary intraocular lens implantation.

 Investigators compare the visual acuity, incidence of high intraocular pressure, incidence of visual axis opacification, uveitis and iris/pupil abnormality between two groups, aiming at comparison of minimal invasive lens surgery and traditional cataract surgery for treating congenital cataracts.

In this study, the investigators give participants who had a lens implantation before a secondary intraocular lens implantation in the purpose of reduce complications of surgeries for dense cataract , and report a prospective, non-randomized controlled study aiming at comparison of minimal invasive lens surgery and traditional cataract surgery for treating congenital cataracts
