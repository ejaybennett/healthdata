(fifthQuint)Use of a Visual Pedagogy and Structure With Children With Autism for Routine Physical Exams.

 Objective: This pilot study aimed to evaluate the effects of a picture-schedule reinforcement system on reducing problem behaviors in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) during a physical exam.

 Design, setting, patients, intervention: Fifteen study participants, aged 5-10 years, with autism and identified by caregivers as typically uncooperative with physical exams were randomized to one of two physical exam groups (treatment and control) based on their adaptive communication score.

 The treatment group exam included use of a picture schedule-reinforcement book and the control group exam did not introduce the book.

 Caregivers rated participants' irritability/stereotypy behaviors before and during study exams.

 Exam teams blinded to study aims, recorded participants' total exam items completed and caregivers rated participants' level of cooperation.

Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have unique social-communication and behavior impairments that complicate their medical management.

 This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using a picture schedule paired with a reinforcement system during the medical exam.

 Two groups (treatment and control) of children (ages 5 - 10 yrs) diagnosed with ASD and below average adaptive communication impairment were asked to participate.

 Following participation in an overview of autism diagnostic symptoms training, two teams (comprised of one chief medical resident and one nurse), blind to the study aim, conducted the study exams.
