The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of chia seed consumption on body composition, blood pressure, blood glucose, satiety, mood, joint pain, and dietary displacement in overweight and obese females (18-45years).

 It is hypothesized that consuming chia seeds will bring about a positive change in body composition (lower % body fat), satiety, mood, joint pain, and blood pressure, lower blood glucose levels, increased fiber and improved nutrient intake, in overweight/ obese females.
