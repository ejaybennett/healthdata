(thirdQuint)Improving Post-Prandial Blood Glucose Control With Afrezza During Closed-Loop Therapy.

 There are 2 primary study aims that this research will address.

 The first study aim will be to determine whether use of Afrezza inhaled insulin with ultra-fast kinetics will improve the performance of a closed-loop (CL) system, both with respect to immediate post-prandial hyperglycemia and the subsequent late post-prandial hypoglycemia as compared to hybrid CL (HCL) with subcutaneous (SC) rapid-acting insulin (RAI) pre-meal bolus.

 The second study aim will be to examine the efficiency and feasibility of Afrezza inhaled insulin as a pre-meal bolus and a missed meal correction bolus on mitigating post-prandial blood glucose control during outpatient CL therapy.

 This study will test the hypothesis that Afrezza inhaled insulin given before a meal to mimic physiologic first phase insulin release will limit the magnitude and rate of rise of glucose levels following a meal and will achieve greater percent time spent within target blood glucose range as compared to conventional hybrid CL therapy without inhaled insulin both in the in-clinic research and outpatient real-life setting.

The study will be conducted in two phases; an in-patient meal study phase (Phase I) and an outpatient home study (Phase II).

 The two phase study design is chosen to enhance safety by testing the Afrezza Closed-Loop (CL) system in controlled in-clinic setting under study staff supervision before it could be investigated at the outpatient home setting.

 Phase II will not begin without the establishment of safety in Phase I.
