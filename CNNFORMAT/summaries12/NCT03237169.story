(secondQuint)Performance of a New REsting Pressure Index During Invasive Angiography Compared To Adenosine Hyperemic FFR.

 Coronary lesions with a potential indication for percutaneous coronary intervention or warranting invasive physiological interrogation (in the opinion of the investigator) will undergo PressureWire cent assessment under 2 conditions: rest and adenosine hyperemia.

 The measurements at rest (standard Pd/Pa and Pd/Pamin) will be repeated to assess test/retest repeatability.

 Subsequent treatment decisions will be made by the operator according to the standard practice based on the adenosine FFR value together with all other clinical information.

 Performance of a New REsting Pressure Index During Invasive Angiography Compared To Adenosine Hyperemic FFR@highlight

To test the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of a new automated pressure derived resting index (Pd/Pamin), using FFR as gold standard, in de novo coronary lesions in which invasive physiological evaluation is warranted.
