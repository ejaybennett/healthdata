(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Effect of BioK+ 50B on Glycemic Control in a Type 2 Diabetes Population.

 This is a phase 2 double-blind, randomized, single-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 12-week study of Bio-K+ probiotic 50B(R) in subjects diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and suboptimal glycemic control.

 After providing informed consent and completion of screening baseline assessments, approximately 130 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Bio-K+50B(R) probiotic or matching placebo.

 Subjects will take investigational product or placebo once daily orally for 12 weeks.

 During the double-blind treatment period, subjects will complete a daily diary and will be contacted via telephone (at Week 4 and Week 8) for an assessment of adverse events, concomitant medications, diabetes management habits, collection of stool sample at home, diary revision and study product compliance.

 At visit 3 (Week 12; end of study visit) subjects will return to the study site for laboratory tests and clinical assessment.
