(thirdQuint)Intraocular Lens Implantation Surgery vs Traditional Cataract Surgery.

 A Prospective,randomized controlled study of eyes with dense nucleus were enrolled.

 Patients were assigned to two groups: Group I: the participants had a intraocular lens implantation, while in Group II, the participants had a traditional cataract surgery.

 Investigators give two groups a secondary intraocular lens implantation.

 Investigators compare the visual acuity, incidence of high intraocular pressure, incidence of visual axis opacification, uveitis and iris/pupil abnormality between two groups after the first and the second surgery, aiming at comparison of minimal invasive lens surgery and traditional cataract surgery for treating congenital cataracts.
