(fifthQuint)CT-controlled Advanced Navigation Techniques for Transbronchial Pulmonary Lesion Access; Evaluation of Augmented Fluoroscopy Bronchoscopic Navigation Based Diagnostic Yield.

 Lung cancer is one of the leading most frequent types of cancer and is the most lethal malignancy in the Netherlands.

 Mortality is high due to its advanced stage disease at diagnosis.

 To improve survival current guidelines are moving towards CT-screening of the high risk population.

 These CT-scans detect numerous nodules and rapidly increase the demand for minimal invasive accurate and safe diagnostic procedures.

 The historically available and current first diagnostic procedure in the work-up of PPLs is fluoroscopy guided Trans Bronchial Biopsy (TBB) despite its low pooled yield of 31.

1%.

 When the above transbronchial technique does not provide an unambiguous outcome, an additional and more invasive diagnostic work-up remains indicated.

 To exclude the possibility of missing malignancies, trans thoracic needle aspiration is first indicated.

 If deemed inaccessible, surgical biopsy may be alternatively indicated depending on patient risk of malignancy.

 Ideally, a transbronchial approach having high diagnostic accuracy would overcome the need of this sequential increasingly invasive diagnostic and consecutive treatment approach.

 Newer pilot studies now hypothesize that combining multiple new endobronchial modalities might provide a solution in preventing more invasive additional diagnostic staging, reporting diagnostic yields exceeding 70%.

 When an accurate and certain transbronchial diagnosis by combining multiple techniques can indeed be provided.

 We will study a combination of new advanced modalities for diagnosis of peripheral nodules endobronchially.

 The aim of this study is to determine diagnostic yield, cost-effectiveness, safety, and, to collect data for developing diagnostic algorithms to further cost-effectively increase yield, reduce complication rate and determine a future platform for clinical implementation.

 CT-controlled Advanced Navigation Techniques for Transbronchial Pulmonary Lesion Access; Evaluation of Augmented Fluoroscopy Bronchoscopic Navigation Based Diagnostic Yield@highlight

In this exploratory adaptive clinical trial the investigators will examine the diagnostic yield of a combination of commercially available imaging and navigation techniques for reaching peripheral lung lesions.

 The two investigated techniques will herein be the rEBUS imaging modality combined with augmented fluoroscopy based virtual bronchoscopy navigation.

 Confirmation of reaching the lung lesion will be by means of CT (fluoroscopic) imaging.

 Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) of cytopathology will be used for obtaing a per-procedural outcome on tissue biopsy representativeness.

 The study will replace the current conventional standard TBB procedure (fluoroscopy and rEBUS guided bronchoscopy) in the endoscopy suite.

 Consecutive patients will be included on the MITeC hybrid operating room (needed to monitor patient safety and CT availability).

 All data will be prospectively collected.

 In case tissue biopsy is found to be malignant or benign, it will be termed representative.

 In case tissue biopsy is found to be non-representative (=blood, anatomical lung tissue, unreachable), conventional follow-up of CT guided TTNA, follow-up monitoring and/or surgical biopsy will serve as golden standard for obtaining tissue diagnosis.

 For verification of reaching the target lesion, another study parameter of interest, (cb)CT imaging will be performed for verification that instruments are within the nodule (per-procedurally available).
