(secondQuint)Optimal Strategy of Primary PCI for Left Main Coronary Artery Occlusion Induced AMI.

 Primary percutaneous coronary intervention for patients presented with acute myocardial infarction caused by left main coronary artery occlusion is associated with significantly higher mortality and risks of major cardiac adverse events.

 Deferred stent implantation may improve prognosis of primary PCI through reducing distal embolization and no-reflow phenomenon.

 There is no randomized clinical trial focuses on the effect and outcome of deferred stent implantation on primary PCI for left main coronary artery occlusion in contrast with conventional strategy.

 This prospective, multicenter, randomized trial is aimed to compare immediate stenting with deferred stenting for LM-AMI with 30 centers in China involved.

 We hope to determine whether deferred stenting is superior to conventional strategy for primary PCI of AMI caused by left main coronary artery occlusion in improving long-term clinical outcomes and cardiac function.

This study will compare clinical outcomes of immediate stent implantation with deferred stent implantation(4-10days after primary angiography) for patients presented with acute myocardial infarction due to left main coronary artery occlusion.
