(firstQuint)Cobimetinib and HM95573 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors.

 This is a Phase Ib, open label, multicenter dose escalation study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral dosing of cobimetinib and HM95573 administered in combination in patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed, locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors with RAS- or RAF-mutation for which standard therapies either do not exist or have proven ineffective or intolerable.

 Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any other discontinuation criterion is met.

 There are two stages of this study: Stage 1, a standard 3+3 dose escalation, and Stage 2, an indication specific dose expansion.

 Stage 1 is designed to establish the combination MTD for cobimetinib and HM95573.

 To acquire additional safety and PD data to more fully inform dose selection, up to six additional patients may be enrolled to backfill cohorts at dose levels that have been shown to not exceed the MTD.

In Stage 2, the potential RP2D will be investigated in five indication specific expansion cohorts.
