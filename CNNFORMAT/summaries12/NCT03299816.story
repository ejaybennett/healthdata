(thirdQuint)Five, Plus Nuts and Beans for Kidneys.

 This study will test the effectiveness of dietary advice delivered by a study coach and assistance with weekly online ordering of $30/week worth of potassium rich foods delivered by a local grocer to a community location for reducing urinary albumin excretion among African Americans with hypertension and chronic kidney disease.

 Participants will be recruited from primary care clinics in Baltimore, MD.

 150 African American adults diagnosed with hypertension and with mild/moderate chronic kidney disease based on the presence of albuminuria will be randomly assigned to one of two arms for 12 months.

 There are 2 phases of the study.

 In Phase 1 (months 1-4), one study arm will consist of minimal guidance from the study team and a weekly allowance of $30 dollars to purchase food and drinks of their choosing from a local grocer.

 During Phase 1, the second arm of the study will receive dietary guidance from the study coach and assistance with ordering and purchasing $30/week worth of high potassium foods from the same local grocer.

 In Phase 2 (months 5-12) neither study arm will receive a food allowance, however the second arm will receive telephonic visits and dietary advice from the study coach.
