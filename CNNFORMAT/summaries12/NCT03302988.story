(firstQuint)Wound Eversion Versus Planar Closure for Face or Neck Wounds.

 It has been established that as wounds heal, the resultant tissue remodeling results in wound contracture.

 Surgeons are taught that by everting wounds' edges with well-placed dermal sutures, there is less depression of the resultant scar.

 A prior study conducted by us at this center found that wound eversion was not associated with better cosmetic outcome (1).

 However, it was noted that most of the procedures were performed off the head and neck, places where the effects of eversion were thought to be most beneficial (2) Thus our goal is to now study the effects of eversion exclusively on the face and neck.

The aim of this study is to determine whether wound edge eversion, achieved by careful placement of dermal sutures, improves the cosmetic outcome of operative wounds closed on the head or neck.
