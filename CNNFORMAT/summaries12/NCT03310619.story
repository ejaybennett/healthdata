(fifthQuint)A Safety and Efficacy Trial of JCAR017 Combinations in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Malignancies (PLATFORM).

 This is a global, open-label, multi-arm, multi-cohort, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study to determine the safety, tolerability, PK, efficacy and patient reported quality of life of JCAR017 in combination with various agents.

 This protocol is intended to evaluate various drug combinations with JCAR017, as separate arms, over the life of the protocol, using the same objectives.

 During the Phase 1 part, different arms may be opened to test JCAR017 in combination with combination agent(s).

 Within each arm, different doses and schedules of JCAR017 and the combination agent(s) may be tested in several cohorts and subcohorts per arm.

 During the Phase 2 part of the study, the expansion of any dose level and schedule that has been shown to be safe may occur.

 Arm A will test JCAR017 in combination with durvalumab in adult subjects with R/R aggressive B-cell NHL.

 All subjects from Phase 1 and Phase 2 will be followed for 24 months following JCAR017 infusion.

 Post-study follow-up for survival, relapse, long-term toxicity (including new malignancies), and viral vector safety will continue under a separate long-term follow-up (LTFU) protocol for up to 15 years after the JCAR017 dose as per health authority regulatory guidelines.

 A Safety and Efficacy Trial of JCAR017 Combinations in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Malignancies (PLATFORM)@highlight

This is an open-label, multi-arm, multi-cohort, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study to determine the safety, tolerability, PK, efficacy and patient reported quality of life of JCAR017 in combination with various agents.

 The first combination, defined as Arm A, will evaluate JCAR017 in combination with durvalumab.

 Within each arm, cohorts and subcohorts will test different doses and schedules of the combination agent(s).

 The study will consist of 2 parts: dose finding (Phase 1) and dose expansion (Phase 2).
