(firstQuint)Music Therapy Intervention to Reduce Caregiver Distress at the End of Life.

 Caregivers are at high risk for stress, poor quality of life (QOL), and burnout.

 As a patient nears death, common themes for caregivers include anxiety and emotional distress from impending death, anticipatory grief, and acceptance of loss, which negatively impact the caregiver QOL.

 Investigators propose to conduct a pilot project to investigate music therapy impact on caregiver distress for caregivers of imminently dying hospitalized patients referred to hospice.

 Upon enrollment, caregivers will be provided a music therapy intervention with legacy-building components, and will be asked to complete 3 brief questionnaires on distress and quality of life before and after the music therapy to assess their response to the intervention.

 The overall aim is to reduce caregiver distress and optimize QOL.
