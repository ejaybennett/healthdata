(secondQuint)Adjunctive, Low-dose tPA in Primary PCI for STEMI.

 STRIVE is a prospective, 3-arm, parallel group, open label, randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a novel approach to prevent and treat microvascular obstruction and reduce major cardiovascular events using intracoronary administration of very low-dose fibrinolytic (tissue plasminogen activator, tPA) directly into the culprit coronary artery during primary PCI.

 The objective is to determine if low-dose adjunctive intracoronary tPA (10 mg or 20 mg) will reduce the incidence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or new onset heart failure in patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI.

 Adjunctive, Low-dose tPA in Primary PCI for STEMI@highlight

STRIVE will evaluate the use of adjunctive, low-dose intracoronary tissue plasminogen activator during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events.
