 This is a randomized control trial looking at the effects of vitamin D supplements on mental health in a group of forensic inpatients.

 More specific the effects of vitamin D will be investigated in relation to underlying biological mechanisms associated with resilience (e.

g.

, serotonin, cortisol, heart rate variability and executive functioning), but also subjective well-being such as sleep quality, emotion-regulation, anxiety, depression and self-reported resilience.

 About 100 participants will be randomized to an intervention group (vitamin D) or a control group (placebo).

 The intervention will last for 3-4 months.

 Pre-test will start in October/November 2017 and post-test in April/May 2018.
