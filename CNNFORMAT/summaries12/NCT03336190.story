(fifthQuint)Blue Star Cares: Innovative Approaches to Helping Military-Connected Caregivers.

 The purpose of this project is to evaluate an interactive training program for military-connected caregivers (MCCs) of wounded warriors.

 The program leverages existing resources and incorporates evidence-based training and peer-based support networks to enhance continuity of care.

 The program consists of an educational Toolkit (workbook) and an avatar training interaction where an MCC can practice skills learned from the toolkit training with the avatar (how to navigate difficult conversations).

 This is an educational training evaluation to determine whether or not avatar interaction can effectively improve health outcomes in MCCs.

 The investigators will implement a between subjects design looking at two groups of caregivers across multiple time points examining differences between groups and changes in the outcomes from baseline (before engaging in the training/intervention) to after completing the training, including follow-ups at 3- and 6-months to evaluate longer-term outcomes.

 The groups include an experimental group who will receive the complete training program (toolkit and avatar) and a control group who will receive the avatar PLUS additional self-care (toolkit and avatar PLUS extra self-care).

 Project participants (i.

e.

, MCCs who engage in the training and follow-up activities) will receive the (a) training toolkit workshop and will engage with the avatar to practice the knowledge and skills described in the workshop or will receive only the (b) training toolkit workshop (control).

 Each scheduled workshop will be randomized to either the experimental (full training program) or control (avatar plus extra self-care).

 Comparing the groups and time differences will enable us to determine if the training program, specifically the avatar interaction, is associated with improved health and quality of life in caregivers of wounded warriors, enhanced caregiver social support and networks, improved patient (wounded warrior) experience of care, and reduced per capita costs of care for both the wounded warrior and caregiver.
