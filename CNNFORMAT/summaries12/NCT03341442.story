(fifthQuint)A Study of Posterior Hip Precautions After Total Hip Arthroplasty.

 1.

 Participants at the following institutions (West Virginia University; The Andrews Institute; and University of Kentucky Healthcare Sports Medicine will be given an educational session regarding hip replacement and procedures to follow after total hip replacement at their History and Physical visit prior to elective total hip replacement surgery via a posterior approach.

 2.

 Participants will be told of the study after their educational session.

 All their questions will be answered and they will be given the opportunity to consent for participation.

 3.

 After consent, the participant will be randomized to a control group receiving Standard of Care (education) hip precautions or to a 'no hip precautions' group.

 The control group will be instructed to practice postoperative hip precautions they learned at their educational session; (standard of care) (no flexion > 90 degrees, no internal rotation, no adduction) for 6 weeks.

 The intervention group will be aware of the precautions but will be told not to practice them post-operatively.

 4.

 The participants will be monitored per the surgeons' normal routine post-operatively, which includes notification to the surgeon if the subject returns to the hospital with any hip problems.

 5.

 After the first three participants who were randomized to 'no precautions' have returned for their post-op visit at all sites, the DSMB will have a teleconference to discuss any adverse events including dislocations.

 If any of the first 3 participants dislocated the study will be stopped.

 6.

 At six weeks the following will be recorded: time to elimination of walking aids, dislocation episodes requiring closed reduction, and need for revision surgery.

 If any of the first 3 intervention participants dislocated during the 6 week period, the study will be stopped.

 7.

 The participants will be asked to complete the HOOS Jr.

 and VAS follow-up questions at 2-week, 6-week, 3 month, 6 month and one year post-operatively per standard of care follow-up.

 Participants will be asked to list any hip precautions practiced at these time frames.

 8.

 If the participants fail to come for the standard of care follow up appointments, the research assistant will call the participants and ask the HOOS Jr.

 and VAS questionnaires over the phone and to list any hip precautions they practiced.

 A Study of Posterior Hip Precautions After Total Hip Arthroplasty@highlight

The purpose of this study is to perform a randomized controlled study to compare patients undergoing THA via a posterolateral approach to receive either standard of care post-surgery hip restrictions or to receive no restrictions.

 The investigators goal is to first complete a pilot study in which the investigators assess the short term dislocation rates 3-6 months and then continue to recruit into this study and follow these patients for a year to determine the 1 year risk for dislocation.

 The investigators also will compare the HOOS Jr.

 and VAS scores and time until free from walking aid.

 The research question is: Will the elimination of post operative posterior hip precautions increase the dislocation rate? The hypothesis is that the elimination of post operative hip precautions will not increase the dislocation rate.
