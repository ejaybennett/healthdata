(secondQuint)The Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of the Mesenchymal Stem Cells From Adipose and Hyaluronic Acid.

 This is a single-centre, quadruple blined, randomized controlled clinical trials with a total of 14 knee osteoarthrits patients as participants, who will be randomly assigned into experiment group or compare group.

Participants in experiment group will receive the treatment of MSCs from adipose anticular injection, while participants in compare group will receive hyaluronic acid.

 Unexplained local and systemic symptoms as well as visual analog scale pain score, WesternOntario McMasterUniversities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index scorewill be assessed at baseline and 2 years after the injection.

 The Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of the Mesenchymal Stem Cells From Adipose and Hyaluronic Acid@highlight

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) from adipose anticular injection in comparison with hyaluronic acid anticular injection in the treatment of human knee osteoarthritis(OA).
