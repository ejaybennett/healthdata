(fifthQuint)Eribulin Mesylate and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Retroperitoneal Liposarcoma That Can Be Removed by Surgery.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of radiation and eribulin mesylate (eribulin) when used in combination for the preoperative treatment of retroperitoneal liposarcoma.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the feasibility of a preoperative chemoradiation protocol for retroperitoneal liposarcoma.

 II.

 to assess the surgical outcomes of retroperitoneal liposarcoma resections after preoperative chemoradiation.

 III.

 To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of eribulin in combination with radiation in subjects with retroperitoneal liposarcoma.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of eribulin mesylate.

 Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8 and undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days a week beginning on day 8 of course 1.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients may undergo surgery within 3-10 weeks after radiation therapy.

 After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed up at 2 weeks, 9 weeks, and then every 6 months for 10 years.

This phase Ib trials studies the side effects and best dose of eribulin mesylate when given together with radiation therapy in treating patients with retroperitoneal liposarcoma that can be removed by surgery.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.

 Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.
