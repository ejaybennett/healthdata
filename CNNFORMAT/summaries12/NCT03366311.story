 Challenging airway is always a big issue in emergency room.

 However, better hand technique, stylet shapes and conditions affecting intubation successful rate, elapsed duration need further investigations.

 We compare two endotracheal tube holding position, two holding places, with or without epiglottis lift technique in this study.

 All intubation processes in the study will be recorded.

To investigate which shapes of stylet, hand techniques and possible condition that improve intubation successful rate and reduce the elapsed intubation time.
