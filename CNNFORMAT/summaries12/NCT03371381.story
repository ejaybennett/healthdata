(thirdQuint)An Efficacy and Safety Study of JNJ-64041757, a Live Attenuated Listeria Monocytogenes Immunotherapy, in Combination With Nivolumab Versus Nivolumab Monotherapy in Participants With Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Lung.

 This study evaluates safety and efficacy of JNJ-64041757 with nivolumab.

 The total study duration will be up to 3 years.

 It will consist of safety run-in and randomized phase which will comprise of Screening phase(Day(D) -28 to D -1),Treatment Phase,End of Adverse Event Evaluation Period (100 D after last dose of nivolumab)and Post-treatment Follow-up Phase(Every 3 Months).

 The primary hypothesis is that addition of JNJ-640417577 to nivolumab will result in higher objective response rate compared with nivolumab monotherapy in at least one of programmed death receptor ligand 1 subgroups in participants with relapsed or refractory StageIIIB or StageIV adenocarcinoma of lung.

 The study procedures include blood culture bacterial shedding assessments, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and biomarkers.

 Safety will be monitored throughout study.

 An Efficacy and Safety Study of JNJ-64041757, a Live Attenuated Listeria Monocytogenes Immunotherapy, in Combination With Nivolumab Versus Nivolumab Monotherapy in Participants With Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Lung@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the efficacy of JNJ-757 combined with nivolumab is better than the efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy for participants with mesothelin-positive relapsed/refractory Stage IIIB or Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung.

 The open-label study comprises of two parts i.

e.

 Phase 1b (safety run-in) and Phase 2.

 Phase1b consists of 1 arm whereas Phase 2 is randomized into 2 groups i.

e.

 Group A and Group B.
