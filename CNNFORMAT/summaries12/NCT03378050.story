(thirdQuint)A Trial of a Multi-component Individualized Telephone-based Support Intervention for Adult-child Caregivers Caring for Parents With Dementia.

 The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a multi-component individualized telephone-based support intervention (HEART) for adult-child caregivers caring for parents with dementia in China.

 The primary hypothesis to test is whether the HEART is more efficacious in reducing caregiver burden than the follow-up as usual (FU) in dementia adult-child caregivers.

 Secondary hypotheses include the following: 1.

 The HEART is more efficacious in improving health related quality of life than the FU in dementia adult-child caregivers.

 2.

 The HEART is more efficacious in protecting reciprocal Filial Piety than the FU in dementia adult-child caregivers.

 3.

 The HEART is more efficacious in relieving CR's behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) than the FU in dementia adult-child caregivers.

 4.

 The HEART group has a higher satisfaction with the intervention than the FU group.

 In addition, two research questions will be answered by qualitative data from process evaluation for the feasibility of the HEART intervention.

 The research questions are as follows: 1.

 To what extent can the HEART intervention be delivered as planned? 2.

 What are the barriers to and facilitators of the HEART intervention?.
