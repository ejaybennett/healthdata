(thirdQuint)Chinese Version of Fibromyalgia Criteria and Severity Scales Study.

 Fibromyalgia is a chronic debilitating musculoskeletal pain syndrome that causes substantial physical and psychological impairments.

 The provisional criteria of the ACR 2010 and the 2011 self-report modification for survey and clinical research are widely used for fibromyalgia diagnosis.

 However, there is no Chinese version of fibromyalgia diagnosis criteria and severity assessment scales until now.

 The aim of this study is to investigate the reliability and the validity of the Chinese version of the 2011ModCr and 2016 ACR revisions to the 2011ModCr, as well as its quantification scale, the Chinese version of Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-C) and Revised FIQ (FIQR-C).

 In this study, we'll divide patients with chronic pain without psychiatric disorders other than depression into two groups according to the 1990 ACR diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, a fibromyalgia group and a non-fibromyalgia group.

 Patients in both groups will be assessed using the 2011ModCr and 2016 ACR revisions to the 2011ModCr.

 Furthermore, those in the fibromyalgia group will also complete FIQ-C, FIQR-C and several other validated questionnaires including the Medical Outcome Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), ect.
