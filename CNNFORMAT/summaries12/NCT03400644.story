(fifthQuint)Are Rigid Cervical Collars Necessary for Open-door Laminoplasty and Titanium Arch Plates for Cervical Myelopathy?.

 Current management protocols regarding cervical laminoplasty is to provide early immobilization with rigid cervical neck collars to avoid implant failure, loss of correction and recurrence of neurological deficit.

 However, there is no strong evidence supporting the need for neck collars in laminoplasty especially since modern plating fixation methods are already very rigid.

 Cervical neck collars should also not be used haphazardly due to possible complications and cost implications.

 Cervical range of motion has been shown to reduce with rigid cervical collars.

 Decreased voluntary eye movement and postural stability has also been illustrated.

 Longer duration of neck collar use may even lead to postoperative axial neck pain.

 Neck collars has also been linked to complications such as pressure ulcers, nerve palsy, skin reactions, dysphagia and respiratory problems.

 The costs of collar manufacturing and maintenance is not small and must also be taken into consideration.

 With stronger fixation devices like plates, the above complications can be avoided.

 Most clinicians still use neck collars for protection mainly due to historical reasons.

 However this is not an evidence-based approach.

 By eliminating the need for neck collars, patients are allowed earlier mobilization, less neck stiffness and axial neck pain while reducing its cost.

 Hence this study is important to provide a basis for changing clinical practice.

 The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial.

 Patients are consecutively and randomly divided into two groups .

 One group of patients will receive no cervical collar postoperatively and a second group will receive rigid neck collar for 3 weeks postoperatively.

 Operative techniques will be standardized.

 All assessments are performed 3 and 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively.

 The subjects were analysed in terms of clinical and functional outcomes through radiographic measurements, clinical assessment and questionnaires.

This is a randomized controlled trial to assess the use of rigid neck collar postoperatively.

 It consists of patients with cervical myelopathy undergoing open-door laminoplasty with titanium arch plates.

 Patients are divided into two groups: one group are not using rigid neck collar whereas the second group of patients wear rigid neck collar for three weeks postoperatively.

 Both groups of patients will then be assessed at fixed intervals.

 Clinical assessments include the cervical spine range of motion, any axial neck pain and also a full neurological examination.

 Radiographs will be used to assess for any complications.

 Cervical spine alignment and relevant questionnaires will be done and recorded.

 These results will help to conclude whether we can avoid the use of rigid cervical collars postoperatively, in view of the associated problems arising from restricted neck movement.
