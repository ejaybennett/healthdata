(secondQuint)The Korean TITRATION Study: Comparison of the Self-titration Methods for Glargine-300.

 The primary objective of this study is to obtain efficacy and safety descriptive data on two different titration algorithms: the INSIGHT titration algorithm (self-titration of 1 unit/day) and the EDITION trial algorithm with insulin glargine 300 units/mL (GLA-300) when given as basal insulin in uncontrolled T2DM patients on basal insulin with or without non-insulin anti-hyperglycemic agent (NIAHA) or in insulin naive patients.

 In a Korean, single-center, type 2 diabetes patients with basal insulin therapy will be enrolled.

 They will be randomly assigned to either titration algorithm for GLA-300.

 After 12 weeks, the glycemic control, patients' satisfaction to the titration methods and healthcare providers' satisfaction to titration methods will be assessed.

The aim of this study is to demonstrate efficacy and safety of self-titration algorithm with Gla-300 using the INSIGHT algorithm (once daily by 1 unit) and the EDITION algorithm (once weekly by 3 units) in Korean patients with T2D.
