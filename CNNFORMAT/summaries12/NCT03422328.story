.

 The purpose of this study is to provide continued treatment with macitentan to subjects with PAH who participated or participate in "parent studies" in France and to continue to accrue long-term safety data.

 "Parent study/studies" refer to a number of clinical studies with macitentan that are conducted in different clinical classification of PAH (NCT00667823, NCT02112487, NCT02310672, NCT02968901, NCT02558231) and may be completed before the participating subjects have access to commercial macitentan in their country of residence.

 The "parent studies" are fully or partially running in France where no access to commercial macitentan is expected in the near future.
