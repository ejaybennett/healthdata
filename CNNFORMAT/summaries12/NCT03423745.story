(thirdQuint)Appropriate Number of Endotracheal Intubation Experience for CPR.

 Endotracheal intubation(ETI) has been considered to be the best method of airway management during cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR).

 However, ETI during CPR requires high skill and experience.

 Therefore ETI during CPR should be performed by expert in ETI.

 But the definition of experts in ETI during CPR has not been done yet.

 This study tried to estimate the appropriate number of ETI experience for successful ETI at first attempt during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

 So the investigators analyze the success rate, speed, trial number, incidence of complications, and hands-off time of ETI using direct laryngoscopy (DL) which is standard device, in real clinical setting.

 In addition, this study analyze the residency training term, total number of ETI experience using DL at that time.
