(fifthQuint)Treatment of Immature Permanent Teeth With Three Different Pulp Capping Materials With Partial Pulpotomy.

 The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical and radiographical success of three different materials in partial pulpotomy treatment.

 50 patients with 54 asymptomatic, cariously exposed young permanent mandibular molar teeth were included to the study.

 The teeth were randomly divided into three main groups which were; calcium hydroxide, MTA and Biodentine(R) and finally restorated with stainless steel crowns.

 Pain, percussion sensitivity, palpation sensitivity of soft tissue around the tooth, root development, presence of lesion, integrity of lamina dura were evaluated clinically and radiographically during 12 months and recorded for each.

 Also, Image J Program with Turbo-Reg plug in was used for standardization of the radiographs and to determine the increase in root length.

 Treatment of Immature Permanent Teeth With Three Different Pulp Capping Materials With Partial Pulpotomy@highlight

The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare partial pulpotomy treatments with Biodentine(R), calcium hydroxide (CH) and Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) in cariously exposed asymptomatic young permanent teeth clinically and radiographically for 1 year and evaluate root developments with Image J Software Program.

 The null hypothesis of this study is Biodentine(R) will promote healing with high success rates and induce root development more than CH and MTA.
