(thirdQuint)Impact of Nursing Interventions Based Mishel's Uncertainty in Illness Theory on Mothers of Children With Cancer.

 Cancer defines a group of diseases that arise from the uncontrolled proliferation and spread of abnormal cells.

 The prevalence of cancer before the age of 15 years is 110-150 million.

 Every year, more than 150,000 people in the World are newly diagnosed, and over 10,000 children in America are diagnosed with cancer for the first time.

 It is reported that 2500-3000 new cases of childhood cancer are expected to be seen in our country, Turkey, annually.

 Childhood cancer is a major stressor for parents.

 They are at risk for developing psychosocial problems during the course of disease and its long and stressful treatment.

 And uncertainty is one of these problems which they live.

 Uncertainty arises when "the decision maker can not give a definite value to a certain event or situation" or "can not predict the accuracy of the results".

 Uncertainty refers to the inability to identify, interpret and predict the disease-related condition/event.

 Uncertainty can have positive or negative affects to child and family according the meaning and coping of uncertainty for parents.

 Mishel is the first nurse theorist who mentioned uncertainty in illness in the aspect of nursing as a theory.

 In her theory, nursing interventions can help parents to cope with or adapt the uncertainty.

 Nursing interventions should contain the main domains of such as communication, education, supporting, being reliable health care professional for parents.

 In this study there will be two groups that are randomly assigned from the mothers' of children with cancer whose treatments continue in two university hospital in Konya.

 Sample size for each group calculated according to effect size (medium effect), power (.

80), alfa error (.

05) and it was found 27 mothers for each group.

 To avoid possible sample problems can be seen during to study (such as do not want to continue the stud etc), sample was improved %10 and the last sample size for each group was determined 30 mothers.

 Groups will be recruited randomly.

 Experimental group will receive nursing intervention that include education and sharing group activity based on Theory.

 The aim of this intervention is to control/solve the antecedents of uncertainty and to affect appraisal of uncertainty in a positive way so mothers can improve the coping and adaptation of uncertainty.

 Control group will receive routine nursing intervention that is given normally for hospitals to avoid bias and ethical problems.

 Duration of intervention and collecting data for the study will be 12 weeks.

 Data will be collected using questionnaire and three scales.

 Scales validation and reliability studies were made for Turkish population and they will use to evaluate uncertainty, hopelessness, coping and compliance of mothers.
