(thirdQuint)Tolerability of Vitamin C in Patients With Intermediate or High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome With TET2 Mutations.

 This study will enroll patients with intermediate or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome.

 All patients will receive at least 1 cycle of treatment (4 weeks).

 Patients with clinical benefit (CR,PR, or SD) then will undergo a second 4-week cycle of treatment.

 The primary objectives of this study are: 1.

 Evaluate the safety and toxicity of high dose Vitamin C 2.

 Estimate the proportion of Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with Ten-eleven translocation-2, (TET2) mutations who exhibit a biological response defined as maintaing a vtamin C serum concentration of 1mM over the treatment cycle.

 The secondary objectives are: 1.

 Estimate the clinical efficacy, namely objectiveresponse rate (ORR).

 [including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)] duration of response (DOR) and progression-free survival (PFS) as defined in the IWG (International Working Group) response criteria in myelodisplasia.

 2.

 Estimate the Maximum measure Vitamin C plasma concentration (max) 3.

 Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile (PK) of Vitamin C as hypomethylating or demethylating agent.

This is an open label, Phase Ib/IIa study designed to evaluate the safety, toxicity and biological activity of high dose Vitamin C in bone marrow and peripheral blood when administered as therapy to patients with intermediate or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome according to the revised IPSS (international prognostic scoring system) criteria whose disease has a Ten-eleven translocation-2, (TET2) mutation.
