(fifthQuint)Durvalumab Plus Tremelimumab Combined With Proton Therapy for HNSCC.

 The incidence of Head and neck cancer (HNC) is approximately 6% of all cases with a world annual incidence and nearly 90 to 95% of HNC is squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

 [1] For patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC (R/M HNSCC), cytotoxic-based chemotherapy remains the standard therapeutic option.

 The median survival of these patients treated with cytotoxic-based chemotherapy, however, is only 6 to 10 months.

 For those who are not candidates for chemotherapy, the prognosis is even worse with median survival of 3 to 6 months.

 [2-4] Thus, new therapeutic options for these patients are needed to improve the treatment outcomes.

 We hypothesize that durvalumab plus tremelimumab combined with proton therapy would be effective in R/M HNSCC.

 The combination of immunotherapy and RT can be effective regimen because immunologic response might be enhanced by RT through the alteration of microenvironment within the irradiated field, tumor antigen release and "abscopal effect" at distant metastatic sites.

 In addition, the benefit of proton therapy is to deliver RT dose just to target lesion.

 The irradiated volume can be significantly reduced with proton therapy compared to X-ray treatment, thus proton therapy will provide better quality of life compared to X-ray during palliative RT.

 Patients in the durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab combination therapy treatment group will receive durvalumab (MEDI4736) (1500mg Q4W) in combination with tremelimumab (75 mg IV Q4W) for up to 4 doses/cycles each, followed by durvalumab (MEDI4736) 1500mg Q4W until confirmed disease progression unless there is unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met.

 The first durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy dose at 1500mg Q4W will be 4 weeks after the final dose of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in combination with tremelimumab.

 Tremelimumab will be administered first; the durvalumab (MEDI4736) infusion will start approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the tremelimumab infusion.

 If there are no clinically significant concerns after the first cycle, then, at the discretion of the Investigator, all other cycles of durvalumab (MEDI4736) can be given immediately after the tremelimumab infusion has finished.

0 Efficacy Assessments: according to RECIST version 1.

1 - Statistical Methods and Data Analysis: PFS: from the date of treatment to the date of progression or death or last follow-up OS: from the date of treatment to the date of death or last follow-up - Sample Size Determination: Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of HNSCC.

 In this phase II study, up to approximately 27 eligible patients will be enrolled.

 It is anticipated that full accrual to this study will take approximately 24 months.

 H0: Objective response rate 10% H1: Objective response rate 35% According to Simon's two-stage optimal design (power of 90% and one-sided alpha of 0.

05), this study needs total 27 evaluable patients.

 At the first stage, 11 patients would be enrolled.

 If two or more among them achieve objective response, the study will go forward the second stage.

 At the second stage, 16 additional patients (total 27 patients) would be enrolled.

 Among the total 27 evaluable patients, six or more objective responses are necessary for this drug to be evaluated further in the group of R/M HNSCC
