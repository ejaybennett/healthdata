(thirdQuint)Treatment of Graves' Orbitopathy to Reduce Proptosis With Teprotumumab Infusions in an Open-Label Clinical Extension Study.

 This is a multi-center, open-label extension study of HZNP-TEP-301 (NCT03298867) examining the safety and efficacy of teprotumumab in the treatment of TED in adult participants.

 Participants who complete the 24-week double-masked Treatment Period in Study HZNP-TEP-301 and are proptosis non-responders or were proptosis responders at Week 24 but meet the criteria for re-treatment due to relapse during the Follow-Up Period of HZNP-TEP-301 will be eligible for enrollment.

 All participants who choose to participate will receive up to 8 infusions of teprotumumab (10 mg/kg for the first infusion followed by 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) in an open-label fashion, with the number of infusions determined by the Investigator's clinical judgment (but not to exceed 8 infusions).

 The Baseline (Day 1) Visit of this extension study will occur within 14 days after the final visit of Study HZNP-TEP-301 (Week 24 for proptosis non-responders and up to Week 72 for participants who relapse).

 During the open-label Treatment Period, study drug infusions are scheduled for Day 1 (Baseline), and Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21.

 When the Investigator considers treatment to be complete, participants will have an EOT Visit 3 weeks after the final infusion and undergo the scheduled EOT assessments.

 Participants who relapse during the Follow-Up Period of HZNP-TEP-301 and choose to enter this extension study will not participate in the Follow-Up Period of this study and will be discharged from the study following completion of the EOT assessments.
