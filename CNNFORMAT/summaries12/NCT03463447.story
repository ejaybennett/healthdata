(firstQuint)Measurement of Handgrip Strength and Pinch of Children and Adolescents Using an Electronic Dynamometer.

 The hand is considered the most improved tool and differentiated of the human, with great importance in the accomplishment of numerous actions due to an essential function: The handgrip strength.

 The handgrip and pinch movements are very important for an accomplishment of daily activities.

 For an evaluation of the movements, the dynamometry has been used in many fields of health and frequently in the area of rehabilitation.

 However, if the type of dynamometer used is not suitable for children, a measurement of the handgrip may be compromised.

 Therefore, the present study verified the effectiveness of an electronic dynamometer to evaluate the handgrip strength and pinch in children and adolescents.
