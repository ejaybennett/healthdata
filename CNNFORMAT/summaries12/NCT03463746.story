(fifthQuint)Integrated, Practice-oriented Electromechanical-assisted Gait Training in Subacute Stroke Patients.

 Background and Rationale: Every year, more than a 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke1.

 Despite laborious rehabilitation programs 70% of those stroke patients still show limited gait ability after three months.

 Numerous RCTs have shown the superiority of over ground gait training and electromechanical-assisted gait devices in comparison with conventional over ground gait training alone.

 (Jan Mehrholz, Elsner, Werner, Kugler, & Pohl, 2013) However, most of these trials used the electromechanical-assisted gait devices in a very high frequency which is almost impossible to achieve in daily clinical routine.

 Therefore, the effect of a practice-oriented physical therapy protocol including electromechanical-assisted gait training remains unclear.

 Objective(s): The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the effects of an integrated, practice-orientated individual physical therapy protocol with or without electromechanical-assisted gait training in subacute stroke patients, respectively.

 The effects of both physical therapy protocols will be compared with validated assessments covering the different components of the ICF framework: function, activity and participation.

 Primary objectives: Effects on gait ability and on basic activities of daily living (ADL).

 Secondary objectives: Effects on walking speed, walking capacity, functional mobility, muscle force, spasticity and reintegration to normal living (RNLI).

 Furthermore, different training-related data are recorded to capture the efficiency (intensity and hassle) of both physical therapy protocols.

 Detailed Description: Background and Rationale: With 16.

9 million people suffered a first stroke and almost six million stroke-related deaths worldwide in 2010, stroke was ranked as the second most common cause of death at the age of over 65 years (Lozano et al.

, 2012).

 Although mortality-to-incidence ratios have decreased, the global burden of stroke in terms of the absolute number of people affected every year and stroke-related deaths are increasing (Krishnamurthi et al.

, 2013).

 Taking into account the demographic changes of our society up to 12 million stroke deaths and 70 million stroke survivors are expected in 2030 (Krishnamurthi et al.

, 2013).

 In Switzerland 15'000 people suffer a stroke every year (Jorgensen, Nakayama, Raaschou, & Olsen, 1995).

 Three months after stroke 20% of the affected patients are still bound to a wheelchair and 70% show limited gait ability, therefore, the restoration of gait ability is one of the most important therapy goals.

 Since motor restoration especially takes place during the first six months the choice of a proper gait therapy is of great importance (Jorgensen et al.

, 1995).

 Since repetition and task-specific activity have been shown to be key factors for motor (re)-learning (Kwakkel, Kollen, & Lindeman, 2004) (French et al.

, 2007) treadmill training with body weight support has been implemented in stroke rehabilitation.

 However, no superiority of treadmill training compared to conventional over ground gait training could have been shown to date.

 Especially patients who cannot walk at all don't seem to benefit from treadmill training to a greater extent (J Mehrholz et al.

, 2014).

 A possible explanation therefor is the tremendous therapeutic effort needed to move severely impaired patients on a treadmill.

 To obtain a higher therapeutic efficiency (reduce therapeutic effort and increased number of steps) electromechanical-assisted gait devices have been developed.

 During electromechanical-assisted gait therapy the patient is either moved by the means of a robotic-driven exoskeleton orthosis (exoskeleton device) (Colombo, Joerg, Schreier, & Dietz, 2000) or two mechanically driven foot plates simulating the gait pattern (end-effector device) (Hesse, Sarkodie-Gyan, & Uhlenbrock, 1999).

 Over the last decade different studies have evaluated the effect of the implementation of the exoskeleton and end-effector devices within the rehabilitation process of stroke patients (Jan Mehrholz et al.

, 2013).

 RCTs have shown the superiority of the combination of conventional over ground gait training supplemented by electromechanical-assisted gait devices in comparison with conventional over ground gait training alone (Jan Mehrholz et al.

, 2013).

 Especially non-ambulatory patients in the subacute phase (=2.

 Lower FAC-levels are not tested.

 Walking capacity (ICF-level activity): To assess walking capacity the 6minWT is performed.

 The 6minWT is a simple and valid test which is used to assess maximum walking distance.

 It shows adequate reliability and excellent validity in stroke patients (Kosak & Smith, 2005).

 The 6minWT is carried out in patients with FAC-Level >=2.

 Lower FAC-levels are not tested.

 Functional Mobility (ICF-level activity): For the assessment of mobility, the DEMMI is chosen.

 The DEMMI consists of 17 basic everyday mobility tasks differentiating between 5 conditions (bed, chair, static balance, walking and dynamic balance) (de Morton, Davidson, & Keating, 2008).

 The DEMMI is a practical, short and valid mobility test for geriatric and stroke patients that is sensitive to detect changes (Braun et al.

, 2015).

 Muscular Strength lower extremities (ICF-level structure/function): Change of lower extremities muscular strength is measured with the Motricity Index (MI).

 Due to the present intervention studied only the muscle force of the lower limbs will be evaluated (hip flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion).

 Previous studies have shown that the MI is a valid, reliable and sensitive tool that is short and easily to apply (Collin & Wade, 1990; Demeurisse, Demol, & Robaye, 1980).

 Spasticity (ICF-level structure/function): Quantification of spasticity of the affected lower limb is carried out with the mTS.

 The mTS has shown to have very good test-retest reliability and sensitivity that is high enough to measure changes pre-post treatment (Jan Mehrholz et al.

, 2005).

 Reintegration to normal living (ICF-level participation): For the assessment of the ICF level participation the RNLI is chosen.

 The instrument can be used to evaluate the degree to which the patient has been able to return to a normal life (Wood-Dauphinee & Williams, 1987).
