(thirdQuint)Whole-Body Cryotherapy (WBC) as an Adjunct Treatment on Pain in Fibromyalgia Persons: Short Time Effect.

.

 24 patients with fibromyalgia were randomized into 2 groups (n=11 in the WBC group, n=13 in the control group).

 In the WBC group, 10 sessions of WBC were performed (in addition to usual care) in a standard cryotherapy room over a duration of 8 days.

 Patients in the control group did not change anything in their everyday activities.

 Several self-reported variables relating to perceived health were measured repeatedly (pain intensity, functional mobility, and quality of life).

 Whole-Body Cryotherapy (WBC) as an Adjunct Treatment on Pain in Fibromyalgia Persons: Short Time Effect.

@highlight

Our aim was to determine whether Whole Body Cryotherapy (WBC) can result in improved pain status, perceived health, and quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia.

 It is hypothesized that this positive effect can be achieved through increased functional mobility and decreased pain intensity resulting from cold-induced modulation of the inflammation-immune axis.
