(firstQuint)A Trial Comparing the Incidence of Hypophosphatemia in Relation to Treatment With Iron Isomaltoside and Ferric Carboxymaltose in Subjects With Iron Deficiency Anaemia Due to Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

 Existing IV iron complexes differ in relation to the compounds capability to induce unintended hypophosphatemia to a degree defined as medical significant.

 This trial is designed evaluate the effect of IV iron isomaltoside compared to IV ferric carboxymaltose on phosphate in subjects with IDA due to inflammatory bowel disease .
