(fifthQuint)MOM's PAIN (Methylene Blue for Oral Mucositis' PAIN).

 Study Groups: If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups.

 This is done because no one knows if one is better, the same, or worse than the other.

 - In Group 1, you will receive methylene blue first, followed by standard therapy.

 You will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of a dice) to receive 1 of 3 doses of methylene blue.

 Neither you nor the study staff or study doctor will know which dose of methylene blue you are receiving.

 However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out which dose you are receiving.

 - In Group 2, you will receive standard therapy alone.

 Study Drug Administration: If you are in Group 1, you will rinse your mouth with methylene blue for about 5 minutes every 6 hours until your side effects go away or you run out of methylene blue, whichever comes first.

 To rinse with methylene blue, you will swish it around your mouth and hold it at the painful areas of your mouth and then spit it out.

 After you have received methylene blue (if you are in Group 1) or if you are in Group 2, you will receive standard medications.

 The study doctor and/or study staff will explain which medications you will receive and their risks.

 Length of Study: If you are in Group 1, you will be given 1 bottle of methylene blue which you can use every 6 hours as needed or until you run out of methylene blue.

 Hence, the MB rinse is 2 total rinse per day, 6 hours apart.

 After that, if it is needed, you may continue to use standard medications.

 All participants may continue to receive standard treatment for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

 You will no longer be able to use methylene blue if the mucositis gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Your participation on the study will be over after the Day 7 phone call (described below).

 Study Phone Calls: All participants will be called by a member of the study staff the day after you complete treatment and at Days 2, and 7 after that.

 If you are coming to the clinic as part of your standard care, this may be done in person.

 Also, on Day 30, adverse event will be assessed, and this maybe by telephone or face-to-face in the clinic.

 The study staff will ask you about your pain levels; how well you are able to talk, swallow, and chew; if you have had any side effects; and if you are taking any medications to treat mucositis.

 If you are called, each call should last about 7-10 minutes.

 MOM's PAIN (Methylene Blue for Oral Mucositis' PAIN)@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to compare methylene blue (an oral rinse) to standard therapy to learn if one is better, the same, or worse than the other in controlling mucositis (mouth blisters/sores).

 Standard therapy may include regular analgesics (numbing medications) and mouth rinses.

 This is an investigational study.

 Methylene blue is FDA approved and commercially available to treat methemoglobinemia (a type of blood disorder).

 It is considered investigational to use methylene blue to treat mucositis.

 The study doctor can explain how methylene blue is designed to work.

 Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
