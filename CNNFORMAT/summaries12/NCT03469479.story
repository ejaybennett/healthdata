(secondQuint)Neoadjuvant HAIC for Huge Resectable HCC at BCLC A-B Stage.

 Resection is the long-term therapeutic option for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.

 While a number of studies demonstrate poor effect and high relapse rate of resection for patients with huge hepatocellular carcinoma staged BCLC A/B.

 Our previous prospective study also revealed that neoadjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) seems to confer a survival benefit for resectable HCC.

 Recently, the results of our previous prospective study suggested that, compared with TACE, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve the survivals for HCC with huge HCC.

Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective randomized control to demonstrate the superiority of resection plus neoadjuvant HAIC over resection alone.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of resection plus neoadjuvant hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) compared with resection alone in patients with huge resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) BCLC A-B stage.
