(thirdQuint)Ischemic Conditioning by Aircrews for Refractory Occlusions.

 In this study, 15 subjects presenting to a community hospital with signs and symptoms of ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion, transported to a comprehensive stroke center by aircew will receive RLIC using the Doctormate device.

 The RLIC treatment will consist of 3-5 cycles ( depending on transportation time) of 5 minutes inflations of both blood pressure cuffs simultaneously.

 Blood pressure will be 200 mm HG with 5 minutes of reperfusion between each inflation.

 Subjects will be evaluated upon arrival to the comprehensive stroke center and evaluated for side effects.

 The study will be conducted at one site ( University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics).

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of performing remote limb ischemic conditioning (RLIC) using the Doctormate device, a special blood pressure device used to perform RLIC, on patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion being transported to a thrombectomy capable center by the helicopter.
