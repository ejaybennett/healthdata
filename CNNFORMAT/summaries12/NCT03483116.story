(secondQuint)A Phase II Dose-ranging Study of Oral RV3-BB Rotavirus Vaccine.

 The primary objective of this study is to assess the cumulative anti-rotavirus serum IgA response (defined as a 3 fold increase from baseline) 4 weeks after 3 doses of RV3-BB administered in a neonatal schedule at a High, Mid or low vaccine titre.

 In addition the cumulative anti-rotavirus serum IgA response (defined as a 3 fold increase from baseline) 4 weeks after 3 doses of RV3-BB administered in an infant schedule at a high dose of vaccine will be assessed along with cumulative vaccine take and components of vaccine take after 3 doses of RV3-BB administered in a neonatal or infant schedule.

 The safety and tolerability of RV3-BB when administered as an infant or as a neonatal schedule will be described.
