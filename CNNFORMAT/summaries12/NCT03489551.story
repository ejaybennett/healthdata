(fifthQuint)Feasibility of Prophylactic Haldol to Prevent Delirium in Cancer Patients.

 This is an open label, safety & feasibility, clinical drug trial.

 We will use historical controls from previous research with bone marrow transplant patients and delirium incidence at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic Haldol in the prevention of delirium.

 This study will recruit adult cancer patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at UIHC.

 Feasibility of Prophylactic Haldol to Prevent Delirium in Cancer Patients@highlight

This research study proposes to conduct an open label, feasibility study administering prophylactic oral haldol to patients undergoing a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

 The study will address the following research aims: 1) To demonstrate the feasibility of enrolling HSCT patients in a prophylactic medication trial, 2) To determine the tolerability of oral haldol in HSCT patients and 2) To compare rates of delirium in HSCT patients who receive prophylactic haldol with an untreated historical control group.
