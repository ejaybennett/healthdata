(secondQuint)Vaginal Estrogen on Postpartum Atrophy, Perineal Pain, and Sexual Function.

 The overall goal of this study is to determine whether there are benefits to use of low-dose vaginal estrogen in the postpartum period.

 Dyspareunia and vaginal/perineal pain are well-known sequelae after vaginal delivery.

 However, the contribution of postpartum vaginal atrophy to these issues is largely unknown.

 Although the relationship between lactation, relative estrogen deprivation, and vulvovaginal atrophy has been established, there is a paucity of data regarding on the prevalence of vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms in the postpartum period.

 Additionally, although the benefits of vaginal estrogen in postmenopausal atrophy are well-established, the benefits in the postpartum period are unknown.
