(fifthQuint)DIRECT-SAFE: A Randomized Controlled Trial of DIRECT Endovascular Clot Retrieval Versus Standard Bridging Thrombolysis With Endovascular Clot Retrieval.

 The DIRECT-SAFE trial will include patients with acute ischemic stroke, who are 18 years of age and are eligible for standard intravenous tPA therapy within 4.

5 hours of stroke onset.

 Patients will be assessed for large vessel occlusion to determine their eligibility for randomization into the trial.

 Eligible vessel occlusions include the internal carotid artery, basilar artery or middle cerebral artery (M1 or M2).

 Patients will be consented after large vessel occlusion is confirmed based on standard care multimodal imaging.

 Patients will be recruited in Australia and New Zealand, China, Taiwan and Europe.

 Randomisation either direct to ECR or standard thrombolytic therapy and ECR shall be in a 1:1 ratio.

 All patients will have a multimodal MR (or CT/CTP at investigator's discretion if MRI not possible) at 18 to 30 hours post treatment to assess reperfusion, recanalization, ischemic core growth and hemorrhagic transformation.

 Final follow up will occur at Day 90.

 DIRECT-SAFE: A Randomized Controlled Trial of DIRECT Endovascular Clot Retrieval Versus Standard Bridging Thrombolysis With Endovascular Clot Retrieval@highlight

The study will be a multicentre, prospective, randomized, open label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) phase 3 trial (2 arm with 1:1 randomization) in ischemic stroke patients within 4.

5 hours of stroke onset.

 Randomised patients will be stratified for site of baseline arterial occlusion into one of three groups: 1.

 internal carotid artery (ICA) 2.

 middle cerebral artery (MCA) 3.

 basilar artery (BA).

 Patients will be randomised to either bridging intravenous thrombolysis with endovascular clot retrieval (ECR), or direct endovascular clot retrieval.
