(thirdQuint)Non-integrated Costs Increase Effectiveness of Incentives.

 The investigators will send e-mails to a complete mailing list of faculty and staff at a university.

 Each recipient will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: control, main task incentive or indirect incentive.

 Our main dependent variable will be whether or not participants decide to get vaccinated.

 The investigators will obtain their actual vaccination records from the university Occupational Health Department.

 Within the e-mail message, participants will indicate whether or not they intend to get vaccinated.

 Intention serves as an indirect dependent outcome.

 Upon clicking to indicate their intention, participants are redirected to a page which gives further instructions on how to proceed.

 Participants who vaccinate will be asked to complete a brief follow-up questionnaire to evaluate their experience with vaccination and (for those offered and incentive) to provide contact information to receive their payment.

The investigators will test the hypothesis that the control (no incentive) condition will have the lowest vaccination rate, the main task condition will have a significantly higher vaccination rate while the indirect condition will have the highest vaccination rate.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three message conditions and their vaccination records obtained from the university Occupational Health Department.
