(fifthQuint)Retail Outlet Health Kiosk Hypertension Trial.

 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the U.

S.

 as well as the leading cause of health care cost.

 Hypertension is the leading remediable risk factor for CVD in the U.

S.

 and globally, with prevalence of 29% in U.

S.

 adults.

 Recent data from NHANES indicate that blood pressure (BP) is not controlled, defined as 3 systolic BP measurements >140/90 mmHg.

 The investigators propose to target this group using interactive text messaging to activate individuals to take actions to improve BP control.

 The primary endpoint will be BP control defined as <140/90 mmHg at 12 months post randomization.

 Retail Outlet Health Kiosk Hypertension Trial@highlight

The investigators propose to conduct pilot studies to support an application to conduct a fully powered randomized trial of a text messaging intervention to increase the rate of blood pressure control, defined as <140/90 mmHg, among hypertensive individuals using health kiosk blood pressure devices.

 These pilot studies will include testing of the intervention, recruitment, enrollment, and data collection procedures, and of the web-based interactions between the data coordinating center and higi Sh llc (Chicago, IL), which is the company that installs and maintains the health care kiosks and associated software infrastructure.

 Completion of these pilot studies will provide preliminary data to support an application for a full scale randomized controlled study.

 Potential for adaption is high because of alignment of retail outlets, kiosk providers, and consumers for health, wellness, and self-care.
