(fifthQuint)Determinants of the Long-Term Success of Bariatric Surgery.

 Currently, there is insufficient data to determine the persistence over time of the positive results of bariatric surgery on weight loss.

 Moreover, there is no consensus or criteria for choosing one surgical weight loss procedure over another.

 The best choice for one patient may not be the most appropriate for another.

 The results of this project will allow to better select obese patients likely to benefit from bariatric surgery, and to further personalise the management of severe obesity.

 Determinants of the Long-Term Success of Bariatric Surgery@highlight

The management of obesity is based on a multidisciplinary approach and justifies the use of surgery in patients with the most severe forms.

 Surgery for obesity or bariatric surgery generally allows rapid and significant weight loss however it is associated with significant risks, and its long-term results remain heterogeneous and unpredictable.

 Long-term data will clarify the role of different types of bariatric surgery in surgical strategy, improve patient information and identify predictors of failure in order to provide personalised and tailored surgery for each candidate .
