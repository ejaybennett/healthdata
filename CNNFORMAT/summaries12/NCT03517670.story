(thirdQuint)Safety of Intravenous Milrinone for the Treatment of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage-induced Vasospasm.

 The aim of this prospective observational study is to evaluate the hemodynamic tolerance of intravenous milrinone for the treatment of arterial vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.

 Intravenous milrinone is part of our standard care protocol for the management of cerebral vasospasm in association with nimodipine (intravenous or enteral route) and high arterial blood pressure (mean arterial pressure of 100-120 mmHg, spontaneously or induced by volume expansion and norepinephrine).

 All patients of our ICU who were diagnosed with cerebral arterial vasospasm during the few days following a subarachnoid hemorrhage will be included.

 Safety of Intravenous Milrinone for the Treatment of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage-induced Vasospasm@highlight

The aim of this study is to evaluate the tolerance of intravenous milrinone combined to the current standard treatment for cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.

 Assessment of IV milrinone safety in this setting is mandatory before the conduction of a large study assessing its effectiveness.
