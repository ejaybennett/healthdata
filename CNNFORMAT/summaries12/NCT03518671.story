 The investigators will complete a single-arm, phase II pilot study of time-limited CBT on BID in patients with surgically-treated HNC.

 Reliable, validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of BID will be collected before, 1 month and 3 months after the CBT intervention to provide preliminary data on the effectiveness of CBT for BID in patients with surgically-treated HNC, addressing this critical knowledge gap.

 It is expected that time-limited CBT implemented in the post-treatment period will decrease BID and improve QOL in affected patients.

This study will evaluate whether a time-limited cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention in the post-treatment time period can address body image disturbance (BID) in patients with surgically-treated head and neck cancer (HNC), thereby improving BID and quality of life (QOL).
