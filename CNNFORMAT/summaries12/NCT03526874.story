(fifthQuint)Occipital Blocks for Acute Migraine.

 There are two substantial hurdles that must be overcome in designing a trial to test the efficacy of PNBs: high placebo response rate and possible unblinding.

 In order to test the efficacy of this commonly used treatment for children and adolescents with difficult-to-treat headache, we need utilize a trial design which will address the high placebo response rate and the potential lack of blinding.

 About 58 children, recruited over a 3.

5 year period at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, will take part in this study.

 Participation will last about one month and involve one in-person study visit, and then completion of headache-related surveys, at home, for 28 days.

 Lidocaine cream lead-in will be used open-label for all subjects followed by double-blind randomized injections of active treatment (lidocaine) versus comparator (saline) in subjects who continue to have significant headache.

 To accomplish our secondary objectives, we will examine how expectation is affected by perceived treatment, and how expectations, measured in patients, parents, and providers, influence outcomes in pediatric and adolescent acute migraine.

 Occipital Blocks for Acute Migraine@highlight

Migraine affects 10-28% of children and adolescents and yet 20-30% of patients are ineffectively treated with current oral and nasal options.

 Peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs), injections of local anesthetics over branches of the occipital and/or trigeminal nerves, have been associated with possible benefit for pediatric headaches in case series, and may be useful for both acute and preventive treatment of migraine for children who fail less invasive treatments.

 In fact, 80% of pediatric headache specialists reported using peripheral nerve blocks and carry low risk of serious side effects; however, peripheral nerve blocks have never been tested, formally, in a randomized pediatric trial.

 By applying a novel design that utilizes lidocaine cream as a run-in step, investigators intend to test the efficacy of the most commonly used peripheral nerve block, the greater occipital nerve (GON) block, as an acute treatment for pediatric migraine and determine whether lidocaine cream leads to successful blinding of the injection.

 The GON block is expected to prove effective in decreasing the pain of migraine, with lidocaine being superior to saline and lidocaine cream maintaining blinding.
