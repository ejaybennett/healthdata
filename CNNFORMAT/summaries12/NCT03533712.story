(fifthQuint)Effect of a Fortified Balanced Energy-Protein Supplement on Birth Outcome in Hound District, Burkina Faso.

.

 Pregnancy remains a challenging period in the life of many women in low- and middle-income countries.

 Maternal mortality remains high and many newborns suffer from premature delivery and /or gestational growth retardation both in length and in weight accumulation.

 The 2016 WHO antenatal care guidelines stated that pregnant women in undernourished populations should receive fortified balanced energy-protein (BEP) supplements to reduce the risk of stillbirth and small-for-gestational-age birth.

 However, acceptable supplements and delivery channels must be determined for different contexts.

 The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a fortified BEP supplement for pregnant and lactating women to improve birth weight, fetal and infant growth.

 This research includes 3 phases: - Phase 1: Formative research to identify preferred product types of a fortified BEP supplement; - Phase 2: Formative research with an 8-week home-feeding trial to determine the acceptability of a fortified BEP supplement for longer-term consumption.

 - Phase 3: A community-based, individually randomized efficacy trial of the fortified BEP food supplement including 1,776 pregnant and lactating women aimed at testing 2 hypothesis: supplementing pregnant and lactating women with a fortified BEP supplement will improve fetal growth; improving fetal growth will have a positive effect on health and growth during infancy.

The 2016 WHO antenatal care guidelines stated that pregnant women in undernourished populations should receive fortified balanced energy-protein (BEP) supplements to reduce the risk of stillbirth and small-for-gestational-age birth.

 However, acceptable supplements and delivery channels must be determined for different contexts.

 The present proposal therefore will 1) perform a formative study to identify the most suitable (acceptability and utilization) BEP supplement for pregnant women in rural Burkina Faso (phase 1 and 2) and 2) evaluate the efficacy of this supplement to improve birth weight, fetal and infant growth (phase 3).

 The nutritional composition of the BEP supplement was established during an expert convening at the BMGF in September 2016.

 Private sector partners will prepare the supplements in the selected forms with the recommended nutrient composition.
