(thirdQuint)Expanded/Activated Gamma Delta T-cell Infusion Following Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide.

 Many patients with hematological malignancies require a bone marrow transplant for curative treatment.

 A matched sibling donor is optimal but may not be available.

 Therefore, a partially matched family member (haploidentical) may be a viable alternative.

 The incidence of graft vs.

 host disease, however, can become more of a significant, even fatal, factor with partial matches.

 T-cells have been shown to be the key player in the post-transplant immune phenomena.

 The majority of T-cells are composed of alpha beta T-cells with a small minority of gamma delta T-cells, which are known to have the unique ability to kill malignant cells without antigen recognition.

 This study proposes to extract, concentrate, and activate gamma delta T-cells from the peripheral blood to provide innate anti-tumor effect with minimal risk of GVHD.

 Safety and impact and/or the rate of GVHD will be evaluated.

Gamma delta T-cells are part of the innate immune system with the ability to recognize malignant cells and kill them.

 This study uses gamma delta T-cells to maximize the anti-tumor response and minimize graft versus host disease (GVHD) in leukemic and myelodysplastic patients who have had a partially mismatched bone marrow transplant (haploidentical).
