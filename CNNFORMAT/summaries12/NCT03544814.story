(fifthQuint)EGFR-TKI Combined With Synchronous or Sequential Chemotherapy for Patients of Gradual Progression.

 To investigate whether concurrent use of chemotherapy and EGFR-TKI can achieve better response than sequential use of EGFR-TKI and chemotherapy in advance EGFR-activating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who occurred gradual progression after first-line EGFR-TKI treatment and to investigate genetic alteration and peripheral blood immune cell phenotype change during the EGFR-TKI therapy.

 Patients who occurred gradual progression on first-line EGFR-TKI therapy were randomized into two groups: synchronous therapy group and sequential therapy group.

 Patients in synchronous therapy group were added pemetrexed plus cisplatin treatment along with continuation of EGFR-TKI after gradual progression.

 Patients in sequential therapy group continued receiving EGFR-TKI until investigator judged that continuation was adiaphorous, and then switched to pemetrexed plus cisplatin chemotherapy.

 We evaluated progression-free survival (PFS)-from gradual disease progression to the progression of chemotherapy or death.

 For sequential therapy group, PFS was PFS1(gradual progression to discontinue EGFR-TKI) plus PFS2(chemotherapy alone).

 Objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and safety were also evaluated.

 The primary endpoint was PFS-from gradual disease progression to the progression of chemotherapy or death.
