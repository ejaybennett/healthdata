(thirdQuint)Peri-Operative Ipilimumab+Nivolumab and Cryoablation Versus Standard Care in Women With Triple-negative Breast Cancer.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of peri-operative cryoablation, ipilimumab and nivolumab versus standard pre-operative care on 3-year Distant Disease-Free Survival (DDFS), in women with residual hormone receptor negative, HER2-negative ("triple negative") resectable breast cancer after taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

 Our strategy combines two interventions: first we induce activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T cells by cross-presentation of tumor antigens via local destruction of tumor tissue by cryoablation.

 Second, we administer ipilimumab, a CTLA4 blocking antibody that enhances the magnitude and potency of the tumor specific T cell response, with nivolumab, a PD-1 blocking antibody that interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell regulatory signaling.

 In this study, women with hormone receptor negative, HER2-negative ("triple negative") resectable breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be randomized to standard peri-operative management versus tumor cryoablation with peri-operative nivolumab and ipilimumab.

 Women undergoing either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery are eligible.
