(thirdQuint)A Prospective Trial to Assess Breast Cancer Survivors and Vaginal Atrophy Treatment Outcomes.

 Breast cancers that are hormone sensitive require estrogen suppression as a part of multimodal treatment.

 Estrogen suppression also reduces the likelihood of a breast cancer recurrence.

 Therefore, breast cancer survivors with estrogen sensitive tumors are placed on hormone suppression therapy with either selective estrogen receptor modulators like tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors like anastrazole.

 This therapy typically is administered for five years after a cancer diagnosis.

 Regardless of age or pre-existing menopausal status, the hormone suppression reduces estrogen levels and can either exacerbate existing menopausal symptoms or induce medical menopause in otherwise premenopausal women.

 This study will evaluate the patient's perspective of nonsurgical vulvovaginal rejuvenation (NVR) using the Viveve(R) device in breast cancer patients.

 A Prospective Trial to Assess Breast Cancer Survivors and Vaginal Atrophy Treatment Outcomes@highlight

The focus of this study is to assess breast cancer survivors perspectives of Viveve(R) Treatment using patient reported outcome tools with a focus on symptoms associated with vulvovaginal atrophy/genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM).

 This will be assessed by the FSFI, FSDS-R and DIVA questionnaires.
