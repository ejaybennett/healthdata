(secondQuint)Efficacy of a Web App With Multimedia Animations to Teach Therapeutic Exercise in Shoulder Pain.

 The web app will consist in 3D multimedia animations (video and audio) which the patient will be able to access from any device with internet connection (cell phone included).

 The trial will include patients with shoulder pain because of rotator cuff tendinopathy.

 We will carry on a pilot study with 100 patients randomly distributed into two groups, with a 6 months follow up.

 Both groups will perform the same treatment, but the control group wont use the exercise app.

 There will be four dependent variables: correct exercise performance, compliance degree, satisfaction with the treatment and expectations to improve with treatment.

 As secondary dependent variables we will analyze pain (at rest, with movement and at night), functional disability (SPADI questionnaire), and patients assessment of app video characteristics (usability, utility and satisfaction) and co-interventions.
