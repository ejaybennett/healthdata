(secondQuint)Randomized Phase 2, Dose-finding Efficacy, Safety Study of ANF-RHO Versus Neulasta in Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia.

 Forty Eight (48) adult female, chemotherapy treatment-naive, stage I to III, breast cancer patients scheduled to receive FEC100 (3 cycles)/docetaxel (3 cycles) myelosuppressive chemotherapy will be enrolled into the study after they meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

 Four (4) Cohorts of 12 patients each will be studied; they will be randomized either in the ANF-RHO cent treatment arm at different doses (10 1/2g/kg, 20 1/2g/kg, or 30 1/2g/kg, for the cohorts 1-3, respectively) or Neulasta(R) (6 mg / 0.

6 ml SC injection, for cohort 4).

 For the cohorts 1-3, 12 patients from each of the respective ANF-RHO cent cohorts will be randomized with four patients from cohort 4 (Neulasta(R)).

 Patients in the ANF-RHO cent cohorts will receive study drug on Day 1 of each Chemotherapy cycle.

 Patients in the Neulasta(R) cohort will receive study drug on Day 2 of each Chemotherapy cycle.

 Doses of ANF-RHO cent /Neulasta(R) will be provided for a total of 6 cycles (21 days each).

 The total duration of the study 129 2 days (126 Days of treatment period followed by end of study visit).

 Randomized Phase 2, Dose-finding Efficacy, Safety Study of ANF-RHO Versus Neulasta in Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia@highlight

Randomized, Open-Label study to determine the dose, efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic profile of ANF-RHO cent with once-per-cycle injection in comparison with Neulasta in Breast Cancer patients at high risk of developing Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia
