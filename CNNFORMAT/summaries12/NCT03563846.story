(fifthQuint)Effect of a Standard Meal on the Pharmacokinetic Profile of RP-G28 in Healthy Adult Male and Female Subjects.

 Subjects will participate in a screening visit (during the interval from Day -21 to Day -3) to determine eligibility for study participation.

 During this visit, subjects will provide informed consent and undergo screening assessments (inclusion/exclusion criteria evaluation, physical examination, triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram [ECG], vital signs, clinical laboratory testing, etc.

).

 Eligible subjects will be scheduled to return for baseline/check-in (Day -2 to Day -1), at which time they will be admitted to the clinical research unit and confined until 24 hours post dose in treatment period 2 (Day 4), following PK sample collection and any scheduled safety assessments.

 After meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, subject will be randomized (Day 1) in an open label, balanced fashion to 1 of 2 single-dose treatment sequences AB or BA, consisting of: treatment A, 15 g of RP-G28 administered in the fasted state; and treatment B, 15 g of RP G28 administered immediately following the consumption of a standard meal.

 Plasma samples will be collected at 24, 21, 18, and 12 hours and 30 minutes before dosing for an exploratory analysis to assess baseline levels of beta[1,4]-linked Gal-Gal-Glu and mono-, di- and tri-saccharides for one diurnal cycle prior to dosing.

 Treatment A will be orally administered with approximately 240 mL of water, following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours.

 No food will be allowed for at least 4 hours post dose.

 Water will be allowed ad libitum, except for 1 hour before and 1 hour after study drug administration.

 Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects randomized to treatment B will consume a standard meal, which must be consumed within the 30 minute pre dose interval.

 Treatment B will be orally administered, 30 minutes after the start of the meal, with approximately 240 mL of water.

 No food will be allowed for at least 4 hours post dose.

 With the exception of beverages served with themeal, water will be allowed ad libitum, except for 1 hour before and 1 hour after study drug administration.

 Blood samples for a diurnal baseline PK analysis will be collected at 24, 21, 18, and 12 hours before first dosing in period 1 only.

 Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected prior to study drug administration (pre-dose at 30 minutes before dosing) and at 0.

5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post dose in each treatment period.

 The pre-dose blood sample in period 1 will also be used as time 0 for the diurnal baseline assessment.

 A triplicate 12-lead ECG recording and measurement of vital signs will be conducted at baseline/check-in on Day -2 to Day 1, within 60 minutes pre dose and 2 hours post dose in each treatment period, and prior to discharge from the clinical research unit on Day 4.

 A physical exam will be performed, and blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory safety assessments at baseline/check-in on Day -2 to Day -1 and prior to discharge on Day 4.

 The 2 treatment periods will be separated by an in-house washout period of at least 48 hours (Day 1 to Day 3).

 A follow-up phone call will be conducted 7 to 10 days after the final dose of study drug (ie, during the interval, Day 10 to Day 13).

 Effect of a Standard Meal on the Pharmacokinetic Profile of RP-G28 in Healthy Adult Male and Female Subjects@highlight

This randomized, open-label, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover study is designed to evaluate the effect of a standard meal on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of orally administered RP-G28, which is being developed for the treatment of lactose intolerance.

 The study consists of a screening visit (during the interval from Day 21 to Day -3), baseline/check-in to the clinical research unit (Day -2 to Day -1), 2 treatment periods (Day 1 and Day 3), a 48-hour washout between doses, check-out from the clinical research unit (Day 4), and 1 follow-up phone call conducted 7 to 10 days after the final dose of the study drug (ie, during the interval from Day 10 to Day 13).

 The duration of subject study participation is approximately 5 weeks.
