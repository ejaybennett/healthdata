(secondQuint)Prediction of the Severity of Female SUI by Measuring New Static and Dynamic Ultrasound Parameters of the Urethra.

 The urinary incontinence is a disorder which affects 25 to 45% of women.

 Nowadays, the role of urethral tissue in IUD is not explored although well viewed in perineal ultrasound.

 Our actual knowledge demonstrates that urodynamic ultrasound is reliable to establish the bladder neck mobility.

 And the posterior urethral wall mobility was often associated to the stress urinary incontinence.

 Two elements appeared to indicate the elasticity of the urethral environment: functional length urethral variation and urethral closure angle variation during Valsalva manoeuvres compared to rest.

 This study aims to evaluate the correlation of the ultrasonic functional length of the urethra and the incontinence urinary disorder for the purpose to predict the severity of this syndrome.

 Prediction of the Severity of Female SUI by Measuring New Static and Dynamic Ultrasound Parameters of the Urethra@highlight

This study aims to evaluate the correlation of the ultrasonic functional length of the urethra and the incontinence urinary disorder (IUD).

 The goal is to predict the severity of the IU by measuring new static and dynamic ultrasound parameters of the urethra.
