(thirdQuint)Intratumoral Tavo and Pembro in Patients With Inoperable Locally Advanced or Metastatic TNBC.

 The study will be comprised of a Core study (27 weeks), an Extension Phase and a long-term follow-up.

 Core Study: Eligible patients will be treated with intratumoral tavo-EP to the accessible lesions on Days 1, 5 and 8 every 6 weeks and with IV pembrolizumab (200 mg) on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for 24 weeks.

 As many accessible lesions, may be treated, as deemed feasible by the treating physician.

 Extension Phase: Patients who completed 27 weeks of treatment (Core study) with the investigators discretion, will enter an Extension phase and continue to receive the combined treatment of intratumoral tavo-EP and pembrolizumab for up to 35 cycles of pembrolizumab from baseline (approximately 2 years) or until subsequent disease progression.
