(fifthQuint)Sustainable Early Episode Clinic Study.

 This is a 24-month open label, quasi-experimental study of adult patients with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder within five years of diagnosis.

 Caregivers who are eligible may participate.

 At the conclusion of the study, the patients enrolled will continue to utilize the Care4Today Connect application platform for a maximum of 3 months.

 Sharp will make referrals during this time for follow up psychiatric care in the community for patients (at the minimum) referral to a psychiatrist for ongoing medication management and clubhouses for continued support.

 Additionally, patients will be provided with contact information for the Access and Crisis Line.

 If clinically indicated, patients can be given referrals to psychotherapists for individual therapy, specialized support groups, day treatment programs, and/or resources for continued vocational/educational support.

 Caregivers will also be provided with resources in the community for ongoing family support (e.

g.

 NAMI).

 Subjects will be recruited from outpatient and inpatient psychiatric treatment programs at Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital and from community mental health providers in San Diego, California.

 Patients and caregivers will be enrolled in the study if they meet inclusion criteria and after meeting with site personnel, agree to study requirements and sign the informed consent form.

 Program Phases and Structure of the SEEC: Phase I During Phase I (the "Education" Phase), the focus of treatment is on engagement, assessment, and psycho-education for both the patient and their caregiver.

 The goal of this phase is to develop hope of recovery for the future.

 This initial phase will last 8 weeks.

 Elements of Service and Frequency Initial assessment with patient and caregiver - This is the initial contact with the patient and their caregiver to screen for inclusion, obtain informed consent, complete assessments, and begin to identify goals for treatment.

 Care4today Psycho-education group and Care4today Connect Goal Setting group - Groups will be delivered over a 3 hour block, 1 time a week for 8 weeks total.

 Care4today Psycho-education modules will be used to provide foundational knowledge to patients about schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

 The Care4today Connect app will be the primary focus of goal setting groups.

 - Medication management - (available up to 2 times per month as needed) Patients will visit with the SEEC psychiatrist and registered nurse on group days up to 2 times per month for medication monitoring and/or review, , to receive injections, and for primary care coordination.

 - Multi-family group psycho-education and Support group (2 hour block every 2 weeks a total of 4 sessions) - Caregivers participate in these groups together.

 Participants will not attend these groups with their caregivers.

 The groups will be topic oriented and be focused on education and support.

 This is an opportunity for families to share and support each other.

 Ability to monitor patients' goals and progress using Care4today Connect will be taught and encouraged.

 - Family Therapy/Recovery Plan meeting (1 hour, 1 time per month) - Patient and participating caregivers will meet 1 time per month with the primary therapist to discuss recovery/treatment goals, review progress, identify barriers and strengths, and identify ways family can help to support the patient.

 Care4today Connect use and progress will also be reviewed.

 During these sessions, goals and responsibilities for the next month will be decided and agreed upon by all parties.

 Individual Case Management Session (1 hour, 1 time per month) - Patient will meet with their primary therapist to review progress toward treatment goals, identify stressors, discuss coping strategies, and review use of Care4today Connect tracking reports.

 Assessments will also be conducted during these sessions.

 Phase II Patients will move to Phase II (the "Empowerment/Action" phase) following completion of Phase I.

 During this phase, the focus is on psychotherapy, case management, and including the family in supporting the patient's recovery/treatment plan.

 This is the action phase of treatment and is anticipated to last 6-10 months based on individual progress.

 During this phase, the goals are to increase resiliency, self-responsibility, connections to community, socialization, and to develop meaningful roles for the future.

 The family remains an important piece of the recovery team and learns to support and monitor their loved ones effectively.

 Participants remain in this phase until the recovery team (psychotherapist/case manager, psychiatric rehabilitation specialist, peer support specialist, psychiatrist, registered nurse, and caregiver) and the patient agree that supports and psychiatric stability have been sufficiently established to move toward the greater independence offered at Phase III.

 Elements of Service and Frequency Recovery group/CBT-p group therapy/Care4today Connect Goal setting group - Groups will be delivered over a 3 hour block, every 2 weeks, on an ongoing basis.

 Medication Management - Medication will be managed the same as in Phase I.

 Individual Case Management Session - Case management sessions will be provided the same as in Phase I.

 Individual Specialty Support Services - Patients can receive 1:1 supportive services in the area of supported employment/education services, community integration, peer support, or individual psychotherapy on an as needed basis.

 Family Therapy/Recovery Plan Meeting - Family therapy will be provided the same as in Phase I.

 Multi-family Support group - This group will be a process group focused on providing support to caregivers.

 This group is optional for caregivers in Phases II and III.

 Phase III (the "Recovery and Maintenance" phase) provides minimal intervention but ongoing support/evaluation for the patient and their caregiver with flexibility for an easy transition back to Phase II as needed to prevent relapse.

 It is expected that at this phase, patients have demonstrated an ability to manage their symptoms and they are actively engaged in regularly scheduled activities in the community such as employment, school, volunteer work, etc.

 Patients and caregivers in this phase are choosing to take on increased responsibility for their recovery journey and less dependence on the mental health system.

 Elements of Service and Frequency - Recovery group - Recovery group will be focused on celebrating recovery successes and management of symptoms as well as providing support to overcome current challenges.

 Opportunities to reconnect with former peers are provided and ongoing support from peers will be encouraged.

 Upcoming resources and events in the community will be shared.

 This group will be delivered over a 1 hour block, 1x month, on an ongoing basis.

 - Medication Management - Medication management may be reduced to 1x every 3 months or as frequent as needed (e.

g.

 Long Acting Anti-psychotics LAT) - Remote check-In with caregiver over telephone - This 1x month telephone call to caregivers by the primary psychotherapist will be for the purpose of maintaining contact, getting updates on patient's progress, and providing continued support.

 Family Therapy Sessions can be requested and recommended in this phase if the need arises to determine whether a participant's return to Phase II might be necessary for increased support.

 - Individual Case Management sessions - Case management sessions will be provided the same as in Phases I and II.

 - Multi-family Support group - This group will be a process group focused on providing support to caregivers.

 This group is optional for caregivers in Phases II and III.

 Care4today Connect Mobile App Care4Today Connect is a mobile smartphone app that enables people to receive reminders to take medication, perform actions related to wellness goals and track completion of these tasks.

 In addition, the app offers 1-3 minute opportunities for learning about a variety of wellness topics through informational articles covering areas such as exercise, nutrition, quitting smoking, managing medical illnesses (e.

g.

 diabetes), drugs and alcohol use, etc.

 The app is designed to be supportive by inspiring use through friendly coaching language rather than lecturing.

 An overarching goal is chosen by the patient as well as their reasons for wanting to achieve this goal ("I want to lose weight so I can improve my overall health") as a driving motivator to complete daily tasks.

 App users are able to view their daily progress on task completion as well as their overall progress for the week or month on their phone via a dashboard.

 Caregivers and healthcare providers can also be granted access to view the patient's dashboard, providing opportunities for increased support and intervention.

 The app can be used to support a patient's treatment plan as patients and their healthcare providers can set a long-term wellness goal for the patient together, select appropriate short-term tasks to support this long-term goal, review incremental progress, and make adjustments to settings as progress is made.

 The Care4today Connect dashboard can also be used as a tool to facilitate discussion between patient and provider/caregiver around barriers to achieving goals.

 Care4today Connect will be introduced to patients and reinforced during Care4today Connect Goal Setting groups in Phases I and II.

 Care4today Connect will be used to support many of SEEC program interventions, including case management, medication management, group psychotherapy, group psycho-education, individual psychotherapy, and family psychotherapy.

 IPad The Care4today psycho-education films are loaded onto an iPad which is then linked to a television for viewing.

 Group leaders are able to control the delivery of each section within a module with ease to accommodate for questions, group discussion, workbook exercises, and further explanation.

 Other Data Collected Additional patient-related data that will be collected includes the following: - Date of birth - Age - Sex - Diagnosis - Age at diagnosis - Medications (LAT vs Oral) - Insurance provider - Overall healthcare utilization - Caregiver involvement (Yes vs No) - Living situation - Employment/educational status Program related data that will be collected includes the following: - Source of referral to program - Dates of interactions with program and staff - Attendance at sessions will be documented for each subject - Unscheduled visits with staff - Frequency of use of individual services - Attrition rates and reasons for early exit from program - Graduation dates from each phase - Usage rates (clicks, access) and preferences of the Care4today Connect app - Time in Phase II for each subject - Need for return to Phase II from Phase III - Time spent in return to Phase II Institutional data collected includes the following: - Resource use in deploying program - Healthcare provider satisfaction with program - Ongoing input from patients, caregivers, and staff for program improvement and modification Data Analysis Methods cent Subject Information Descriptive statistics of mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be summarized for numerical variables of age, age at diagnosis and usage rates of technology solutions including mobile components for health insurance claims data and SEEC patients.

 The number and percentage of subjects in the categories of the categorical variables gender, diagnosis, etc.

, will be summarized for health insurance claims data and SEEC patients.

 - Significance Level All statistical tests will be 2-sided with a significance level of 5% unless specified otherwise.

 - Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint of this study is the rate of high intensity service utilization (count per unit of time).

 Assuming that high intensity service utilization count follows Poisson distribution, then the rate (count per unit of time) will be compared between health insurance claims data and SEEC patients.

 cent Secondary Endpoints The secondary endpoints are: - Overall healthcare utilization rate (count per unit of time) - High intensity service utilization count at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months - Overall healthcare utilization count at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months - Changes from baseline of CRDPSS, CGI-S/CGI-I, Quality of Life Scale QLS, and PSP scales at 6 months after admission, graduation from Phase II, and every 6 months after graduation from Phase II - Changes from baseline of PFBS at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months - Changes from baseline of patient/caregiver satisfaction at 6 months, graduation from Phase II and every 6 months after graduation from Phase II Assuming that overall health care utilization count follows Poisson distribution, then the rate (count per unit of time) will be compared between health insurance claims data and SEEC patients.

 Average high intensity service utilization count and average overall health care utilization count at each measured time point will be separately compared between health insurance claims data and SEEC patients.

 Descriptive statistics of mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be summarized for the changes from baseline of all the total scores of scales CRDPSS, CGI-S/CGI-I, QLS, PFBS, PSP and patient/caregiver satisfaction at each measured time point.

 - Sample Size Determination The sample size estimation for this study was based on the significance level of 0.

05 (2-sided), power, allocation rate between subjects who receive SEEC intervention and subjects from health insurance claims data, the ratio of high intensity service utilization in SEEC patients over that in health insurance claims data, and follow-up time.

 - Interim analysis plan - Data may be analyzed after 12 months of SEEC intervention SUBJECT COMPLETION AND WITHDRAWAL All patients enrolled in the study will be completed at the end of the 24 month study period.

 Based on continuous enrollment the patient's duration of SEEC intervention will vary.

 Study participants (patient and caregiver/s) have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without affecting their ability to obtain care in the future at the study site.

 No additional data will be collected once a participant withdraws consent except to document the date and reason for withdrawal, if known.

 Participant data collected prior to the date on which a participant withdraws consent, however, may be included in the data analysis.

 Participants who withdraw their consent before completing baseline assessments will not be included in any data analysis and will be replaced.

 Participants who have not withdrawn consent will be considered withdrawn and will not be replaced if they miss more than one follow-up assessment after baseline assessments have been completed.

 Patients who die for any reason during the course of the study will be considered withdrawn as of the date of death and this will be reported as a serious adverse event.

 Patients who meet the diagnostic inclusion criteria (schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) at the time of enrollment in the study may be withdrawn if their diagnosis changes during the study period.

 A participant may also be withdrawn if it is deemed appropriate or necessary in the opinion of the treatment team.

 If a participant is lost to follow up, every reasonable effort must be made by the study site personnel to contact the subject and determine the reason for discontinuation/withdrawal.

 The measures taken to follow up will be documented.

 Caregivers who withdraw or are lost to follow up will not be replaced but the patient will continue to be enrolled.

 If a patient withdraws from the study or is lost to follow up, both the patient and the caregiver will be withdrawn from the study and not replaced.

 RISKS AND BENEFITS It is possible that a patient may be referred to the SEEC program who would have obtained greater benefit in the prevention of relapse from an alternate outpatient program with more intensive support There is also a risk of loss of confidentiality.

 Inherent in any study involving medication, there are also risks related to medication prescription, administration and management.

 Patient Monitoring Throughout the program, patients will have regular contact with study personnel via individual, family and group interventions and will be monitored remotely via Care4today Connect mobile technology.

 The Principal Investigator (Dr.

 Michael Plopper) will have overall oversight of study activities.

 The study psychiatrist and study personnel will provide clinical oversight over enrolled patients.

 If at any time, patients demonstrate that they need a higher level of care with more intensive support, they will be referred to that level of care (e.

g.

 Partial Hospitalization Program PHP or Intensive Outpatient Program IOP).

 Patients will be readmitted to the program following any hospitalization, PHP or IOP treatment.

 Data Handling and Record Keeping The principal investigator is responsible to ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.

 All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.

 Data Management and Responsibilities Data collection is the responsibility of the study personnel at the site under the supervision of the site principal investigator.

 During the study, the investigator must maintain complete and accurate documentation for the study.

 Access to source documents will be restricted to study personnel only.

 Clinical documentation captured via electronic medical record (Cerner) will be password protected and viewed only by study personnel.

 Any paper materials or records will be stored on secure premises in locked cabinets when not directly in the custody of study personnel.

 All data will be de-identified prior to transfer to sponsor in order to maintain subject confidentiality.

 All study analyses will be conducted using de-identified data.

 Adverse Events and Reporting Timely, accurate and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical studies are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide.

 All studies conducted by the sponsor and its affiliates will be conducted in accordance with established procedures and regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safety information.

 It is the responsibility to the principal investigator to assess events that occur during the course of a research protocol.

 Unanticipated problems or events whose nature, severity and frequency are not described in the information provided to the IRB or to the subjects must be submitted to the IRB for consideration if they involve risk to the participants and are related to either a research intervention or interaction or to the conduct of the study in general.

 Examples include, but are not limited to: subject experiences, new scientific findings, unexpected complications, missteps in study procedure, or in consent documentation, or breaches of confidentiality.

 An adverse event is an effect that occurs during the course of the research that either causes physical or psychological harm or increases the risk of such harm or results in a loss of privacy or confidentiality to a research participant.

 .

 This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition.

 The IRB must determine with the help of the PI if such events are anticipated or unanticipated, or also if there are serious and related to the research.

 Adverse event collection starts with the signing of the informed consent form.

 A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that: - Results in death - Is life-threatening - Results in persistent or significant disability or capacity Unanticipated problems and adverse events will be reported to the IRB on an Unanticipated Problem or Event Report (HRP-214).

 FDA regulations require that if a physician or health care provider receives or otherwise becomes aware of information, from any source, that reasonably suggests that a HUD has or may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury of a patient, the physician or health care provider must report such findings to the FDA as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days after the physician first learns of the effect or problem.

 Potential Benefits of Study Participation Potential benefits of participation in the study may include reduction in symptoms, reduced relapse, reduced need for hospitalization, improved family relationships, reduced caregiver burden, improved social and educational/vocational functioning, improved illness self-management strategies including medication management, and improved quality of life.

 Sustainable Early Episode Clinic Study@highlight

Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness and one of the leading causes of long-term disability in the world.

 It is characterized by psychotic symptoms, social withdrawal, apathy, cognitive impairments and problems with social and occupational functioning.

 The first five years of psychotic symptoms is known as the "critical period", associated with high risk for relapse, re-hospitalizations, and suicide.

 While early episode clinics are becoming more prevalent, they have not become sustainable, most rely on funding by time-limited grants.

 Recognizing the need for improved treatment, Janssen Research & Development and Sharp Healthcare collaborated to design and validate a sustainable early episode clinic model.

 The goal of the model is to provide early intense intervention, with an ongoing maintenance phase, resulting in improved patient outcomes.

 It is hypothesized patients enrolled in "SEEC" will have fewer relapses compared to patients in "usual care.

" The primary endpoint for this study will be the difference in high intensity resource utilization between SEEC patients and patients who receive "usual care.
