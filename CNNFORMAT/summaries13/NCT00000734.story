(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Interaction Between High Dose Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim and Zidovudine.

 AZT has been effective in treating HIV infection in some patients with AIDS, and SMX/TMP is an antibiotic combination which is useful in preventing or treating Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).

 It is important to know how drugs interact in patients because addition of a second drug may change the speed at which a drug is eliminated from the body, and cause increased toxic effects or decreased therapeutic effects.

 Patients with HIV infection take AZT every 4 hours and/or SMX/TMP every 8 hours by mouth for 4 days as outpatients and then come into the clinical research center for 2 days of studies.

 On day 5 the final dose of medicine is given orally SMX/TMP or by intravenous infusion (AZT).

 Blood samples are drawn 10-20 times over a period of 12 hours and urine is collected for 36 hours.

 Concentrations of the drugs in the blood and urine samples are determined.

 This sequence is repeated twice, so that each patient takes AZT alone, SMX/TMP alone, and the combination of AZT and SMX/TMP over a period of about 3 weeks.

 Patients may be included in the study if they are asymptomatic, or have been diagnosed with ARC or AIDS, but not if they have PCP or any other severe opportunistic infection.

 Evaluation of the Interaction Between High Dose Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim and Zidovudine@highlight

To determine if the pharmacokinetics of high doses of zidovudine (AZT) (that is, how fast AZT reaches the blood, what concentration of AZT is attained in the blood, and how long AZT remains in the blood) changes from day to day in the same patient.

 Also to determine whether the pharmacokinetics of AZT is changed when trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SMX/TMP) is given at the same time, or whether the pharmacokinetics of SMX/TMP is altered by AZT given at the same time.
