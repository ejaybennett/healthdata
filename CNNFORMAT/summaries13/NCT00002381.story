(fifthQuint)The Safety and Effectiveness of Nevirapine Plus Nelfinavir in HIV-1 Infected Patients Who Have Taken Stavudine.

 The trial is an open-label study in patients with HIV-1 infection who are naive to treatment with NNRTI and protease inhibitor classes of antiretroviral drugs and have <= 6 months prior exposure to d4T at the time of screening.

 Part I of this trial is an investigation of potential pharmacokinetic interaction between nevirapine and nelfinavir in HIV-1-infected adults treated with d4T.

 Part II is an investigation of the long-term antiviral activity of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir on viral load as measured by HIV-1 RNA.

 The Safety and Effectiveness of Nevirapine Plus Nelfinavir in HIV-1 Infected Patients Who Have Taken Stavudine@highlight

To determine the potential effects of 28 days of nevirapine treatment on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir and of stavudine (d4T), and to further evaluate the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine in combination with nelfinavir, and d4T compared to the historical controls treated with nevirapine but without nelfinavir or d4T.

 To determine the efficacy of long-term combination therapy of nevirapine, nelfinavir and d4T on viral load in patients who are non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and protease inhibitor naive, and have <= 6 months prior d4T exposure at the time of screening.
