(thirdQuint)SWOG-9208 Quality of Life and Health Status in Patients With Stage I or Stage II Hodgkin's Disease.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate prospectively the health status and quality of life of patients with Stage I/IIA Hodgkin's disease randomized on protocol SWOG-9133 (CLB-9391) to treatment with subtotal nodal irradiation with vs.

 without 3 courses of doxorubicin/vinblastine.

 II.

 Describe the short-term effects of these treatments on these patients and compare their impact on quality of life (i.

e.

, patient symptom status, health status, fatigue).

 III.

 Evaluate the intermediate and long-term effects of these treatments on these patients and compare their impact on quality-of-life outcomes over 5 years.

 OUTLINE: Quality-of-Life Assessment.

 Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System Short Form, CARES-SF; Symptom and Personal Information Questionnaire (including Symptom Distress Scale, MOS SF-36 Fatigue Scale, MOS SF-36 Health Perception Rating, Demographics); Cover Sheet.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 500 patients will be accrued over 7 years.
