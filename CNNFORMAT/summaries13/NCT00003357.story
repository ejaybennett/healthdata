(secondQuint)Vaccine Therapy Plus QS21 in Treating Women With Breast Cancer Who Have No Evidence of Disease.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine whether immunization with GM2-KLH vaccine plus the immunological adjuvant QS21 induces an antibody response against GM2 and cells expressing GM2 in disease free patients at high risk for recurrence of breast cancer.

 OUTLINE: GM2-KLH vaccine plus QS21 is administered subcutaneously to sites on the upper arm and upper leg at weekly intervals for 4 weeks.

 Two additional vaccines are administered at weeks 12 and 24.

 Patients are followed every 3 months after the sixth vaccination.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
