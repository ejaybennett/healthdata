(thirdQuint)Eflornithine in Treating Patients With Bladder Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine whether treatment with eflornithine is effective in preventing recurrence of tumor after transurethral resection in patients with low grade, superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

 II.

 Determine the incidence and severity of toxicities associated with the long-term use of this drug in this patient population.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to disease status (newly diagnosed vs recurrent), clinical stage (Ta vs T1), grade (G1 vs G2), and focus (multifocal vs unifocal).

 Patients receive either oral eflornithine or placebo once daily.

 Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 3 months during the first 2 years, every 6 months for the third year, and then annually for the fourth year.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 450 patients (225 per arm) will be accrued to this study within 1.

5 years.

 Eflornithine in Treating Patients With Bladder Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 It is not yet known if eflornithine is more effective than no further therapy in treating bladder cancer.

 PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of eflornithine in treating patients who have newly diagnosed or recurrent bladder cancer.
