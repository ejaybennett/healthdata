(secondQuint)Morphine Gel for Bedsores.

 In this study, we will apply a morphine-containing gel (or placebo) directly onto painful pressure ulcers.

 We will take participants off of any opioid-containing medications upon entry into the study.

 This allows us to measure any morphine that may enter into the bloodstream from the topically applied gel.

 The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of the gel for pressure ulcer analgesia, as well as the systemic absorption of morphine from the topically applied gel.

 We will document the amount of pain medications taken by participants to determine whether the gel decreases the need for these drugs.
