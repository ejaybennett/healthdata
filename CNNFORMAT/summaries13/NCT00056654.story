(secondQuint)Study of a 6-Month Sustained-Release Formulation of Leuprolide Acetate in Prostate Cancer.

 The primary purpose of the study is to determine if a new sustained-release 45 mg (depot) formulation of leuprolide acetate administered once every 26 weeks for 1 year, will lower testosterone levels to and maintain them at medically castrate levels in subjects with prostatic adenocarcinoma.

 This study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of the 45 mg formulation and assess the safety of this formulation.
