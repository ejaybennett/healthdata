(secondQuint)Ixabepilone in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the objective overall response rate of patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with BMS-247550 (ixabepilone).

 II.

 Determine the safety and toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 III.

 Determine the duration of response, overall survival, and time to progression in patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

 Patients receive ixabepilone intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or if the patient becomes a candidate for stem cell transplantation.

 Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression.

 Ixabepilone in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@highlight

This phase II trial is studying how well ixabepilone works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
