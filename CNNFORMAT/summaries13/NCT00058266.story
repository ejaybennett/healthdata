(secondQuint)Genistein in Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Who Are Planning to Undergo Radical Prostatectomy.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity of genistein in patients with localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.

 - Determine the decrease, if any, of prostate-specific antigen-positive cells in the operative field of patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive 1 of 2 treatment regimens.

 - Group A: Patients receive oral genistein once daily for 1-2 months, undergo radical prostatectomy, and then continue oral genistein once daily for 1-2 months afterward (for a total of 3 months of therapy).

 - Group B: Patients undergo radical prostatectomy.

 Beginning 1 month after surgery, patients receive genistein as in arm I for 3 months.

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 1 and 3 months after surgery.

 Patients are followed every 3 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 88 patients (44 patients per treatment group) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

RATIONALE: Genistein may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of genistein in treating patients with localized prostate cancer who are planning to undergo radical prostatectomy.
