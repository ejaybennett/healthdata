(thirdQuint)Study of SGN-30 (Antibody) in Patients With Refractory or Recurrent Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma.

 SGN-30 is the chimeric form of a novel murine monoclonal antibody (mAb), AC-10, that has specificity for CD30.

 The CD30 antigen has a very low expression on normal cells, but is expressed on malignant cells in Hodgkins disease and anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

 This study is designed to define the toxicity profile and antitumor activity of SGN-30 in patients with refractory or recurrent Hodgkin's disease and with refractory or recurrent anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

 Patients will receive 6 weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of SGN-30 followed by a 4 week observation period.

 Study of SGN-30 (Antibody) in Patients With Refractory or Recurrent Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma@highlight

To investigate safety and antitumor activity of SGN-30 in patients with Hodgkin's Disease and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).

 As of March 22, 2005, interim analysis of the Hodgkin's Disease (HD) arm has been completed per the statistical plan in the protocol.

 SG030-0003 is now closed to further recruitment of HD patients.
