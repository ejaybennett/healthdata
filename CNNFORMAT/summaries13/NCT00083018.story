(thirdQuint)Nipple Aspiration, Ductal Lavage, and Duct Endoscopy For Diagnostic Assessment in Women Undergoing Surgery for Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Correlate the cell yield and morphology findings from ductal lavage with duct endoscopy findings and surgical pathology findings in women with breast cancer.

 - Determine the sensitivity and specificity of nipple aspiration, ductal lavage, and duct endoscopy in detecting established breast cancer in these patients.

 Secondary - Compare the intraduct environment of cancer-involved ducts in the affected breast vs the ductal systems in the contralateral breast of these patients.

 - Perform immunohistochemical analysis (including estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2-neu receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, p53, and proliferation marker expression) for markers potentially associated with breast cancer in these patients.

 - Determine potential molecular markers of malignancy by gene methylation, gene expression, and proteomics in these patients.

 - Compare the biochemistry and protein analysis of the intraductal fluid vs serum analysis in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo nipple aspiration, ductal lavage, and duct endoscopy under general anesthesia immediately before breast surgery.

 Fluid and tissue obtained are examined for tumor markers by immunohistochemistry.

 Candidate genes are analyzed by gene methylation, gene expression arrays, and proteomic profiling.

 Patients are followed at 24 hours and at 1 week.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.

 Nipple Aspiration, Ductal Lavage, and Duct Endoscopy For Diagnostic Assessment in Women Undergoing Surgery for Breast Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as nipple aspiration, ductal lavage, and breast duct endoscopy, may help doctors detect and assess breast cancer cells early and plan more effective treatment.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well nipple aspiration, ductal lavage, and duct endoscopy work in assessing cancer cells in women who are undergoing surgery for breast cancer.
