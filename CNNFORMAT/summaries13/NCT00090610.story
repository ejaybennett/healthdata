(firstQuint)Second-Line Treatment for Patients With Platinum-Sensitive Ovarian Cancer.

 Primary Objective The primary objective of the study is to compare the progression-free survival of two treatment regimens: Taxotere(R) 30 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8, combined with carboplatin AUC 6 IV on Day 1, repeated every 21 days for 6 cycles or until disease progression.

 (A patient who has completed 6 cycles of treatment and who has achieved a partial response or stable disease may either continue or stop treatment at the investigator's discretion.

) Versus Taxotere(R) 30 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8, repeated every 21 days up to 6 cycles or until disease progression.

 Followed by carboplatin (AUC 6) IV every 21 days if the patient does not achieve a complete response or has disease progression on Taxotere(R).

 A patient who has achieved a complete response on Taxotere(R) will be followed until the subsequent recurrence at which time she will then receive single-agent carboplatin.

 Carboplatin treatment will be discontinued if the patient has completed 6 cycles of treatment and has achieved a complete response or has disease progression.

 (A patient who has completed 6 cycles of carboplatin treatment and who has achieved a partial response or stable disease may either continue or stop treatment at the investigator's discretion.

) Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of the study are to compare the objective response rates (defined as a complete response plus partial response), duration of tumor response, median survival, QOL and safety in patients treated with the two regimens described above.
