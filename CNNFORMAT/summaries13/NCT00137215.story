(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Silverlon Dressing for Autogenous Skin Donor Sites.

 At the time of the procedure, donor sites that are symmetrical in size and shape will be selected.

 Once the grafts have been harvested, the wounds will be randomized for treatment using either the Silverlon dressing or Xeroform.

 The wound dressings will then be observed at least once a day beginning 72 hours after surgery until healed, defined as 90% or more of the wound surface being confluently re-epithelized.

 Evaluation of Silverlon Dressing for Autogenous Skin Donor Sites@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare one type of dressing against the current standard dressing that is used to cover an unburned area of the skin where a piece of skin is removed to cover another part of the body that was burned.

 Hypothesis: The mean healing time for wounds treated with the Silverlon Dressing will be less than the mean healing time for wounds treated with Xeroform Dressing.
