(firstQuint)Trial to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of a Single Bolus of TNK-tPA (Tenecteplase, Metalyse) With Accelerated Infusion of Rt-PA (Alteplase, Actilyse) in Asian Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction.

 This was a randomized (1:1), open-label, multi-center, active-control, parallel-group study to compare the efficacy and safety of TNK-tPA (tenecteplase, Metalyse(R)) with that of accelerated rt-PA (alteplase, Actilyse(R)) in Asian patients with AMI.

 The primary endpoint (TIMI 3 Flow) and the secondary endpoint (TIMI frame count) were evaluated in a blinded manner in the core laboratory.

 Patients eligible for the trial who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria and who gave their informed consent were randomized to one of two treatment groups (i.

e.

 TNK-tPA or accelerated rt-PA).

 The study period totaled 30-37 days and included baseline, randomisation, study drug administration, in-hospital follow-up and thirty-day follow-up.

 Coronary angiography was performed at 90 minutes after the start of study drug administration.

 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained before randomization, between 60 to 75 minutes and 180 15 minutes after the start of study drug administration, and at hospital discharge.

 If the patient showed rapid and progressive hemodynamic deterioration before 90 minutes, rescue PTCA or other appropriate interventions should be performed at the discretion of the treating physician.

 Following the analysis of TIMI flow and frame count at each study center, the results were carefully recorded on the CRFs.

 This data was stored on a compact disk or a film and labeled with the subject's study I.

D.

 number.

 It was then sent with the summary worksheets and ECGs to the Angiographic Core Laboratory located at the Leuven Coordinating Center (LCC) of the University Hospital Gasthuisberg (Leuven, Belgium) for central evaluations.

 Study Hypothesis: The null hypothesis tested was that there was no difference between the two treatment groups: TNK-tPA (Tenecteplase, Metalyse(R)) and accelerated rt-PA (Actilyse(R)), against the alternative that there was a difference.

 Comparison(s): The primary endpoint of the study was TIMI 3 flow at 90 minutes after start of thrombolytic therapy, angiograms were evaluated in a blinded manner in a core laboratory.

The objective of this trial was to compare the efficacy and safety of a single bolus of TNK-tPA (tenecteplase, Metalyse(R)) compared with rt-PA (alteplase, Actilyse(R)) in Asian patients.
