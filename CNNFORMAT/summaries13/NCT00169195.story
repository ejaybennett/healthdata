(secondQuint)Rituximab, Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin (R-GEMOX) for Refractory/Relapsed B-cell Lymphoma.

 This is a multicentric, open-label, non-randomized clinical study, evaluating the efficacy and the safety of R-GEMOX in refractory/relapsed patients aged from 18 to 75 years with CD20-positive large B-cell lymphoma non eligible for autologous transplantation.

 It is anticipated that 50 subjects will be enrolled over 4 years (from April 2003/January 2007), but inclusion could stop earlier according to the analysis performed every 5 patients (based on triangular test).

 The duration of the treatment period is approximately 16 weeks and patients are followed until death.

 The total duration of the study is expected to be 3 years.
