(thirdQuint)NAOMI: A Study to Compare Medically-prescribed Heroin With Oral Methadone in Chronic Opiate Addiction.

 This is a two-centre (Vancouver, Montreal) RCT involving a total of 235 volunteers.

 Eligible participants will be randomized to injectable heroin combined with oral methadone as desired (45%) versus oral methadone alone (45%).

 A subset of 10% will be randomized to injectable hydromorphone (Dilaudid cent ).

 Hydromorphone and heroin will be given in a double-blind fashion; the purpose is to permit validation of reported illicit use of heroin through urine testing in the hydromorphone group.

 Research visits will be conducted quarterly and will occur independently of treatment clinic visits.

 Incentives will be used to maintain research follow-up whether or not the subject is retained in treatment.

 The analysis will be under intent-to-treat.

 The primary outcomes of interest are 1) recruitment and retention in the study and 2) illicit drug use and criminal behavior (as determined by the Europ-ASI) at 12 months.

 Secondary outcomes are measures of social function (e.

g.

, social integration and functioning, quality of life) and cost-benefit/effectiveness of the interventions.

 NAOMI: A Study to Compare Medically-prescribed Heroin With Oral Methadone in Chronic Opiate Addiction@highlight

The objective of this study is to determine whether the closely supervised provision of injectable, pharmaceutical-grade heroin (in combination with oral methadone) is more effective than methadone therapy alone in recruiting, retaining, and benefiting long-term heroin users who have not been helped by current standard treatment options.
