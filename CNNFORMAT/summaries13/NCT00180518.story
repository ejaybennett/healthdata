(fifthQuint)ACCULINK for Revascularization of Carotids in High Risk Patients "The ARCHeR Trial".

 The purpose of the study is to demonstrate equivalence in the safety and performance of the RX ACCUNET when used with the RX ACCULINK, to that of the ACCULINK and ACCUNET devices, in the treatment of high risk surgical patients and patients with anatomical risks who require treatment for carotid artery disease.

 Patients in ARCHeR RX will be followed after the index procedure at one, six and 12 months.

 Equivalence in safety will be demonstrated by comparing 30-day rates of DSMI for ARCHeR Amendment 2 and ARCHeR RX.

 Secondary analyses will be performed on the rate of ipsilateral stroke between 31 days and 12 months, target lesion revascularization at six and 12 months, acute device success for the RX ACCULINK and RX ACCUNET Systems, clinical success, and access site complications requiring treatment.

 Additionally, the stented segment will be evaluated by carotid duplex ultrasound at six and 12 months.

 Serious adverse events (SAE) of death or ipsilateral stroke that occur anytime during the follow-up period will be identified and reported, and will be adjudicated if indicated.
