(fifthQuint)Phase II Study of Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) in Patients With Breast Cancer.

 Patients with moderate to high risk primary breast cancer -Stage III, Triple negative (T= 4 cm N0, any N+), Stage IV (without evidence of disease) will take tetrathiomolydbate (TM) pills for two years.

 Extension study 1 - If patients are shown to be copper depleted, they are given the option to continue to receive TM for an additional 2 years.

 Extension study 2 - Open to patients who are stage 4 NED, 10 involved lymph nodes or triple negative molecular subtype and candidates will continue for months 49-72.

 Extension study 3 - Open to patients who are stage 4 NED receiving a benefit from TM.

 These subjects can continue receiving TM for 73-96 months.

 Extension study 4 - Open to patients who are stage 4 NED receiving a benefit from TM.

 These subject can continue receiving TM for 97-120 months.

 Phase II Study of Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) in Patients With Breast Cancer@highlight

Patients with moderate to high risk primary breast cancer (Stage II with more than 4 lymph nodes involved with cancer) III or Stage IV (without evidence of disease) will take tetrathiomolybdate (TM) pills for two years.

 The objectives of the study are to: - Assess the safety and tolerability of tetrathiomolybdate in patients with breast cancer at high risk of tumor recurrence.

 - Observe the disease-free survival of patients in this trial.

 - Conduct background scientific experiments on tumor tissue and blood of patients in this study
