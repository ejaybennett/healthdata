(thirdQuint)17-Dimethylaminoethylamino-17-Demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) in Treating Patients With Metastatic Solid Tumors or Tumors That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and recommended phase II dose of 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) in patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors.

 - Determine the feasibility, safety, and toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

 Secondary - Determine the clinical pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the biologically effective dose.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

 Patients receive 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-DMAG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 An additional 10 patients are treated at the MTD.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 28 days.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 17-DMAG in treating patients with metastatic solid tumors or tumors that cannot be removed by surgery.
