(fifthQuint)Assessment of the Immunogenicity and Safety of PENTAXIM in Philippines.

 Open, randomized, multicentric, controlled trial.

 Infants will be randomly allocated in one of the two study groups as follows: Group A: 212 subjects will receive the PENTAXIM cent vaccine at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age, and the recombinant 10 mu g hepatitis B vaccine at 0, 6 and 14 weeks of age.

 Group B: 212 subjects will receive the PENTAXIM cent and the recombinant 10 mu g hepatitis B vaccines at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age.

 All infants included in the study will receive a booster dose of PENTAXIM cent vaccine at 18-19 months of age.

 Assessment of the Immunogenicity and Safety of PENTAXIM in Philippines@highlight

The present clinical study will assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the subsequent administration of Aventis Pasteur's DTacP-IPV//PRP~T combined vaccine (PENTAVAC cent /PENTAXIM), as a three-dose primary vaccination in 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age schedule followed by a booster vaccination during the second year of life with the aim to cover the WHO EPI primary vaccination schedule at this age for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis and Hib vaccines.

 WHO EPI vaccination schedules for hepatitis B (either 0, 6 and 14 weeks or 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age) will be also assessed in infants born to HBsAg seronegative mothers.

 To assess the safety of Pentaxim.
