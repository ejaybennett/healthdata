(secondQuint)Watchful Waiting Versus Open Tension-free Repair of Inguinal Hernia in Asymptomatic or Minimally Symptomatic Men.

 CONTEXT Many men with an inguinal hernia have minimal symptoms.

 Whether deferring operation is safe and a good option for some patients has not been assessed.

 OBJECTIVE To compare pain and the Physical Component Score (PCS) of the SF-36 at two years in men with minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias randomized to watchful waiting (WW) or a standard tension-free hernia repair (TFR).

 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS.

 Between January, 1999 and December, 2004 we conducted a multicenter trial of 720 men (364 WW, 356 TFR) who were followed for 2-4.

5 years.

 Men were excluded with hernia pain interfering with activities; undetectable hernias; infection; American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status >3; recent difficulty in reducing the hernia.

 INTERVENTIONS Men assigned to WW were followed at 6 months and annually and watched for hernia symptoms.

 Men assigned to operation received TFR, and were followed at 3 and 6 months, and annually.

 Watchful Waiting Versus Open Tension-free Repair of Inguinal Hernia in Asymptomatic or Minimally Symptomatic Men@highlight

This is a multicenter clinical trial to compare pain, physical function, and other outcomes in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias randomly assigned to watchful waiting without an operation, or a standard hernia repair with mesh.

 We studied the safety of delaying operation.
