(firstQuint)T Wave Alternans in Hemodialysis.

 One-third to one-quarter of hemodialysis patients die of sudden cardiac death (SCD).

 The hemodialysis procedure may theoretically increase the risk of SCD.

 This study uses T wave alternans, a noninvasive marker of SCD, to objectively determine whether the hemodialysis procedure alters the risk of SCD in hemodialysis patients.
