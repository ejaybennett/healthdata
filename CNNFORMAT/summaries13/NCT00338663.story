(secondQuint)A Study on Knee Immobilization and Pain Levels After an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction Surgery.

 This study will attempt to evaluate the efficacy of knee immobilization on patient postoperative pain levels following an ACL reconstruction.

 There is a lack of consensus in the area of postoperative knee bracing/immobilization.

 A survey of Canadian surgeons indicates that the primary reason for postoperative knee immobilization is to reduce pain.

 To the investigators' knowledge, there are no studies comparing the use of immediate (0-48 hours) postoperative knee immobilization versus no immobilization and pain control in this patient population.

The purpose of the study is to determine if there is difference in immediate postoperative pain levels (48 hours) between patients who wear a knee immobilizer splint compared to patients who do not wear a knee immobilizer splint after an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery.
