(thirdQuint)Outcomes of Intraoperative 5-Fluorouracil Versus Mitomycin C.

 Glaucoma is a life-long progressive disease, and patients are living longer.

 Therefore, a long term full evaluation of the efficacy of intraoperative 5-FU and MMC needs to be performed to assess the true efficacy of MMC compared to 5-FU.

 We, therefore propose, a long-term prospective study of patients previously enrolled in the prospective study involving the evaluation of single intraoperative application of mitomycin C versus 5-fluorouracil in low to moderate risk glaucoma patients.

 Outcomes of Intraoperative 5-Fluorouracil Versus Mitomycin C@highlight

A clinical trial to establish the long term response of using intraoperative 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) versus mitomycin C (MMC) in trabeculectomy glaucoma surgery.

 Antiproliferative agents such as 5-fluorouracil and Mitomycin C have been used extensively in trabeculectomy surgery to improve the success of the surgery and prevent further visual loss and blindness in glaucoma patients.
