(fifthQuint)Vitamin E in Preventing Peripheral Neuropathy Caused by Chemotherapy in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Cancer.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to type of chemotherapy (taxane vs cisplatin vs carboplatin vs oxaliplatin vs combination), age ( 50 years vs > 50 years), and gender.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the incidence of chemotherapy-induced sensory peripheral neuropathy grade 2 in patients undergoing curative neurotoxic chemotherapy for cancer treated with vitamin E vs placebo.

 Secondary - Compare the proportion of patients requiring dose reductions of chemotherapy secondary to sensory peripheral neuropathy.

 - Compare the proportion of patients stopping chemotherapy before treatment is complete secondary to sensory peripheral neuropathy.

 - Assess the toxicity of vitamin E in these patients.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 months.

RATIONALE: Vitamin E may prevent peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy in patients with cancer.

 It is not yet known whether vitamin E is more effective than a placebo in preventing peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying vitamin E to see how well it works compared with placebo in preventing peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer.
