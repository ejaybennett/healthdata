(secondQuint)Bevacizumab Versus Combined Bevacizumab and Triamcinolone for Refractory Diabetic Macular Edema; a Randomized Clinical Trial.

 According to the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS), the treatment of choice for diabetic macular edema is laser therapy, which may be neither effective nor curative in some patients.

 Corticosteroids may have a beneficial effect on diabetic macular edema.

 Other newly introduced medications for macular edematous lesions are anti-VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor)drugs.

 In this randomized, sham-controlled, multicenter, three-arm clinical trial,we try to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab alone and in combination with intravitreal triamcinolone in the treatment of refractory diabetic macular edema.
