(fifthQuint)Effect of Androgen Blockade Therapy on Thymus Function in Older Patients Who Have Undergone Radical Prostatectomy for Localized Prostate Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine if inhibition of sex steroid action is associated with increased thymic size in older patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy for localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

 - Determine if inhibition of sex steroid action is associated with an increase in the absolute number or percentage of circulating "naive" phenotype T cells, and/or an increase in the frequency of T-cell receptor excision circles in peripheral blood cells.

 OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, single-blind, cohort study.

 Patients are stratified according to hormonal therapy after surgery (yes vs no).

 Patients undergo CT scan of the thymus.

 Blood samples are analyzed by flow cytometry to determine phenotype of T cells.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Effect of Androgen Blockade Therapy on Thymus Function in Older Patients Who Have Undergone Radical Prostatectomy for Localized Prostate Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Studying changes in thymus function in patients who have been undergoing androgen blockade therapy for prostate cancer may help doctors learn more about how well patients will respond to treatment, may help in planning cancer treatment, and may help the study of cancer in the future.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the effect of androgen blockade therapy on thymus function in older patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.
