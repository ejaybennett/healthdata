(fifthQuint)Vitamin D Dose-Response Study to Establish Dietary Requirements in Infants.

 Vitamin D status is currently judged by serum 25(OH)D and the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-25(OH)D dynamic (1).

 The ultimate effect of vitamin D on human health is a healthy skeleton, which is characterized in infancy by normal linear growth and bone mineral accretion and absence of bone related disease, such as rickets (1).

 The importance of these indicators is illustrated in epidemiological research, where linear growth in infancy is positively related to peak bone mass as an adult (2).

 Moreover, both vitamin D status (3) and intake (4) in infancy are related to bone mass in children.

 In 2004, Health Canada reaffirmed its population health policy that all breastfed, healthy term infants in Canada receive a daily vitamin D3 supplement of 400 IU (5).

 This policy recommendation was made in consultation with the Canadian Expert Advisory Committee on Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI).

 They determined that the 1997 DRI value for vitamin D of 200 IU was too low for Canadians based on Canadian studies (6, 7) and surveillance systems (1) that indicated a high rate of vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D deficient rickets continued in Canada.

 Both the Health Canada committee (5) and Institute of Medicine Committee on Dietary Recommended Intakes (1) acknowledged that there was considerable uncertainty regarding what defines optimal vitamin D intake in infancy based on functional outcomes.

 In adults, a minimum serum 25(OH)D value of 75 nmol/L now defines optimal vitamin D status (8).

 This concentration is derived from dose-response studies of the relationship between 25(OH)D and PTH, where PTH plateaus in approximately the mid-normal range and also from studies where 25(OH)D concentrations between 90 and 100 nmol/L are positively related to bone mineral density (BMD) in young adults (9).

 A dose-response study to determine the physiological and functional response to vitamin D3 supplementation has not been conducted in infants and is necessary to confidently set DRI values for Canadian infants.

 In summary, health care professionals are faced with major gaps in knowledge of: a) what constitutes optimal vitamin D status in infancy based on the physiological and functional outcomes, 25(OH)D, PTH and bone mass; and b) what oral dosage of vitamin D supplement is required to elevate serum 25(OH)D to optimal values as the key biomarker of optimal vitamin D status.

 The global objective of this study is to conduct a dose-response study of vitamin D3 intakes and to provide information regarding the physiological and functional response to vitamin D supplementation in infancy, including: 25(OH)D concentrations and the relationship between 25(OH)D, PTH and bone mineral accretion.

 Once the best dosage is determined, funding for a larger study spanning all Canadian regions will be sought to more conclusively demonstrate that this dosage is appropriate for all Canadian infants.

 In the larger study, infants will be followed longitudinally to confirm that optimization of vitamin D status in infancy enhances peak bone mass.

0 BACKGROUND 2.

1 Recommendations for Intakes of Vitamin D for Infants The AI value of at least 200 IU/d was derived from the amount of breast milk typically consumed by infants and the concentration of vitamin D in breast milk that resulted in serum 25(OH)D concentrations above 27.

5 nmol/L (1).

 The current recommendations for vitamin D intake in Canada for infants are listed below, but no dosage has been evaluated using dose-response studies conducted in Canada.

 - 400 IU vitamin D3/d for infants recommended in 2004 by Health Canada, The Canadian Pediatric Society and Dietitians of Canada in Guidelines for Healthy Term Infants (5); and - that entirely breast-fed infants should be given 400 IU of vitamin D daily that may be increased to 800 IU/d from October through April as recommended by the Indian and Inuit Committee of the Canadian Pediatric Society (10).

 Infants bottle-fed formulas made from fortified whole or canned milk should receive additional 400 IU from October through April (10).

 2.

2 Vitamin D Metabolism and Sources of Vitamin D for Infants: The Canadian Scenario Endogenously synthesized vitamin D is in the form of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3).

 Most food sources and supplements in Canada have this mammalian form, but some contain the plant form, ergocalciferol (vitamin D2).

 Vitamin D3 is estimated to be approximately 9.

5 times more potent than vitamin D2 (12).

 Endogenous synthesis accounts for the majority of vitamin D in adults (8).

 Above latitude 42 in the northern hemisphere, synthesis is limited to late spring through mid-autumn, because of the low intensity of UVB radiation, during the rest of the year.

 The majority of Canadians reside north of the 42nd parallel, placing them at risk for hypovitaminosis D year round because of the use of sunscreen and environmental factors, such as clothing and pollution, which reduce exposure to UVB sunlight (14).

 This means that endogenous synthesis in pregnant women and subsequent maternal-fetal transfer may be compromised.

 Fortified foods such as milk, margarine and vitamin supplements remain the major source of vitamin D for many Canadian adults.

 2.

2.

1 Maternal-fetal transfer by birth: Given the fact that Canadian women do not consume enough milk (15, 16), it is not surprising that over 1/3 of infants are born already deficient in vitamin D.

 In Manitoba, the PI has documented that 36% of infants from white or non-white parents are deficient in vitamin D at birth, defined as a serum 25(OH)D below 27.

5 nmol/L, with 46% of their mothers themselves having values 75 nmol/L at 3 months of age in exclusively breast fed infants.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: When multiple doses achieve our primary objective of optimal 25(OH)D concentrations, the best dosage will be identified based on: (i) 25(OH)D-PTH dynamics (ii) incidence of adverse events, such as disturbed mineral homeostasis (e.

g.

 hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, etc), and (iii) alternate markers of bone health (e.

g.

 bone mass, osteocalcin and N-telopeptide) TERTIARY OBJECTIVE: We will examine the quantitative relationships between primary and secondary outcome measures and the various prospectively collected predictor variables, including dose, vitamin D from breast milk or fortified formulae, gender, season of birth, ethnicity, baseline vitamin D stores and determine if the selected dosage maintains 25(OH)D over the first year of life.

 4.

0 METHODOLOGY: Dose Response Study 4.

1 Population n=192 breast-fed infants from greater Montreal region will be studied.

 The rationale for studying breast-fed infants is that this is the current recommended optimal food for infants, along with vitamin D supplements, and the fact that 85% of women in Canada initially breastfeed their infant (44, 45).

 Beginning with breastfeeding allows confirmation that the best dose is suitable while breastfeeding and if this dose is also optimal later in infancy with introduction of foods and weaning to vitamin D fortified formula.

 Initially a pilot study will be employed with 24 infants to evaluate the recruitment strategy, study questionnaires and procedures that will be used in the larger study.

 4.

2 Study Protocol 4.

2.

1 Recruitment: Rolling recruitment over 1 year with 1-year follow up for all beginning in September of 2006 and continuing through August 2007.

 Equal numbers across all months will be sought.

 At least two large pediatric clinics (Medicentre St-Lazare and Clinique de sante jeunesse) will be the primary recruitment centres with over 1500 newborns annually receive their ongoing medical care.

 These clinics provide care to families with a wide range of SES and cultures representative of Montreal and Canada.

 Infants will be recruited at the first postnatal visit at 2 weeks of age.

 Such recruitment age is suitable since breastfeeding will be deemed as established and recovery of birth weight and good health are confirmed.

 The clinician will inform women and families who meet inclusion criteria, and only those who are interested in participating in the study will have their names and contact address and telephone number forwarded to the study coordinator.

 All study visits will take place at the Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit, School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition.

 4.

2.

2 Study treatment groups: After obtaining written consent the infant will be randomized to a study group stratified for sex (see page 12) i for randomization process).

 At recruitment (2-4 weeks of age), baseline measurements will be conducted prior to providing treatment.

 Infants will then be randomized to receive 400, 800, 1200 or 1600 IU/d of vitamin D3 to 1 year of age.

 A placebo group is not included since the standard in Canada is 400 IU/d and a precedent for considering placebos unethical has already been set (37).

 The supplement will be double blinded to the investigators and all staff by coding of the supplements by Euro-Pharm who as agreed to provide the supplement in kind.

 This supplement will be stable for at least 3 months (the longest interval of measurements) and each dosage delivered in 2 ml volumes.

 4.

2.

3 Frequency and duration of follow up: Baseline and all follow up visits (3, 6, 9, and 12 months of life) will include anthropometric measurements and blood and urine analysis for (25(OH)D, PTH, calcium, phosphorus, creatinine) as well as bone markers and bone mass measurements.

 An additional blood sample will be obtained 1 month after starting the study to monitor blood calcium levels.

 Bottles of the supplement will be assessed for compliance at these visits.

 Other sources of vitamin D intake will be reviewed by diet history as well as determining the content of vitamin D in the breast milk.

 Maternal baseline information regarding demographics will be gathered at the initial visit and dietary vitamin D intake will be assessed at each visit.

 4.

3 Details of Measurements INFANT: NUTRITIONAL AND HORMONAL STATUS AND BONE METABOLISM 4.

3.

1 Sample procurement: Blood and urine samples will be collected in infants at all visits.

 All samples will be taken between 8 and 10 am to control for diurnal variation permitting 3 to 4 infants to be seen in our Unit daily.

 Heparinized blood (~1 ml in infants via finger poke - 400 ul for safety, 600 ul for other measurements) and non-pharmacological approaches used to provide for pain control including swaddling and 1 ml 33% sucrose solution given sub lingual 2 minutes prior to collection (46).

 4.

3.

2 25(OH)D and PTH concentrations: Vitamin D status will be measured using a RIA (25-50; Diasorin) that is known to measure both D2 and D3 in plasma (47).

 This method (RIA) is selected as the now most common clinical method over HPLC and competitive protein binding assays.

 Serum intact PTH will be measured using an ELISA (50 ul; Immutopics International).

 4.

3.

3 Bone markers: Change in bone metabolism in response to 25(OH)D will be assessed by a marker of osteoblast activity related to mineralization, plasma osteocalcin (20 ul; Diasorin).

 Osteoclast activity will be assessed by measuring urinary N-telopeptide (ELISA, Osteomark) corrected to creatinine.

 The assay is specific to Type 1 collagen with a CV% <8%.

 N-telopeptide measurements urine selected over blood to reserve the small blood sample for other measurements.

 Urinary N-telopeptide in spot urine samples is a validated measurement in infancy (42).

 The PI is experienced in all of these measurements (6, 48).

 4.

3.

4 Anthropometry: For infants, size at birth (weight, length, head circumference) and gestational age will be documented from the vaccine carnet.

 Growth will be assessed each visit using triplicate measurements of weight (to the nearest g without clothing/diaper), crown-heel length (to the nearest 0.

1 cm using an infant length board) and head circumference (to the nearest 0.

1 cm using a non-stretchable tape).

 Data will be expressed in absolute units and standard deviation scores using the data from the Centers for Disease Control at each age.

 Quality of growth achieved after term age will be available as lean and fat mass provided during measurement of bone mass using DXA, reported as accurate and reproducible (49).

 4.

3.

5 Nutrition: Milk intake in infancy will be assessed by weighing infants prior to and after breast-feeding (i.

e.

, test weighing and the basis of the required weigh scales).

 For this purpose, parents will be provided with electronic weigh scales designed for test weighing over 3 days then returned to the research site by courier.

 Additionally, breast milk vitamin D (all forms) will be measured (using HPLC (51, 52)) in samples collected at inception and the 3 month visit using an electronic breast pump.

 Mothers will be asked to feed the infant on one breast and pump from the other.

 Total intake of vitamin D will then be derived from milk intake and milk vitamin D concentration.

 Thus total intakes of vitamin D will be possible whether breast-fed or fed formula.

 At each age, dietary and supplement intake will be documented in infants using written 3-day records that are designed to accommodate test weighing and documentation of other milks and any foods consumed as successfully used previously by the PI (53).

 Estimated portions sizes will be made using household measuring tools.

 Mothers will be asked about timing of introduction of solid foods or fluids other than breast-milk or vitamin D supplements.

 If infants wean to infant formula or cows milk, the product brand will be documented.

 It is anticipated that by 3 to 4 months of age that many infants will wean from breastfeeding to formula.

 However, the dosage will not be adjusted.

 Intake of vitamin D from infant formula, cows' milk etc will be documented and used to calculate total daily intake above the supplement.

 Such additional vitamin D will be addressed in the statistical analysis and is anticipated to be a systematic variation in total intakes.

 4.

3.

6 Bone mass: Measurement of bone area, BMC and BMD of the whole body, lumbar vertebrae (L2-4) and femur at all visits will be conducted using DXA (QDR 4500A Discovery series, Hologic Inc.

) at the Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit.

 DXA has been validated for measuring infant whole body and regional BMC (49, 54, 55) and delivers minimal radiation (6 uSv) in comparison to standard pediatric x-rays (~60 uSv).

 Since positioning in infants is difficult to standardize, only BMC is used for whole body and femur.

 For lumbar spine, standardized positioning is feasible enabling assessment of bone area, BMC and BMD.

 Infants will not be sedated and will be scanned while sleeping and wrapped in a receiving blanket and standardized clothing without any metal zippers, clasps etc.

 Data will be expressed as absolute values for bone area, BMC and BMD and also as a rate of change for BMC.

 The measurement of whole body bone mass is ideal and recommended by ISCD (56).

 To enable complete data regarding bone, the next best measurement is lumbar spine, vertebra 1-4 (56).

 This measurement is easily attainable in infants to 1 year of age and only requires 30 to 60 seconds compared to whole body at 3 minutes.

 In addition, the femur can be scanned in 30 to 60 seconds and offers a novel assessment of a long bone.

 Whole body BMC will be corrected to body weight, length and lean mass and also expressed as change over the period of study.

 Correction to weight or length is endorsed by ISCD rather than more novel methods such as use of bone area and height (59) since normative data for infants is not currently available.

 Differences in whole body bone mineral accretion between inception, 3 and 6 months and between 6 and 12 months are greater than the error of measurement by DXA estimated at <4.

5% (25, 49).

 Values for spine bone area, BMC and BMD and femur BMC will be compared among groups.

 MATERNAL CHARACTERISTICS 4.

3.

7 General demographics and anthropometry include: Maternal age, weight gain in pregnancy, height, family income range and number of dependent members, employment, highest education level achieved, previous pregnancies, live births.

 To obtain accurate measurement of height, mothers will be measured at the inception visit.

 Weight will also be measured to accurately describe the population.

 Self-reported weight gain in pregnancy will be documented.

 Mothers will be asked to self-identify ethnicity.

 These data will be used to simply characterize the study population.

 4.

3.

8 Nutrient intake: Dietary and supplement intake by the mothers during the last trimester of pregnancy will be assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire, the modified Willett/Harvard (60).

 This questionnaire is modified to assess intakes over the last 3 months of pregnancy.

 These data will be used to describe vitamin D exposure of the fetus in utero when bone is mineralizing.

 At each visit and while the mother is lactating, intake of vitamin D will be assessed using a 24-hour recall.

 The value for maternal vitamin D intake will be used to describe our population as necessary to determine if results can be extrapolated to the Canadian population.

 4.

4 Recruitment and Statistical Analysis 4.

4.

1 Recruitment: Infants will be equally allocated to the 4 dosage groups, based on a randomization in blocks of 8 to accommodate stratifying by gender since growth diverges in male and female infants by the first year of life.

 Even distribution among the 4 seasons (standard calendar dates) will be sought by recruiting 1/12th of the sample each month.

 The fact that some infants may have already began vitamin D supplements will be considered as a systematic error.

 4.

4.

2 Power and sample size: The sample size will be 48 to enable balanced groups across seasons and genders.

 This sample size will permit analysis of the data by feeding type: infants exclusively breast-fed versus weaning to formula as necessary to meet objective 3.

 4.

4.

3 Data Analysis: The intention-to-treat principle will be applied, including all randomized infants for each outcome.

 For comparison purposes, results will also be evaluated in terms of the dose actually received.

 Should baseline imbalances occur between groups despite randomization, these will be treated as covariates and adjusted for.

 To compare proportions between treatment groups, sample proportions will be evaluated by a Chi-squared test of proportions, adjusted for multiple comparisons to ensure a family-wise error rate of 0.

05.

 Results will be assessed at the each time point, with a Chi-squared test for trend in proportions to compare their temporal evolution.

 Mean 25(OH) D concentrations, bone mass, and biochemical indices of bone remodeling will be compared in each dose group under a fixed effects ANOVA model, with significant group differences localized by suitable post-hoc testing (e.

g.

 Tukey method), again with adjustment for multiple comparisons to ensure a family-wise error rate of 0.

05.

 Time course will be evaluated under a mixed effects ANOVA model (with the addition of time as a random effect).

 The dynamics of the 25(OH)D-PTH relationship is visually assessed in linearized log-log plots, whose slope is a measure of PTH sensitivity to 25(OH)D.

 The best-fit line is determined by least squares, and slopes compared by standard methods based on the distribution of regression coefficients as t-statistics.

 Taking the following as independent predictor variables - dose, source of vitamin D, age, gender, season of birth, ethnicity, and baseline vitamin D stores - their effect on the likelihood of achieving our therapeutic target will be evaluated by multiple logistic regression, with ordinary multivariate linear regression to examine their impact on serum concentration of 25(OH)D, bone mass, osteocalcin, and N-telopeptide.

 Vitamin D Dose-Response Study to Establish Dietary Requirements in Infants@highlight

The research team is comprised of an expert nutrition scientist and a pediatrician with expertise in endocrinology.

 Both have world-class experience in assessing bone mass in infancy.

 Together they have designed a study to determine how much dietary vitamin D is needed to optimize health in infants.

 This is important since many infants are born with vitamin D deficiency.

 At present the dosage of vitamin D that is optimal for infant health is unclear and recent research suggests that vitamin D status very early in life has long lasting effects on bone mass and other health issues.

 Therefore, in a group of healthy infants, this research team will test which dosage of vitamin D is needed to achieve optimal vitamin D status.

 Optimal vitamin D status will be based on growth, biomarkers of vitamin D and bone status in blood and also general health.

 The infants will all be breastfed and begin the study at about 2 weeks of age.

 At 3 months intervals over the first year of life, each infant will be measured for growth, duration of breastfeeding and supplement use plus have a bone density scan to determine changes in bone growth.

 The data will be helpful to guide health care professionals in providing the best care possible for their infants.

 It will also be important to the health of populations since dietary recommendations for vitamin D are used to guide fortification of foods and development of evidence based policy around nutrient recommendations and their implementation.
