(firstQuint)Effect of Tonsillar Pillar Closure on Postoperative Pain and Bleeding Risk After Tonsillectomy.

 After induction of appropriate general anesthesia, a tonsillectomy was performed and control of bleeding was achieved as is routine for the individual Otolaryngologist performing the procedure.

 Next the surgeon used 3-0 chromic (absorbable) sutures on tapered needles to close one tonsillar fossa but leave the tonsillar fossa on the other side open.

 The side chosen was determined by a computer generated schedule.

 Routine postoperative care was given.
