(firstQuint)Dislocated Unstable Distal Both-Bone Forearm Fractures in Children.

 children who arrive at the emergency unit with a dislocated both-bone distal forearm fracture will be asked to join the trial.

 After an unstable reposition, the fracture will be fixated with 2 Kirschner-wires.

 The arm will be immobilised in above elbow cast during 4 weeks.

 Outpatient clinic visits till a follow-up of 6 months.

 During these visits we will investigate: consolidation and dislocation on X-ray, function of both arms, complains in daily living and complications.
