(secondQuint)Combination of CPT-11 and LoHP vs Combination of 5-FU, Leucovorin and LoHP as 1st Line Treatment in Gastric Patients.

 There is no regimen considered standard in advanced gastric cancer.

 The reported response rates of 5-FU-based combination chemotherapy are higher than single agents (10-50%) but more toxic.

 The combination of 5-FU/LV and LOHP has demonstrated an ORR of 43%, median TTP of approximately 6,5 months and OS of 8,6 months in phase II trials, with an acceptable toxicity.

 Irinotecan (CPT-11) is effective as salvage treatment in metastatic gastric cancer and has a synergistic activity with LOHP in preclinical trials.

This phase II trial will compare the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin versus 5-FU/LV and Oxaliplatin as first line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer
