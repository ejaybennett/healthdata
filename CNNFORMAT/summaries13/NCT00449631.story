(firstQuint)Multidrug Resistance After Trabeculectomy With Mitomycin C.

 Despite the adjuvant use of mitomycin C during trabeculectomy, short-term and long-term failures still occur.

 We investigate whether mitomycin C treatment during previous trabeculectomy induces P-glycoprotein expression.

 Expression of P-glycoprotein is analysed in surgically removed Tenon tissue using immunohistochemistry.
