(firstQuint)Ototoxicity of Artemether / Lumefantrine (Coartem) and Other Antimalarials.

 Artemisinin based combination therapies (ACT) currently are the most promising treatment options for uncomplicated falciparum malaria.

 There have been controversial reports about possible ototoxicity of artemether / lumefantrine (Coartem(R)) from retrospective studies.

 In this investigation treatment of uncomplicated malaria with artemether / lumefantrine, quinine, where side-effects on hearing are known, or atovaquone / proguanil, where no such effects have been reported, are compared.

 Auditoy function is examined (Auditory Brainstem Response, Pure-tone Audiometry, Otoacustic Emissions) before treatment, after 7, 28, and, for determination of irreversibility, after 90 days.
