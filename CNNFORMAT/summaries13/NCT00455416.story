(secondQuint)Dietary Intervention in Follicular Lymphoma.

 Dietary factors plays an important role in the prevention of several diseases.

 The cardiovascular disease mortality have dropped dramatically the last 20 years, but the relative death rates from cancer remains fairly stable.

 There is reason to believe that factors in the tumors microenvironment is of great importance for the outcome of many malignant diseases, including FL.

 Factors predicting a poor outcome are associated with inflammation, oxidative stress which both impair the hosts immune response and produces growth stimulatory signals.

 In this open study with 45 patients to be included we seek to perform a dietary intervention with comparison of apoptosis rate, proliferation rate and immune cell infiltrate before and after the intervention period.
