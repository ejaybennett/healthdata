(secondQuint)Cytokine Profiles in Children With Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

 We will recruit subjects with OSA about to undergo adenotonsillectomy and collect a blood sample and portion of their tonsils after the induction of general anesthesia.

 The mononuclear cells will be isolated from both these tissues and stimulated with different markers and cytokines assayed and compared.

 We will also recruit patients with no symptoms of OSA undergoing unrelated elective surgery and ascertain the absence of OSA by having the parents fill out a sleep questionnaire.

 We will then collect blood samples from these patients after the induction of anesthesia and examine the cytokine secretion profile and compare it to that of the children with OSA.

 Cytokine Profiles in Children With Obstructive Sleep Apnea@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the cytokine profile of tonsillar and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and to compare the blood mononuclear cell cytokine secretion profile between patients with obstructive sleep apnea and controls without apnea.
