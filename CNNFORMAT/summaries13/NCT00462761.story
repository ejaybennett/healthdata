(firstQuint)A Phase I Study of AC220 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia Regardless of FLT3 Status.

 This is a multi-center clinical study conducted in the USA and possibly two international sites.

 It is open-label, dose escalation study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of orally administered AC220 as a single agent given daily for 14 days.

 Cohorts of 3 patients receive AC220 until dose limiting toxicity is noted (DLT).

 At that point cohorts will expand to 6 patients until MTD is determined.

 Patients not experiencing DLT or significant disease progression at Day 15 may continue receiving AC220 at the discretion of the Investigator and Sponsor.

 FLT3 positive and negative patients are allowed to participate.
