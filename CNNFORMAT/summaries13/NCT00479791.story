(secondQuint)Lipid, Glycemic, and Insulin Responses to Meals Rich in Different Fatty Acids.

 Research Design and Methods: Test meals rich in palmitic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and containing 1,000 kcal each were administered in a randomized cross-over design every 3 to 4 days to 11 patients with T2DM.

 Serum insulin, glucose, and triglycerides concentrations were measured for 360 minutes.

 All subjects received an isoenergic diet of constant composition throughout the study.

 Lipid, Glycemic, and Insulin Responses to Meals Rich in Different Fatty Acids@highlight

A meal rich in very-long chain omega-3 fatty acids or oleic acid may lower postprandial insulin levels in comparison to a meal rich in linoleic acid or palmitic acid.

 A meal rich in very long-chain omega-3 fatty acids may lower postprandial triglyceride levels compared to other fatty acids.
