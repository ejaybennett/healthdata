(secondQuint)Phase II Study of Combination of Paclitaxel Poliglumex and Alimta for Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

 Primary objective To evaluate the overall response rate (complete plus partial responses by RECIST criteria) to the combination of paclitaxel poliglumex and pemetrexed as therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.

 Secondary Objectives To evaluate the safety and adverse event profile of the combination of paclitaxel poliglumex and pemetrexed as therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.

 To evaluate the duration of response, time to progression, and overall survival of advanced NSCLC treated with the combination of paclitaxel poliglumex and pemetrexed.

 To compare the overall response rate using three-dimensional reconstruction of target lesions by Medical Metrx Solutions (MMS) and RECIST criteria.
