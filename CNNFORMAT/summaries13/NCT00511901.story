(thirdQuint)Prevalence and Treatment of Anemia in Rehabilitation Patients.

 Anemia is associated with loss of function in some studies.

 However, it is unknown if more rapid correction of anemia in patients who enter a rehabilitation setting after surgery or from hospitalization for acute medical problems leads to shorter rehabilitation stays and improved functional status.

 Patients aged 60 and older who have hemoglobin levels of less than 10.

5 g/dL will be randomized to receive 8 weekly doses of either erythropoietin alfa or placebo.

 Functional status will be measured at baseline and then at 3, 8 and 12 weeks.

 The following specific aims will be tested in this study: - Determine the prevalence of anemia in patients admitted to a subacute rehabilitation facility with potential for recovery.

 - Determine the baseline functional status of patients admitted to a subacute rehabilitation facility with potential for recovery using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), an assessment tool used in acute rehabilitation settings.

 - Determine if administration of epoetin alfa will result in higher hemoglobin concentrations in patients receiving the drug than in patients given placebo at 3, 8 and 12 weeks after entry into the study.

 - Perform a study that establishes the feasibility of a trial to test whether epoetin alfa produces improvements in the FIM, grip strength, the time it takes for patients to reach rehabilitation goals, activity monitor, fatigue, mood, functional recovery and reduces length of rehabilitation stay.

 Prevalence and Treatment of Anemia in Rehabilitation Patients@highlight

Patients who are admitted to subacute rehabilitation facilities following hospitalization are frequently anemic.

 The purpose of this study is to see if anemic patients treated with epoetin alfa will have higher hemoglobin levels and better functional recovery at 3, 8, and 12 weeks after study entry compared to patients who do not receive epoetin alfa.
