(secondQuint)Therapeutic Massage for Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

 Anxiety and stress are costly problems that afflict millions of American adults.

 Together, they are among the most common reasons for which adults use complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies as well as more conventional relaxation therapies.

 Although massage is one of the most popular CAM treatments for anxiety, its effectiveness for this problem has never been rigorously evaluated.

 This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of massage as a treatment for a diagnosed anxiety disorder.

 Massage will be compared with two other relaxing treatments: thermotherapy and time in a relaxing environment, which reflect the types of activities that persons with anxiety might try to relieve their symptoms.
