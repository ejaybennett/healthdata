(secondQuint)EXecutive RCT: Evaluating XIENCE V in a Multi Vessel Disease.

 This is a clinical evaluation of the XIENCE V(R) everolimus eluting coronary stent system as a revascularization treatment of patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease (MVD-CAD).

 The long term safety and efficacy of the XIENCE V EECSS have been demonstrated in the SPIRIT FIRST trial up to 5 years, the SPIRIT II trial up to 4 years, and in the SPIRIT III Randomized Control Trial (RCT) up to 3 years.

 In addition, these pre-approval studies have shown low rates of Target Vessel Failure and Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) that were consistently lower than the comparator arm of each study.

 The post approval EXECUTIVE study demonstrated that the use of the XIENCE EECSS in complex lesions in a real-world population resulted in 1 year MACE, Stent Thrombosis and Target Lesion Revascularization rates that are comparable to those of the previously mentioned pre-approval studies which included patients with more restricted inclusion / exclusion criteria.

 Therefore, based on existing data from these trials, Abbott Vascular has decided to discontinue further follow up in the EXECUTIVE trial.

 The study is composed of two parts: A Registry, outlined in a separate posting and the Randomized Control Trial (RCT) portion of this study, which is as follows: -A randomized group of patients aimed at assessing the angiographic efficacy of the XIENCE V(R) Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (XIENCE V(R) EECSS) compared to the TAXUS(R) Liberte cent Paclitaxel Eluting Coronary Stent System.
