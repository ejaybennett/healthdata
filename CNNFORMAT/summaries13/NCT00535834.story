(thirdQuint)Studying Stored Samples From Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Treated on Clinical Trial NCI-00-C-0154.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the formation of antibody complexes in serum samples taken before initiation of treatment and after completion of therapy in prostate cancer patients previously enrolled on clinical trial NCI-00-C-0154.

 - Evaluate immunologic response.

 Secondary - Clone the underlying tumor antigens discovered through SEREX.

 OUTLINE: Samples previously collected on clinical trial NCI-00-C-0154 (whole blood, serum, and peripheral mononuclear blood cells) are analyzed for immunologic responses and evidence of formation of anti-tumor antibodies.

 Western blot is used to detect any evidence of vaccine-induced autoantibody responses.

 If there is an indication of response, SEREX is used to clone the underlying antigens.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients before and after treatment may help doctors learn more about the effects of the treatment on cells.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying samples collected from patients with localized prostate cancer who received treatment on clinical trial NCI-00-C-0154.
