(fifthQuint)Dynamic Epidermal Cooling During Pulsed Dye Laser Treatment of Port Wine Stain Birthmark at High Fluences.

 The flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser has offered the best results with the lowest incidence of side effects.

 The yellow light is preferentially absorbed by hemoglobin allowing more selective destruction of the ectatic capillaries in the dermis.

 The flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser has become the treatment of choice for port wine stain birthmarks; however, therapeutic challenges remain.

 The epidermis is not totally spared due to partial absorption of energy therein by melanin which presents an optical barrier through which the light must pass to reach the underlying blood vessels.

 Absorption of laser energy by melanin causes localized heating in the epidermis, which may, if not controlled, produce permanent complications such as hypertrophic scarring or dyspigmentation.

 Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of cryogen spray cooling during pulsed laser treatment of port wine stain birthmarks.

 This technology allows the use of higher incident laser light dosages and has been demonstrated to improve treatment results.

 cryogen spray cooling also decreases treatment pain and the duration of post-laser treatment purpura.

The purpose of the study is to improve the efficacy of pulsed dye laser treatment of port wine stain birthmarks.

 Involvement in the protocol will involve formal documentation of the level of treatment pain, duration of post-treatment purpura and incidence of side effects.

 In addition, measurements will be taken of blood substances that promote blood vessel formation/regrowth and non-invasive reflectance measurements and photographs will be taken before and after treatment.

 The objective of this study is to document the degree of port wine stain lightening, the incidence of side effects and the presence of angiogenic factors induced during treatment with the pulsed dye laser in association with cooling agent.

 This information ultimately lead to improved treatment.
