(fifthQuint)Does Lung Impedance Correlate With Changes in BNP in Stable and Acutely Decompensated Heart Failure Patients?.

 This is a prospective non-randomized longitudinal study.

 One hundred subjects will participate in 6 monthly and 3 bi-monthly serial assessments of plasma-based BNP, implantable device measured intrathoracic impedance, and clinical evaluation of heart failure status.

 Each patient will be enrolled in the study for a period of 12 months.

 Does Lung Impedance Correlate With Changes in BNP in Stable and Acutely Decompensated Heart Failure Patients?@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between serial B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) and implantable device measured intrathoracic impedance in symptomatic and asymptomatic heart failure patients over a 1-year period.

 Furthermore, this study will establish whether implantable device measured intrathoracic impedance trends with the distance walked on a six-minute hall walk (6MHW), an exercise-based acute measure that has also been associated with heart failure clinical status.
