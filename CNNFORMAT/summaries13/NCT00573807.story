(firstQuint)Energy Specific Far Infrared Radiation Treatment for Sciatica.

 Sciatica is created by joint misalignment, muscle spasm and inflammation.

 Generally, sciatica is a combination of lower back pain, pain radiating into the buttock and possibly down the leg.

 Far infrared radiation of the sciatic nerve, coupled with the stretching of the spinal cord, is a promising non-invasive method for treating sciatica.
