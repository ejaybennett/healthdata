(secondQuint)Community and Clinician Partnership for Prevention.

 Tobacco use, poor diet, and lack of physical activity are associated with the leading causes of significant morbidity and mortality, including coronary heart disease, hypertension, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and respiratory dysfunction.

 One solution to decreasing unhealthy behaviors would be to better integrate primary care providers with community resources, including community and public health organizations that already have the capacity and expertise to deliver effective interventions.

 This project is a randomized trial to evaluate different practice-level interventions to link practices to community resources to decrease unhealthy behaviors.
