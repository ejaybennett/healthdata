(secondQuint)Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) for Spine Metastases.

 This study will evaluate the pain control and the quality of life of patients with spinal metastases using stereotactic radiotherapy.

 Stereotactic radiotherapy is referred to as "targeted therapy".

 It uses special equipment to position the patient and guide the focused beams of radiation toward the cancer and away from normal surrounding tissue.

 This higher dose technique may work better to kill cancer cells with fewer side effects than standard radiation therapy.

This study will evaluate the most effective radiation dose.

 Patients will be randomized (like flipping a coin) to receive either low dose stereotactic radiotherapy (defined as "14 Gy") or high dose stereotactic radiotherapy (defined as 18 Gy).
