(secondQuint)Mental Stress Reduction in Defibrillator Patients.

 The study is a randomized controlled small clinical trial designed to determine whether a 10-week program of group cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) versus a control "Patient Education" program can improve hemodynamic responses to mental stress testing in patients with Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators.

 Comparison will be made between groups of heart rate and blood pressure responses to mental arithmetic and anger-recall mental stress, psychometric profiles, arrhythmia frequency and implantable cardioverter defibrillator firings before, immediately and up to 6 months after intervention.

 If benefit of CBSM is proven, study findings could lead to wider use of stress management programs, with increased life expectancy for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients.
