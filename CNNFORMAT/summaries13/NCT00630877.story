(fifthQuint)Evaluation of a Flushing ASsessment Tool (FAST) in Subjects Receiving Niacin Extended-release Plus Aspirin.

 This study was designed to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of the FAST questionnaire.

 The FAST is a self-administered questionnaire, completed using a hand-held electronic data capture device (LogPad e-diary).

 Subjects recorded the start and stop date and time of each flushing event, the presence and severity of individual flushing symptoms (redness, warmth, tingling and/or itching), and an overall assessment of their flushing experience.

 Evaluation of the psychometric characteristics of the FAST was based on 3 primary data analyses: 1 ) test-retest reliability based on the intraclass correlation coefficient; 2) construct validity based on Spearman correlation coefficients; and 3) responsiveness based on changes in FAST scores.

 The mean and maximum severity of flushing events, as measured by the FAST, were the primary variables evaluated in each of the 3 data analyses mentioned above.

 Psychometric analyses were performed blinded to treatment group assignment.

 Evaluation of a Flushing ASsessment Tool (FAST) in Subjects Receiving Niacin Extended-release Plus Aspirin@highlight

The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric characteristics (reliability, validity, and responsiveness) of a Flushing ASsessment Tool (FAST) in subjects receiving niacin extended-release (NER) plus aspirin (ASA) daily for 6 weeks.

 The FAST is a questionnaire that was developed to provide a detailed assessment of flushing symptoms and their impact in patients receiving niacin therapy.

 The effect of aspirin on flushing symptoms, as measured by the FAST, was also evaluated.
