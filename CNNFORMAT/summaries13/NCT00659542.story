(secondQuint)Glubran Mesh Fixation in Lichtenstein Hernioplasty.

 Repair of inguinal hernia in one of the most frequently performed surgical operation in western world.

 The technique of choice is currently to support inguinal tissues by using polypropylene mesh.

 Chronic postoperative pain and discomfort occur in 25-30% of patients after inguinal hernioplasty.

 Pain might be related to mesh fixation by sutures.

 This randomized study investigates whether mesh fixation by tissue glue (cyanoacrylate) is better than sutures.

 The patients are followed 1 year postoperatively.

 Pain, quality of life, operative parameters (time, cost) and recurrences are reported.
