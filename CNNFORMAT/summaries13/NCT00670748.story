(fifthQuint)Chemotherapy Followed by ESO-1 Lymphocytes and Aldesleukin to Treat Metastatic Cancer.

 Background: - We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both alpha and beta chains of a T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes the NY-ESO-1 (ESO) tumor antigen, which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with high efficiency (> 30%) without the need to perform any selection.

 - In co-cultures with human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A A serotype group (HLA-A2) and ESO double positive tumors, anti-ESO TCR transduced T cells secreted significant amount of interferon (IFN)-gamma and additional secretion of cytokines with high specificity.

 - Poxviruses encoding tumor antigens, similar to the replication-defective recombinant canarypox virus (ALVAC) ESO-1 vaccine have been shown to successfully immunize patients against these antigens.

 Objectives: Primary objectives: - Determine if the administration of anti-ESO TCR engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and aldesleukin to patients following a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen will result in clinical tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancer that expresses the ESO antigen.

 - Determine if the administration of anti-ESO TCR engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), aldesleukin, and ALVAC ESO-1 vaccine to patients following a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen will result in clinical tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancer that expresses the ESO antigen.

 Secondary objectives: - Determine the in vivo survival of TCR gene-engineered cells.

 - Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen.

 Eligibility: - Patients who are HLA-A*0201 positive and 18 years of age or older must have: - metastatic cancer whose tumors express the ESO antigen; - previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred to standard care for metastatic disease, except for melanoma patients; - Patients may not have: - contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.

 Design: - Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained by leukapheresis (approximately 5 X 10(9) cells) will be cultured in the presence of anti-cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) (OKT3) and aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.

 - Transduction is initiated by exposure of approximately 10(8) to 5 X 10(8) cells to retroviral vector supernatant containing the anti-ESO TCR genes.

 - Patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous infusion of ex vivo tumor reactive, TCR gene transduced PBMC plus intravenous (IV) aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg q8h for a maximum of 15 doses) with or without ALVAC ESO-1 vaccine.

 Subcutaneous injection of ALVAC ESO-1 vaccine will be administered on day 0 approximately 2 hours prior to intravenous infusion of cells and a second dose of ALVAC ESO-1 vaccine is given on day 14 (+/- 2 days).

 - Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor with physical examination, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and clinical laboratory evaluation four to six weeks after treatment.

 If the patient has stable disease (SD) or tumor shrinkage, repeat complete evaluations will be performed every 1-3 months.

 After the first year, patients continuing to respond will continue to be followed with this evaluation every 3-4 months until off study criteria are met.

 Cohorts 1 and 2: - Patients will be entered into two cohorts based on histology: cohort 1 will include patients with metastatic melanoma or renal cell cancer; cohort 2 will include patients with other types of metastatic cancer.

 - For each of the 2 strata evaluated, the study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled.

 For each of these two arms of the trial, if 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a clinical response, then no further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the first 21 evaluable patients enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will continue until a total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled in that stratum.

 - For both strata, the objective will be to determine if the combination of high dose aldesleukin, lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy, and anti-ESO TCR-gene engineered lymphocytes is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.

05) in favor of a modest 20% partial response (PR) + complete response (CR) rate (p1=0.

20).

 Cohorts 3 and 4: - For patients receiving ALVAC ESO-1 vaccine, patients will also be entered into two cohorts based on histology: cohort 3 for patients with metastatic melanoma or renal cell cancer and cohort 4 for patients with other histologies and all patients will receive the treatment regimen including the ALVAC ESO-1 vaccine.

 - For each of these 2 new strata, the study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled.

 For each of these two new cohorts of the trial, if 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a clinical response, then no further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the first 21 evaluable patients enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will continue until a total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled in that stratum.

 - For both strata, the objective will be to determine if the combination of high dose aldesleukin, lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy, anti-ESO TCR-gene engineered lymphocytes, and ALVAC ESO-1 vaccine is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.

05) in favor of a modest 20% PR + CR rate (p1=0.

 Chemotherapy Followed by ESO-1 Lymphocytes and Aldesleukin to Treat Metastatic Cancer@highlight

Background: -This study uses an experimental cancer treatment that uses the patient s own lymphocytes (type of white blood cell), which are specially selected and genetically modified to target and destroy their tumor.

 Objectives: -To test the safety of the treatment and determine if it can cause the patient s tumor to shrink.

 Eligibility: - Patients greater than 18 years and less than or equal to 66 years of age whose cancer has spread beyond the original site and does not respond to standard treatment.

 - Patients have tissue type human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201.

 - Patients cancer cells have the ESO-1 gene.

 Design: - Workup: Patients have scans, x-rays, laboratory tests, and other tests as needed.

 - Patients have leukapheresis to collect cells for laboratory treatment and later reinfusion.

 For this procedure, whole blood is collected thorough a tube in a vein, the desired cells are extracted from the blood, and the rest of the blood is returned to the patient.

 - Chemotherapy: Patients have low-dose chemotherapy for 1 week to prepare the immune system to receive the treated lymphocytes.

 - Cell infusion and aldesleukin (IL-2) treatment: Patients receive the lymphocytes by a 30-minute infusion through a vein.

 Starting within 24 hours of the infusion, they receive high-dose aldesleukin infusions every 8 hours for up to 5 days (maximum15 doses).

 - Recovery: Patients rest for 1 to 2 weeks to recover from the effects of chemotherapy and aldesleukin.

 - Tumor biopsy: Patients may be asked to undergo a biopsy (surgical removal of a small piece of tumor) after treatment to look at the effects of treatment on the immune cells in the tumor.

 - Follow-up: After treatment is completed, patients return to the clinic once a month for several months for physical examinations, a review of side effects, laboratory tests and scans.

 They may undergo leukapheresis at some visits to look at the effect of treatment on the immune system and check the viability of the infused cells.

 Patients then return to the National Institute of Health (NIH) clinic once a year for 5 years and then complete a follow-up questionnaire for another 10 years.

 - Retreatment: Patients whose tumor shrinks or disappears following treatment and then recurs may receive one additional treatment, using the same regimen of chemotherapy, lymphocyte infusion and IL-2 treatment.
