(secondQuint)Cetuximab (Erbitux), Capecitabine and Radiotherapy in Neoadjuvant Treatment of Patients With Rectal Cancer.

 Preoperative radiotherapy and 5-FU based chemotherapy, along with the complete resection of the mesorectum is a standard treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer.

Capecitabine has the potential to replace 5-FU as standard agent.

 Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against EGFR.

 Both agents are active in treatment of colorectal cancer and have demonstrated radiosensitising properties.

The trial aims to assess the efficacy, safety and toxicity of the combination of cetuximab, capecitabine and radiation in patients with stage II and III rectal cancer.
