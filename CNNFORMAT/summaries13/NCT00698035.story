(thirdQuint)Vaginal Testosterone Cream vs ESTRING for Vaginal Dryness or Decreased Libido in Early Stage Breast Cancer Patients.

 There is a growing body of scientific literature to suggest that sexual functioning is one of the most distressing problems experienced by breast cancer survivors.

 Vaginal dryness, dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse), and decreased libido are common complaints among breast cancer patients.

 With increasing use of aromatase inhibitors which are associated with a higher rate of vaginal dryness than tamoxifen, these problems are becoming even more prominent.

 This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the ESTRING and 1% testosterone cream administered vaginally as treatments for vaginal dryness and/or decreased libido in women receiving an aromatase inhibitor for early stage breast cancer.
