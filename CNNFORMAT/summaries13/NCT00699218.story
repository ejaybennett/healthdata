 A Pilot Study on Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) Treatment of Bipolar Depression@highlight

This is a pilot project to study if repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) will benefit patients with bipolar depression safely.

 Based on published studies, this study hypothesizes that rTMS on the left dorsal prefrontal lobe will improve symptoms in some patients who have failed at least two medications.
