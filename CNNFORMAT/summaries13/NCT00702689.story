(fifthQuint)Imatinib Mesylate to Treat Skin Changes in Patients With Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease.

 Background: Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT).

 The sclerotic skin manifestations of chronic cutaneous GVHD (ScGVHD) can lead to significant functional impairment and no satisfactory therapy exists to adequately treat this form of cGVHD.

 Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling, a key cytokine pathway which has been implicated in fibrotic disease in general, and in extensive cGVHD in particular.

 We hypothesize that treatment with imatinib mesylate will reduce the sclerotic manifestations of cGVHD as assessed by quantitative range of motion assessment of an affected joint.

 Objectives: Primary Objective: To investigate whether imatinib mesylate results in clinical improvement in skin fibrosis in children and adults with ScGVHD using range of motion assessment of affected joints.

 To determine if imatinib mesylate 200 mg daily is tolerated by patients with cGVHD.

 Secondary Objectives: To assess toxicity associated with imatinib mesylate in patients with cGVHD.

 To establish outcome criteria for the evaluation of ScGVHD using multi-modality objective and subjective assessments, including magnetic resonance imaging, skin scoring, and patient self-reported measures.

 To evaluate biomarkers of disease activity and correlative response measures to treatment with imatinib mesylate.

 To assess quality of life and functional measures of disease activity and to evaluate changes through the course of therapy.

 To evaluate the response of other organ manifestations affected by cGVHD to treatment with imatinib mesylate.

 To evaluate steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib mesylate in the cGVHD patient population.

 Eligibility: Patients age 4 years of age or older with the diagnosis of ScGVHD.

 Design: This is an open-label, pilot study of imatinib mesylate.

 Treatment cycles are 28-day cycles with no rest period between cycles.

 A target of 10 evaluable patients will be enrolled on this trial.

 Imatinib Mesylate to Treat Skin Changes in Patients With Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease@highlight

Background: Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication of stem cell transplant, resulting from the donor's immune cells attacking the cells of the body of the recipient.

 One effect of GVHD is fibrosis (scarring) of the skin that can lead to impaired function, decreased quality of life and increased risk of death.

 This is known as sclerotic skin changes of GVHD, or sclerodermatous graft versus host disease (ScGVHD).

 Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat cancer in humans and fibrosing conditions in animals.

 Objectives: To see if imatinib mesylate can improve ScGVHD and evaluate its effect on other GVHD symptoms To assess the side effects of imatinib mesylate in patients with GVHD To evaluate blood, body fluids and tissue samples in patients to try to better understand the biology of ScGVHD Eligibility: Patients 4 years of age and older with ScGVHD Design: Initial treatment: Participants take imatinib mesylate tablets once a day for up to 6 months, as long as their GVHD does not get worse and they do not develop unacceptable side effects of the drug.

 Evaluations: Participants are evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 months at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center with procedures that may include the following: Medical history and physical examination Blood and urine tests Lung function test Skin biopsy Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan Specialty consultations (e.

g.

, physical or rehabilitative therapy, dentist, eye doctor, dermatologist) Electrocardiogram (EKG) Echocardiogram (ultrasound test of the heart) Muga scan (nuclear medicine test of the heart) Quality-of-life questionnaires Apheresis (procedure for collecting quantities of white blood cells) Office visits with local physician once a week for 1 month, then once every 2 weeks for 5 months Followup visits at National Institutes of Health (NIH) every 6 months for 1 year Continuing treatment: Patients who improve continue to receive imatinib mesylate for up to 6 months after their best response and are followed for up to 2 years.

 Patients who continue to respond or who become worse after stopping treatment may receive additional treatment for up to 2 years.
