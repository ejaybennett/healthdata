(firstQuint)Feasibility Study of Mirasol-Treated Whole Blood Red Cell Recovery and Survival.

 Radiolabeling of red blood cells with subsequent autologous infusion of the donor is commonly used as a surrogate to evaluate circulation of red blood cells in vivo.

 By measuring the level of radioisotope in a blood sample, these tests evaluate what percentage of the red blood cells remain in the bloodstream after 24 hours (recovery) and can predict how long the red blood cells will remain in circulation (survival).

 The IMPROVE trial is a feasibility trial to evaluate these parameters in red blood cells obtained from whole blood units that have been treated with the Mirasol System.
