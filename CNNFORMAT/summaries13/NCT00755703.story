 Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Adenovirus-vectored, Intranasal Pandemic Influenza Vaccine.

@highlight

The purpose of this study is to test the recombinant vaccine for safety and immunogenicity in healthy adults volunteers.

 Single dose, intranasally administered vaccine using an adenovirus-recombinant vector has provided a safe route for inducing protection in animals against pandemic influenza in preclinical studies.

 The vaccine is non-replicating, tissue culture based and designed for intranasal delivery.
