(fifthQuint)A Study of Plasma Concentrations, Metabolism and Excretion of 14C-paliperidone After a Single Oral Dose.

 This study is designed as a single-center, single-dose, open-label study of the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of paliperidone in healthy men (3 extensive and 3 poor metabolizers based on CYP2D6 phenotype).

 Eligible volunteers will be admitted to the study center the evening before study drug administration and will remain at the study center until 168 hours after dosing (or longer if required up to a maximum of 14 days).

 Each volunteer will receive a single oral dose of 14C-paliperidone with total radioactivity below 1000 mu Sv (16 mCi).

 Blood samples for plasma pharmacokinetic profile will be obtained immediately before study drug administration and 0.

5, 1, 1.

5, 3, 6, 12, 16, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours postdose.

 Blood samples will be obtained 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours postdose for determination of 14C in whole blood.

 Samples for determination of serum creatinine will be obtained 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours postdose.

 Urine will be collected immediately prior to drug administration and from 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-16, 16-24, 24-36, 36-48, 48-72, 72-96, 96-120, 120-144, and 144-168 hours after study drug administration.

 Fecal samples will be collected per each stool, once before study drug administration and in the period from 0-168 hours after study drug administration.

 Collections of urine and feces (per 24 hours) will continue beyond 168 hours, to a maximum of 336 hours (Day 15) for patients who excrete radioactivity slowly (2 latest 24-hour urine collections each greater than or equal to 2% of total radioactive dose) or have mu Ci).

 The total radioactive load for the subject will remain lower than 1000 mu Sv.

 A Study of Plasma Concentrations, Metabolism and Excretion of 14C-paliperidone After a Single Oral Dose@highlight

The purposes of this study are to investigate the metabolic pathways of paliperidone and excretion of paliperidone and its metabolites in healthy adult male volunteers, both CYP2D6 poor and extensive metabolizers, after administration of a single 1-mg oral dose of 14C-paliperidone, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of paliperidone, and to determine the relationship between genotypes (CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, UGT1A1, and UGT1A6) and exposure to paliperidone and its metabolites.
