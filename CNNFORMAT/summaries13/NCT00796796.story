(firstQuint)Temsirolimus and Radiation for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 Temsirolimus has demonstrated anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic activity in multiple epithelial cancers, is well-tolerated, has non-overlapping toxicities with radiation, and has been shown to potentiate the effects of radiation in vitro.

 Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer is cured in a minority of patients with concurrent chemoradiation but newer agents are needed.

 In this study temsirolimus will be studied in combination with radiation in a phase I setting to establish safety.
