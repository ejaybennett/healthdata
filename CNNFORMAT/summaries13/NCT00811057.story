(fifthQuint)Tocolysis for Preterm Labor.

 Preterm labor is the most common complication of pregnancy and one of the most catastrophic occurring in 10-12% of all pregnancies and accounting for up to 80% of the neonatal morbidity1.

 In addition, the delivery of a very low birth weight baby often leads to a reduction in cognitive and academic skills as well an increased in mental retardation by age five2,3.

 While there are many strategies to treat women in preterm labor all of the agents which have been used have side effects, acutely prolong the pregnancy only for a few days, and there have been no universally accepted treatment for long term prolongation using oral tocolytics in the home4,5,6.

 While beta-agonists have been used for several decades as primary agents for acute tocolysis, side effects have led to these agents being relegated to adjunctive therapy or in home care program with the programmable subcutaneous pump7.

 Consequently there are no tocolytic agents approved by the FDA for use during pregnancy.

 The most common drug used for acute tocolysis is magnesium sulfate, which is administered intravenously to stop contractions8.

 While it appears to be effective for short-term tocolysis it is thought to be not as effective as anti-prostaglandins or calcium channel antagonists in quickly suppressing uterine activity.

 In addition, there has been controversy as to adverse effects on the neonate when this drug is used to impede uterine contractions9.

 Some authors feel that it causes adverse neurologic function in the baby where as others feel that it is not associated with any increase neonatal morbidity/mortality in premature infants9.

 Regardless, for clinicians treating women in preterm labor magnesium remains the main stay of therapy.

 Newer developments, however, point to the improved effectiveness of anti-prostaglandin agents and calcium channel antagonists as it concerns treating such patients7,11.

 Calcium channel antagonists are just as effective and appear to be safer than magnesium for primary tocolytic treatment of women in preterm labor12-14.

 Tocolytic treatment with anti-prostaglandin drugs such as indomethacin, a Cox-1 inhibitor, has demonstrated them to be the most effective and most rapid tocolytic agent available15.

 Initially there were reports of increasing complications with the use of this drug16,17.

 However, it has been shown that these concerns are unwarranted if indomethacin use is limited to 48 hours per treatment cycle and the amniotic fluid assessed for oligohydramnios; therefore, in pregnancies 4cm group (assuming 90% delivery within seven days) 40 patients in each group (120 women) will be necessary to have an 80% power of detecting (with a 25% reduction in deliveries with seven days) a significance of < 0.

 It is anticipated that it will take a time period of approximately two years to enroll this number of participants.

 Tocolysis for Preterm Labor@highlight

Preterm birth is the most common and costly complication in obstetrics.

 It complicates up to 11% of all pregnancies and it is responsible for 70% of sick babies.

 The ideal way to stop preterm labor when it occurs (which drug to use) is not known.

 Currently magnesium sulfate is used by about 95% of all practitioners, but recent data suggest magnesium given this way may be harmful for the baby's future development.

 Other drugs such as antiprostaglandin agents are very effective in stopping uterine activity, but particularly when used for >48 hours have been associated with both maternal and fetal sides effects.

 Lastly, calcium channel antagonists are effective in stopping contractions and have very little in the way of maternal and fetal side effects, but less data is available in the United States on their use.

 Because there is no FDA approved drug to stop preterm labor, we purpose to randomize all women with preterm labor (20-34 weeks) to receive one of the above three methods of stopping preterm labor.

 The primary outcomes will be to see which agent stops the uterine contractions most effectively, for the longest period of time with fewest relapses and results in significant prolongation of pregnancy.

 If one of these agents is clearly superior to the other two it would help women avoid early delivery or have significant extension of their pregnancy to avoid some of the complications of preterm birth in the baby.
