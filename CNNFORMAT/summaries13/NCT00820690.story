 Locally advanced breast cancer is a common condition in development countries.

 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy gives the opportunity to identify genetic signatures associated with objective clinical and pathological complete responses.

 Patients will receive doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide with paclitaxel.

 Tumor samples collected before and after chemotherapy will be analyzed.
