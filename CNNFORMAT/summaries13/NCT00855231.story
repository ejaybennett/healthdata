(secondQuint)Diagnostic Accuracy of Multislice CT Angiography for Acute Chest Pain.

 Adults at low to intermediate risk of acute coronary syndrome who present to the Emergency Department with symptoms suggestive of cardiac ischemia will undergo a blinded cardiac CT followed by a standard of care (SOC) strategy.

 Significant coronary artery disease on CT (coronary stenosis >50%) will be compared to an adjudicated diagnosis derived from clinical data and other diagnostic tests based on the SOC strategy.

 Costs for the SOC evaluation will be collected and compared to a CT-based evaluation.

 Patients will be followed for 3 years after enrollment to evaluate prognosis.

 Diagnostic Accuracy of Multislice CT Angiography for Acute Chest Pain@highlight

The ACUTE CT trial is designed to test whether the assessment of chest structures by high-resolution multislice computed tomography (CT) provides equivalent diagnostic accuracy for patient with acute chest pain or other potential cardiac symptoms as compared to a standard of care evaluation.
