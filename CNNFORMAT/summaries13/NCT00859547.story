(secondQuint)Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Recombinant Thrombin (rThrombin) in Pediatric Participants.

 The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of rThrombin have been evaluated in 5 Phase 2 studies, 1 pivotal Phase 3 study, and 1 Phase 3b study, in surgical indications such as: spinal surgery, major hepatic resection, peripheral arterial bypass surgery, arteriovenous graft formation for hemodialysis access, and burn wound excision.

 Limited data currently exist on the effects of rThrombin exposure in pediatric patients.

 This Phase 4 trial aims to provide additional information on the use of rThrombin in children by evaluating the drug's safety and immunogenicity when administered as an aid to hemostasis during burn wound excision and skin grafting in pediatric burn patients.
