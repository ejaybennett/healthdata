(firstQuint)The Influence of Aerobic Endurance Training After Roux-en-Y-Gastric Bypass.

 The only effective treatment for patients with morbid obesity is bariatric surgery.

 Sudden weight loss following bariatric operations for morbid obesity, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) can result in a concurrent decrease in lean body mass.

 However the long-time results (weight reduction, elimination co-morbidities) are depending on the post operative treatment.

 Aerobic physical exercising (APE) is well accepted in conservative treatment of obesity as well as of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM).

 The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of APE on weight loss, body composition and co-morbidities in patients after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass (RYGBP).
