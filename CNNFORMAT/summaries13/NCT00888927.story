(secondQuint)Safety Study to Evaluate Monoclonal Antibody KW-0761 in Subjects With Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma.

 This Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation clinical study will enroll up to 47 subjects with previously treated PTCL including CTCL.

 The study is comprised of a dose escalation phase (Phase 1) and a preliminary assessment of efficacy (Phase 2).

 In the dose escalation phase, the starting dose will be 0.

1 mg/kg administered i.

v.

 once every week for four weeks, followed by a 2-week observation period in the first treatment course.

 Succeeding dose levels will include 0.

3 and 1 mg/kg.

 During the first course of treatment if assessments performed at day 29 (end of week 4) indicate that a subject has demonstrated an overall CR, the subject may continue on study for up to an additional four infusions beyond CR on an every other week infusion schedule.

 Treatment will then be discontinued in order to determine duration of response.

 If a subject experiences a PR or SD, the subject may continue therapy after consultation between the investigator and the medical monitor on an every other week infusion schedule until disease progression occurs or other withdrawal criteria are met.
