(thirdQuint)Measurement of Recirculation During Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VV ECMO).

 At the present time there are no devices available to measure recirculation in patients on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

 The study uses an external monitor, laptop computer, clamp on flowsensors and ultrasound dilution technology to measure blood flow.

 Measurements are made by injecting 0.

5 - 1 ml/kg of sterile isotonic saline into the patient's extracorporeal circuit.

 The subject will be monitored throughout the measurements.

 The measurements will be coordinated with the regular care of the patient and their extracorporeal circuit.

 Measurement of Recirculation During Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VV ECMO)@highlight

This study is to test the usefulness of ultrasound dilution recirculation measurements in patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as therapy.

 The ultrasound dilution measurements determine the efficiency of support provided by venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

 At the present time there are no other devices available to make recirculation measurements.
