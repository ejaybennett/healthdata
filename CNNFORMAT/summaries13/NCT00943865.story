(fifthQuint)Three Lifestyle Interventions on Endothelial Function and Cardiometabolic Risk in Obese Patients With Metabolic Syndrome.

 It's a 12 week single center randomized controlled trial to evaluate three different lifestyle interventions on flow mediated vasodilatation, cardiometabolic profile and anthropometric parameters in non-diabetic persons with metabolic syndrome without coronary heart disease.

 After informed consent, they will be randomized to 3 different lifestyle interventions: 1.

 Hypocaloric tailored AHA type 1 diet plus standard exercise advice; 2.

 Pragmatic portion controlled healthy diet plus pedometers to perform 10.

000 steps daily or 3.

 pragmatic portion controlled healthy diet plus fitness under direct supervision,using heart rate monitors to adjust workload to achieve the target heart rate (75% of the maximum attainable heart rate - HRpeak, as determined by their individual maximal treadmill exercise test).

Main outcome is endothelium vasodilation accessed through brachial ultrasound, a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis.

 Secondary outcomes are anthropometric data: weight, waist circumference and fat proportion, cardiometabolic profile and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-R).

 Three Lifestyle Interventions on Endothelial Function and Cardiometabolic Risk in Obese Patients With Metabolic Syndrome@highlight

Obese patients with metabolic syndrome without diabetes or ischemic heart disease were randomized to three lifestyle interventions: 1.

 hypocaloric tailored diet with standard recommendations 2.

 pragmatic healthy style diet adapted to brazilian habits with portion control and pedometers to perform 10000 steps daily recorded or 3.

 pragmatic healthy style diet adapted to brazilian habits with portion control plus fitness three times a week under direct supervision.

 The main outcome was brachial reactivity, a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis, and secondary outcomes were cardiometabolic profile, arterial pressure and anthropometric measures: weight,waist circumference and bioimpedanciometry to access fat proportion and insulin sensitivity.
