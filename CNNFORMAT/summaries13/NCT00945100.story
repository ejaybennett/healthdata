(fifthQuint)Increasing Patching for Amblyopia in Children 3 to < 8 Years Old.

 Amblyopia is the most common cause of monocular visual impairment in both children and young and middle-aged adults.

 Both patching and atropine are accepted treatment modalities for the management of moderate amblyopia in children.

1 Many practitioners prescribe 2 hours daily patching as initial therapy for amblyopia.

 However, many children fail to achieve normal visual acuity in the amblyopic eye with this regimen.

 In a randomized trial conducted by PEDIG comparing patching regimens, 71 of 92 patients with moderate amblyopia (77%) had amblyopic eye visual acuity of 20/32 or worse after 4 months of patching 2 hours daily.

2 In another PEDIG randomized trial comparing patching to spectacles alone after a period of refractive adaptation, patients were treated with 2 hours daily patching and followed every 5 weeks until there was no improvement in amblyopic eye acuity.

 Fifty-five of 70 patients with moderate amblyopia (79%) and 14 of 14 patients with severe amblyopia (100%) had best-measured amblyopic eye visual acuity of 20/32 or worse after a median treatment period of 10 weeks.

3 When improvement with initial therapy stops and amblyopia is still present, treatment options include increasing the dosage of current treatment, switching to another treatment, maintaining the same treatment and dosage for additional months, or combining treatments.

 Many clinicians will choose to increase the dosage of the current treatment, in part because families have become comfortable with that particular mode of treatment.

 However, it is unknown whether increasing occlusion dosage will improve amblyopic eye visual acuity in these patients.

 We are unaware of any reports of response to intensified treatment of amblyopia.

 Increasing Patching for Amblyopia in Children 3 to < 8 Years Old@highlight

This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of increasing prescribed patching treatment from 2 to 6 daily hours after visual acuity has stabilized with initial treatment and amblyopia is still present.

 Children ages 3 to <8 years with visual acuity of 20/50 to 20/400 in the amblyopic eye will be enrolled in a run-in phase with 2 hours daily patching until no improvement, followed by randomization of eligible patients to patching 2 hours daily versus an average of 6 hours daily (42 hours per week).

 The primary objective is to determine if increasing patching dosage will improve visual acuity in patients with amblyopia still present after visual acuity has stabilized with initial treatment.
