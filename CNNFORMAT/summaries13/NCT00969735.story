(thirdQuint)Cryoenergy Or Radiofrequency for Pulmonary Vein Isolation.

 Pulmonary vein (PV) isolation using a radiofrequency catheter is the most widespread technique for atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation.

 These procedures are difficult and time-consuming, because they require precise catheter manipulation and multiple radiofrequency applications.

 Thus, alternative techniques are being investigated to simplify the procedure.

 Recently, a cryoenergy balloon catheter has been developed for PV isolation (Arctic Front(R), Cryocath Technologies).

 When this catheter is deployed at the PV antrum, it can create a circumferential lesion around the PV ostium by delivering a single cryoenergy application.

 An implantable loop recorder for AF detection has been made available (Reveal XT(R), Medtronic).

 It may help taking clinical decisions regarding anticoagulant and antiarrhythmic therapy and, at the same time, it may be a powerful tool to evaluate the efficacy of different therapeutic strategies.

 This is a prospective single-center randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety of PV cryoablation with the Arctic Front(R) catheter vs.

 the standard PV isolation using radiofrequency irrigated tip catheters.

 The efficacy of both strategies will be evaluated from a clinical point of view and from the detection and quantification of AF episodes by means of the Reveal XT(R) implantable loop recorder.
