(thirdQuint)An Interactive Web-Based Program to Improve Food and Activity Choices of Teens.

 Increasing numbers of youth are at risk for becoming overweight because of poor diets and low physical activity levels.

 Prevention is key to reducing the obesity problem.

 Intervention programs must be easily accessible, and include intervention materials in a format that draws attention and interest.

 This study evaluates an 8-week web-based intervention for teens to promote healthy food and physical activity choices.

 The web program includes role model stories, nutrition and activity information pieces, goal setting and problem solving, and self-monitoring.

 Students will complete assessments at baseline, 8-weeks post, and then 6 and 12-months post intervention.
