(thirdQuint)Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Apadenoson for Detection of Myocardial Perfusion Defects Using SPECT MPI.

 Adenosine is an effective vasodilator used in SPECT-Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (SPECT-MPI).

 However, it produces transient symptoms that are poorly tolerated by most subjects.

 PGxHealth has designed a multi-center, randomized crossover, double-blind study to compare the safety and effectiveness of apadenoson to adenosine (Adenoscan(R)) in SPECT-MPI.

 Subjects who are clinical candidates for SPECT-MPI will be enrolled to undergo two sequential SPECT-MPI studies.

 The first study will use adenosine as the stress agent in approximately 1300 subjects.

 Eligible subjects will then be randomized in a 1:2 assignment ratio to receive a second SPECT-MPI using either adenosine or apadenoson as the pharmacologic stress agent, with the goal of obtaining a total of 753 subjects who complete both studies.

 The similarity of the results from the two adenosine:adenosine stress tests will be compared to those from the adenosine:apadenoson tests to assess efficacy.

 The incidence and intensity of commonly reported side effects will be compared to evaluate improved tolerability.

 Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Apadenoson for Detection of Myocardial Perfusion Defects Using SPECT MPI@highlight

The purpose of this study is to see whether apadenoson is as effective as adenosine when used as a pharmacological stress agent in myocardial SPECT-Imaging to detect defects in the supply of blood to the heart muscle (myocardial perfusion defects).

 The study will also look at whether apadenoson is better tolerated than adenosine when used in SPECT-MPI.
