(firstQuint)Ranibizumab DosE Comparison and the Role of LAser in REtinal Vein Occlusions.

 The secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of 0.

5mg versus 2.

0mg of monthly ranibizumab injections in patients with macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion between baseline and month 6.

 At week 24, patients will be re-randomized to receive pro re nata (prn) ranibizumab+laser photocoagulation versus ranibizumab alone and the efficacy of both treatment options will be compared.

 Treatment efficacy will be assessed by comparing changes in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central subfiled thickness (CST) between the treatment groups.
