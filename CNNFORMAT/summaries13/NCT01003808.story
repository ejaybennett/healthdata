(firstQuint)Safety Study of a Recombinant Protein Vaccine to Treat Esophageal Cancer.

 The prognosis of esophageal cancer is improved with the improvement of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

 However, there are no standard therapies established for recurrent esophageal cancer.

 NY-ESO-1 antigen is expressed in 33% of patients.

 NY-ESO-1 protein is applicable without limitation by HLA types, and injected as a complex with cholesteryl pullulan (CHP), forming nano-particles (IMF-001), it can activate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

 In this phase 1 study, the safety and the biological recommended dose will be determined.
