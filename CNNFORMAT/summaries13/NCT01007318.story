(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of Single Port Laparoscopic Appendectomy in Acute Appendicitis.

 Laparoscopic appendectomy improved the postoperative functional outcomes in the treatment of acute appendectomy.

 In addition, recently single port laparoscopic surgery was introduced in the laparoscopy-dedicated center.

 When compared with conventional 3 port laparoscopic appendectomy, single port laparoscopic appendectomy was expected to be less painful, more rapid recovery of bowel function, and better cosmetic.

 In this prospective randomized trial, we tried to investigate the superiority of this new technique in adult patients with acute appendectomy.
