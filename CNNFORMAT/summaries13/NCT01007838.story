(fifthQuint)Intradialytic Progressive Resistance Training for Maintenance Haemodialysis Patients.

 Muscle wasting is common in patients with chronic kidney disease and has been associated with decreased ability to complete activities of daily living, increased hospitalisation and therefore and decreased quality of life.

 In other catabolic conditions, such as cancer or rheumatoid arthritis, exercise is an established treatment to reverse muscle wasting.

 It is uncertain whether exercise has this effect in the chronic kidney disease population due to an altered hormone system that may prevent the anabolic effects of exercise from occurring.

 However, progressive resistance training, which is exercise that is most effective at eliciting an anabolic response has not been effectively carried out with haemodialysis patients.

 Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether or not a twelve week intradialytic progressive resistance training programme will have an effect on muscle quantity, physical function and quality of life in patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a 12 week progressive resistance training during haemodialysis on muscle quantity and physical functioning in chronic kidney disease patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis.

 It is hypothesised, based on previous literature involving similar resistance training protocols in other catabolic conditions, that the resistance training will result in a significant increase in muscle quantity as well a physical function.
