(firstQuint)Outcomes in Rotator Cuff Repair Using Graft Reinforcement.

 Conexa is a surgical mesh derived from porcine dermis and processed to produce an acellular dermal matrix.

 It is designed to perform as a surgical mesh for use as a soft tissue patch to reinforce soft tissue where weaknesses exist and for the surgical repair of damaged or ruptured soft tissue membranes.

 The purpose of this post-market clinical study is to collect safety and efficacy data when Conexa is used to repair torn tendons of the rotator cuff.

 Conexa will be used in accordance with its labeling for this clinical study.
