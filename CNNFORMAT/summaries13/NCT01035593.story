(thirdQuint)Recombinant Human C1 Inhibitor for the Treatment of Early Antibody-Mediated Rejection in Renal Transplantation.

 This is an Investigator-initiated, prospective, open-label, randomized, adaptive design study to enroll 30 adult renal transplant recipients with biopsy-confirmed AMR within 30 days post transplantation.

 After informed consent is obtained and study eligibility is confirmed, subjects will be enrolled immediately after biopsy confirmation of AMR and positive donor specific antibody (DSA).

 Subjects will then be randomized into one of two treatment groups (SOC [control] or rhC1INH).

 An initial cohort of 8 subjects (3 SOC, 5 rhC1INH) will receive intensive safety monitoring of the coagulation system and for thromboembolic events.

The purpose of this study will be to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of rhC1INH in renal transplant recipients with biopsy-confirmed antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) within 30 days of renal transplantation.

 This study will combine the investigational drug rhC1INH with a standard regimen of plasmapheresis (PP) and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and compare this to PP and IVIG alone.
