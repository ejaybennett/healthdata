(firstQuint)Same-Day Discharge After Coronary Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA).

 The feasibility and safety of same day discharge post PCI will be examined.

 Study data will be compared to national registries and national or regional databases of PCI in Troponin negative patients with overnight stay.

 As part of the registry we will also assess compliance with dual antiplatelet therapy at six months and at 1 year and will record any reasons for premature discontinuation as well as any associated adverse events.
