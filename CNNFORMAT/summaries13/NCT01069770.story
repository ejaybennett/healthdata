 Neoadjuvant Sunitinib Treatment for Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to see whether neoadjuvant administration of Sunitinib reduces the size of the primary kidney tumor in patients with metastatic disease undergoing cytoreductive surgery.

 The study will also assess the safety of neoadjuvant Sunitinib, objective response rate, respectability of primary tumor, quality of life, and survival advantages.
