(secondQuint)Pilot Study Using Molecular Profiling to Find Potential Targets and Select Treatments for Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer.

.

 To determine the percent of patients with refractory breast cancer where molecular profiling and RPMA-based protein pathway activation analysis of their tumor, can change the clinical course of their disease (i.

 produce a Growth Modulation Index (GMI) 1.

3).

 The GMI is calculated as the ratio of Progression-free survival (PFS) under molecular profiling and RPMA analysis selected treatment to the time to progression (TTP) for the most recent regimen the patient has progressed on.

 Pilot Study Using Molecular Profiling to Find Potential Targets and Select Treatments for Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer.

@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate, that is the % of patients with non-progression of their metastatic breast cancer after 4 months on treatment that was selected by molecular testing and proteomics.
