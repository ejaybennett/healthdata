(fifthQuint)Temsirolimus, Bendamustine and Rituximab for Relapsed Follicular Lymphoma or Mantle Cell Lymphoma.

 The first part of the study is a phase I study in which the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of Temsirolimus, Bendamustine and Rituximab will be established.

 In the phase I part of the trial 3 patients will be included in each dose level.

 After inclusion of 3 patients, each patient has to receive at least 2 complete cycles without DLT until the enrolment into the next cohort can be initiated.

 In case of one DLT, 3 additional patients will be added to the specific dose level.

 If a second DLT appears, the last dose level without DLT will be considered the standard dose for the phase II trial.

 If the third dose level is achieved without any DLT, there will be no further dose escalation.

 In the phase II proportion of the trial, after establishment of a maximum tolerated dose, the efficacy of the combination regimens in two different patient cohorts will be evaluated.

 In the one cohort, 30 patients with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma will be treated; the second cohort will be composed of 30 patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma.

 Temsirolimus, Bendamustine and Rituximab for Relapsed Follicular Lymphoma or Mantle Cell Lymphoma@highlight

This is a multicenter, open label, single arm, phase I/II study.

 There will be no placebo usage within this trial.

 Phase I: Primary: To establish a maximum tolerated dose of the addition of Temsirolimus to a regimen of Bendamustine and Rituximab (BERT) in patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma.

 Phase II: Primary: To evaluate the ORR in patients with MCL or FL treated with the established BERT dose Secondary: To determine the complete remission rate, progression free survival rate and overall survival rate and to investigate safety and tolerability of BERT.
