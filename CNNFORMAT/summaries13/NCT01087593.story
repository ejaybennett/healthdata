(secondQuint)Estrogens Effect on Pain in Postmenopausal Women Suffering of Fibromyalgia.

 Fibromyalgia is a condition that preferentially affects women.

 Sex hormones, and in particular estrogens, have been shown to affect pain processing and pain sensitivity, and estrogen deficit has been considered a potential promoting factor for fibromyalgia.

 However, the effects of estrogen treatment in patients suffering from fibromyalgia have not been studied.

 Twenty-nine postmenopausal women were randomized to either eight weeks of treatment with transdermal 17-estradiol (50 ug daily) or placebo according to a double-blind protocol.

 A self-estimation of pain, a set of quantitative sensory tests measuring thresholds to temperature, thermal pain, cold pain and pressure pain, and a cold pressor test were performed at three occasions: before treatment, after eight weeks of treatment, and twenty weeks after cessation of treatment.
