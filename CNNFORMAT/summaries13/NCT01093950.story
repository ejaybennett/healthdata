(firstQuint)White Light Scanning to Aid Body Contouring: A Pilot Project.

 A 3-D digital body camera that employs non-intrusive white light phase profilometry and 24 coordinated charge-coupled cameras scans and produces a "point cloud" image of the subject.

 The result of the two-minute scan process is an accurate three-dimensional body model of the subject, consisting of over 1.

2 million surface points.

 The point cloud is compressed to provide programmable measurement extraction profiles (MEP's) that automatically extracts linear and circumferential measurements.

 Subjects are scanned and anthropometrically measured pre-operatively, and at 3, 6 and 9 months post-op.

A white light scanner can more accurately measure body contouring subjects than standard anthropomorphic methods.
