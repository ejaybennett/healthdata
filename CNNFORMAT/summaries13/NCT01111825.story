(thirdQuint)Temsirolimus Plus Neratinib for Patients With Metastatic HER2-Amplified or Triple Negative Breast Cancer.

 Phase I Design A standard, 3+3, dose escalation schedule to determine the MTD of temsirolimus in combination with neratinib with no intrapatient dose escalation and a starting dose of temsirolimus 8 mg administered intravenously (IV) weekly (dose level 1) and three patients enrolled in each cohort.

 Phase II Design The phase II portion of this trial is comprised of three cohorts.

 Two of the cohorts utilized a Simon two-stage design to determine the sample size to assess the efficacy of temsirolimus when administered in combination with neratinib: HER2-amplified and triple negative breast cancer.

 The third cohort was a single stage design with HER2-amplified patients and dose escalation.

This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center, multi-national, adaptive design, dose-escalation Phase 1/2 study to determine the MTD of temsirolimus with daily neratinib, and to determine the safety and efficacy of this combination when given to patients with advanced breast carcinoma, specifically trastuzumab-refractory HER2-amplified disease or triple-negative disease.
