(firstQuint)A Comparison of Changes in Bone Density With the Same Bone-health Plan, But With Different Bone-health Supplements.

 The US Surgeon General's Report on Bone Health suggests America's bone-health is in jeopardy and issued a "call to action" to develop bone-health plans that: 1.

 improve nutrition, 2.

 increase health literacy and, 3.

 increase physical activity.

 The purpose of this study was to use a comparative effective research model to compare 6-month changes in bone mineral density (BMD)in two study groups.

 Both followed the same bone health plan that contained the three components listed above with the same plant-source calcium supplement, but enhanced with different levels of calcium, vitamin D3, vitamin K and magnesium.
