(firstQuint)Measuring Signatures in the Fluid Surrounding the Spinal Cord in Patients Who Have Problems With Intrathecal Drug Delivery.

 The purpose of this feasibility study is to record cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signatures from subjects who have an implanted drug infusion system and who undergo clinical tests designed to troubleshoot possible catheter-related problems as part of their normal standard of care.

 Signatures will be correlated with physician-determined catheter status.
