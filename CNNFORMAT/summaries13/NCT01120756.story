(thirdQuint)Neural Bases of Cognitive Rehabilitation for Brain Injury.

 Brain injury often results in a disruption of attentional regulation processes, which reduces the efficiency and effectiveness of cognitive functions including learning, memory, problem-solving and goal management, leading to significant functional disability.

 Despite the importance of these problems, few effective interventions are available.

 Current projects involve developing novel theory-driven neural biomarkers and behavioral measurement tools and training interventions that target attentional control processes.

 The collection of results will help delineate neural mechanisms that support improved attention regulation that may serve as neurobiological targets for the development of novel interventions that enhance the benefits of rehabilitation.

 In a controlled intervention study design, individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and chronic executive control dysfunction will participate in comparison interventions, with pre- and post-intervention measurements of performance on neurocognitive 'challenge' tests assessing targeted and non-targeted domains, functional performance in low structure 'real-world' settings, and functional MRI measurements assessing goal-directed information processing.

 The interventions are: Goal-oriented attentional self-regulation (GOALS) training, Brain Health Education (EDU), Pathfinder Attention Regulation Training (PATH), and Tonic and Phasic Alertness Training (TAPAT).

 GOALS is designed to train attention regulation skills with meta-cognitive strategies for goal management, with application to participant-selected projects.

 Brain Health Education is designed to increase knowledge and understanding of key factors that affect brain functioning.

 Pathfinder training is designed to intensively train goal-directed self-regulation skills using a combination of digital game scenarios and application to personal life.

 TAPAT is designed to improve alertness at two levels: tonic attention of sustained attention and phasic alertness, or the capacity to rapidly and effectively interrupt an ongoing response pattern.

 Participants undergo fMRI, neuropsychological and functional assessments at baseline,, after the interventions, and at follow-up.

 Neural Bases of Cognitive Rehabilitation for Brain Injury@highlight

Some of the most common and disabling consequences of brain injury are deficits in cognition, such as difficulty with sustained attention, memory, organization, and goal management.

 The long-term goal of this research program is to develop and test novel neuroscience-based cognitive assessment tools and interventions for improving attentional regulation and related "executive function" brain processes involved in goal-directed behavior.
