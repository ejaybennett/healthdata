(secondQuint)The Gravity-VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia) Trial.

 This study is planned to compare, in patients sedated, intubated or tracheostomized and mechanically ventilated, the efficacy and safety of two body positions in reducing incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

 The semi-recumbent position prevents gastro-oropharyngeal aspiration of bacteria laden gastric contents and the "gastro-pulmonary" route of colonization.

 The lateral-Trendelenburg position aims to promote outward drainage of bacteria-laden oropharyngeal secretion, while avoiding bacterial translocation from the oropharynx into the lungs.
