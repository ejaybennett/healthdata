(secondQuint)Effectiveness of the Association Artesunate and Mefloquine in the Treatment of Malaria by Plasmodium Falciparum.

 - Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of the fixed combination of artesunate + mefloquine in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum, in the county (municipality) of Cruzeiro do Sul, Jurua Valley, State of Acre (AC), Brazil, where it was being used as specific first-line drug.

 - Selection Criteria : Persons aged between 6 months and 70 years with history of fever in the last 48 hours that had a confirmed diagnosis of mono-infection by Plasmodium falciparum (F or F+Fg) with parasitemia of 250 to 100000 parasites/1/2l and absence of signs of severe malaria, malnutrition or another severe disease.
