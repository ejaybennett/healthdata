 Vitamin D and Inflammatory Markers of Cardiovascular Disease in African Americans With Type 2 Diabetes@highlight

Recent clinical trials in non diabetics showed that vitamin D supplementation markedly reduced serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, and tissue matrix metallo-proteinases.

 Our study objective is to evaluate if administration of vitamin D in African Americans with hypovitaminosis D and DM Type 2 decreases serum levels of inflammatory/thrombotic markers such as CRP: Highly Sensitive C Reactive Protein.
