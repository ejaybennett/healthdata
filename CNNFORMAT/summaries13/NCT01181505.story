(firstQuint)STUDY The Effect of HNF-4A G60D Variant on the In VIVO CYP2D6 Activity By Tolterodine Pharmacokinetic Study.

 After a single oral administration of 2 mg tolterodine in 31 healthy subjects (6 with the heterozygous mutation of HNF-4A G60D vs 25 subjects with wild type of that whose CYP2D6 genotype and gender were matched with variant group), blood were collected for 24hrs.
