(fifthQuint)Open Label Study to Evaluate Chronic Hepatitis C Treatment in Latino Subjects With and Without HIV Co-infection.

 Hepatitis C is a major health problem affecting 100- 300 million individuals worldwide.

 Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection leads to cirrhosis in approximately 20% of subjects over a period of 1-20 years.

 Hepatitis C is now the most common indication for liver transplantation in the United States.

 infection occurs in one-third of all HIV-infected individuals, and the natural history among HIV-1 infected individuals demonstrates higher levels of HCV viremia, faster rates of progression and cirrhosis.

 There have been very few studies addressing the lower therapeutic response rates in minorities outside of African Americans.

 A recent study showed that Latino white subjects respond less effectively (34%) than non Latino white subjects (49%) given the same treatment even after adjusting for various important factors.

 As the current landscape for treatment of HCV changes, it would be important to evaluate factors responsible for therapeutic response in Latino patients.

 This is a study to address the genetic, epigenetic, and proteomic expression during therapy for chronic hepatitis C in Latino participants with and without HIV co-infection.

 One hundred Latino participants who have evidence of chronic hepatitis C with and without HIV who are receiving treatment for HCV will be enrolled.

 The results of this study will enable us to explore reasons for the differential therapeutic response rates with Hepatitis C treatment in Latino participants with and without HIV coinfection.

 Open Label Study to Evaluate Chronic Hepatitis C Treatment in Latino Subjects With and Without HIV Co-infection@highlight

- Peginterferon alfa-2a has been approved by the U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat adults with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with liver disease who have not been previously treated with interferon-alpha drugs (which improve immune system response to infection).

 Ribavirin has been approved by the FDA and is usually given in combination with interferon drugs such as peginterferon alfa-2a for treatment of chronic HCV.

 - Recent research shows that Latino whites do not respond as well to treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin as non-Latino whites.

 Various factors such as excessive weight, gender, and insulin resistance were evaluated to explain this difference, but research suggests that underlying factors related to Latino or non-Latino background, possibly genetic and immune differences, may be affecting the response to HCV infection and treatment.

 However, more research is needed on the effectiveness of peginterferon and ribavirin in Latino subjects with HCV, and with combined and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection.

 Objectives: - To evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and viral response of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C in Latino participants with and without HIV co-infection.

 This is an observational study.

 The observed treatment is received and managed through their primary care.
