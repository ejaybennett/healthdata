(fifthQuint)Sleepiness and the Effects of CPAP on Salivary Cortisol and Alpha-Amylase Levels in Patients With Sleep Apnea.

 It has been shown that there is an inconsistent response in serum cortisol levels in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), but it is undetermined whether a change in hormone level was not seen due to compliance issues in these long-term studies.

 These investigators will be employing compliance monitoring continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines and also assessing "sleepiness" before and after therapy.

 Sleepiness is the dependent variable in our study and will be measured subjectively using sleepiness scales and objectively using Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) and an autonomic measure using pupillometry prior, during and after treatment.

 Sleepiness and the Effects of CPAP on Salivary Cortisol and Alpha-Amylase Levels in Patients With Sleep Apnea@highlight

Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) will evidence higher levels of salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase levels prior to use of placebo and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and will evidence a decrease in these levels after consistent use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy as compared to placebo.

 Their level of sleepiness will also decrease with the use of CPAP therapy and will correlate with the levels of salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase in relation to their subjective sleepiness scale, Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT), and pupillometry.
