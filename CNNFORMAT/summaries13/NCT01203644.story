(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetics of SKY0402 in Subjects Undergoing Inguinal Hernia Repair.

 SKY0402 was administered in a dose escalating/de-escalating fashion, with a low starting dose in Cohort 1 that was to be increased or decreased in subsequent cohorts based on safety and analgesic effects.

 The decision to proceed to the next cohort (i.

e.

, increase or decrease the dose) was made by a Cohort Data Review Committee following a review of the data from the previous cohort.

 Subjects were randomized to receive either SKY0402 or bupivacaine HCl at a ratio of 1:1 in Cohort 1 and at a ratio of 3:1 in subsequent cohorts.

 The dose of bupivacaine HCl (100 mg) remained constant for all cohorts.

 Evaluation of the Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetics of SKY0402 in Subjects Undergoing Inguinal Hernia Repair@highlight

The primary objective of this study was to determine the appropriate dose of SKY0402 for the management of postoperative pain following inguinal hernia repair.

 This study evaluated the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of SKY0402 compared with a 100 mg dose of bupivacaine HCl for the treatment of postoperative pain in subjects undergoing inguinal hernia repair.

 Study drug was administered by surgical wound infiltration at the end of the hernia repair procedure.
