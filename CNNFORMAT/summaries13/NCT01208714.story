(fifthQuint)Medical and Endovascular Treatment of Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis (METRAS Study).

 Background Renal atherosclerotic stenosis (RAS) is an increasingly prevalent causes of secondary hypertension (HT), and is becoming one of the first causes of end-stage renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy in an aging population.

 Atherosclerotic RAS is associated with a high cardiovascular risk profile leading to a considerable excess rate of morbidity and mortality from stroke, coronary heart and peripheral vascular disease.

 Recent advances in antihypertensive drug therapy and in intensive risk factor management prompted the undertaking of prospective randomized trials that compared percutaneous renal angioplasty (PTRAS) with medical therapy.

 Unexpectedly, these trials failed to show compelling benefits of revascularization when added to effective medical therapy.

 However, they had serious limitations, which raised a number of criticisms, and limited to weight of their conclusions.

 Hence, clinicians are still left with uncertainties as to whether and in what patients revascularization should be pursued.

 It is conceivable that only a study design exploiting an optimized patient selection strategy and a use of hard experimental endpoints could resolve these uncertainties and thus lead to a better clinical management of the increasing population with atherosclerotic RAS.

 Objectives.

 The primary objective of the METRAS study is to determine if revascularization by means of PTRAS is superior or equivalent to optimal medical treatment for preserving glomerular filtration rate in the ischemic kidney as assessed by 99TcDTPA sequential renal scintiscan.

 Secondary objectives (see appropriate section) will be to determine if the two treatments are equivalent in lowering blood pressure (BP), preserving overall renal function and regressing damage in the target organs of hypertension.

 Design: prospective multicenter randomized, unblinded two-arm study.

 Enrolment.

 Eligible patients entail adult hypertensive of both genders with clinical and/or radiological evidence of unilateral or bilateral RAS.

 Clinical evidence of RAS will be unexplained renal dysfunction (GFR 70% or, if 0.

80 at the Doppler analysis was claimed to predict no improvement of BP or renal function, as assessed by measuring the creatinine clearance.

 However, the latter is an index of global function, and therefore provides no information on the GFR of the ischemic kidney.

 This study, by randomizing patients for matching RI values, is expected to clarify whether endovascular treatment can slower GFR loss even in the patients with nephroangiosclerosis.

 Moreover, by meeting its secondary endpoints it will help clarifying some clinically relevant issues as the BP lowering, the rate of renal and major cardiovascular events, and the change in quality of life with/without endovascular treatment in patients with atherosclerotic RAS.

 Duration of the study.

 The METRAS Study will last for 5 years.

 This time interval is expected to be sufficient to register renal and major cardiovascular events.

 Centers.

 This study will be performed within the Italian Society of Arterial Hypertension (SIIA) to achieve randomization of the number of patients needed to provide significant power to the study.

 A core laboratory in Padova will adjudicate the eligible patients and will randomize patients.

 Conclusions and Perspectives.

 The METRAS Study has been designed to provide a conclusive answer to a very debated question: is angioplasty combined with stenting and associated with optimal medical therapy equivalent to the optimal medical treatment alone in preventing deterioration of renal function, assessed as GFR in the ischemic kidney? A novel approach, consisting in evaluating deterioration of renal function, as assessed as GFR in the ischemic kidney, rather than the overall GFR, will clarify if PTRAS can protect a kidney with stenotic artery from functional declining.

 Medical and Endovascular Treatment of Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis (METRAS Study)@highlight

Renal atherosclerotic stenosis (RAS) is a prevalent cause of secondary hypertension (HT).

 Since there are still uncertainties as to whether and in what patients revascularization by means of percutaneous renal angioplasty (PTRAS) should be pursued, we designed a study exploiting an optimized patient selection strategy and using hard experimental endpoints to unravel these uncertainties.

 Primary objective: to determine if revascularization by means of PTRAS is superior or equivalent to optimal medical treatment for preserving glomerular filtration rate in the ischemic kidney as assessed by 99mTcDTPA sequential renal scintiscan.

 Secondary objectives: to determine if the two treatments are equivalent in lowering blood pressure (BP), preserving overall renal function and regressing damage in the target organs of hypertension.

 Design: prospective multicenter randomized, unblinded two-arm study.

 Eligible patients will have clinical and/or radiological evidence of unilateral or bilateral RAS, defined by stenosis of the proximal portion of the renal artery and its main bifurcations at angioCT.

 Duplex scan will exclude nephroangiosclerosis as the latter could bias the assessment of the outcome of revascularization.

 Inclusion criteria.

 RAS affecting the main renal artery or its major branches at angio-CT either > 70% or, if < 70 with post-stenotic dilatation.

 Renal function will be assessed with 99mTc-DTPA renal scintigraphy.

 Sample size (30 patients per arm) was calculated to have a 90% power to detect a difference in means of GFR in the vascularized (or control untreated kidney) of 7.

5 ml/min.

 Arms 1.

 Revascularization: digital scan angiography and PTA with stenting of the renal artery at the ostium or at truncular level, plus optimal medical therapy.

 2.

 Medical therapy: the drug regimen that had been optimized during the run-in period.

 Experimental endpoints: The absolute value of GFR assessed by 99TcDTPA in the ischemic kidney will be used as quantitative variable and compared between groups at each time point.

 A categorical definition of kidney loss, defined as a GFR in the ischemic kidney of < 5 ml/min, will be also used and the rate of achievement of such endpoint will be compared.

 Duration: 5 years.
