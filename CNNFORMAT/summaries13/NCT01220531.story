(fifthQuint)Thymus Transplantation Safety-Efficacy.

 Complete DiGeorge anomaly (cDGA) is a congenital disorder characterized by athymia.

 Without successful treatment, children remain immunodeficient and usually die by age 2 years.

 In complete DiGeorge subjects, thymus transplantation with and without immunosuppression has resulted in diverse T cell development and good T cell function.

 The purpose of this expanded access study is to continue thymus transplantation safety and efficacy research for the treatment of complete DiGeorge anomaly.

 Until thymus transplantation is FDA approved as standard care for DiGeorge anomaly, research study participation is the only means by which a patient may have access to this potentially life-saving procedure.

 This protocol includes 4 groups: one for subjects who do not require immunosuppression; and 3 immunosuppression groups for subjects with different T cell function levels to be suppressed adequately.

 Eligible subjects undergo thymus transplantation and may undergo an allograft biopsy.

 Protocol specified studies continue until approximately one year post-transplantation.

 Study participation lasts two years or until thymus recipients are asked to participate in a long term follow up study.

 Thymus Transplantation Safety-Efficacy@highlight

Complete DiGeorge anomaly (cDGA) is a disorder in which there is no thymus function.

 With no thymus function, bone marrow stem cells do not develop into T cells, which fight infection.

 Complete DiGeorge anomaly patients cannot fight infection and are immunodeficient.

 Without successful treatment, cDGA patients usually die by age 2 years.

 Thymus transplantation with and without immunosuppression (drugs given before and after transplantation) has resulted in the development good T cell function in complete DiGeorge anomaly subjects.

 This expanded access study continues thymus transplantation safety and efficacy research for the treatment of complete DiGeorge anomaly.

 Eligible participants undergo thymus transplantation and biopsy.

 Immune function testing is continued for one year post-transplantation.
