(secondQuint)Investigating Re-Dosing With Otelixizumab in Adults With Newly-Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.

 The primary objective of this phase IIa, open-label, multi-centre study is to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of re-dosing at 6 months with an 8 consecutive day series of otelixizumab intravenous (IV) infusions in 8 adult subjects with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

 Although it is hoped that the cell preserving effect of otelixizumab will be long-lasting, it is possible that the effect may decline over time and thus T1DM subjects may require re-treatment.

 Six months is the minimum time expected between treatments.

 After baseline assessments, eligible subjects will receive 8 consecutive days of otelixizumab infusions, each given over a 30 minute period.

 Prophylaxis for cytokine release syndrome AEs will be given.

 At Month 6, following a review of any new medical conditions, concomitant medications, lymphocyte count, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) viral load and other re-dosing eligibility criteria, subjects will be re-treated with the same dosing regimen.

 Subjects will be followed for 24 months in this study.
