(fifthQuint)Safety and Immunogenicity Study to Assess TDV, a Live Attenuated Tetravalent Vaccine for Prevention of Dengue Fever.

 This is a single center, placebo-controlled, randomized study assessing the safety and tolerability of two dose levels (low and high) of TDV administered subcutaneously or intradermally in two doses separated by an interval of 90 days.

 Initial dosing of low dose cohort will be performed and Day 21 safety assessed prior to administration of second dose to low dose cohort on Day 90 and initial dosing of high dose cohort.

 Day 21 safety for the high dose cohort will be assessed prior to administration of second dose for this cohort.

 Safety (local injection site reactions and solicited and unsolicited adverse events) will be assessed through Day 120 post-first (1 month after the second dose).

 Immunogenicity will be assessed at specified time points up to Day 120 post-prime (1 month after the second dose) and again on Days 180 and 270 (6 and 9 months post-first).

 Safety and Immunogenicity Study to Assess TDV, a Live Attenuated Tetravalent Vaccine for Prevention of Dengue Fever@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV) (previously DENVax) in healthy adults when given as either a subcutaneous (SC) or intradermal (ID) injection at two dose levels (low and high).

 The vaccine will be given as two doses 90 days apart.

 Safety assessments include injection site evaluation and adverse events.

 The immune response generated after vaccination will be assessed up to 9 months after the first vaccination.
