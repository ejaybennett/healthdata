(secondQuint)Dengue Virus NS1 Antigen (Bio-Rad) Clinical Protocol.

 Dengue is an endemic disease that is increasingly more common in tropical climates and the dengue epidemic in Puerto Rico (May 2009) presents a risk to the blood supply in Puerto Rico.

 Also, on July 13th 2010 federal officials reported an outbreak of dengue fever in Florida after a survey of Key West residents found that at least 5% had been infected or exposed to the virus.

 Therefore this IND study is being carried out to identify blood donors carrying the dengue virus using the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag (Bio-Rad, France).

 Prospective testing is being performed on blood donors who have read an information sheet regarding the use of donated blood samples in research.

 Testing will occur at the American Red Cross, Charlotte, NC NTL site.
