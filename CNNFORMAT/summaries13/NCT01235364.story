(secondQuint)Assessment of Pain With Insertion of the Foley Catheter for Induction of Labour.

 The most common method described for placing the Foley catheter is under direct visualisation of the cervix during a sterile speculum examination.

 Another method is to place the catheter during a digital cervical examination.

 Maternal discomfort/pain during speculum placement of the catheter has been evaluated in a few studies whereas studies that compare the digital method with the speculum method of placement are lacking.

 The visual analogue scale is used to subjectively assess pain.

 With a skin conductance algesimeter an objective assessment of pain is possible.

 Assessment of Pain With Insertion of the Foley Catheter for Induction of Labour@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess pain in women randomised to digital or speculum placement of a Foley catheter.

 Pain during cervical ripening with the Foley catheter is also to be evaluated as well as maternal satisfaction with induction of labour.
