(secondQuint)RIBS IV (Restenosis Intra-stent of Drug-eluting Stents: Paclitaxel-eluting Balloon vs Everolimus-eluting Stent).

 Treatment of patients with drug-eluting stent restenosis remains a major clinical and technical challenge.

 Currently, drug-eluting stents are widely used in the management of these patients.

 Recently, the value of the paclitaxel-eluting balloon in this clinical setting has been suggested.

 However, there is only scarce observational data on the value of this new balloon in patients with drug-eluting stent restenosis.

 This prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial will compare two different interventional strategies (namely, paclitaxel-eluting balloon vs everolimus-eluting stent) in the treatment of patients with drug-eluting stent restenosis.

 RIBS IV (Restenosis Intra-stent of Drug-eluting Stents: Paclitaxel-eluting Balloon vs Everolimus-eluting Stent)@highlight

Treatment of patients with drug-eluting stent restenosis remains a challenge.

 This study will assess which interventional strategy (paclitaxel-eluting balloon vs everolimus-eluting stent) is superior in the treatment of patients suffering from drug-eluting stent restenosis.
