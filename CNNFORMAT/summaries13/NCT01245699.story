(thirdQuint)MIHS Emergency Department CPR Quality Improvement Project.

 The Emergency Department will be using E-series unit manufactured by ZOLL Medical Group (Chelmsford, MA).

 These units are equipped with an accelerometer-based system that allows for measurement of chest compression depth and rate.

 These units are also equipped with RealCPRHelp, and FDA-approved technology that provides real-time audiovisual feedback to providers on the quality of chest compressions.

 In the first phase of the project, the ED providers will utilize the E-series units to treat all patients requiring chest compressions.

The investigators will quantify the quality of chest compressions provided in the Emergency Department and determine whether the quality of chest compressions is related to patient outcome.

 The quality of chest compressions and patient outcomes will be assessed both before and after the introduction of audiovisual feedback in real time.
