(secondQuint)TPF Followed by Cetuximab and IMRT Plus Carbon Ion Boost for Locally Advanced Head and Neck Tumors.

 TPF-C-HIT is a prospective, monocentric phase II trial efficacy, as measured by control and survival rates, as well as toxicity (acute and late effects) of the combined treatment with TPF-induction followed by radioimmunotherapy with the EGFR-antibody cetuximab and carbon ion boost in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).

 As long-term local control remains a therapeutic challenge in advanced head and neck cancer, locoregional control was chosen as the primary endpoint.

 Secondary endpoints are survival rates (disease-free survival, PFS, OS), acute and late radiation effects as well as adverse events.

 For development of prognostic markers, proteomic and genomic analyses are also included in the secondary endpoints.
