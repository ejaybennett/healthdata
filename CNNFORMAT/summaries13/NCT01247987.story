(thirdQuint)Comparison of Transfers of Thawed Blastocysts Versus Blastocysts Derived From Thawed Bipronuclear Oocytes.

 Subjects will be randomized to one of two study groups during their cycles of in vitro fertilization (IVF).

 In one group, the subjects will have all of their embryos cryopreserved at the blastocyst stage, followed by thaw and transfer in a subsequent cycle.

 In the other group, subjects will have all of their embryos cryopreserved at the bipronuclear oocyte stage, followed by thaw, extended culture, and transfer in a subsequent cycle.

 Comparison of Transfers of Thawed Blastocysts Versus Blastocysts Derived From Thawed Bipronuclear Oocytes@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if cryopreservation at the blastocyst stage followed by embryo thaw and transfer is as effective as cryopreservation of bipronuclear oocytes followed by post-thaw extended culture (PTEC), and blastocyst transfer.

 Effectiveness will be measured by the rate of ongoing pregnancy at 10 weeks gestation.
