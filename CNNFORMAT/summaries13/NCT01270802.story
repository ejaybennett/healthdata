(secondQuint)Effects of Switching Efavirenz to Raltegravir on Vascular Function and Bone Markers in HIV-infected Patients.

 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an increasingly important comorbidity in HIV-infected patients.

 Our preliminary data suggests that efavirenz may worsen endothelial function, which in turn may increase the risk for future CVD events.

 Efavirenz has also been linked to lower vitamin D levels, which may in turn result in increased bone fragility.

 Raltegravir is not known to affect either endothelial function or vitamin D levels.

 Therefore, switching efavirenz to raltegravir in patients with suppressed HIV viremia may lead to improved outcomes.

Efavirenz, a commonly used HIV medication, may cause worsening vascular function and bone problems.

 The purpose of this study is to determine if switching efavirenz to raltegravir, a newer HIV medication, will improve vascular function and tests of bone health.
