(firstQuint)Pediatric Radial Arterial Cannulation.

 In infants, percutaneous cannulation of radial artery requires considerable expertise.

 People have been using Doppler guided radial artery cannulation technique to improve success rate for more than 20 years.

 Recently, Ultrasound sonography has been utilized for central line placement in pediatrics.

 The purpose of this study is whether ultrasound guided radial artery cannulation technique improves the success rate compared to traditional doppler guided technique.
