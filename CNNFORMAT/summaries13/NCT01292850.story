(secondQuint)Skin Sterility After Ethyl-Chloride Spray.

 This is an IRB-approved, prospective, blinded, controlled study.

 In the first set of experiments, skin sterility is assessed.

 Healthy adult subjects are prepared for mock injections of shoulders and knees.

 No injection is performed.

 Each site has a set of 3 skin cultures: 1) prior to the alcohol prep (pre-prep), 2) post-alcohol prep (pre-spray), and 3) after ethyl-chloride was sprayed on the site (post-spray).

 In the second set of experiments, sterility of ethyl chloride is tested directly by culturing the liquid from the spray bottles.

 Skin Sterility After Ethyl-Chloride Spray@highlight

The aim of this study is to investigate sterility of ethyl-chloride topical anesthetic spray when used prior to an injection.

 The hypothesis is that the spray does not change the sterility of the injection site after skin is prepped.
