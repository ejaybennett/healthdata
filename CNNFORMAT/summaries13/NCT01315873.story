(fifthQuint)Bortezomib and Bendamustine to Treat Relapsed/Refractory Myeloma.

 Patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma who have a measurable paraprotein in the serum or urine or measurable protein by Freelite or measurable disease by plasmacytoma will be given a combination of bendamustine and bortezomib each cycle.

 Response rate (PR or better after 2 cycles) and duration of response will be assessed.

 Therapy will be continued until disease progression.

 The bendamustine would be used in a day 1, day 4 dosing schedule after each dose of bortezomib to take advantage of the chemosensitizing properties of bortezomib.

 This minimizes the days of treatment to just the first week and allows rebound of blood counts.

 This will be a phase II trial with dose reduction as necessary.

 Bendamustine is a drug which appears to be non-cross-resistant with other alkylating agents in vitro and in vivo.

 Thus, we hypothesize that the combination of bortezomib and bendamustine will have activity in relapsed/refractory myeloma.

 Bortezomib and Bendamustine to Treat Relapsed/Refractory Myeloma@highlight

Patients with myeloma that has either not responded to previous treatment or has returned after previous treatment will be given a combination of the drugs bendamustine and bortezomib.

 The bortezomib and bendamustine will be given using an intravenous line (IV) on days 1 and 4 of each cycle, with bortezomib being given first, before each dose of bendamustine.

 Each cycle will be 28 days long, so patients will be treated the first week of each cycle and then have 3 weeks 'off' (without any treatment).

 Disease assessments will be performed on day 22 of each cycle.

 Patients will receive the study drugs until their disease progresses or they are withdrawn from the study.

 In other studies, bendamustine seems to work well with other drugs.

 Thus, this study hopes to show that the combination of bortezomib and bendamustine will have activity in relapsed/refractory myeloma.
