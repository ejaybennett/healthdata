(secondQuint)Comparison of Safety And Efficacy of Neuraxial Anesthesia, Palpation Versus Ultrasound.

 It is known that ultrasound can be useful to assist placement of epidural analgesia among pregnant women.

extenseve research on the usefulness of ultrasound imaging to facilitate the placement of neuraxial anesthesia in pregnant have been done.

The potential advantages of successful placement among non-pregnant patients include increases the safety and comfort.

 In our study all patients schedueld to receive an nueraxial anesthesia for non-obstetric surgery will be included.

The investigator will request permission from the Helsinki committee of hadassah university hospital.

Patients will be requesting for surgery and will be randomized to one of two study groups.

One group will be passed neuraxial anesthesia on the standart technique and the secound group will be passed neuraxial anesthesia with the help of ultrasound.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether use of the ultrasound to locate the epidural space and assist with performing neuraxial anesthesia will decrease numbers of the attempts required for successful placement of epidural catheter.
