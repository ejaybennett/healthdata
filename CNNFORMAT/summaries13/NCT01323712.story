(fifthQuint)Vitamin D Supplementation and Cardiac Hypertrophy in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).

 Impact of Vitamin D supplementation on Cardiac Hypertrophy and Function in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients- A randomised placebo controlled trial.

 1.

 Lay summary: Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) are up to 3.

5 times more likely to die from diseases of heart and blood vessels (Cardiovascular Disease-CVD).

 Vitamin D insufficiency is very common in CKD and associated with CVD.

 Animal studies have shown an improvement in heart size and function with Vitamin D therapy, although evidence in humans is lacking.

 The proposed study will test if oral Vitamin D treatment, in deficient CKD patients, will improve heart enlargement and function.

 With these proposed changes the investigators expect to reduce CVD and deaths in patients with CKD.

 Abstract of proposed investigation: Traditional risk factors inadequately explain the disproportionate increase in CV risk in CKD.

 Hypovitaminosis D is common in CKD and associated with increased CV mortality.

 In animal experiments, vitamin D reduces LV mass (LVM) and improves systolic function.

 In dialysis patients, observational studies show that vitamin D therapy reduces CV mortality and improves diastolic function.

 However, benefit of native vitamin D repletion on cardiac structure and function has not been investigated in humans.

 The investigators propose to test in a randomised, placebo-controlled trial, if 40 weeks of oral Colecalciferol, in predialysis CKD patients, will result in reduction of LV mass and improvement in systolic/diastolic function along with cardiac extracellular matrix composition.

 Currently, NICE does not recommend routine measurement of vitamin D in CKD patients.

 If effective in this setting, further outcome trials will prove if this inexpensive and easily administered therapy can be routinely prescribed to prevent morbidity and mortality.

 Background to the project and pilot data: (i) CVD in CKD: CV death rates are up to 3.

4 times higher in patients with CKD compared to the general population(1).

 The investigators and others have demonstrated a graded relationship between CV events and death with declining renal function(2).

 Traditional risk factors only partially explain the elevated risk.

 This highlights the importance of non-traditional risk factors such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and vitamin D deficiency as modifiable CV risk factors in CKD.

 (ii) Vitamin D deficiency in the general population and in CKD Hypovitaminosis D is common in general population.

 A study by Thadhani's group of 15,088 adults has shown the prevalence of Vitamin D insufficiency to be between 40-80% in the US general population(3).

 CKD patients are at an increased risk of hypovitaminosis D.

 In a group of 145 non-dialysis CKD patients from south London, have seen a 85% prevalence of Vitamin D insufficiency [25 hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D)73 to 16561 g/m2) on transthoracic echocardiogram over 15 weeks(12).

 However, no studies thus far have investigated the effects of native vitamin D repletion on cardiac structure and function, as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in predialysis CKD.

 (v) Vitamin D and cardiac fibrosis: Recent evidence using gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), suggests that cardiac fibrosis is a predominant feature of uremic cardiomyopathy(13).

 Animal studies have demonstrated an important role of vitamin D in maintaining extracellular matrix (ECM) composition in the heart.

 In vitamin D receptor knockout mice model there is marked increase in cardiac fibrosis, related to abnormal expression of collagenases(14).

 Studies by Diez's group in hypertensive heart disease subjects have identified a reliable serum biomarker that reflects type 1 collagen synthesis in human heart- Carboxy-terminal propeptide of procollagen type 1 (PICP)(15).

 Serum PICP along with free Matrix metalloproteinases 1 (MMP-1) and free Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP 1), as markers of collagen degradation accurately reflect collagen metabolism in the heart(15).

 PICP is released in a 1:1 ratio during the synthesis of type 1 collagen, from its precursor procollagen type 1.

 Furthermore, peripheral serum PICP accurately reflect amount of collagen type 1 fibres in the heart(16) and can therefore be used to monitor the effects of treatment on collagen content of the heart(17).

 However, no studies thus far have shown an effect of vitamin D therapy on changes in ECM composition within the human heart.

 (vi) Abnormal LV size with systolic and diastolic dysfunction in pre dialysis CKD patients: In a group of 18 consecutive stable stage 4 and 5 CKD patients, deemed suitable for renal transplantation, the investigators have seen significant increase in LVM, interventricular septal (IVS) diameter and posterior wall diameter with systolic and diastolic dysfunction; using a combination of Transthoracic and Cardiac Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) echocardiography, compared to normal controls.

 (5) Original Hypothesis The investigators propose that 40 weeks treatment with oral Colecalciferol will improve cardiac structure and function in predialysis CKD patients, as a consequence of improvement in cardiac ECM composition and turnover.

 The investigators plan to address this central hypothesis through the following specific aims: (i) Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of oral Colecalciferol therapy on left ventricular mass as measured by CMR imaging.

 The investigators expect a 10g reduction in LVM on CMR in active treatment group compared to controls.

 (ii) Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of oral Colecalciferol therapy on cardiac systolic function by cardiac TDI and diastolic function by transthoracic echocardiography.

 Systolic function will be measured as an improvement in average longitudinal peak systolic strain rate (SR) and longitudinal end systolic strain (S) assessed at the base, mid wall and apex of the IVS, lateral, inferior and anterior wall on cardiac TDI.

 Improvement in diastolic function will be measured by early (peak E) and late (peak A), trans-mitral flow and annulus motion, isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) and deceleration time (DT) on transthoracic echocardiogram.

 These parameters will be tested in randomised placebo controlled trial involving 25 patients in each arm.

 25 hydroxy vitamin D3 [25 (OH) D] has been used in this proposal, as CKD stage 3-4 patients would be expected to have adequate stores of 1 -hydroxylase enzyme to convert 25 (OH) D to active 1,25 (OH)2 D.

 The investigators will measure the level of 25 hydroxy colecalciferol to ensure adequate repletion.

 Colecalciferol has been shown to be safe and effective when given at this dose(18;19).

 To examine the improvement in ECM composition and turnover the investigators will demonstrate reduction in cardiac collagen content as measured by decrease in serum PICP and Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1(TIMP1) and an increase in serum Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1).

 PICP will be corrected for eGFR and bone alkPO4.

 MMP1/TIMP1 ratio will be used to measure the collagen degradation.

 Cardiac function pre and post therapy, will also be assessed by measuring plasma N-Terminal proBNP (NT proBNP).

 Furthermore, a biobank of whole cells, mRNA and DNA, blood and urine will be created for future analysis of novel genes or biological pathways.

 (6) Experimental detail and design of proposed project (i) Study Population: Vitamin D naive patients will be recruited from the general nephrology outpatient clinics from St.

 George's, Guy's and Kingston hospitals.

 Patients with 25 (OH) D deficiency [(25 (OH) D = 0.

05 and Power=95%].

 Accounting for a dropout rate of 30%, the investigators will recruit 25 patients in each group.

 Comparisons for continuous variables will be performed using independent sample t-test between the active treatment and placebo group.

 (8) Expected value of results The investigators are confident that the study is adequately powered to show a 10 gm change in LVM, using MR scan at Reza Rezavi's laboratory, if it exists; similarly a change in systolic function using echocardiogram at the expert laboratory at St Georges.

 The investigators will also be able to examine the role of fibrosis in the LVH and systolic dysfunction by measuring biomarkers at Javier Diez's laboratory.

 A large CKD patient population at St George's, Guy's and Kingston Hospitals will facilitate recruitment.

 Figure 3: Timeline expressed in weeks showing planning, recruitment and anticipated randomization of 50 patients with 25 (OH) vitamin D levels 5mmol/L, Hb 13gm% and persistent high office BP(> 150/90mmHg).

 - Although patients in our pilot study were young, the investigators expect proportionate improvement in parameters in the trial participants as well.

 - The investigators are conscious that improvement in LV function and morphology has not been previously shown with vitamin D therapy in human subjects.

 However, evidence of genomic effects of vitamin D on cardiac myocytes, extracellular matrix and myocardial contractility are well established in animal studies.

 Most importantly, this study explores a novel anti-fibrotic mechanism of vitamin D therapy in humans, which could provide the proof of principle for use of vitamin D in other disease states such as autoimmune disorders.
