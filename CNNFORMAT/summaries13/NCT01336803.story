(thirdQuint)Differentiation of Bone Sarcomas and Osteomyelitis With Ferumoxytol-Enhanced MRI.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Establish magnetic resonance (MR) imaging characteristics of bone sarcomas and osteomyelitis based on their ferumoxytol-enhancement on relatively early postcontrast T1-weighted images.

 II.

 Establish MR imaging characteristics of bone sarcomas and osteomyelitis based on their ferumoxytol-enhancement on delayed postcontrast T2-weighted images.

 III.

 Establish T2-weighted MR imaging characteristics of iron labeled mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) in osteonecrotic bone over time, before and after surgical core decompression and bone marrow implantation.

 IV.

 Adding a second branch for patients who can not receive ferumoxytol but still getting the MRI exam.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive ferumoxytol intravenously (IV) and then undergo ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI up to 1 hour after infusion and up to 24 hours post-infusion.

 Differentiation of Bone Sarcomas and Osteomyelitis With Ferumoxytol-Enhanced MRI@highlight

This pilot trial studies the differentiation of bone sarcomas and osteomyelitis with ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

 Imaging procedures that allow doctors to more accurately differentiate between malignant bone sarcomas and osteomyelitis may help in diagnosing patients correctly and may result in more timely treatment.
