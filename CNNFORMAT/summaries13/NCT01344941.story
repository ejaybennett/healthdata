(secondQuint)Human Immune Responses Toward HIV-1 Envelope Antigens.

 The goal of this protocol is to understand how human lymphocytes respond to HIV-1 antigens in the context of vaccination or infection.

 This protocol will support understanding of the immune response by providing a source of lymphocytes and serum from selected individuals to study in laboratory based investigations.

 Blood samples from individuals who have received an HIV-1 vaccine, individuals who are HIV-1-infected, and individuals who are HIV-1-uninfected are requested to: (1) test previously vaccinated volunteers for HIV-1 envelope-specific B-cell and T-cell immune activities, and (2) increase understanding of how the human immune system processes and responds to HIV-1 envelope proteins.

 Human Immune Responses Toward HIV-1 Envelope Antigens@highlight

The primary objectives of this study is to - Define the envelope-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in humans who have received a St.

 Jude HIV-1 vaccine.

 - Describe mechanisms of HIV-1 envelope processing and consequent B-cell and T-cell activities.
