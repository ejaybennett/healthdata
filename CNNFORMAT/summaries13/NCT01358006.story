(secondQuint)A Dose-Ranging Study of JNJ-40411813 in Healthy Male Volunteers.

 This will be an open-label (volunteers and study staff will know the identity of assigned treatment), dose-ranging study to determine 5-HT2A receptor engagement by JNJ-40411813 as a function of dose and time in healthy male volunteers.

 The study will consist of an eligibility screening examination, an open-label treatment period and a follow-up examination (approximately 10 days after dose administration, a follow-up examination will be performed).

 Initially, 4 volunteers (Cohort 1) will be included to determine 5-HT2A receptor occupancy following single dose administration of JNJ-40411813.

 Dependent on the results, doses for the remaining 8 volunteers (Cohort 2 and 3) will be selected to further characterize 5-HT2A receptor occupancy within the feasible dose range up to maximally 700 mg JNJ-40411813.

The maximal study duration for a volunteer will be 6 weeks.

 In this study, [11C]-MDL 100,907 will be used as positron emission tomography (PET) ligand to investigate the concentration-related binding of 40411813 to the 5-HT2A receptor in the brain.

 JNJ-40411813 (200 mg to 700 mg) will be taken orally (by mouth).

 If multiple capsules have to be taken, the actual intake may be spread over a 15-minute period.

 Study drug will be administered to each volunteer just after completion of a meal and within 30 minutes after the start of the meal.

The purpose of this study is to characterize the 5-HT2A binding over the maximum feasible dose range of JNJ-40411813, to estimate the plasma concentration associated with 50% 5-HT2A binding, and to investigate the safety and tolerability of JNJ-40411813 in healthy male volunteers.
