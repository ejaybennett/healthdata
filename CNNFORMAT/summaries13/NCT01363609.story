(fifthQuint)Effects of Glucagon Like Peptide-1(GLP-1) and Liraglutide on Brain Satiety and Reward Circuits and Feeding Behavior in Diabetes.

 First aim will be addressed in a cross-sectional randomized study.

 20 healthy, lean and 20 obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) will be exposed to food cues and with concomitant infusion of glucagon Like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist or saline, to assess the involvement of endogenous GLP-1, secreted in response to a meal.

 Measurements activation of CNS circuits involved in satiety and reward will be performed using blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

 The second aim will be addressed in cross-over randomized-controlled trial (RCT) in the T2DM patients only.

 Patients will be randomly assigned liraglutide vs insulin glargine treatment, during a treatment period of 12 weeks each with a 12-week washout period in between.

 The investigators will perform the same fMRI protocol.

 The third aim will be addressed in a study with obese individuals who are scheduled for a gastric bypass surgery.

 The same protocol as for the first aim will be performed and this will be before and after the surgery in the same individuals.

 Effects of Glucagon Like Peptide-1(GLP-1) and Liraglutide on Brain Satiety and Reward Circuits and Feeding Behavior in Diabetes@highlight

The aim of this study is to investigate if endogenous Glucagon Like Peptide -1 (GLP-1) has an effect on brain satiety and reward systems and if there are alterations in obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

 Secondly, the aim is to investigate whether treatment with a GLP-1 analog, liraglutide, restores these signals in obese patients with type 2 diabetes.

 Finally, also the endogenous GLP-1 effects will be investigated in obese individuals before and after gastric bypass surgery on brain satiety and reward systems.
