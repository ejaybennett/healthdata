 This is because of a lack of randomized controlled studies in the treatment of post-TBI depression.

 This study is designed to examine the safety and effectiveness of escitalopram in the treatment of post-TBI depression.

 It will also investigate metabolic changes and neural pathways associated with post-TBI depression and metabolic alterations after treatment through neuroimaging.
