(secondQuint)Neural Cardiac Therapy for Heart Failure Study (NECTAR-HF).

 The objectives of this study are to assess the impact of right vagal nerve stimulation on left ventricular remodeling, functional capacity, quality of life, and other measures in heart failure patients over a 6-month period.

 In addition, the study will assess the safety of the NECTAR-HF study system over an 18-month period.
