(secondQuint)Saphenous Vein Allografts for Coronary Bypass.

 This Study is designed as a combination retrospective/prospective single center study in which all patients will be eligible for enrollment based on having a previous implant of CryoVein Saphenous Vein for CABG during the 2008-2010 time frame.

 A comprehensive chart review of former and previously implanted allograft patients will be performed for the retrospective portion of this Study.

 An effort will be made to include all patients from this site.

 Eligible patients will be consented into the Study for a single, prospective, observational imaging evaluation of their bypass conduits.
