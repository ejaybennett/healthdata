(secondQuint)Type 1 Diabetes and Eating Disorder Diurnal Glucose Patterns.

 The specific aims of the proposed research are to: 2.

1 Determine the degree of variation in glycemic profiles of individuals with an Eating Disorder and Type 1 Diabetes (ED-DMT1) and an Eating Disorder only (ED/only); and 2.

2 Determine the impact of nutritional intake and planned physical activity on glucose profiles of individuals with ED-DMT1 and ED/only.

 These aims will be examined by characterizing: - glucose exposure, as measured by area under the Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) median curve; - glucose variability, as measured by the AGP inter-quartile range; and - glucose stability, as measured by change in the AGP median curve.

 Type 1 Diabetes and Eating Disorder Diurnal Glucose Patterns@highlight

The purpose of this study is to use data from the Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) to determine the degree of variation in glucose levels of individuals with an eating disorder and type 1 diabetes and only an eating disorder.
