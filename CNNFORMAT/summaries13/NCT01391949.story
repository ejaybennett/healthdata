(secondQuint)Pedaling Exercises for Disability and Activity Limitations.

 The UCFit (University of California's U Cycle to Fitness) device is a standard commercial arm and leg restorator modified to collect pedaling data and to transmit it wirelessly to a central database, allowing for remote exercise monitoring.

 In this study, patients with stroke will perform pedaling exercise on the UCFit device prior to and then for a period of twelve weeks after discharge to home from inpatient rehabilitation.

 Differing levels of feedback will be provided to study subjects and corresponding changes in the amount of pedaling and walking performed will be identified.

 The results of this study will offer insight into the activity levels of disabled persons in their home environments.

 Furthermore, it will help in the identification of strategies that can increase activity levels in the critical period after discharge to home.
