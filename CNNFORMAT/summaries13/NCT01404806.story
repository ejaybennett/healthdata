(firstQuint)GSK1349572 Exposure in Blood, Cervicovaginal Fluid, and Cervical and Vaginal Tissue in Healthy Female Subjects.

 Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe first dose and steady state pharmacokinetics of GSK1349572 in cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) and vaginal (VT) and cervical (CT) tissue compared to blood plasma (BP) in HIV-1 negative women.

 Based on current literature, GSK1349572 has demonstrated a desirable pharmacokinetic profile in BP, including low to moderate pharmacokinetic variability (CV% 9-41), extended t1/2 (13-15h) and trough concentrations which remain 25-fold higher than the protein-adjusted IC90 ~0.

064 mu g/mL for wild type virus.

 Understanding pharmacokinetic behavior of GSK1349572 in multiple female biological compartments will inform its role in sterilizing the genital tract in HIV-infected women, as well as protect mucosal tissue against HIV infection (pre/post-exposure prophylaxis).
