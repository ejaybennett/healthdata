(secondQuint)Efficacy of Cricoid Pressure in Occluding the Esophageal Entrance: A Glidescope  Study.

 Eighty-nine patients undergoing surgeries necessitating general anesthesia and tracheal intubation were enrolled in this study.

 Group 1 (OB) including obese patients (n= 59) was undergoing bariatric surgery.

 Following rapid sequence induction/intubation (RSII) anesthesia with cricoid pressure, clear view of the vocals cord and the entrance to the esophagus were assessed using Glidescope(R) video laryngoscope before intubation and following intubation.

 Following securing the airway, efficacy of cricoid pressure was tested by the capability to insert gastric tubes (20 and 38 Fr) under direct vision using GVL.

 Group 2 (NOB) including non-obese patients (n=30) was undergoing moderate surgery requiring tracheal intubation under general anesthesia.

 Efficacy of cricoid pressure was also tested similarly using GT's (20 and 38 Fr) following induction of anesthesia and before intubation.

 Inability of GT insertion was recorded as non-patent esophagus (effective CP) and successful insertion of GT was recorded as patent esophagus (ineffective CP).

 Then CP was released and insertion of GT achieved for correct verification of the esophageal opening position in both groups.

 Efficacy of Cricoid Pressure in Occluding the Esophageal Entrance: A Glidescope  Study@highlight

This investigation was designed to assess the patency of the esophageal entrance during cricoid pressure (CP) in anesthetized, paralyzed obese and non obese patients using the Glidescope (R) video laryngoscope (GVL).
