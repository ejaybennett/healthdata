(firstQuint)Randomized RT +/- Lapatinib for Advanced Solid Tumor Cancer Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy for Metastatic Disease.

 Lapatinib is an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of ERBB1 and ERBB2 (HER2).

 It is currently indicated for use in patients with HER2 over-expressing metastatic breast cancer.

 Serum increases in TGF can have growth potentiating effects on distant sites of metastatic disease.

 Palliative irradiation paradoxically may promote distant tumor growth; blocking shedding of TGF from irradiated tumors may prevent this effect and improve the therapeutic index of radiation therapy.

Lapatinib will prevent radiation-induced increase in Transforming Growth Factor alpha (TGF), an important growth factor in cancer cell recovery after ionizing irradiation.
