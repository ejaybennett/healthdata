(thirdQuint)Melatonin Versus Placebo for Benzodiazepine Discontinuation in Patients With Schizophrenia.

 Treatment of schizophrenia frequently includes prolonged administration of benzodiazepines despite lack of evidence of its use.

 It is often difficult to discontinue use of benzodiazepines because of development of dependence.

 After being randomized to prolonged-release melatonin (Circadin(R)) 2 mg daily versus matching placebo, participants are required to slowly taper off their benzodiazepine dose towards no intake.

 Data are collected at baseline and at 6 months follow-up regarding medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, sleep, laboratory tests, adverse events, psychopathology, social function, and quality of life.

 Data on medical treatment, cognition, adverse events, social function, and quality of life are also collected at 2 and 4 months follow-up.

 The results from this trial will assess if melatonin has a role in withdrawing long-term benzodiazepine administration in schizophrenia patients.

 This group of patients is difficult to treat and therefore often subject to polypharmacy which may play a role in the reduced life expectancy compared to the background population.

 In addition, the data of the trial are also analyzed as an observational cohort design to investigate the association of benzodiazepine dose reduction/discontinuation with psychophysiology, cognition, sleep, quality of life, and other selected variables (not further described below, see trial protocol).

 Knowledge of these important clinical aspects is lacking in this group of patients.

 Melatonin Versus Placebo for Benzodiazepine Discontinuation in Patients With Schizophrenia@highlight

In this trial, researchers aim to investigate if prolonged-release melatonin can facilitate the withdrawal of chronic benzodiazepine administration in patients with schizophrenia.

 Furthermore, researchers will investigate the association of benzodiazepine dose reduction with the following clinically important variables: sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life.
