(thirdQuint)Optimization of NULOJIX Usage As A Means of Avoiding CNI and Steroids in Renal Transplantation.

 Dialysis or kidney transplant are the two ways to treat kidney failure.

 Transplant recipients have to take anti-rejection medications to prevent their immune system (the body's natural defense system against illness) from rejecting their new kidney.

 Most patients who undergo a kidney transplant must take these anti-rejection medications for the rest of their lives.

 Taking standard anti-rejection medications for a long time can cause serious side effects, including kidney damage.

 There would be a benefit to finding new anti-rejection medications that work just as well, but don't damage the kidney.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether a new drug, Nulojix(R) (belatacept), would minimize serious long term side effects associated with anti-rejection medications while still protecting the new kidney from damage.

 The researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of this treatment and long term health of the transplanted kidney.
