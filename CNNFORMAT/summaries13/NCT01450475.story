(fifthQuint)Study of Remote Ischemic Postconditioning.

 Cardiac surgery is associated with Troponin release because of ischemia/reperfusion injury in approximately one third of cases.

 And I/R injury may also induce cerebral insult, even Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD).

Transient sublethal episodes of ischemia before a prolonged ischemia/reperfusion injury, known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC), have been shown to reduce the extent of myocardial infarction (MI).

And remote ischemic postconditioning(RIPoC), as another ischemic condition, limits MI size in animal models.

 However, there are limited outcome to demonstrate protection from RIPoC during cardiac surgery.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate the cardiac and cerebral protective effect of remote ischemic postconditioning , as a single-center, randomized controlled trial.

 Study of Remote Ischemic Postconditioning@highlight

Cardiac surgery is associated with cardiac and cerebral injury because of ischemia/reperfusion in approximately one third of cases.

 Ischemic preconditioning (IPC), have been shown to reduce the extent of myocardial infarction (MI).

 As another ischemic conditioning, remote ischemic postconditioning, limits MI size in animal models.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cardiac and cerebral protective effect of remote ischemic postconditioning in children undergoing cardiac surgery, as a single-center, randomized controlled trial.
