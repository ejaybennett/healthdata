(firstQuint)Characterization of the Variability of Insulin Secretory Parameters in the Meal Tolerance and the Maximal Stimulation Tests of Healthy Subjects.

 A three-year observational study to standardize the meal tolerance and maximum stimulational tests for measuring beta cell function in the clinical setting.

 It also aims to improve methods for the early prediction of the long-term response to an intervention and for identification of patients at risk for rapid beta cell function deterioration, thereby enabling future clinical studies that examine diabetes progression.
