(thirdQuint)A Study on the Effects of LY2409021 on the Electrical Impulses of the Heart.

 This is a 2 part study.

 Part A is a single-dose study to compare the effects of a meal on glucose, insulin and QT in healthy participants with and without LY2409021.

 Part B of this study is a randomized, 3-period, crossover design, in which participants and investigators are blinded to placebo and LY2409021, and will assess the electrophysiological effects of a single supratherapeutic dose of LY2409021 compared to a positive control (moxifloxacin) and placebo.

 A Study on the Effects of LY2409021 on the Electrical Impulses of the Heart@highlight

Part A: The purpose of Part A of the study is to look at the electrocardiogram (ECG) effects due to blood sugar changes after a meal compared to when LY2409021 is also given with a meal.

 Part B: The purpose of Part B is to evaluate the effect of LY2409021, when given at a dose level much higher than what would normally be given, on the electrical activity of the heart as measured by ECG in relation to placebo and moxifloxacin.
