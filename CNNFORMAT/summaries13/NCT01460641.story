(secondQuint)Perfusion CT as a Predictor of Treatment Response in Patients With Rectal Cancer.

 Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) technology have made CT perfusion imaging feasible for the assessment of tumor perfusion in solid tumors of the abdomen.

 CT perfusion has shown promising results in serving as a noninvasive method of predicting response to therapy in cancer patients.

 CT perfusion parameters have also been found to correlate with immunohistologic markers of angiogenesis in a number of solid tumors, suggesting a possible role for CT perfusion as a noninvasive biomarker of tumor angiogenesis.

 The goals of the investigators study are twofold: first, to determine the relationship between baseline CT perfusion characteristics of rectal cancers and their response to treatment, and second, to determine if perfusion CT can be used to subsequently monitor tumor response to treatment.

 The investigators hope to enroll those patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing standard CT for pre-treatment planning, integrating CT perfusion imaging into the current abdomen/pelvis imaging protocol with close clinical and radiologic follow-up after treatment to determine response to therapy and time to disease progression.

 Perfusion CT as a Predictor of Treatment Response in Patients With Rectal Cancer@highlight

A research study of rectal cancer perfusion (how blood flows to the rectum over time).

 We hope to learn whether perfusion characteristics of rectal masses may be predictive of response to treatment and whether rectal perfusion characteristics can be used to follow response to treatment.
