(fifthQuint)Lubiprostone Effect on Gastrointestinal Tract Transit Times Measured by Smartpill in Patients With Chronic Constipation.

 Lubiprostone is an effective treatment for chronic constipation.

 The mechanism of action of lubiprostone is through increasing fluid and mucus secretion and improving lubrication of the intestinal lumen.

 The effects of lubiprostone on gastrointestinal (GI) transit and small bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) have not been sufficiently explored.

 The current study was designed to investigate whether: (a) lubiprostone alters GI transit and (b) affects SIBO in constipated patients.

 Twenty nine female patients (mean age of 39 year: range 19-64) with chronic constipation received 2 weeks of lubiprostone (24 mcg b.

).

 Stool consistency based on Bristol stool scale and the frequency of bowel movements were recorded.

 Gastric emptying time (GET), small bowel transit time (SBTT), colon transit time (CTT), combined small & large bowel transit time (SLBTT) and whole gut transit time (WGT) were measured using wireless motility capsule.

 Small bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) status was assessed by the lactulose breath test.

 Lubiprostone Effect on Gastrointestinal Tract Transit Times Measured by Smartpill in Patients With Chronic Constipation@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if lubiprostone may change the rate of movement of food and activities in the stomach and intestines in subjects whose gastrointestinal (GI) tract is slower due to constipation.

 To be able to measure the time difference in the duration of transit of the FDA approved SmartPill capsule in all segments of gastrointestinal (GI) tract before and after exposure to lubiprostone.

 The investigators anticipate to capture the possibility to reduce/eliminate the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in chronically constipated patients after administration of study drug- lubiprostone.
