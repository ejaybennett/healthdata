(secondQuint)Everolimus and Pasireotide (SOM230) in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 This open label, single-arm Phase II study will assess time to progression (TTP) and safety of everolimus and pasireotide in patients with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and limited prior systemic therapy.

 Should this regimen demonstrate efficacy, this will support a Phase III randomized clinical trial of this combination therapy.

 At least 30 patients will be enrolled into this Phase II study.

 Additionally, given the potential importance of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and RAS/pAKT pathways, we propose to correlate outcomes with baseline pAKT, p-S6, somatostatin receptor tumor expression, and serum VEGF expression.

 We anticipate these exploratory analyses will increase understanding of the molecular pathways and their inhibition in this disease.

 The study will be performed as a University of North Carolina-coordinated, multicenter study.

 Everolimus and Pasireotide (SOM230) in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma@highlight

The purpose of this study is to estimate the time to disease progression when everolimus and pasireotide are given together in patients with advanced or metastatic HCC who have not had any prior systemic therapy.
