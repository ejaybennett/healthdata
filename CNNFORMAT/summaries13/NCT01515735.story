(secondQuint)LOXL1 Polymorphism in Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome.

 To evaluate the association profiles of the lysyl oxidase-like 1 gene polymorphisms with pseudoexfoliation syndrome in the Korean population, peripheral blood sampling will be done from the patients with pseudoexfoliation.

 And genotypes of the three single nucleotide polymorphisms of lysyl oxidase-like 1 gene , rs1048661, rs3825942, rs2165241 were analyzed by direct sequencing.
