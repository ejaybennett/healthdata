(firstQuint)Reducing Radioisotope Dose: the Half-Dose CZT Study.

 The aim of this study is to compare the image quality of the half radioisotope dose scans obtained using a CZT (cadmium zinc telluride) camera with scans acquired using a standard of care imaging protocol/radioisotope dose performed on a traditional (conventional) camera.

 The proposed strategy of a half dose/extended time protocol with the CZT camera should yield a similar count activity and consequently image quality equivalent to that detected by a conventional SPECT system.

This is a pilot study to see whether cardiac imaging can be performed using half the standard dose of radioisotope.
