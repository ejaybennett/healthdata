(secondQuint)Ambu Aura-i and Air-Q Intubating Laryngeal Airways as a Conduit for Tracheal Intubation in Children.

 The goal of this prospective randomized study is to compare the Ambu Aura-i and air-Q ILA in children with normal airway anatomy, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of fiberoptic tracheal intubation through these two devices.

 The ease of placement, fiberoptic grade of laryngeal view, time to tracheal intubation, time for device removal after intubation, and peri-operative complications will also be assessed.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a clinically relevant difference in time to tracheal intubation when using fiberoptic bronchoscope as a guide to intubate through the Ambu Aura-i or air-Q ILA.
