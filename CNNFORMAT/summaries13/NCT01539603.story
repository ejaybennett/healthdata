(firstQuint)Comparison of Drug Eluting Balloon and Drug Eluting Stent.

 A recent trial to test premount bare metal stent on drug-eluting balloon failed to demonstrate non-inferiority and safety compared to drug-eluting stent alone for treatment of coronary artery stenosis.

 We think that inappropriate drug delivery to diseased vessel due to stent strut might affect the efficacy of drug-eluting balloon.

 Therefore, we design a clinical study with a different protocol, that is, drug-eluting balloon first and then bare metal stent implantation in comparison to drug-eluting stent.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Drug-Eluting Balloon first and then bare metal stent compared with drug-eluting stent for treatment of de novo lesions (DEB first).
