(thirdQuint)Collection of Maternal Blood Samples for Development of Non-invasive Prenatal Diagnostic Testing.

 Eligible subjects will sign a consent form and have blood drawn at approximately 8-17 weeks gestation.

 Subjects will received $200 reimbursement for providing this blood sample.

 The collected samples will be used to help develop non-invasive prenatal diagnostic testing using Natera's Parental Support technology which is already commercialized for genetic diagnosis of in-vitro embryos.

 In this study, the technology will be tested for it's ability to analyze fetal-specific pieces of DNA isolated from the mother's blood.

 No results of the maternal blood testing will be reported to the subject or to their physicians.

 Collection of Maternal Blood Samples for Development of Non-invasive Prenatal Diagnostic Testing@highlight

The purpose of this study is to collect blood samples from pregnant women who achieved pregnancy following in-vitro fertilization (IVF) with Natera's preimplantation aneuploidy screening (with or without single gene gene testing).

 These samples will be used for test development of non-invasive prenatal diagnostic testing.
