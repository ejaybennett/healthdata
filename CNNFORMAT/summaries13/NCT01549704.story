(thirdQuint)Effect of Adductor-Canal-Blockade on High Pain Responders After Total Knee Arthroplasty.

 The patients will be included the 1.

 or 2.

 day after surgery.

 All TKA patients will be screened.

 Those reporting VAS > 60 during active 45 degrees knee flexion will be asked to participate.

 Included patients will receive 2xACB (singleshot) first placebo (30ml saline) and then ropivacaine (30ml ropivacaine 7,5mg/ml) or the other way around (randomized).
