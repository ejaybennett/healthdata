(fifthQuint)Testosterone Administration and ACL Reconstruction in Men.

 Overall Objective: The overall objective of this study is to determine if 8 weeks of testosterone first administered 2 weeks prior to surgery, can improve the outcome of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.

 Overall Hypothesis: Standard-of-care rehabilitation with the addition of testosterone administration will augment muscle mass, strength, and physical function following ACL reconstructive surgery compared to standard rehabilitation alone.

 Significance: Muscle mass and strength are greatly reduced following ACL surgery.

 The investigators hypothesize that administration of testosterone will minimize these reductions or potentially increase muscle mass and strength.

 In doing so, testosterone may hasten a patient's return to physical activity.

 If testosterone improves recovery after ACL surgery, the same treatment may be used for other injuries that involve trauma and muscle atrophy.

 Furthermore, this study will examine the effect of trauma with or without testosterone on myogenic regulators in muscle tissue taken during ACL surgery-providing possible mechanistic insights for the clinical outcomes.

 Testosterone Administration and ACL Reconstruction in Men@highlight

This study is being done to test whether taking testosterone can prevent loss of muscle mass and strength due to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery.

 Testosterone is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic (muscle promoting) steroid.

 It is essential for the development of male reproductive tissues and promotes increased muscle, bone mass, and the growth of body hair.

 The investigators hope to learn whether testosterone given before and after ACL reconstructive surgery will increase muscle mass and strength and potentially improve recovery time following surgery.
