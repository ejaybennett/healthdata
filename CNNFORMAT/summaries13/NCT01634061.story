(firstQuint)Phase Ib of Abiraterone Acetate Plus BEZ235 or BKM120 in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Patients.

 A dose-escalation part will first determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recomended dose for expansion (RDE) of abiraterone acetate in combination with BEZ235 and abiraterone acetate in combination with BKM120 in CRPC patients with abiraterone acetate failure.

 Subsequently, the MTD and/or RDE of each combination will be investigated in two expansion treatment groups of CRPC patients who have failed abiraterone acetate therapy.
