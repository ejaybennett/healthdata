(secondQuint)Delayed Tolerance in Recipients of Living Kidney Allografts by Donor FCRx Infusion.

 This study involves the use of a combination of an enriched hematopoetic stem cell infusion (stem cells, produced by the bone marrow, generate the cells that form the blood elements, help fight infection and assist in clotting) and kidney transplantation from the same donor to try to avoid the need for long-term anti-rejection drug therapy.

 The desired result of this study is to allow your body to develop "tolerance" to the transplanted kidney.

 Tolerance means that your body would see the transplanted kidney as part of you and not try to get rid of, or reject it.

 To prevent rejection, drugs called immunosuppressive agents must be taken on a daily basis.

 The purpose of this study is to determine if this procedure is safe and to try to substantially reduce or even eliminate the need for anti-rejection medications.

This study involves the use of an enriched hematopoetic stem cell infusion (stem cells, produced by the bone marrow) from the same donor who provided the original kidney transplant.

 This kidney transplant may have taken place months to years previously.
