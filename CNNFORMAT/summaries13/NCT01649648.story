(secondQuint)Autologous Cord Blood Cells for Brain Injury in Term Newborns.

 The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of infusions of autologous (the patient's own) umbilical cord blood cells in term gestation newborn infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

 For this study, infants who have signs of moderate to severe encephalopathy at birth and have cord blood collected at birth can receive their own cord blood cells during the 3 days of age.

 Babies will be followed for neurodevelopmental outcome at 1, 4 - 6, 9 - 12 months and 18-24 months.

 MRI brain will be obtained at 1-2 weeks and 4-6 months old.
