(secondQuint)Phase 2 Study of Inhaled Lipid Cisplatin in Pulmonary Recurrent Osteosarcoma.

 ILC is a novel formulation of cisplatin, designed for inhalation by nebulization.

 The anticipated pulmonary benefits of ILC over systemic cisplatin therapy are threefold: - Increased local cisplatin concentrations - Sustained release of cisplatin in the lungs - Minimal systemic exposure to cisplatin In this study, patients currently in surgical complete remission (CR) following one or two prior relapses of osteosarcoma involving pulmonary disease will be treated with ILC every two weeks for up to one year.

 ILC will be administered via nebulization.

 Phase 2 Study of Inhaled Lipid Cisplatin in Pulmonary Recurrent Osteosarcoma@highlight

To establish whether treatment with Inhaled Lipid Cisplatin (ILC) is effective in delaying/preventing pulmonary relapse in osteosarcoma patients in complete surgical remission following one or two prior pulmonary relapses.
