(fifthQuint)Phase III Study to Evaluate Safety and Effectiveness of NOVOCART 3D Plus vs.

 Microfracture in Knee Cartilage Defects.

 For the cartilage cell product NOVOCART(R) 3D plus, which is used in the study described here, the company TETEC AG obtained an expanded production authorization from the medication monitoring authorities in compliance with Section 13, Para.

 1 of the Medicinal Products Act in 2003.

 This entitles TETEC AG to produce the pharmaceutical product and already distribute it.

 More than 6000 patients were already successfully treated with NOVOCART(R) 3D in Europe since 2003.

 In order to obtain a general market authorization for NOVOCART(R) 3D plus, this control group study is conducted, in which the superiority of the safety and effectiveness of carrier-bound Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation with NOVOCART(R) 3D plus compared to the standard of care microfracture surgery needs to be proven.

 This study further aims at developing and validating known and new biologic markers for the quality and clinical efficacy of the product as requested in the context of identity, purity and potency characteristics of the medicinal/investigational product.

 The patients will receive one of the therapeutic procedures in the study.

 The treatment procedure which will be used will be decided by a previously specified randomization process.

 This type of study meets the high quality requirements of the statutorily specified safety and quality regulations which are also referred to as "Good Clinical Practice" (GCP).

 The probability of the patient being allocated to one of the two treatments is 2:1; that is, an approx.

 67% probability of therapy with NOVOCART(R) 3D plus and an approx.

 33% probability of therapy with microfracture.

 Neither the patient, nor the investigator will be able to influence the treatment assignment.

 Patients will be screened for eligibility at the Screening Visit.

 Each patient will remain in the study for 24 months post-implant for the effectiveness assessments, and then an additional three years to complete the planned post-market phase.

 Each patient will be in the study for up to five years.

 Cells and tissues collected from this study will be used in other in vitro-controlled experiments aimed at developing and validating known and novel biologic markers to quantify cell quality in the context of identity, purity and potency.

 Prognostic values of these biologic markers will be examined by correlating them with clinical data collected in this study.

 Phase III Study to Evaluate Safety and Effectiveness of NOVOCART 3D Plus vs.

 Microfracture in Knee Cartilage Defects@highlight

In this phase 3 clinical trial, a second generation ACI (autologous chondrocyte implantation technique) is compared to standard of care therapy (microfracture) to treat traumatic cartilage defects of the knee for efficacy and safety.

 The investigated study treatment NOVOCART 3D plus is a biphasic biological scaffold which contains cultivated chondrocytes derived from the patient in a previous tissue harvest procedure.

 Allocation to the study treatment is done by randomization in a ration of 2:1 in favor to ACI (investigational product).

 Follow-up data for efficacy is collected for 2 years: follow-up visits are performed 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months after treatment; additional data for safety will be collected for up to 5 years: 36, 48, and 60 months after treatment.

 The study involves knee surgery (by arthroscopy, or mini-arthrotomically for implantation surgery), and blood withdrawal for safety within the first year after treatment.

 Initial imaging is required at baseline.

 Optional MRI imaging and biomarker collection is done as substudy at specific sites only.
