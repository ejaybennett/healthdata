(secondQuint)Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Coronary Calcification and Parathyroid Hormone in CKD Patients.

 We will call for 350 CKD patients (250 CKD3-5stage and 100 CKD5D stage)who suffer from vitamin D deficiency.

They will be divided into 2 groups.

 One group will be given vitamin D and the other will not.

 They will take coronary artery CT test every year(in 2 years).

We will compare the coronary calcification progression between the 2 groups.
