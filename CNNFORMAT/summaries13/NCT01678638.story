(firstQuint)Timing of Inguinal Hernia Repair in Premature Infants.

 This is a randomized clinical trial comparing early versus late repair in premature infants with an inguinal hernia (IH) to determine which approach may be safer.

 Safety in this trial is defined as the freedom from significant adverse events, a reduction in hospital days during the study period, and normal neurodevelopmental testing at 2 years.

 Costs of each treatment strategy are also important and are being evaluated.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether early (before NICU discharge) or late (55-60 weeks post-menstrual age) inguinal hernia repair is safer for premature infants who have an inguinal hernia.
