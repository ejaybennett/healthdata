(secondQuint)Comparative In-Vivo Wetting Characteristics of Silicone Hydrogel Materials With Selected Lens Care Systems.

 This study will be divided into two phases.

 In the Pre-Investigational Phase (Phase 1), participants will wear PureVision contact lenses for 30 days and use ReNu(R) Multiplus(R) for contact lens care.

 Eligible participants will continue into the Investigational Phase (Phase 2) and be randomly assigned to wear AIR OPTIX(R) AQUA contact lenses or ACUVUE(R) OASYS(R) with HYDRACLEAR(R) contact lenses for a total of two months.

 For contact lens care, participants will use OPTI-FREE(R) PUREMOIST(R) MPDS and BIOTRUE(R) for 30 days each.
