(secondQuint)Effect of Local Anesthetic Dose on Interscalene Block.

 Traditionally, an interscalene block is done either with nerve stimulator or ultrasound guided using 40-60mL of local anesthetic.

 The study plans to investigate the difference in hand grip strength post-operatively in patients who will receive interscalene blocks with 40mL versus a lower dose (20mL) of local anesthetic.

 We suspect the lower dose will achieve adequate surgical anesthesia while creating less motor block and thus, increase patient satisfaction, present fewer complications or adverse affects and decrease time in the recovery room.

The purpose of this study is to determine if a decrease in the standard volume of local anesthetic used to numb your shoulder area before shoulder arthroscopy will provide adequate anesthesia for the procedure and decrease the amount of time until you are ready for discharge from the hospital.
