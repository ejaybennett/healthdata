 This is a multi-center, open-label, randomized, Phase II study.

 Patients will be treated either with arm A or B - Arm A: Lenalidomide 10 mg/day for 21 days every 28 days for 4 courses.

 - Arm B: Lenalidomide 10 mg/day for 21 days every 28 days for 4 courses combined with weekly subcutaneous injections of Epoetin beta (60,000 Units/w).

 Evaluation of response at the end of 4 months according to IWG 2006 and IWG 2000 criteria.

 Maintenance: responders will continue to follow the corresponding treatment arm until relapse occurs; non responders at Evaluation of response at the end of 4 months according to IWG 2006 and IWG 2000 criteria.

 in arm A will be considered in failure of treatment and the introduction of Epoetin beta is at the discretion of the physician.

 Lenalidomide in Subject With Low and Intermediate-1 Risk MDS and Without Chromosome 5 Abnormality.

@highlight

The goal of the present study is to assess, through a randomized phase II trial, the efficacy and safety of Lenalidomide with or without Epoetin beta in transfusion-dependent, ESA-resistant, IPSS low and intermediate-1 risk MDS patients without chromosome 5 abnormality.

 Patients will receive either Lenalidomide alone or Lenalidomide and Epoetin beta for 4 months.

 Responders will be eligible for maintenance treatment with cycles identical to the first cycles, until relapse occurs or until unacceptable toxicity.
