(fifthQuint)Effect of Healthy Lunch and Snack Meal on Reaction Time and Well-being of Physicians and Nursing Staff (Go-No-Go).

 The study is designed as a randomised controlled 2 x 4 weeks cross-over trial, initiated with a 1-week run-in period.

 The study sample will consist of 60 volunteer physicians, nurses and nursing assistants from Herlev University Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark.

 A healthy lunch and snack meal meeting the current danish diet recommendations will be delivered daily during all working days in the intervention period.

 During the control period, the participants are requested to maintain their habitual dietary intake at work.

 Reaction time will be assessed by reaction time test Go/No-Go, a subtest of Test-battery for Attention Performance.

 Changes in mood will be measured by the Profile of Mood State questionnaire.

 In addition, dietary intake, level of physical activity and palatability of the intervention diet will be registered.

 Effect of Healthy Lunch and Snack Meal on Reaction Time and Well-being of Physicians and Nursing Staff (Go-No-Go)@highlight

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of increased availability of healthy food and drink during working hours on reaction time and well-being in physicians and nursing staff.

 Hospital medical staff often works long and hectic hours, without adequate meal or rest breaks in order to provide 24-hour care.

 This is a concern, as not only the staff's well-being is important to the individual welfare, but it is also vital to the quality and safety of the care their patients receive.

 The investigators believe that by focusing on physicians and nursing staffs nutrition the investigators will see a positive effect on staff performance and well-being - and thus ultimately possibly on patient safety.

 Hypothesis: The provision of healthy lunch and snack meal during working hours for a period of 4 weeks will improve reaction time and well-being compared to habitual diet in physicians, nurses and nursing assistants.
