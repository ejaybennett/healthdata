(fifthQuint)Prospective, Multiconfiguration Study to Assess Functional Performance of Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty System.

 The study is designed as a prospective, single arm stratified, multi-center investigation.

 Approximately 20 study sites, worldwide, will enroll 1040 subjects (1040 knees).

 Each study is expected to enroll approximately 52 subjects (approximately 52 knees).

 An additional 10 subjects per site may be recruited at sites which have Sub-Investigators participating in the study.

 Cohort reallocation is permitted.

 There will be no control group.

 One thousand and forty (1040)Subjects will be stratified into 4 subgroups of 260: cruciate retaining fixed bearing(CR FB), posterior stabilized fixed bearing (PS FB), cruciate retaining rotating platform (CR RP), and posterior stabilized rotating platform (PS RP).

 Treatment assignment in this study is not randomized.

 Each site will only enroll patients in one of the four knee configuration sub-groups most commonly used as their standard of care.

 Prospective, Multiconfiguration Study to Assess Functional Performance of Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty System@highlight

This post-marketing investigation will evaluate the functional knee performance of Subjects who have undergone primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

 Data from Subjects who receive one of four contemporary knee configurations will be pooled to establish a contemporary dataset.

 The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pre-operative (approximately -90 to -1 day before surgery) to minimum one year (approximately 304 to 668 days) postoperative functional performance improvement for the Attune cent primary, cemented TKA system as measured by the activities of daily living (ADL)subscore of the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS)questionnaire (KOOS-ADL sub-score).

 This will be carried out for all four implant configurations: cruciate retaining fixed bearing (Attune cent CR FB), cruciate retaining rotating platform (Attune cent CR RP), posterior stabilized fixed bearing (Attune cent PS FB), and posterior stabilized rotating platform (Attune cent PS RP).
