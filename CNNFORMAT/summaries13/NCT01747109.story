(thirdQuint)Benefits of Optiflow Device for Preoxygenation Before Intubation in Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure : The PREOXYFLOW Study.

 This study will be designed as followed : Patients will be randomized in 2 groups :"PREOXYFLOW" or "STANDARD FACE MASK".

 Patients randomized in "PREOXYFLOW" group will received a four minutes preoxygenation period with Nasal High Flow Therapy (HFT) (60 l/mn FIO2 = 1) before orotracheal intubation under laryngoscopy after crash induction.

 Patients randomized in "STANDARD FACE MASK" group will received a four minutes preoxygenation period with standard face mask (15 l/mn) before orotracheal intubation under laryngoscopy after crash induction.

 Benefits of Optiflow Device for Preoxygenation Before Intubation in Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure : The PREOXYFLOW Study@highlight

Oro-tracheal intubation in intensive unit care(ICU) in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure after crash induction remains a critical event.

 The aim of this study is to determine whether Nasal High Flow Therapy (HFT) Optiflow (R) is more efficient than the face mask for preoxygenation before orotracheal intubation after crash induction in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
