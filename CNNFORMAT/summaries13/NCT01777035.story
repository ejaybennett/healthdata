(secondQuint)Early Mobilization in the ICU.

 Immediate mobilization of mechanically ventilated (MV) ICU patients is not part of usual care in the U.

S.

 or internationally.

 Our previous work supports that early mobilization through physical and occupational therapy for ICU patients on the ventilator can help them experience less delirium, spend less time in the ICU and hospital, and become more independent when they leave.

 To advance our knowledge in this area, large longitudinal studies are needed to understand the long-term physical, cognitive and mental health status of survivors and to test how specific ICU therapies may affect these outcomes.
