(secondQuint)Real-time Comparison of Left Ventricular Strokevolume Measurement by Four Different Methods.

 20 healthy volounteers between age of 20-40 years, no previous medical history undergo simoultaneous left ventrikular strokevolume measurements using three different methods at rest.

 After datasampling and without moving, the subject then undergo Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging with 2D-throughplane and cine tecnology for validation of volume measurements.

 The data is then analyzed using Bland-Altman calculation.
