(fifthQuint)Comparison of Supportive Therapies for Symptom Relief From Pediatric Upper Respiratory Infections (URIs).

 Study design is a nonblinded randomized controlled trial.

 It is a survey-based comparison study of pediatric patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms for which the ED physician has recommended supportive care only (ie.

 non-prescription symptom relief).

 Study duration is approximately one year.

 Subject participation duration is 4 days.

 Subjects will be randomized into 2 groups: handheld humidifier group (FDA cleared medical device that uses distilled water) & control group.

 Both groups may use any supportive modalities desired such as over-the-counter cold medications (OTCs), room air humidifier etc.

 Primary study objective is to determine if the use of handheld humidifier improves URI symptom scores (nocturnal cough, parental perception) and/or reduces use of other supportive modalities compared to the control group for the relief of pediatric URI symptoms.

 Three surveys will be obtained from all subjects.

 The initial survey occurs at the time of enrollment (T0).

 The second and third surveys will be completed by the parent/guardian on line or by phone on the first day after ED visit (T-1) and sometime between the 2nd-4th day after ED visit (T-2).

 The survey component includes a validated pediatric cough questionnaire with 7 point Likert scale, and a questions regarding any other supportive treatments used for symptom relief (the type, frequency and results).
