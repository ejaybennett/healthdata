(fifthQuint)Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Trial in Jordan.

 I.

 Objectives 1.

 To assess the effectiveness of the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program, on biomedical, behavioral, knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes compared to patients receiving a modified Microclinic Behavioral Health Program without the social network components.

 2.

 To assess the effectiveness of the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program, on biomedical, behavioral, knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes compared to patients receiving standard care.

 3.

 To assess the impact of utilizing existing social networks in improving biomedical and behavioral outcomes.

 4.

 To assess the long-term impact of Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program on improving sustained clinical, behavioral, knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes.

 II.

 Study Design Randomized Control Study: This study is a randomized control study that will aim to recruit 500 female and male adults (>= 18 years old) with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, pre-diabetes, or at risk for diabetes, who will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=~300 as Group A), a group who will receive a modified Microclinic Behavioral Health Program without the social network components (n=~100 as Group B) , and controls receiving standard care (n=~100 as Group C).

 III.

 Study Procedures 1.

 Participant Recruitment (1-3 months) The aim of recruitment is to inform individuals with diabetic, pre-diabetic, or at risk for diabetes in the community about the microclinic study, and encourage patients to participate.

 The recruitment process will consist of interconnected strategies including: 1) the distribution of posters and invitations in four catchment areas, and a broader media campaign, and 2) recruitment by nurses through clinics in two pilot locations around Amman.

 1.

 Phase 1.

 Recruitment: Outreach strategies to recruit patients at risk for diabetes and with Type 2 diabetes include: - The Royal Health Awareness Society will lead an outreach effort to spread the word about the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Trial.

 The effort will involve distribution of posters and flyers in the public sphere, and, if possible, airing of radio or television spots.

 - At the three assigned Ministry of Health local health centers, a Project Officer for each center will work with Project nurses trained in research, Institutional Review Board approved protocol, and data collection to recruit patients at risk for diabetes, pre-diabetes, and with Type 2 diabetes to the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Trial.

 Potential participants will be contacted by phone or referred to the trial in person during their visit to the health center and asked if they would be willing to participate.

 2.

 Phase 2.

 Randomization: Patients registering to participate in the trial will be entered into a sampling pool (n=~140 nodes - those originally recruited who then bring friends and family - per cohort) database that contains all the names of potential participants and unique identifying numbers for each person.

 Computer generated stratified randomization will occur on nodes to three study arms: a) Group A receiving the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program, b) Group B receiving a modified Microclinic Behavioral Health Program that has the same educational curriculum but without social network components and participants attend sessions as individuals, or c) Group C receiving no intervention and therefore, standard care as the control group.

 3.

 Microclinic Groups: Microclinics are self-selected groups of family and friends who are diabetic, pre-diabetic, or at risk for diabetes and come to meet regularly to support one another in setting and meeting goals for improving their health, to learn tools for managing diabetes, and to share much-needed medical supplies and equipment.

 Only participants assigned to the group A will be asked to bring in friends and/or family members with Type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes, or at risk for diabetes to participate in the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program together.

 In comparison, participants assigned to group B and group C will have data collected as individuals.

 2.

 The Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program (approximately 7 months) Only Group A will receive this program.

 Control group B will receive a modified version that contains the same educational curriculum but does not emphasize the importance of social support and social networks.

 Control group C will receive standard care and only be followed-up for parallel measurements in the same schedule.

 Group A participants receiving the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program will be followed by a trained Project Nurse and receive an approximately 7-month program (sessions and educational materials) that will increase the knowledge and skills in diabetes self-management and peer support and monitoring.

 The curriculum includes sessions on the causes of diabetes, prevention of complications, symptoms, self-management strategies, diet, exercise, peer monitoring and support by trained Project nurses from MoH health centers, local physicians, and university professors.

 Each session will provide 2-3 hours of discussion to foster active class participation and engagement for ~28 participants.

 3.

 Evaluation and Data Collection A critical component of this project is systematic data gathering, analysis, and evaluation aimed at assessing the short and long term efficacy, sustainability and feasibility of the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program.

 The program evaluation will collect demographic, socioeconomic, medical history, medical data, behavioral data, psychosocial data, and social network data from all participants during the program as well as post-program (up to 2 years after baseline).

 Participants are assigned an identification number during recruitment and all identifying participants characteristics are kept a secure computer database that is both firewalled and password protected.

 Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Trial in Jordan@highlight

The "Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Trial for Obesity and Metabolic Risk Factor Control in Jordan" spans 51 months and aims to test the effectiveness of the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program in influencing lifestyle behavioral risk factors to improve diabetes management that effect weight and metabolic outcomes through social networks.

 The Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program provides microclinic (MC) groups-consisting of approximately 2-8 individuals from pre-existing social networks (friends, relatives, coworkers, neighbors, etc)-with shared access to diabetes education, technology, and group support to promote weight and metabolic control through diet, exercise, medication adherence, and blood pressure management.

 MC members play a role in the collective effort to combat diabetes and solidifying self-management behavioral skills through peer-monitoring and encouragement of lifestyle behaviors.

 This Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Trial was established in collaboration with the Royal Health Awareness Society (RHAS) and the Jordanian Ministry of Health (MoH).

 This objective of the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Trial, the first randomized control study of its kind, is to test the effectiveness of the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program.

 The study will yield valuable information on the impact of social relationships with diabetes education on weight and metabolic control among individuals with type 2 diabetes.
