(secondQuint)Clinical Trial With Catheter Locking TauroSept (Taurolidine 2%) or Saline Solution 0,9%.

 Home Parenteral Nutrition has become a mainstay in the support of patients with chronic intestinal failure.

 It requires the presence of a central venous catheter to assure adequate venous access.

 Catheter Related BloodStream Infections (CRBSIs) are frequent.

 Most CRBSIs originate from contamination of the catheter hub and subsequent growth of microorganisms embedded within the biofilm that rapidly develops on the inner catheter surface.

 The best preventive measure against the development of CRBSIs is observation of strict hygiene guidelines when inserting and manipulating a central venous catheter and in addition to this the instillation of antimicrobial solutions like TauroSept(R) or saline solution 0.

9% into the catheter lumen (antimicrobial lock).

 This measure is currently widely used in clinical practice.

 Clinical Trial With Catheter Locking TauroSept (Taurolidine 2%) or Saline Solution 0,9%@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if TauroSept(R) taurolidine 2% is more efficient than saline solution 0.

9% as a catheter lock solution in preventing catheter related blood stream infections in patients with home parenteral nutrition.
