(secondQuint)Efficacy/Safety Study of Valsartan and Chlorthalidone Conjugate Treatment Compared to Simple Treatment for Hypertension.

 In spite of the existence of a great variety of treatments with drugs effective against arterial hypertension, the percentages of arterial hypertension control with monotherapy remain quite low reason why the fixed-dose combinations of drugs have been one of the most interesting research topics in order to achieve an appropriate control of arterial hypertension.

 The possibility of achieving better coverage and Blood Pressure control through a drug combination has leaded, on a scientific base of the efficacy of an Angiotensin Receptor Blockers II plus diuretic combination, to the development of a great number of combinations with different Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers plus hydrochlorothiazide.

 Yet it is noteworthy that despite the increasing evidence showing additional benefits in Blood pressure control and reduction of cardiovascular outcomes with chlorthalidone over hydrochlorothiazide, there is neither a great number of combinations nor studies with Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers plus chlorthalidone whereby the conduction of a trial assessing the efficacy and safety of Valsartan plus chlorthalidone in hypertensive patients is proposed plus the benefits of combination therapy that include, among others, the greater efficacy with lower doses of each individual component as well as reduction in occurrence of adverse events directly related with lower drug doses.

With this treatment schedule it is expected to obtain higher control of blood pressure values and greater percentage of patients.
