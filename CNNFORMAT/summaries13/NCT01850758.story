(fifthQuint)Regenexx SD Versus Exercise Therapy for ACL Tears.

 Prospective, randomized, controlled to include 25 subjects treated with Regenexx SD and 25 subjects treated with exercise therapy alone with the exercise group crossing over to the injection group at 3 months.

 Subjects will have a partial or complete, non-retracted ACL ligament tear as evidenced with MRI.

 Subjects will be enrolled within 60 days prior to Regenexx-SD injection or initiation of exercise therapy and take part in follow-up visits for two years following treatment.

 A preoperative visit will occur at the time of enrollment; follow-up visits will occur at the clinical site at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post injection.

 The primary endpoint analysis will be conducted once all subjects reach the 3 month endpoint.

 Subjects will continue to be followed through the 2 year endpoint with data analysis performed at the 1 year and 2 year time points.

 Regenexx SD Versus Exercise Therapy for ACL Tears@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to compare the improvement in subject-reported clinical outcomes for Regenexx SD vs.

 Exercise Therapy treatment of partial and complete, non-retracted knee ACL ligament tears, from baseline to 3 months, with continued evaluation of efficacy and durability up to 24 months.

 Secondary objectives include evaluation of MRI evidence of tendon repair; incidence of post-operative complications, adverse events, re-injections, and surgical intervention; change in pain score and use of pain medications.
