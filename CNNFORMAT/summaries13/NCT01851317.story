(firstQuint)The Relationship Between Patients' Head Position and ETT Intracuff Pressure.

 There are currently no data in the literature as to the effect of changes in head position on CP.

 As the cuff is located in the patients' trachea, the shape of the patents' trachea may be change depending on the position of the patient's head and therefore, the CP may also change.

 If the intracuff pressure will increase as the patient's head is moved into a flexed or extended position, these patients may be at risk for tracheal damage.

 The investigators will prospectively evaluate the relationship between the patient's head position and CP in patients undergoing otolaryngological surgery.
