(fifthQuint)Fast Identification of Pathogen in the Setting of Pneumonia Using Multiplex PCR.

 In this clinical observational study it is to be investigated if Multiplex PCR analyses of clinical samples from ventilated critically ill patients could be a fast and accurate alternative to conventional microbiological diagnostic methods in the identification of human pathogenic microbes in the setting of pneumonia.

 Therefore aspiration samples from intubated and ventilated critically ill patients, which are suspected to develop such an infection, will be collected and analyzed by using a multiplex PCR application situated on the intensive care unit.

 The samples will be investigated for DNA sequences that are known to be specific for pneumonia causing microbes.

 Analyses will take place in a point of care setting and will be carried out by intensive care physicians.

 According to the standard protocols of our intensive care units, conventional microbiological investigations, including MALDI-TOF, will be carried out parallel to the Multiplex PCR analyses.

 Fast Identification of Pathogen in the Setting of Pneumonia Using Multiplex PCR@highlight

With this study the investigators want to determine, if a fast identification of germs, causing infections of the lower respiratory tract, is possible through the use of Multiplex PCR technology - a method that allows on time detection of bacteria in medical specimen by identifying DNA sequences that are known to be specific for the respective microbe.

 Therefore aspiration samples from the respiratory tracts of ventilated patients, which are suspected to develop such an infection, will be collected and analyzed by using a multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) application situated on the intensive care unit.

 The investigators want to determine if Multiplex PCR diagnostic could be a faster alternative to conventional microbiological methods.

 The results of the Multiplex PCR analyses therefore will be compared with results of conventional microbiological methods.
