(fifthQuint)Selective Ultrasound Screening for DDH 1991-2006.

 Of 81564 newborns, 11539 (14,1%) were identified as at risk, of which 11190 (58% girls) were included for further analyses.

 Of the 81564 infants, 2433 (3 cent 0%) received early treatment; 1882 (2,3%) from birth and 551 (0,7%) after six weeks or more of clinical and sonographic surveillance.

 Another 2700 (3,3%) normalised spontaneously after watchful waiting from birth.

 Twenty-six infants (0,32 per 1000, 92% girls, two from the risk group) presented with late subluxated/dislocated hips (after one month of age).

 Another 126 (1,5 per 1000, 83% girls, one from the risk group) were treated after isolated late residual dysplasia.

 Thirty-one children (0,38 per 1000) had surgical treatment before age five years.

 Avascular necrosis was diagnosed in seven of all children treated (0.

27%), four after early and three after late treatment.

 Interpretation The first 16 years of a standardised selective US screening programme for DDH resulted in acceptable rates of early treatment and US follow-ups, and low rates of late subluxated/dislocated hips compared to similar studies.

 Selective Ultrasound Screening for DDH 1991-2006@highlight

Early treatment is considered essential for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), but the choice of screening strategy is debated.

 The investigators evaluated the effect of a selective ultrasound (US) screening programme.

 All infants born in a defined region during 1991-2006 with increased risk of DDH, i.

e.

 clinical hip instability, breech presentation, congenital foot deformities or a family history of DDH, were subjected to US screening at age one to three days.

 Severe sonographic dysplasia and/or dislocatable/dislocated hips were treated with abduction splints.

 Mild dysplasia and/or pathological instability, i.

e.

 not dislocatable/dislocated hips were followed clinically and sonographically until spontaneous resolution, or until treatment became necessary.

 The minimum observation period was 5,5 years.
