(secondQuint)Comparative Study Menaquinone-7.

 In an earlier study, beneficial effects of a nutrient-enriched dairy product on vitamin K-status were observed.

 The study product contained menaquinone-7 (MK-7) and omega-3 fatty acids for vascular health and extra minerals and antioxidants to support general health.

 It was the first time that such low dose of MK-7 (50 mu g) could significantly improve vascular and general vitamin K-status already after short-term treatment.

 From the results of this study, it was assumed that the matrix of the dairy product and/or other components in the product, in which the vitamin was offered, contributed to optimal absorption and availability of vitamin K2.

 In this new study, the uptake and efficacy of MK-7 from the nutrient enriched product is investigated and compared to the uptake and efficacy from a MK-7-containing supplement and a basic dairy product enriched with MK-7.
