(fifthQuint)Radiotherapy of the Prostate and the Pelvic Lymph Nodes After Neoadjuvant Antihormonal Treatment.

 The PLATIN trial is designed as a prospective, non-randomized, five-arm trial.

 Arm 1: Definitive radiotherapy of the pelvic lymphatic drainage with integrated boost to the prostate.

 Arm 2: As arm 1, with additional boost to macroscopic lymph node metastases.

 Arm 3: Postoperative radiotherapy of the pelvic lymphatic drainage with integrated boost to the prostate bed.

 Arm 4: As arm 3, additional boost to macroscopic lymph node metastases.

 Arm 5: Patients with previous radiotherapy to the prostate bed.

 Radiotherapy of the Prostate and the Pelvic Lymph Nodes After Neoadjuvant Antihormonal Treatment@highlight

For patients with prostate cancer and a high risk of lymph node involvement or confirmed pelvic lymph node metastases, radiotherapy of the whole pelvis is a treatment option.

 However, conventional radiotherapy of the pelvis has limited by gastrointestinal and urogenital side effects.

 The PLATIN trial investigates an intensity-modulated radiotherapy of the pelvic lymphatic drainage that spares small bowel, bladder and rectum.

 A higher dose is given during each session to the prostate or the prostate bed and to confirmed lymph node metastases.

 Prior to radiotherapy, two months of neoadjuvant antihormonal treatment are required, and continuation during radiotherapy and for a further two years are strongly recommended.
