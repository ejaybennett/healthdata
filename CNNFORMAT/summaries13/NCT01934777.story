(secondQuint)Efficacy and Tolerance of Treatment With DHA, Choline and Vitamin E in Children With Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis.

 Sixty children or adolescents (4-16 years) with liver biopsy proven NAFLD will be enrolled.

 They will be randomized to treatment with DHA, VIT E and Choline (n=30)or an identical placebo (n=30) given orally for a period of 12 months.

 All patients will be included in a lifestyle intervention program consisting of a diet tailored on the individual requirements and physical exercise.

 Patients will undergo a medical evaluation every three months during the 12-month study period.

 Liver biopsy will be performed at baseline and at 12 months.

 Anthropometric analysis, laboratory tests, including liver enzymes and lipids will be repeated at 3-month intervals during the 12-months study duration.

 Ultrasonography of the liver will be repeated after six months at the end of the study period.
