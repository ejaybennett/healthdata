(fifthQuint)Pharmacogenetic Trial of Doxazosin for Treatment of Cocaine Abuse.

 The noradrenergic system, especially the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, may play an important role in cocaine addiction in humans.

 Doxazosin is a long-acting and selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blocker, which inhibits the binding of norepinephrine to alpha receptors in the autonomic nervous system.

 This study will evaluate the efficacy of doxazosin in reducing cocaine-using behavior in treatment seeking cocaine-dependent individuals, and will guide future pharmacotherapy trials using Doxazosin or related alpha 1 receptor antagonists for treatment of cocaine addiction.

 Additionally, this study will identify genetic subpopulations of participants for whom doxazosin is preferentially effective, specifically examining the R492C functional polymorphism of the ADRA1A gene.

 This 15-week double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial will provide treatment for 100 cocaine-dependent patients and includes a 13 week medication trial (weeks 1-13) and up to 2 week washout period (weeks 14-15).

 Qualifying subjects will be randomized to receive Doxazosin 8 mg/day, or placebo during the study participation.

 Subjects will be receiving 2 mg study medication/placebo capsules at week 1, with 2mg/week induction rate for 3 weeks, according to their randomized assignments, and are maintained on these agents through week 13.

 During the course of the trial, all participants will receive manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy.

 At the end of the study (weeks 14-15), participants will undergo discontinuation from active/placebo medication over a 2-week period.

 Subjects who wish to be transferred to an appropriate treatment program or treatment-research program will be helped with referral during the 2 week period (weeks 14-15).

 Pharmacogenetic Trial of Doxazosin for Treatment of Cocaine Abuse@highlight

Cocaine use disorders affect approximately 1.

5 million Americans annually.

 Currently, there are no US Food and Drug Administration approved medications for treatment of cocaine dependence; however, both animal and human studies suggest that medications affecting the noradrenergic system can reduce cocaine craving and use.

 The investigators will study the effect of doxazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, in reducing cocaine use and anxiety symptoms among cocaine-dependent individuals.

 In addition, the investigators will identify genetic subpopulations of participants who preferentially respond to the medication.
