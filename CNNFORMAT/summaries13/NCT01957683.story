(secondQuint)Canadian eCLIPs Safety and Feasibility Study Protocol.

 With this other endoluminal stent/device implantation technique to treat intracranial aneurysms in conjunction with embolic coils, the neurovascular device is placed across the aneurysm neck, to act as a bridge to prevent coils from protruding into the parent artery.

 Stenting may allow to more safely achieve a higher packing density of coils.

 These effects may improve the rates of complete aneurysm occlusion and enhance the durability of the coiling treatment.

 The eCLIPs cent device manufactured by Evasc Medical Systems Corp.

 has a high density 'leaf' which is implanted across the bifurcation aneurysm neck and anchored in one of the branch arteries of the bifurcation and may provide improved bifurcation aneurysm treatment by allowing for a higher packing density of embolic coils implanted behind the eCLIPs cent device and the eCLIPs cent device in combination with embolic coils may reduce the recurrence/retreatment rate by increasing the rate of complete aneurysm occlusion.
