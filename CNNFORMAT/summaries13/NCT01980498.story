(secondQuint)PEctin Rapid Fentanyl Efficacy Clinical Trial For pAin at Swallowing Undergoing radioTherapy.

 Population: In and out patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy, regardless of the day of the radiotherapy treatment, with or without chemotherapy and taking at least 60 mg of oral morphine daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid to control background pain (background pain controlled is defined as NRS 4 on a NRS 0-10).

 Study design: Patients that have signed the ICF and met inclusion and exclusion criteria are randomly assigned 1:1 to receive one of the following predictable BTP at swallowing treatments: 1.

 Fentanyl pectin nasal spray (FPNS) 2.

 Physician choice-Usual Care (PC-UC) Each patient will take the drug no more than 3 episode a day (at main meals: breakfast, lunch and dinner) for 15 episodes in total in 6 (-1, +2) consecutive days.

 At each episode the patients will record the pain at baseline (before drug administration), and 10, 20 30 minutes after taking FPNS or PC-UC.

 At each meal, if the administered dose of FPNS or PC-UC is not adequately effective on pain control, the patient is allowed to take a rescue medication of IRMS after 30 min from FPNS or PC-UC administration.

The primary objective of the present phase IIIb study is to assess the efficacy of FPNS compared with Physician Choice-Usual Care (PC-UC) in the reduction of swallowing predictable BTP in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.
