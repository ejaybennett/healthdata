(secondQuint)The Four Supports Study: Family Support Intervention in Intensive Care Units.

 One in four elderly Americans die in or shortly after discharge from an intensive care unit.

 An expanding body of literature documents that physician-family communication and end-of-life care is poor in intensive care units.

 These deficiencies are associated with high rates of adverse psychological outcomes among surrogates, physician-family conflict, and life support decisions that may be inconsistent with patients' goals and preferences.

 There is a lack of information on practical, generalizable interventions that effectively improve this important aspect of care for elderly patients and their families.

 The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted communication intervention as compared to an educational control to improve psychological outcomes among family members of critically ill patients, using a randomized, controlled trial design.

 Sample size: With a sample size of 300 patients (450 surrogates), the study is well powered to detect small and clinically important differences in the primary outcome measure Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS).

The trial's original sample size of 400 patients (600 surrogates) was chosen to maximize the power to detect differences in a secondary outcome measure (costs) that required a substantially larger sample size than the primary outcome (HADS).

 Since the original power calculations were conducted, new data were published which indicated that cost analysis in this context will require an even larger sample size based one effect modification from whether the patient lived or died.

 Therefore, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended revising the sample size to power the trial on the primary outcome (HADS), which required 300 patients (450 surrogates).
