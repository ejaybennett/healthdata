(thirdQuint)Renal Denervation for Uncontrolled Hypertension.

 This is a phase 4 randomised control trial of renal denervation for the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension.

 Previous studies have shown that the renal denervation procedure is safe and effective in reducing blood pressure.

 A total of 100 participants with uncontrolled blood pressure, treated with two blood pressure lowering medications will be recruited into the study.

 Patients will be assigned to one of two groups.

 Participants in Group 1 will be assigned to undergo the renal denervation procedure.

 Participants in group 2 will undergo usual care, receiving additional antihypertensive medication in an attempt to reach blood pressure targets.

 The duration of this study is 36 months.
