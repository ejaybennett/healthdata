(firstQuint)Evaluation of Choroidal Thickness During Pregnancy Using Enhanced Depth Imaging Optical Coherence Tomography.

 Pregnant women in the last trimester and age-matched healthy controls have an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) image taken on the OCT Spectralis(R) device.

 A map of the choroid in the macular area is constructed automatically.

 Choroidal thickness and volume are calculated for the 9 subfields defined by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS).

 A comparative analysis between the two groups will be performed.

 As a secondary outcome measure, the change in choroidal thickness of the pregnant group of women will be assessed at 6 months postpartum by comparison to the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.

 The OCT is a non-invasive examination that poses no risk to the mother or the fetus.
