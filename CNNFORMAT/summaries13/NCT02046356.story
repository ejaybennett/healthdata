(secondQuint)Early Recurrence Risk Factors of Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Radio Frequency Ablation.

 - Radio frequency ablation (RFA), as a curable technology, has been recommended for the treatment of early hepatoma by the guidelines from different countries, however, the early (within 2 years) recurrence rate after this operation remains high, and as the investigators know the studies of the risk factors and the independent risk factor of this recurrence are only from retrospective studies, a multi-center prospective case-control study is needed.

 Therefore, the investigators aim to adopt this method to further identify the factor(s) from 86 patients with early hepatoma whom fulfill the diagnostic criteria of Milan and accept complete RFA during hospitalization.

 - After RFA, informed consents are acquired from patients and the follow-up begins.

 According to the follow-up data, patients are assigned to the recurrence group or the un-recurrence group.

 The monitoring data of the risk factors was inputted to the Epi Date software and the statistic was analyzed by SPSS 18.

0.

 The statistical method includes: Chi-square test for the comparison of rate, Logistical regression analysis for the related risk factors and the independent risk factors.

 Early Recurrence Risk Factors of Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Radio Frequency Ablation@highlight

The investigators aim to investigate the related risk factors and the independent risk factors of early recurrence, the rate of disease free survival and the rate of recurrence, furthermore, develop a rating system of risk factors.
