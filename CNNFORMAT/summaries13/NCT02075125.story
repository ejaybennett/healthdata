(firstQuint)Prasugrel and Ticagrelor in ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction.

 Prasugrel and ticagrelor are recommended in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

 Both prasugrel and ticagrelor show more rapid and potent antiplatelet effect compared with clopidogrel.

 However, previous report comparing the efficacy and safety of prasugrel and ticagrelor in patients with STEMI of East Asian ethnicity is lacking.

 Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the antiplatelet efficacy and safety using laboratory platelet function tests and clinical outcomes in patients with STEMI treated with either prasugrel or ticagrelor.
