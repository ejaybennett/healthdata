(firstQuint)Efficacy and Safety Study of rTMS for Upper Extremity Motor Function Recovery in Ischemic Stroke Patients.

 Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can modulate the excitability of cortex but exact efficacy and safety of rTMS is not well established.

 Eighty four patients will be recruited and will be divided into two groups.

 Each group will receive the real rTMS or sham rTMS, respectively, over the primary motor cortex of the dominant hand.

 Individual subject will receive ten sessions of rTMS.

 Each rTMS session is low frequency (1Hz), total 1800 stimulations.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of rTMS TMS for upper extremity motor function recovery in patients with ischemic stroke.
