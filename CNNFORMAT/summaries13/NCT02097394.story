(firstQuint)The Clinical Study on Combizym and Bifidobacteri to Prevent the Recurrence of Colon Polyps.

 Colon polyps has high recurrence rate in the digestion diseases.

 However, the reasons are not clear.

 The possible reasons for the recurrence of colon polyps include intestinal inflammation (e.

g.

, Ulcerative colitis), intestinal flora imbalance (the benefit intestinal bacteria reduced, which lead to diarrhea or constipation), long-term indigestion.

 The investigators propose to examine whether digestion enzyme (Combizym) and intestinal flora drugs(Bifidobacteria) can decease recurrence rate of colon polyps.
