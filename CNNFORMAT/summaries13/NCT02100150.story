(firstQuint)A Safety and Efficacy Study of NNZ-2566 in Patients With Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI).

 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an injury to the head caused by an external trauma that can lead to brain cell death, inflammation, edema, hemorrhage, and disruption of normal brain cell function.

 mTBI frequently results in persistent functional impairment including problems with cognitive function, memory, mood, and other personality disorders.

 There are currently no drugs available to reduce the brain damage or sequelae that result from TBI.

 Clearly, a safe and effective treatment for concussion injury and all forms of TBI would be an important development for military personnel as well as the general population.

 This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of treatment with oral administration of NNZ-2566 at 35 mg/kg or 70 mg/kg BID in adolescents and adults with mTBI.

 The study also will also investigate measures of efficacy during treatment.
