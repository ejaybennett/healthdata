(secondQuint)Hospital Wearable Defibrillator Inpatient Study.

 A multi-center prospective study of hospitalized patients whom a physician deems at risk of sudden cardiac arrest during the hospitalization period, wearing the HWD1000 hospital wearable defibrillator in order to evaluate caregiver and patient interactions with the device.

 In addition, ECG signal quality will be reviewed to confirm the HWD1000 safety profile.
