(fifthQuint)The Pathogenesis of Terson Syndrome and the Role of CSF Tau / Amyloid- 40 and 42 in Patients With Aneurysmatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.

 In this prospective clinical study the pathogenesis of Terson syndrome and the prognostic value of the CSF-biomarkers tau-proteine and amyloid- 40 and 42 in patients with aneurysmatic subarachnoidal hemorrhage are investigated.

 Intracranial opening pressure will be measured in patients requiring CSF-diversion for acute hydrocephalus and correlated with the incidence of Terson syndrome tested by an opthalmologic exam (group A: Terson syndrome positive, group B: Terson syndrome negative).

 CSF samples from external ventricular drainages are obtained at day 0, 2 and 6 and concentration of tau-protein and amyloid- 40 and 42 are determined and correlated to secondary outcome measures such as delayed cerebral ischemia, clinical vasospasm, re-bleed, necessity for surgical intervention secondary to raised intracranial pressure or CSF-diversion.

 Outcome in terms of Glasgow-Outcome-Scale-Extended and Euro-Qol-5 will be assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months.

 CSF from patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic tapping of their internal ventricles for normal pressure hydrocephalus or shunt diagnostics serve as a reference for CSF-biomarkers concentration in healthy individuals.

 The Pathogenesis of Terson Syndrome and the Role of CSF Tau / Amyloid- 40 and 42 in Patients With Aneurysmatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage@highlight

Prospective clinical study to investigate the pathogenesis of Terson syndrome and the prognostic value of the CSF-biomarkers tau-protein and amyloid- 40 and 42 in patients with aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.

 Our two hypotheses are as follows: 1.

 The incidence of Terson syndrome correlates with the initial intracranial opening pressure (measured with extra ventricular drain) 2.

 The CSF-biomarkers correlate with the outcome assessed at discharge, 3-, 6- and 12-months postictally using Glasgow-Outcome-Scale-Extended (GOSE) and Euro-Qol-5 as well as with complications related to aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage such as cerebral vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia and re-bleed.
