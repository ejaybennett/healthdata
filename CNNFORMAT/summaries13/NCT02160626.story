(secondQuint)Dose-Response Profile of A-101 in Subjects With Seborrheic Keratosis.

 The main objective of this study is to evaluate the dose-response relationship of two concentrations of A-101solution when applied to individual seborrheic keratosis (SK) lesions (target lesions) compared with a matching A-101 Solution Vehicle.

 Each subject will have 4 target lesions on the trunk/extremities.

 A further objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two concentrations of A-101 solution and its matching vehicle when applied to SK target lesions on the trunk/extremities.
