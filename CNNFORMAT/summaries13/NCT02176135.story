(secondQuint)Oral Auranofin for Reduction of Latent Viral Reservoir in Patients With HIV Infection.

 The investigators proposed a novel approach in order to reduce the HIV viral reservoir.

 This approach exploits the effects of auranofin, a gold based compound which has been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

 Auranofin induces partially selective apoptosis and differentiation towards short-lived phenotypes of the T lymphocyte memory subsets that encompass the main viral reservoir in patients.

 The hypothesis is that the targeted memory cells would either die or decrease their persistence in the body, with the associated latent viral reservoir being reduced.

 The study will be conducted in two phases: A sequential dose-escalation phase to evaluate two doses of auranofin, followed by an expansion at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

 A total of 20 patients are to be treated at the MTD.

 Auranofin treatment is administered for 12 weeks.

 Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by repeated laboratory panel and physcial examination during the 12 weeks of auranofin therapy and 8 for weeks thereafter.

 The latent reservoir will be measured by assessment of the inegrated viral DNA in CD4+ cells in the circulating blood and in gut biopsies.

The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety of oral auranofin, a gold compound, in patients with HIV infection whose viral load has been suppressed by antiretroviral therapy for no less than 3 years and have a CD4+ cell count over 500 cells/uL
