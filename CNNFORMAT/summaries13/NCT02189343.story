(secondQuint)Phase 1b Study Evaluating ACY-1215 (Ricolinostat) in Combination With Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in Relapsed or Relapsed-and-Refractory Multiple Myeloma.

 To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), if present, and to identify a recommended dose and schedule of ricolinostat administered in an alternative liquid formulation (ALF) (10mg/mL) in combination with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or relapsed-and-refractory multiple myeloma.

 To evaluate the safety and any anti-tumor activity of ricolinostat administered in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone as treatment for patients with relapsed or relapsed-and-refractory multiple myeloma, including duration of response.

 To assess the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of all three medications administered in combination, and to assess the Pharmacokinetics of ricolinostat and pomalidomide specifically.

 An evaluation of the relationship between response and biomarkers relating to interacellular acetylation may also be completed.
