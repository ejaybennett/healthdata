(secondQuint)Modified Angled Tube vs.

 Conventional Angled Tube in Double-lumen Endotracheal Tube Intubation.

 Inserting a double lumen endotracheal tube is somewhat more difficult than a single lumen tube intubation because of its larger outer diameter and the more rigid feature.

 Moreover, the airway axes (oral-,pharyngeal-, and laryngotracheal axis) are not always straight under sniffing condition.

 Therefore, to make easy to insert a double-lumen tube and reduce the tube-related complications, we are trying to compare the individually angle-modified tube and the manufacturer-provided-angled tube.

The investigators are trying to compare the individually modified-angled tube and the conventional-angled tube in ease of double lumen endotracheal tube insertion and the incidence of related postoperative complications.
