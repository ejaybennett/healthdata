(fifthQuint)The Influence of Trust in the Health Care System on Postpartum Contraceptive Choice.

 The aims of the proposed research are three-fold: 1.

 To identify whether trust in the health care system is associated with choice of the highest efficacy contraception (intrauterine contraception, implantable contraception, and sterilization) in the immediate postpartum period among pregnant women receiving prenatal care.

 2.

 To explore which patient-level factors (sociodemographic, reproductive history, future pregnancy intentions) and provider-level factors (antenatal contraceptive counseling) are associated with choice of the highest efficacy contraception in the immediate postpartum period among pregnant women receiving prenatal care.

 3.

 To determine whether trust in the health care system is altered during the receipt of prenatal care or delivery.

 The Influence of Trust in the Health Care System on Postpartum Contraceptive Choice@highlight

The purpose of this research is to understand the relationship between trust in the health care system and choice of contraception during the postpartum period among pregnant women receiving prenatal care.

 Research subjects will complete a questionnaire at enrollment and between delivery and within 5 days of hospital discharge.

 A chart review will also be completed to gather use of a birth control method at the six week postpartum visit as well as pertinent medical diagnoses and recorded data such as height, weight, body mass index, and contraceptive plan as documented in the postpartum medical chart.
