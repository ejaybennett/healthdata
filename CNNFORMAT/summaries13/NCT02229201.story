(fifthQuint)Comparison of Two Anaesthetics on Brain During Brain Tumour Surgery.

 Anaesthetic technique for craniotomy has to provide optimal cerebral perfusion, oxygenation and prevent brain oedema (1).

 It also has to lower the stress response on pain during intubation and surgical manipulation.

 Emergence from anaesthesia has to be rapid and smooth to permit early postoperative neurological evaluation.

 The most likely opioid in the last decade is short acting opioid remifentanil that can be easy titrated during the procedure and provides early recovery (2, 3, 4, 5).

 Currently the propofol-remifentanil and sevoflurane-remifentanil are the most frequently used combinations for craniotomy (6, 7).

 Recently a multicentre study was published that did not show differences in early recovery between three groups (propofol-remifentanil: TIVA, sevoflurane-remifentanil, sevoflurane-fentanyl).

 Either technique provided optimal surgical conditions.

 The group received TIVA had attenuated changes in stress biomarkers (cortizol in plasma and urine, cateholamines.

 (8).

 Anaesthesia and surgical stress during craniotomy can lead to brain damage and activation of inflammatory response (9, 10).

 Consequently inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL8, IL10) are released.

 Cell mediated immune balance can increase postoperative complications (infections, wound healing, multiple organ dysfunction).

 Many studies have shown that volatile anaesthetics reduce systemic and local inflammatory response during major surgery (11, 12, 13, 14), but animal studies have shown that volatile anaesthetics can induce neuroinflammation (IL6, NF-B) that leads to decline of cognitive function in rodent and possible human (15,16).

 Our aim was to investigate how anaesthetic technique for craniotomy influences the release of inflammatory cytokines.

 Our hypothesis was that when optimal neuroprotective strategies are followed during surgery intravenous anaesthesia attenuates inflammatory response comparing to inhalational anaesthesia.

 Plasma levels of IL6, IL8, IL10 were measured during preoperative, perioperative and postoperative periods of both groups of patients.

 The investigators also noted emergence parameters, postoperative (pain, shivering, vomiting) and neurological complications after surgery.

 Patients and methods Anaesthesia regimen: On arrival in the operating room, the patients were randomly assigned to either Group P or Group S.

 Randomisation was done according to computer-generated order.

 All patients were on a regimen of dexamethasone 4x4mg/day with the first dose given at least one day before surgery.

 After arriving to the operating room the standard monitoring was instituted.

 An arterial catheter was placed in the radial artery to continuously monitor blood pressure.

 For extended haemodynamic monitoring Vigileo system was used.

 Patients were premedicated with midazolam (2-3 mg i.

v.

) and ondansetron (4-8 mg i.

v.

).

 Antibiotic prophylaxis with intravenous cefazolin 2g/100 ml 0.

9% NaCl was invariably used in all patients.

 Anaesthesia induction in Group P was performed with propofol (Propoven, Fresenius Kabi) and in Group S with sevoflurane (Sevorane, Abbott Laboratories).

 Before intubation all patients received remifentanil (Ultiva, GlaxoSmithKline) and rocuronium (Esmeron, MSD).

 After intubation, patient's lungs were ventilated mechanically, with 1:2 oxygen-air mixtures in P and S group.

 Ventilation was adjusted to maintain normocapnia.

 Anaesthesia was maintained by continuous infusion of propofol 4-6 mg/kg/h in the P group and with sevoflurane 0,8-1 MAC in the S group.

 Remifentanil was adjusted regarding to anaesthesia response (0.

1 - 2 1/2g/kg/min).

 The depth of anaesthesia was measured by a bispectral index (BIS) monitor; BIS values were maintained at 40-60.

 For haemodynamic management the following algorithm was used: continuous infusion of 0.

9% NaCl 6 mL kg- for the first hour, followed by 2.

5 ml kg-h- .

 If CI 10%, 6% hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven, Fresenius Kabi) until SVV-10% ; if there is no improvement after 250 ml 6% HES-a, ephedrine (0.

5% Efedrin, UMC Ljubljana Pharmacy) 5-10 mg iv or fenilefrin 50-100 1/2g (0.

01%, UMC Ljubljana Pharmacy).

 If CI C until analysis.

 Analyses of samples were performed in one batch.

 Chemiluminescent immunometric assay (Immulite analyzer; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) was used to measure the concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10.

 Our aim was to investigate how anaesthetic technique for craniotomy influences the release of inflammatory cytokines.

 Our hypothesis was that when optimal neuroprotective strategies are followed during surgery intravenous anaesthesia attenuates inflammatory response comparing to inhalational anaesthesia.

 The investigators included 40 patients anaesthetised with remifentanil based anaesthesia with sevoflurane (S group) or propofol (P group).

 Plasma levels of IL6, IL8, IL10 were measured during preoperative, perioperative and postoperative periods of both groups of patients.

 The investigators also noted emergence parameters, postoperative (pain, shivering, vomiting) and neurological complications after surgery.
