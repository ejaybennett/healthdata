(fifthQuint)Effect of MMFS-202-302 on Cognitive Enhancement in Schizophrenia.

 One of the symptoms of schizophrenia is a problem with specific domains of cognition, even when the positive symptoms have been treated.

 The primary goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of 9 weeks of supplementation with MMFS-202-302 as augmentation of atypical antipsychotic medication, to improve a critical specific domain of cognitive function, i.

e.

, working memory, in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

 To support this primary goal, global function will be assessed with the Clinical Global Impression assessment of change.

 The investigators will also examine the effect of MMFS-202-302 on other domains of cognition (e.

g.

 attention, executive function, declarative memory, etc.

); negative symptoms of schizophrenia; positive symptoms of schizophrenia; MRI measures of brain structure, resting state functional connectivity, and function during evaluation of emotional/unemotional and rewarding/aversive images and anticipation and receipt of reward and punishment, and working memory; and EEG measurement of network interactivity during learning and memory recollection.
