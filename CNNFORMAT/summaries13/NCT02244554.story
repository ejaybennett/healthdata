(secondQuint)Comparison Study of Picosecond and Nanosecond Pulse Durations Using a Q-switched Nd:YAG Laser for Tattoo Removal.

 This is a randomized, split-tattoo, open-label, single-center study of up to 25 subjects with tattoos containing black or dark blue ink, alone or in combination with other colors.

 It will compare the safety and efficacy of nanosecond and picosecond pulse durations with the Cutera Picosecond Q-Switched Nd:YAG laser for tattoo removal.
