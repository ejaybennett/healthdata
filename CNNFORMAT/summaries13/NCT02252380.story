(secondQuint)ExAblate Transcranial MRgFUS for the Management of Treatment-Refractory Movement Disorders.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of MRI-guided focused ultrasound thermal ablation of a designated area in the brain of patients suffering from movement disorder symptoms: - FUS under MRI-guidance and MRI-based thermometry can be safely delivered to patients suffering from treatment-refractory movement disorders through an intact human skull with a low risk of transient adverse effects as evaluated during follow-up of up to 12-months.

 - A pre-defined target volume inside the brain can be accurately ablated, as demonstrated on post-treatment MRI.

 - Lesions generated with ExAblate Neuro will result in clinical effects that are similar to those seen with ablative procedures using other surgical techniques (e.

g.

 RF procedure).

The proposed study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ExAblate Transcranial MRgFUS as a tool for creating a unilateral lesion in the Vim thalamus or the globus pallidus (GPi) in patients with treatment-refractory symptoms of movement disorders.
