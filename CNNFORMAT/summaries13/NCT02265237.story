(thirdQuint)A Randomized, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ombitasvir/ABT-450/Ritonavir Co-administered With Ribavirin (RBV) in Adults With Genotype 4 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection and Cirrhosis (AGATE-1).

 This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir coadministered with RBV for 12, 16, or 24 weeks in HCV genotype 4 (GT4)-infected participants with compensated cirrhosis who are either treatment-naive or who had previously received only IFN/RBV treatment for HCV.

 The study also enrolled HCV GT4-infected participants with compensated cirrhosis who had previously experienced virologic failure with either SOF/pegIFN/RBV or sofosbuvir (SOF)/RBV treatment.

 These participants were treated with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir coadministered with RBV for 24 weeks in this study.

 This study was divided into 2 parts with approximately 184 total participants.

 Part I included participants who were randomized to receive either 12 or 16 weeks of treatment and Part II included participants who received 24 weeks of treatment.

 Enrollment into Part II opened once randomization in Part I was completed.

The purpose of this study in HCV genotype 4-infected participants with compensated cirrhosis is to assess the safety and to compare the percentage of participants achieving a 12-week sustained virologic response (SVR12), [HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) < lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 12 weeks following treatment], to a clinically relevant threshold [based on SVR rates for HCV genotype 4-infected participants treated with pegylated interferon (pegIFN)/RBV].
