(thirdQuint)A PK/PD Genetic Variation Treatment Algorithm Versus Treatment As Usual for Adolescent Management Of Depression.

 Treatment seeking adolescent patients with a moderate to severe major depressive episode defined as a 40 or greater on Childhood Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) will be invited to participate in this study evaluating the GeneSight(R) platform.

 This new technology can rapidly assess PK and PD genetic variation that can potentially impact antidepressant, anti-psychotic, and stimulant treatment selection.

 These patients will have GeneSight(R) testing and will be randomized to one of two groups.

 In Group 1 (n=138), GeneSight(R) testing results will be available to the patient's treating clinician prior to treatment selection.

 In Group 2 (n=138), testing results will not be available to the patient's research treating clinician.

 However, all testing results will be made available to all participants and clinicians after the 8-week trial (upon completion of blinded assessments at week 8).

 The patients and the clinical raters will be blinded to group assignment.

 A PK/PD Genetic Variation Treatment Algorithm Versus Treatment As Usual for Adolescent Management Of Depression@highlight

The overall goal of this investigator-initiated trial is to evaluate the impact of platform algorithm products designed to rapidly identify pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) genomic variation on treatment outcome of depression in adolescents.

 This new technology may have the potential to optimize treatment selection by improving response, minimizing unfavorable adverse events / side effects and increasing treatment adherence
