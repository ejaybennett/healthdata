(secondQuint)Effect of Oral Administration of Methylene Blue MMX Tablets on Double Stranded DNA.

 Primary Objective: To evaluate the effect of oral 200 mg Methylene Blue MMX(R) tablets, (administered as 8 x 25 mg), prior to endoscopy, on double-stranded DNA breaks in colonic biopsy samples assessed by histone H2AX analysis, compared to control biopsies collected during standard white light colonoscopy without the prior use of Methylene Blue MMX(R).

 Secondary Objectives : To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral Methylene Blue MMX(R) tablets.

.

 To evaluate the staining score for colonoscopy obtained with oral Methylene Blue MMX(R) tablets .

 Time to reach the caecum during colonoscopy and withdrawal time from caecum to exit.
