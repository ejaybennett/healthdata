(secondQuint)NOV120401 (CKD-516 Tablet) for Advanced Solid Tumors.

 Vascular disrupting agents are expected to kill cancer cells located in core of tumor tissues by disrupting microvascular structure of tumor.

 To assess the safety and tolerability of NOV120401 (CKD-516 Tablet), patients with advanced refractory solid tumors will be enrolled in this study.

 Initial dose of NOV120401 (CKD-516 Tablet) is 5 mg/day, which will be escalated until at least 2 of 6 subjects show dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).

 Pharmacokinetic profiles and efficacy by tumor response and vascular disrupting activities will also be assessed.
