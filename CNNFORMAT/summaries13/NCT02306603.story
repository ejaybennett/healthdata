(secondQuint)Long-term Outcomes of Endoscopic Resection (ER) of Lesions of the Duodenum and Ampulla.

 Endoscopic resection (ER) of superficial lesions of the duodenum and ampulla is a safe and effective surgery sparing modality in experienced hands.

 It is often curative of dysplastic lesions and is associated with minimal complications and high patient acceptance (1-5).

 Westmead Hospital has accumulated a significant amount of experience in the removal of such lesions; however, there is limited research to document the long term outcomes of patients undergoing endoscopic resection.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term outcomes of ER of superficial lesions of the duodenum and ampulla.
