(thirdQuint)Ability of Late Sodium or Calcium Current Block to Balance the ECG Effects of Potassium Current Block.

 This is a randomized, double-blind, 5-period crossover study in healthy male and female subjects, 18 to 35 years of age, to compare the electrophysiological response of hERG potassium channel blocking drugs with and without the addition of late sodium or calcium channel blocking drugs.

 The 5 treatment periods are 1) dofetilide alone, 2) mexiletine with and without dofetilide, 3) lidocaine with and without dofetilide, 4) moxifloxacin with and without diltiazem and 5) placebo.

 During each treatment period, 12 blood samples for pharmacokinetic measurements are obtained with matched 12-lead ECG recordings.

 Ability of Late Sodium or Calcium Current Block to Balance the ECG Effects of Potassium Current Block@highlight

The primary objective of this research study is to test the hypothesis that late sodium current blocking drugs (mexiletine or lidocaine) can attenuate the effect of hERG potassium channel blocking drugs (dofetilide) on ventricular repolarization (QTc) by shortening early repolarization (J-Tpeakc).

 The secondary object is to assess the ability of calcium channel block (diltiazem) to reduce the QTc prolongation associated with hERG block (moxifloxacin).
