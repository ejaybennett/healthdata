(secondQuint)Clinical Follow-up of Direct/Indirect Bridge, Orthodontic and Periodontal Splint by Using Fibre-reinforced Composite.

 Adhesive dentistry is based on preventive dental approach.

 In presence of such advanced and minimally invasive techniques, destructive treatment methods should not be preferred for clinical situations, such as missing single tooth cases, tooth mobility following periodontal treatment and prevention of relapse after orthodontic treatments.

 Glass fibre is a reinforcement material, and increases the flexibility of the material together which it has been used.

 Fibre-reinforced applications by using direct or indirect techniques.

 This material and method is easily applicable, biocompatible, repairable and economical on a high extent.

 Clinical Follow-up of Direct/Indirect Bridge, Orthodontic and Periodontal Splint by Using Fibre-reinforced Composite@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether fibre-reinforced composite resin restorations are effective for single tooth replacement, elimination of tooth mobility following periodontal treatment and as an orthodontic retainer.
