(thirdQuint)Protocol for the Evaluation of Dario BGMS Performance at Elevated Altitude.

 The study will be performed with 50 fresh capillary blood samples, collected by fingerstick using Dario single use lancet.

 Additional fingerstick with dedicated disposable lancets will be used to collect sufficient capillary fresh blood to be analyzed by the YSI 2300 STAT Plus analyzer.

 Additional fingersticks may be necessary if volume of blood from first fingerstick is insufficient.
