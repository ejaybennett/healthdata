(secondQuint)The Effect of Theory Menu-Based Intervention on Vitamin D Adherence in People With Osteoporosis-Pilot Study.

 Osteoporosis is a common disease around the world.

 The morbidity and mortality attributed to osteoporosis is due to fracture.

 The evidence shows that vitamin D is effective in preventing osteoporotic fracture, however, adherence to vitamin D is low among people with osteoporosis (20%-60%).

 The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) has been found useful to describe, explain, and predict changes in health behaviours in a variety of setting.

 Based on HAPA, mini-videos will be developed aiming to increase vitamin D adherence in people with osteoporosis.

 Mini-videos will address self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, risk perception and action and coping plan.

 This pilot study aims to evaluate the recruitment and participants' feedback about the mini-videos.

This pilot study evaluates the effect of theory menu-based mini-videos on vitamin D adherence in older adult with osteoporosis.

 Half of participants will watch the videos while the other half will receive usual care (treating physician advice).
