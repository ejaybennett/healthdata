(secondQuint)Study of Lifileucel ( LN-144), Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Melanoma.

 Lifileucel is an autologous adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes a TIL manufacturing process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma.

 The adoptive cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving a lymphocyte depleting preconditioning regimen, prior to infusion of autologous TIL, followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.
