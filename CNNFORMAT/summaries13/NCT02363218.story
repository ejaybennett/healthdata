(fifthQuint)Study on Effectiveness and Safety of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Treated With CyberKnife.

 Indication: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most deadly cancer in the world.

 It is primarily seen in areas where hepatitis is endemic, such as Asia, but other risk factors include alcoholic cirrhosis.

 Surgical resection and/or transplantation remain the only curative options.

 However, more than 80% of patients present with unresectable disease.

 For these patients with unresectable tumors, a variety of treatment options are available, including transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), radioactive microspheres, microwave coagulation, laser-induced thermotherapy, and percutaneous alcohol injection, all of which have similar survival rates.

 Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for unresectable HCC is a relatively new treatment option made available because of significant improvements in diagnostic imaging and radiation delivery techniques.

 Although follow-up is limited, results show encouraging local control rates.

 The investigators propose to conduct a Phase II study assessing the efficacy and safety of CyberKnife SBRT for the treatment of HCC.

 Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria: Inclusion Criteria 1.

 Confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma according to one of three EASL criteria: - Histopathology - Two radiographic techniques (out of US, MRI, CT, Angiography) that confirm a lesion >2 cm with arterial hypervascularization - One radiographic technique that confirms a lesion >2 cm with arterial hypervascularization and an AFP>400 ng/mL 2.

 Unifocal liver tumors not to exceed 5 cm in greatest axial dimension.

 Multifocal lesions will be restricted to a maximum of 3 lesions with a maximum lesion size of 3 cm for each lesion, that can be treated within a single target volume within the same liver segment as long as the dose constraints to normal tissue can be met.

 Portal vein thrombus 13.

 Participation in another concurrent treatment protocol Intervention and Mode of Delivery: CyberKnife SBRT - External photon radiation.

 Procedure is outpatient.

 Study on Effectiveness and Safety of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Treated With CyberKnife@highlight

Study Phase: multi-institutional Phase II study Primary Objective(s): To determine overall survival for HCC patients treated with CyberKnife SBRT at 2 years.

 Secondary Objective(s): 1) To determine overall survival for HCC patients treated with CyberKnife SBRT at 1 year 2) To determine local control using RECIST and EASL criteria at 1 and 2 years 3) To assess progression-free survival at 1 and 2 years 4) To assess acute and late toxicities following CyberKnife SBRT.

 Hypothesis: Overall survival rate of HCC patients at one year after SBRT treatment is not less than 65%.

 Study Design: Single arm study.

 Patients will undergo a CT scan with and without contrast and MRI scan for radiation treatment planning and target delineation.

SBRT will be delivered on the CyberKnife with Synchrony Respiratory Tracking capabilities.

 The tumor will be tracked with 3 implanted fiducial seeds for targeting.

 Treatment will be delivered in 3 fractions within a 7 day window at the discretion of the investigator.

 Sample size: The sample size required is 93 with a power of 90%, p=0.

05, 50% response rate is considered not effective (p0) and 65% overall survival rate at 1 year (p1) is considered effectiveness of the treatment.

 The estimated drop-out rate is 20%, so the total sample size would be 117.

 Statistical Considerations: The set of Intention-To-Treat (ITT) will be analyzed.

 All patients will be censored at their last visit, including the patients lost to follow-up.

 All patients will be followed and counted in the therapy to which they were assigned, even if they decline that therapy.

 Only those patients who refuse (in writing) to have their outcomes count in the study's conclusions will not be included in the analyses from that time forward; however, the follow-up data for such patients will be included up until the time they withdraw consent.

 Such patients will be replaced.

 Baseline characteristics of patients will be presented with summary statistics.

 Time-to-event survival rates for OS and DFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and presented at one and/or two years.

 The incidence of acute and late toxicities will be presented in tabular form on both a per-patient and per-event basis.
