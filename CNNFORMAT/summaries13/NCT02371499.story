(secondQuint)Effect of Lactobacillus Casei DG (Enterolactis Plus) in Patient With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: a Pilot Study.

 The aim of the study is to collect data for the assessment of the Lactobacillus casei DG (Enterolactis plus(R)) effect on overall abdominal pain/discomfort, symptoms and gut microbiota composition in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

 The investigators suppose that, due to the immunomodulatory action of probiotics, overall abdominal pain/discomfort and symptoms will improve, fecal Immunoglobulin A levels will change, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels will decrease and the production of regulatory cytokines as Interleukin 10 will improve following consumption of Lactobacillus casei DG (Enterolactis plus(R)).
