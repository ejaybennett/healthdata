(fifthQuint)A Surveillance Study of Diseases Specified as Adverse Events of Special Interest, of Other Adverse Events Leading to Hospitalisation or Death, and of Meningitis in Children in Africa Prior to Implementation of the RTS,S/AS01E Candidate.

 The outcomes of interest (AESI, other AE leading to hospitalization or death, and meningitis) as well as data on malaria morbidity and mortality will be captured through active and enhanced hospitalization surveillance in children < 5 years of age.

 Children enrolled in active surveillance will be visited at their home at regular intervals during a period of 8 months.

 In addition to the home visits, all visits to health care facilities will be recorded during this period.

 Thereafter there will be continuous monitoring of hospitalizations only; up to study end or up to the day the child reaches 5 years of age, whichever occurs first.

 For all children enrolled in enhanced hospitalization surveillance, all hospitalization events will be captured during the total study period.

 The protocol summary has been updated with protocol amendment 4 (dated 11-Dec-2015) information: Rationale for amendment 3: - Participant recruitment has been modified: approximately 20,000 children will be enrolled in the active surveillance in the 6-12 weeks group (identified at first administration of DTP/HepB/Hib vaccine), to mimic administration of RTS,S/AS01E in the 6-12 weeks age group, and 20,000 children in the 5-17 months group (either selected children identified at first administration of DTP/HepB/Hib vaccine, or children aged 5 to <18 months and corresponding to a catch-up), to mimic administration of RTS,S/AS01E in the 5-17 months age group.

 - The term "passive surveillance" has been replaced by the term "enhanced hospitalization surveillance".

 - The case definitions, ascertainment and laboratory investigation (including to determine aetiology) for meningitis cases have been clarified.

 The objectives and outcomes related to meningitis have been modified accordingly.

 - Case ascertainment for AESI has been clarified.

 - It was clarified that blood sampling is to be performed as per study procedures in case of AESI or meningitis.

 In case of neurological AESI or meningitis, if a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample is taken as part of routine practice, part of the sample will be stored.

 Only serious adverse events related to blood sampling will be collected.

 - Limitations due to the sample size and the study design have been further discussed.

 - For clarity, consistency and comparability in the objectives, outcomes and methodologies, protocol amendment 3 text has been aligned in EPI-MALARIA-002 (115055) with the EPI-MALARIA-003 (115056) protocol.

 Rationale for amendment 4: - The background section has been updated with data about cerebral malaria from a post-hoc analysis of the Phase III study MALARIA-055.

 - Additional secondary objectives have been added for estimation of probable meningitis and for estimation of the incidence of cerebral malaria using RDT and/or microscopy.

 - The design and the analysis have been modified to take into account implementation of a 4th dose of RTS,S/AS01E.

 In addition, the follow-up period after the last dose has been extended to correspond to the follow-up period of the children enrolled in EPI-MAL-003 (i.

e.

 24 months after the 4th dose of RTS,S/AS01E).

 Indeed, home visits at 12 months and 24 months after the last RTS,S/AS01E dose will help to capture protocol-defined diseases that may have long risk window periods and that may not have been identified if the subject did not visit a health care facility, and to monitor the occurrence of malaria episodes for evaluation of vaccine effect.

 The age of the study population has been adapted accordingly (< 5 years).

 - The section about sites participating to the study was updated following SAGE/MPAC recommendations of pilot implementations of RTS,S/AS01E in 3-5 distinct settings in SSA restricted to moderate-to-high transmission of malaria.

 - The activities related to home visits to detect malaria cases, including training of community health workers for systematic measurement of body temperature of all children, and availability of malaria tests have been clarified for alignment with the EPI-MAL-003 protocol.

 - It has been clarified that cases of malaria only detected during the annual visits planned for EPI-MAL-005 will not be included in the analysis of EPI-MAL-002.

 However, if the cases of malaria are detected during an EPI-MAL-005 home visit that coincides with a home visit scheduled in EPI-MAL-002, the events will be captured in EPI-MAL-002.

 - The case definitions for malaria have been revised, according to the 3rd edition of the WHO guidelines for the treatment of malaria (2015).

 In addition, a case definition for cerebral malaria has been added.

 - Case ascertainment by the external panel of experts has been clarified.

 - It has been clarified that severe/cerebral malaria cases and other AE leading to hospitalization or death will be reviewed by the external panel of experts.

 - The incidence of other AE leading to hospitalization or death, meningitis and malaria morbidity and mortality will be monitored in sub-populations of children with hemoglobinopathies and HIV-positive children.

 - The section about analysis of co-primary objectives has been revised to mention that additional at risk periods will be considered based on results as sensitivity analyses.

 - The section about analysis of secondary objectives has been revised for clarification of potential variables that may be considered for models, in line with information collected in eCRF, and for estimation of the incidence of cerebral malaria.

 - It has been clarified that an interim analysis will be per-formed with the data collected on all subjects after 6 months of follow-up following the administration of dose 3 of DTP/HepB/Hib vaccine (6-12 weeks group), or 6 months after V3 (5-17 months group).

 - The section about handling of missing data has been revised.

 - It has been clarified that data about seasonal malaria chemoprevention will be collected.

 Other changes were made for simplification, clarification or consistency.

 A Surveillance Study of Diseases Specified as Adverse Events of Special Interest, of Other Adverse Events Leading to Hospitalisation or Death, and of Meningitis in Children in Africa Prior to Implementation of the RTS,S/AS01E Candidate@highlight

The purpose of this pre-licensure cohort study is to estimate the incidence of adverse events of special interest (AESI), other adverse events (AE) leading to hospitalisation or death, meningitis and malaria in sub-Saharan African children under 5 years of age.

 The outcomes of this study will provide the baseline data for the post-licensure EPI-MALARIA-003 (115056) study that will evaluate the safety, effectiveness and impact of the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine.

 An interim analysis will be performed when the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine will be implemented in most of the study sites.

 This interim analysis will be done with clean data collected on a sub-group of subjects having 6 months of follow-up following the administration of dose 3 of DTP/HepB/Hib vaccine (6 12 weeks group), or 6 months after Visit 3 (5-17 months group); corresponding to Visit 5.

 The interim analysis will concern primary safety endpoints and the main impact endpoints (at 6 months post last dose for the purpose of this interim).
