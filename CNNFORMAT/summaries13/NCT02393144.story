(thirdQuint)Analysis of Contemporary Labor Patterns Measured Via Transperineal Ultrasonography.

 Intrapartum sonography is rapidly advancing field in the management of obstetrics labor.

 Traditional approach to labor management consists evaluation of cervical dilatation, head position and head descent via digital examinations.

 Rate of progress is evaluated using data of available labor curves.

 Unsatisfactory progression is either treated with labor augmentation or cesarean section depending on the degree and duration of labor retardation.

 Transperineal ultrasonography is able to assess cervical dilatation, fetal head descent and head position.

 Data obtained from analysis of labor via transperineal ultrasonography is not available.

 This research's primary aim is to generate labor curves using data obtained via ultrasonographic measurements.

 Analysis of Contemporary Labor Patterns Measured Via Transperineal Ultrasonography@highlight

Primary aim of this study is to analyse contemporary labor patterns by measuring rate of dilatation and head descent via transperineal ultrasonography.

 Labor curves will be generated using data regarding rate of dilatation, head-descent obtained via transperineal ultrasonography.

 Factors which are known to effect duration of labor will be taken into account.
