.

 An open-label, randomized, two-treatment crossover bioequivalence study comparing two batches of the same fixed dose combinations Amaryl(R) M IR 2/1000 (glimepiride/metformin hydrochloride immediate release combination tablet) in fed conditions in healthy male and/or female subjects.

 Primary Objective To assess, after single oral administration under fed conditions, the bioequivalence between the two batches of the same glimepiride/metformin hydrochloride (HCl) 2 mg/1000 mg fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets (immediate release combination tablet Amaryl(R) M IR 2/1000) manufactured in India and in Turkey.

 Up to 50 healthy subjects are to be enrolled to have 46 subjects available for the final pharmacokinetic evaluation.

 Study treatment: In each period A single dose of glimepiride/metformin HCl 2mg/1000 mg FDC (manufactured in India) Or single dose of glimepiride/metformin HCl 2mg/1000 mg FDC (manufactured in Turkey) will be administered after breakfast.

 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S) Primary Endpoint: Glimepiride and metformin: Cmax and AUClast Secondary Endpoint(s): Glimepiride and metformin: AUC0-inf, tlag, tmax and t1/2z Safety DURATION OF STUDY (per patient) Screening : up to 15 days Treatments periods: 4 days each including treatment day Wash-out period: 4 to 7 days Follow-up: 4 to 7 days Total study duration: 37 days.
