(fifthQuint)Role of Glucagon In Glucose Control in Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes.

 This project is designed to begin to characterize the abnormalities of glucagon secretion in subjects with cystic fibrosis related diabetes along the spectrum of glucose tolerance.

 This will be a descriptive, cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort study in a sample of children and young adults with CF and a continuum of glucose tolerance compared to healthy age-matched controls.

 Cystic fibrosis patients with normal glucose tolerance as well as cystic fibrosis related diabetes as well as control subjects will be admitted to the research unit on three separate occasions to undergo an oral glucose tolerance test, mixed meal tolerance test, and one step hypoglycemic clamp.

 Cystic fibrosis patients will then return 12 months later to undergo repeat mixed meal tolerance test and hypoglycemic clamp test.
