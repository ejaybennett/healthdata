(firstQuint)Protocol for a Research Database for HCT, Other Cellular Therapies and Marrow Toxic Injuries.

 The Research Database contains demographic and clinical data on allogeneic related and unrelated donor and autologous HC transplants.

 Data are also collected on unrelated donors and their donation experiences.

 The data contained in the research databases are observational data.

 The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) does not determine which therapies are used for patients, but rather collects information regarding therapies as they are applied by transplant centers.

 Secondary goals of the CIBMTR Research Program are to understand uses of hematopoietic cells for regenerative medicine or immune-based therapy, including for malignancy or infection, and to improve treatments and outcomes for those individuals who have been exposed to radiation or other chemicals that are toxic to marrow.

 In these cases, exposure data, organ injury data, treatment data, and outcomes data are collected.

The primary goal of the CIBMTR Research Program is to improve the safety and effectiveness of hematopoietic cell (HC) transplantation for both donors and recipients.
