(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacodynamic Effects of Single Oral Doses of PF-06648671 on -Amyloid (A) Concentrations in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF).

 This study is investigator-and-subject blind, sponsor open, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study in healthy subjects to evaluate central (CSF) and peripheral (plasma) pharmacodynamics effects (Abeta) over 36 hours post single doses of PF-06648671.

 Two cohorts will be run in sequential.

 the first cohort is to evaluate the Abeta effect at top dose of 300 mg PF-06648671 and second cohort is to evaluate the Abeta effect at top dose (if more subjects are required) and/or 1-2 lower doses.
