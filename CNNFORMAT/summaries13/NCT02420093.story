(thirdQuint)Investigating the Clinical Effects of Supporting Neutral Pelvic Position in Sitting.

 This study is a randomized control trial with repeated measures.

 It will include 34 subjects with low back pain who sit 25 hours a week or more at a desk / computer.

 There will be 2 groups: control and experimental, each with 17 subjects.

 All subjects will be measured on the same 2 dates (3 weeks apart - pre and post intervention) with the same measures.

 The experimental group will use a pelvic support device, that aids in supporting the user's pelvis in a neutral position, in their desk chairs at home or work as tolerated during this 3 weeks.

 The control group will continue in their current sitting arrangement during the same 3 weeks.

 For control of conflict of interest, the Sponsor-Investigator will not perform any of the measures and data will be coded for subject group assignment until all data analysis is finalized.

 Multiple sessions of 3-week intervals of data collection may be performed as needed to achieve desired subject number in the study.
