(firstQuint)Comparison of Viusal Outcomes After Implantation of the POD 26% FineVision Toric (PhysIOL) and POD 26% Toric (PhysIOL).

 The study is an observational non-randomised controlled study comparing the visual acuity after implantation of the POD 26% FINEVISION TORIC with respect to the POD 26% TORIC This study includes both eyes of 24 patients implanted with the POD 26%FineVision Toric (group 1: 12 patients) and the POD 26% Toric (group 2: 12 patients) .

 The study primary goal is to compare the near visual acuity in both groups.

 Distance and intermediate visual acuities, defocus curve, refraction and straylight will be compared.
