(thirdQuint)Study to Assess Safety and Clinical Activity of Local MBN-101 in Treatment of Infected Bone Sites.

 Postoperative orthopaedic infections, particularly antibiotic-resistant infections, present a serious clinical challenge to surgeons and other treating physicians.

 These infections frequently involve implanted foreign materials (stabilizing orthopaedic hardware), making infection of these sites much more likely than if foreign materials were not involved.

 MBN-101 has broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against orthopaedic wound pathogens.

 This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of MBN-101 to treat orthopaedic infections during revision surgery, (a) with or without orthopaedic hardware, and (b) with or without removal and replacement of orthopaedic hardware.

This study evaluates the safety and clinical benefit of MBN-101 administered intraoperatively to osteosynthesis or osteomyelitis sites for patients diagnosed with an orthopedic infection, with or without orthopaedic hardware.

 Three quarters of the patients will receive MBN-101, while the other one quarter will receive placebo.
