(fifthQuint)Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation With Ixazomib for High Risk Multiple Myeloma (BMT CTN 1302).

 The study is designed as a Phase II, multi-center double-blind trial that randomizes patients with high risk Multiple Myeloma to Ixazomib maintenance or placebo 60-120 days after allogeneic HSCT.

 The primary objective of this randomized trial is to compare progression free survival from randomization as a time to event endpoint between patients randomized to Ixazomib maintenance or placebo.

 Secondary objectives are to describe for each treatment arm: rates of grade II-IV and III-IV Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, best disease response rates, disease progression, transplant related mortality, overall survival, rates of Grade 3 toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.

 Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation With Ixazomib for High Risk Multiple Myeloma (BMT CTN 1302)@highlight

This study is designed to compare progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization among patients randomized on the BMT CTN 1302 protocol, "Multicenter Phase II, Double-blind Placebo Controlled Trial of Maintenance Ixazomib after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for High Risk Multiple Myeloma".

 It is hypothesized that Ixazomib maintenance therapy will result in improved PFS in patients with high-risk multiple myeloma following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) compared to placebo.
