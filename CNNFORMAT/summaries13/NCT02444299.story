(thirdQuint)Aequalis Resurfacing Head Study.

 Resurfacing head implants allow restoring of the normal joint mechanics and stability of the shoulder with minimal bone resection and low peripheral fracture risk, while preserving humeral bone stock.

 Non cemented head implants also allow for an easy re-intervention if needed.

 The success of resurfacing implants largely depends on the etiology, with the best results in primary shoulder arthrosis, and the worst in post-traumatic and cuff-tear arthropathy.

 The Aequalis(R) Resurfacing Humeral Head is designed to restore the humeral head.

 It shares the same indications as shoulder arthroplasty in general, including the various types of arthritis and conditions resulting in loss of joint cartilage, joint incongruity, pain, and stiffness.

 Resurfacing humeral head implants allow minimal bone resection while preserving humeral bone stock as compared to standard anatomic humeral implants.

 However, few data are available on mid-term effects of the resurfacing head implant developed by Tornier.

 This Post-Marketing study is implemented for the Aequalis(R) Resurfacing Head in shoulder arthroplasty to collect medium and long-term clinical data on performance and safety.

 It is designed to collect data from consecutive series in European patients for at least 12 months of follow-up and up to 10 years.

 If possible, the study duration and collection of information will be prolonged.

 Further follow-up can be implemented, by amendments.

 Aequalis Resurfacing Head Study@highlight

Aequalis(R) Resurfacing Head implant is a range of shoulder arthroplasty device available for the treatment of various shoulder pathologies.

 It received CE Mark in June 2007.

 The aim of this study is to collect immediate medium and long term data on performance and safety of the implant, retrospectively as well as prospectively, from a consecutive series of patients to assess the patients' outcomes and functional status.
