(thirdQuint)Clinical Study of the Endotracheal Tube Used in Prone Position Ventilation Condition.

 The investigators apply some technical proposals to make it come true:one kind of special endotracheal tube, including traditional endotracheal tube,fixed device,fixed rope,two through holes.

With this tube ,the investigators can keep away shifting and falling off of traditional air tube,so that the investigators can try to avoid disaster events.

And for the patients with acute respiratory disease syndrome(ARDS),they are always given ventilation in prone position,so it may be beneficial.

In this study, the investigators adopt the special endotracheal tube to those patients at prone posture during the operation,or those with acute respiratory distress syndrome in the intensive care unit(ICU), so that the investigators can reduce, or even avoid some severe complications during perianesthesia, and that the investigators can provide strong safeguard measures for the respiratory therapy of critical patients in ICU.
