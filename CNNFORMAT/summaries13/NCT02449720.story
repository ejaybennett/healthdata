(thirdQuint)Intraperitoneal Local Anaesthetic in Bowel Surgery.

 The purpose of this randomised controlled blinded trial is to determine the effectiveness in every day practice of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic (IPLA) infusion on postoperative recovery following bowel resection in an optimised Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) setting.

 The investigators hypothesise that, in an optimised ERAS setting, intraperitoneal instillation and infusion of the local anaesthetic ropivacaine to the site of maximal visceral dissection for 48 hrs will result in an improved functional postoperative recovery following both open and laparoscopic bowel surgery.

 This research will provide evidence to allow recommendation on the routine inclusion of IPLA into the multimodal analgesia component of ERAS programs for bowel surgery.

This study will evaluate the addition of a local anaesthetic infusion into the abdomen to patient controlled analgesia in the management of postoperative pain and recovery after bowel surgery.

 Half of the patients will have an infusion of a local anaesthetic called ropivacaine and half will have an infusion of placebo in addition to their normal pain relief.
