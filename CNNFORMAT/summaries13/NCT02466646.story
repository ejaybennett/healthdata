(fifthQuint)Evaluation of Efficacy of Full-mouth Disinfection in Generalized Aggressive Periodontitis Patients.

 The present study aimed to compare the efficacy of conventional initial periodontal treatment (C-IPT), full-mouth disinfection IPT (FMD-IPT) and full-mouth IPT (FM-IPT) and the levels of gingival crevicular fluid interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) over 6-months period.

 Forty-two GAgP patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups.

 IPT was performed in a quadrant-wise manner at 1-week intervals in C-IPT, in 2 sessions within 24 hours in FM-IPT, and in 2 sessions with application of chlorhexidine to the intra-oral niches within 24 hours in FMD-IPT.

 FMD-IPT group also used daily 0,2% chlorhexidine for 3 weeks.

 At baseline, 3 and 6 months clinical parameters consisting of plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, bleeding on probing and clinical attachment level were recorded and gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected.

 Gingival crevicular fluid levels of IL-1 and IL-17 were analyzed using ELISA.

 Evaluation of Efficacy of Full-mouth Disinfection in Generalized Aggressive Periodontitis Patients@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether full-mouth disinfection is effective in the initial periodontal treatment of generalized aggressive periodontitis on clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) levels compared with conventional initial periodontal treatment and full-mouth initial periodontal treatment.

 The investigators' hypothesis is to test whether full-mouth disinfection in the initial periodontal treatment of generalized aggressive periodontitis enhance the clinical and biochemical parameters in comparison to conventional initial periodontal treatment and full-mouth initial periodontal treatment.
