 Study Evaluating Hemay020 In Subjects With Advanced Solid Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics,safety and tolerability of Hemay020 and to determine the recommended dose for future Phase II study as well as to obtain preliminary information on the efficacy of Hemay020 in subjects with solid tumors.

 The study will be conducted in two parts.

 Part one, testing will be done on up to 16-31 subjects to determine the safety and tolerability of Hemay 020 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
