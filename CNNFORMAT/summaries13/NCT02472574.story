(firstQuint)Dose-effect Relationship of Rt-PA on ICH Evacuation.

 The minimally invasive surgery (MIS) plus recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is one of the best choices in the treatment of a large-scale deep supratentorial intracerebral hematoma.

 It uses hardware access technology, in a relatively short time to enter the hematoma center with favourable accuracy and safety.

 The dose of rt-PA range from 0.

3 mg to 4.

0 mg in different research.

We propose to determine the optimal dose of rt-PA with three dose control groups.

 Dose-effect Relationship of Rt-PA on ICH Evacuation@highlight

The purpose of this trial is to determine the optimal dose of rt-PA in the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) using a combination of minimally invasive surgery and clot lysis with rt-PA.
