(firstQuint)The Impact of the Fluid Resuscitation on the Venous Volume and Flow Characteristics in Hypovolemic Shock.

 Patients with clinical signs of loss of the effective blood volume will undergo ultrasound examination of several major veins.

 The purpose of this examination is to determine vein volume(size) and flow.

 The ultrasound examination will be done before fluid resuscitation, after fluid administration,and three days after admission.

 The Impact of the Fluid Resuscitation on the Venous Volume and Flow Characteristics in Hypovolemic Shock@highlight

We hypothesis that in various situation when the effective blood volume decreased the venous volume flow characteristics change according to the fluid resuscitation
