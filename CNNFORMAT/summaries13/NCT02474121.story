(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Autologous Concentrated Bone Marrow Aspirate for Critical Limb Ischemia - Continued Access.

 This is a continued access enrollment intended for subjects with critical limb ischemia (CLI) that are unsuitable for revascularization.

 The investigational treatment utilizes autologous concentrated bone marrow aspirate (cBMA) at the point of care.

 The bone marrow aspirate is obtained from the subject's hip, concentrated with a bone marrow concentration device, and delivered intramuscularly to the affected limb.

 Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be treated with the MarrowStim cent PAD Kit and followed for a total of five years.

 Information on subject outcomes, such as the occurrence of amputation and death, as well as measurements of rest pain, blood flow (ankle-brachial index, toe-brachial index), and quality of life will be collected.

 Safety information (via adverse event reporting) will also be collected.
