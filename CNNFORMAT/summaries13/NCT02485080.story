 Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of 24 Weeks Simeprevir+Sofosbuvir for Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1@highlight

The goal of this pilot study is to examine both efficacy and tolerability in patients with HCV genotype 1 and mild decompensation with Child-Pugh-Turcott score of 6 or lower.

 The CPT score is used to assess the prognosis of chronic liver diseases, as well as the required strength and treatment and necessity of liver transplantation.

 A higher CPT score denotes higher necessity of liver transplantation.
