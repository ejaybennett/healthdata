(secondQuint)Transdermal Patch CVD 2000: The Effect of Heat on Fentanyl Release From Fentanyl Patches in Healthy Adults.

 This research study is intended to determine the effect of heat on FDA-approved fentanyl transdermal patches and whether the heat applied will result in more fentanyl being absorbed through the skin than without applying heat.

 This is important given that little is known about how the release of fentanyl is affected by heat, particularly for generic products that are also available over the counter.

 This study will use fentanyl patches (brand name and generic patches) that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are already sold over the counter to customers in the United States, and will not include any placebos.

This is an Open-label, Non-Randomized, 3-way Crossover Bioequivalence Study to compare fentanyl release after heating of a brand name (Duragesic) and generic (Apotex and Mylan) fentanyl skin patches in healthy adults.
