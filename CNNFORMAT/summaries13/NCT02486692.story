(firstQuint)Pilot Evaluation of AboutFace: Novel Peer Education Resource for Veterans.

 Research suggests that at least 1 in 10 Veterans will meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to their military experience.

 Treatment is widely available to Veterans with PTSD, and national dissemination initiatives have increased Veterans' access to best practice interventions.

 However, treatment seeking remains strikingly low among Veterans with PTSD.

 In fact, most Veterans with PTSD do not seek mental health services due to perceived stigma and other associated barriers.

 The National Center for PTSD recently developed and launched AboutFace, a peer education resource for Veterans.

 The investigators of this study believe that AboutFace has tremendous potential to reduce stigma and improve attitudes toward seeking mental health services among Veterans.

 However, it has not yet been evaluated.

 Investigators have partnered with the National Center for PTSD to launch this mixed methods pilot evaluation of AboutFace.
