(thirdQuint)Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Early Stages Cervical Cancer.

 Patients will be enrolled in the study at the time of surgery planning; at this point, a patients consent will be requested if inclusion criteria are fulfilled (histological type, FIGO stage, age, performance status, lymph node clinical status).

 The following procedures will be provided prior to surgery: clinical staging (MRI or EUS), medical data collection, adverse events assessment, lymphedema assessment, quality of life questionnaire, ECOG performance status, weight and height, standard pre-operative laboratory workup, pregnancy test if clinically indicated.

 Surgery should be done within 6 weeks of the imaging study (MRI or expert US).

 During the surgery, local or distant cancer spread outside of the cervix will be excluded, SLN will be detected, and all SLN will be sent for intra-operative pathologic evaluation.

 In patients with SLN detection on both sides of the pelvis no other lymph nodes will be removed and they will continue in the study.

 SLN biopsy will be followed by radical hysterectomy (type B, C1, or C2) or fertility-sparing procedure, according to the pre-operative plan.

 Intra-operatively, the following patients will be excluded from the study, systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy will be performed on both sides of the pelvis, and further treatment will be provided according to institutional guidelines: 1.

 Patients with intra-operative detection of more advanced disease stage (> IB1) 2.

 Patients without bilateral SLN detection (either no SLN detected or only on one side of the pelvis) 3.

 Patients with intra-operative pathologic detection of macrometastases or micrometastases in SLN Excluded patients will remain in a database and reasons for their exclusion will be entered into the SIS (Form 2).

 In patients, who continue in the study, all SLNs will be processed by pathologists according to the protocol for SLN ultrastaging (Chapter 7.

4.

2; Appendix 11).

 If macrometastases or micrometastases are detected in any of the SLNs by pathologic ultrastaging after the surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy will be recommended to the patient.

 No adjuvant treatment will be offered to those with negative final lymph node status or ITC (Isolated Tumor Cells) detection, confirmed pre-operative disease FIGO stage (IA1 - IB1), and adequately performed radical hysterectomy with negative parametrial and vaginal margins.

 Follow-up will consist of visits at regular intervals of 6 months after the surgery (additional visits in shorter intervals can be scheduled according to institutional guidelines).

 The following procedures will be provided at each visit during the follow-up period: pelvic examination, symptomatic lymphocele assessment, quality of life assessment (6 and 12 months after the surgery), adverse events assessment, and secondary lower extremity lymphedema assessment (2 years after surgery).

 Other imaging studies will be done only if clinically indicated.

 Any postoperative complication or disease recurrence will be managed according to the institutional guidelines.

 Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Early Stages Cervical Cancer@highlight

To evaluate whether a less radical surgical approach with sentinel lymph node biopsy is non-inferior to treatment with systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy.

 The null hypothesis is that the recurrence rate after SLN biopsy is non-inferior to the reference recurrence rate of 7 % (at the 24th month of follow-up) in patients after systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy, but that the less radical surgery is associated with significantly lower postoperative morbidity.
