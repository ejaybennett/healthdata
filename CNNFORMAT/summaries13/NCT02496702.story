(fifthQuint)Playware Technology for Balance Training.

 This study will investigate the use of one form of exergames called IMT how this compared to usual care of elderly people 70+.

 The trial will consist of two groups, one for training with the IMT and usual care that will receive the care provided to non-patients elderly, which at this moment is no additional treatment other than recommendations.

 The study will be single blinded, randomized controlled trial.

 It will be funded by the patient@home project and Entertainment robotics.

 Concealed allocation and intention-to-treat analysis will be used.

 Measurements will be taken at baseline and after intervention.

 Upon acceptance the protocol will be registered in clinicaltrials.

 The trial's results will be reported using domains and categories described in the taxonomy developed by the Prevention of Falls Network Europe, to allow future synthesis of evidence, or study replication.

 The intervention is done in the form of groups of 4-5 participants per set of tiles, with 2-3 set of tiles at a time.

 As more set can be used it is possible to make groups of more people.

 The training will consist of 1.

5-3 minutes of training (depending on the game) on tiles and the rest while the other 2-3 participants train (4-6 minutes of break).

 Then the participants will train for 1.

5-3 minutes again until each participant have received a total of 13 minutes of training.

 The control group will not train.

 Playware Technology for Balance Training@highlight

This study evaluates the use of Playware technology for balance training.

 Falling among elder is a costly problem.

 Research shows that training can help prevent falls.

 Pilot studies of the use of Interactive Modular Tiles (IMT) show that the participants can highly increase their physical abilities.

 The interventions group will train using interactive modular tiles.

 The tiles include preprogrammed games that create playful training for the participants.

 The control group will receive "usual care", which here refers to normal day activities.

 The intervention will be done 2 times a week for 12 weeks, each session lasting 1 hour and each participant receiving 13 minutes of training each time.
