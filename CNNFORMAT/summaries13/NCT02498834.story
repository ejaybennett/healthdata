(fifthQuint)Using Question Prompt Lists During Pediatric Asthma Visits to Increase Adolescent Involvement.

 The study uses a randomized controlled trial design stratified by provider to assess the impact of an adolescent "asthma question prompt list" combined with a supportive educational video emphasizing the importance of adolescent involvement and question-asking on communication during pediatric visits.

 This application is based on Social Cognitive Theory.

 Self-confidence or self-efficacy is a central component of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) Application of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) in asthma populations has shown that technical advice from providers is one external factor that can improve asthma management self-efficacy.

 Additionally, personal beliefs, such as outcome expectations, and family factors, such as parent and adolescent responsibility for asthma self-management, have been shown to affect adolescent self-efficacy and disease management outcomes.

 Prior work has found that adolescent self-efficacy in asthma management correlates strongly with health status, adherence, asthma medication device technique, asthma symptoms, and impact of illness on the family.

 All adolescents will have their medical visits audio recorded.

 The adolescent will be interviewed after his/her medical visit while his/her caregiver/parent completes a survey at the time of study enrollment.

 This same procedure will be used when the adolescent and caregiver/parents return for the 6- and 12-month follow-up visits.

 Using Question Prompt Lists During Pediatric Asthma Visits to Increase Adolescent Involvement@highlight

The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial with English and Spanish-speaking adolescents to compare the effectiveness of an adolescent "asthma question prompt list" with a supportive educational video intervention with usual care.

 The hypothesis of this study is that by showing the parents and adolescents the educational video and then providing the adolescents with the one-page "asthma question prompt lists" to use during their visits will improve: (a) asthma control, (b) adolescent self-efficacy in managing asthma, and (c) adolescent quality-of-life.
