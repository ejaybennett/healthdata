(thirdQuint)Biosimilar Versus Urinary Gonadotropins.

 Biosimilar products are drugs "like" biotechnological origin to other innovative biological medicines and that can be marketed once the patent has expired.

 These drugs are intended to achieve the same therapeutic benefit as biological medicinal resembles.

 Because of the similarity in both the active substance in the formulation, it is intended to demonstrate the equivalence between the biosimilar medicine of recombinant FSH and FSH of urinary origin in terms of fitness.

 The investigators' main objective is to perform a non-inferiority trial of biosimilar recombinant FSH product compared to a conventional ovarian stimulation protocol with urinary FSH in relation to the number of oocytes retrieved and the number of metaphase II oocytes.

 Biosimilar Versus Urinary Gonadotropins@highlight

Biosimilar drug marketing of recombinant FSH for the treatment of infertility is another step in simplifying fertility treatments, making them easier to manage and more accessible to patients.

 Taking in mind these arguments ,the study is proposed for determining equivalence in terms of biological effectiveness of an ovarian stimulation protocol with biosimilar recombinant FSH stimulation protocol vs.

 urinary FSH in oocyte donation program.
