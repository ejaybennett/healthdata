(secondQuint)A Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Antiretroviral Activity of 10-1074.

 In preclinical studies carried out in humanized mice and non-human primates, 10-1074 alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies led to protection from HIV or simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection and also to sustained suppression of HIV plasma viremia.

 The aims of this protocol are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile of 10-1074 in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals, and its antiretroviral activity in HIV-infected individuals.
