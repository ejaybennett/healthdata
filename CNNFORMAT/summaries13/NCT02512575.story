(fifthQuint)A Single Ascending Dose Study To Assess The Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics And Pharmacodynamics Of AZD9567.

.

 This is a Phase I, first-in-human (FIH), randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose sequential group study in healthy male subjects.

 The objectives are to study the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and effects on glucose homeostasis (pharmacodynamics) of AZD9567.

 Additional exploratory variables (Inflammation biomarkers, ECG modelling and taste assessment) will also be evaluated.

 The study will also assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of prednisolone 60 mg in comparison with high doses of AZD9567 and placebo.

 The study will be conducted at a single study centre with a planned number of subjects of up to 72 healthy males, aged 18 to 55 years.
