(firstQuint)Study Comparing Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy vs Conventional Palliative Radiotherapy (CRT) for Spinal Metastases.

 This research is being done because while there is some evidence suggesting that SBRT may improve treatment for patients with spine metastases, more research is needed to determine if it is better than CRT.

 The first part of the randomized trial (phase II) looked at whether it was possible (feasible) to provide these treatments in cancer centres across Canada, by aiming to recruit 54 participants within 18 months.

 This part of the study was successfully completed in early 2017.

 The second component of this study, called a randomized phase III trial, is now underway.

 It involves recruiting another 98 participants to receive either CRT or SBRT, using the same study procedure as in the feasibility study.

 We will continue to obtain information about whether SBRT is better than CRT at controlling pain.

The purpose of this study is to find out if SBRT is better than CRT at controlling pain in the spine 3 months after receiving treatment.
