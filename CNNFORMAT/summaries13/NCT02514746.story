(thirdQuint)Long-term Immunogenicity After Receipt of JE Vaccine and Antibody Response and Safety to a Booster Dose.

 Study participants previously immunized with CD-JEV (Clinical Trials identifier: NCT01567865, JEV05) will have serum collected three and four years after initial vaccination to assess long-term immunogenicity.

 Four years after receiving the initial dose of CD-JEV, eligible participants will be vaccinated with a second subcutaneous dose of CD-JEV to assess the antibody response.

 Participants will be monitored for safety for 28 days following receipt of the booster dose.

This study aims to understand the persistence of the Japanese encephalitis (JE) antibody response in previously vaccinated children.

 The proposed study is a phase 4 open-label trial enrolling up to 818 Bangladeshi children who had previously participated in a lot to lot consistency study (JEV05) of JE live attenuated SA 14-14-2 vaccine (CD-JEV).
