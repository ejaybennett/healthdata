(thirdQuint)"Sandwich" Chemotherapy With Radiotherapy in Newly Diagnosed, Stage IE to IIE, ENKTL.

 The extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) shows high local or systemic failure rates when radiotherapy (RT) is taken as the primary treatment, suggesting a role for chemotherapy (CT) added to RT for this disease.

 However, the appropriate mode of combined modality therapy (CMT) has not been fully defined.

We conducted a prospective phase II study of "Sandwich" Pegaspargase, cyclophosphamide,vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (P-CHOP) regimen in combination with radiotherapy.

The "sandwich" protocols, refer to earlier RT after an initial 2 cycles of P-CHOP followed by further two "consolidation" cycles.

A phase 2 study was conducted of "sandwich" protocols, with earlier RT after an initial 2 of P-CHOP (Pegaspargase, cyclophosphamide,vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone ), followed by further two "consolidation" cycles,to explore the appropriate mode of combined modality therapy (CMT) in early stage ENKTL.
