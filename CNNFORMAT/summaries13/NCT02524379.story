(firstQuint)Spinal Cord Injury Neuroprotection With Glyburide.

 This study will include patients between 18 and 80 years who have experienced acute traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (specifically ASIA A, B or C).

 Patients will then begin an oral drug regimen of Glyburide (DiaBeta), which must be started within 8 hours of injury and continued for 72 hours at a daily dose of 3.

125 mg on Day 1, 2.

5 mg on Day 2 and 2.

5 mg on Day 3.

 If indicated, the patient will also have surgical intervention for spinal cord decompression and spinal stabilization.

 Every one who takes part in this study will have labs drawn and adverse events assessed through Day 14 or discharge (whichever is earlier), and be carefully monitored throughout their hospitalization.

 Study participation will last for 365 days (+/- 30 days), with post-hospitalization follow up occuring on Days 28, 42, 84, 182 and 365.
