(secondQuint)Effect Evaluation of Independent Medical Evaluation (IME) in Norway.

 A randomized controlled trial in a Norwegian context, involving an effect evaluation, a cost-benefit evaluation and a qualitative evaluation.

 Independent medical evaluation (IME) will be compared to treatment as usual (TAU).

 Independent medical evaluation (IME) will comprise a consultation with an independent general practitioner (IME GP) who will assess whether the sick listed worker has been given eligible and available opportunities in return to work follow-up in Norway.

 The independent medical evaluation general practitioner (IME GP) will write a short report that is sent to the treating general practitioner as input from a colleague.

 The report can be used in the follow-up of the sick listed participant.

 The participants in the treatment as usual (TAU) group will not receive any other follow-up than normal follow-up by the treating general practitioner.

 The qualitative evaluation will be conducted to gain insight into the experiences of the general practitioners and the participants.
