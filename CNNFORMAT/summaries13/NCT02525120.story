(secondQuint)Post Market Non-Inferiority Study Comparing Triojection to Discectomy for Lumbar Disc Herniation.

 The objective of this study is to compare clinical, economic and safety outcomes between Triojection and surgical discectomy.

 The study will include two follow-up phases: 1) an initial follow-up period during the first 6 months after treatment and (2) a long-term follow-up lasting an additional 18 months (2 years total).

 The hypothesis is that over the first six months after treatment, Triojection(R) will be non-inferior to discectomy with respect to the improvement in leg pain.

 This will be demonstrated using a non-inferiority margin of 19.

4 points on the difference between baseline leg pain score and the average leg pain score recorded at 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months.
