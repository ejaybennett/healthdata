(thirdQuint)Long-term Immunogenicity and Safety of Fourth Administration of Boryung Cell-Culture Japanese Encephalitis Vaccineinj.

 This is a follow-up study of KD287-BR-CT-301 (ClinicalTrials.

gov identifier: NCT01150942), a phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of a cell-culture Japanese encephalitis vaccine (ENCEVAC(R)) compared with that of a mouse brain-derived Japanese encephalitis vaccine (Japanese Encephalitis vaccine-GCC(R) inj).

 Subjects participated in KD287-BR-CT-301 study were to receive 3 doses of Japanese encephalitis vaccine (JEV) assigned by randomization from the age of 12 months and those subjects who completed the 3 doses of JEV are the target population in this study.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term immunogenicity and safety of the booster (fourth) dose of JEV, which will be given as Boryung Cell-Culture Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine inj, proven to be same with ENCEVAC(R) but manufactured by a different manufacturer.
