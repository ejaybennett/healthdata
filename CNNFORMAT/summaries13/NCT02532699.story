(fifthQuint)Anti-hypertensive Effect of Mycelia of Antrodia Cinnamomea.

 This the first report undertaken to assess the effect of supplementation with oral gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), adenosine and antrosterol-containing AC mycelia on blood pressure among people with mild hypertension.

 Forty-one subjects with systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 130 and 179 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 85 and 109 mm Hg were randomized to receive either AC mycelia or starch placebo for 8 weeks, and had follow-up observation for an additional 2 weeks.

 SBP in the subjects given GABA, adenosine and antrosterol-rich AC mycelia significantly decreased compared to those who received the placebo (p<0.

05).

 DBP also decreased after the intake of AC mycelia.

 Compared to the placebo, AC mycelia significantly reduced plasma renin activity by a maximum of 25 % and 36 % on week 8.

 This suppression suggested that AC mycelia is a potent inhibitor of renin, and its bioavailability is sufficient to produce BP reduction after a short term of oral administration.

 Neither adverse events nor abnormal laboratory findings were noted throughout the study period, suggesting that GABA, adenosine and antrosterol-rich AC mycelia significantly decreased borderline hypertension, which may support its consideration as a safe alternative treatment compared to conventional anti-hypertensive medications.

This the first report undertaken to assess the effect of supplementation with oral gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), adenosine and antrosterol-containing AC mycelia on blood pressure among people with mild hypertension.

 Overall, AC mycelia consumption for 8 weeks could successfully reduce mean diastolic and systolic BP through the suppression of PRA that is linked to downstream suppresion of angiotensin II formation, which further decreases the sympathetic outflow that leads to hypertension.

 In addition to blood pressure lowering properties, AC mycelia also has beneficial effect in reducing oxidative stress, significantly.

 No adverse events were noted, suggesting that AC mycelia deserve its consideration as a candidate for safe alternative treatment to conventional anti-hypertensive medications.
