(fifthQuint)Pulse Pressure and Post-epidural Fetal Heart Rate Changes.

 Objective: To assess the efficacy of increased IV fluid preload for the prevention of post-epidural FHR changes in women with narrow pulse pressure Hypothesis: In individual with narrow pulse pressure, an increased IV fluid bolus will reduce the rate of post-epidural FHR changes.

 Background: In contemporary obstetric practice, regional anesthesia is the most commonly utilized method for pain management in labor [1,2].

 Compared with no anesthesia, neuraxial techniques have been associated with an increased risk of maternal hypotension, operative vaginal delivery, maternal fever, and cesarean delivery for fetal distress [3].

 Following the initial dosing of regional anesthesia, maternal hypotension and FHR abnormalities occur with reported frequencies of 5-18% and 6-30% respectively [4-9].

 Neuraxial anesthesia can induce a sympathetic blockade, which results in decreased maternal systemic vascular resistance and venous return.

 These alterations in the maternal hemodynamic profile impact maternal blood pressure, uteroplacental blood flow and fetal perfusion, and may contribute to maternal hypotension and changes in the FHR after initiation of regional anesthesia.

 Importantly, these hemodynamic changes generally occur in the setting of a constant maternal intravascular volume.

 Given that the uteroplacental circulation has limited capacity for autoregulation, uterine perfusion is sensitive to changes in both maternal blood pressure and venous return [10].

 This physiology represents the basis for the administration of an intravenous (IV) bolus prior to or during the placement of regional anesthesia [11].

 While maternal hypotension and FHR changes after neuraxial anesthesia are common occurrences, limited information on maternal and fetal characteristics or risk factors has been published [12-14].

 A recent retrospective cohort study by Miller et al.

 reported that a narrow maternal pulse pressure was a risk factor for post-epidural FHR changes [14].

 In this cohort study, women with an admission pulse pressure 45, had a marked increase in the risk of post-epidural FHR changes (27% vs 6%, p 45 on admission (and otherwise meet the aforementioned inclusion/exclusion criteria).

 The control group will receive the standard preload bolus of 500 mL prior to epidural placement.

 This is a practical study using standard clinical practice methods to assess vital signs.

 Maternal vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate) will be collected in the left lateral recumbent position after an initial 5 minute period without activity.

 Automated devices will be used to assess blood pressure and pulse pressure at the following times: on admission, immediately prior to infusion of IV fluid bolus in preparation for epidural placement, immediately following IV fluid bolus infusion, at epidural test dose (T=0), every 5 minutes for 30 minutes (T=0 to T=30), and then every 10 minutes for the next 30 minutes (T=30 to T=60).

 The chart will be abstracted to identify changes in the FHR and interventions.

 Continuous external (or internal, if placed for typical obstetric indications), fetal monitoring will be performed before and after epidural placement as is standard on our L&D unit.

 Treatment of hypotension with administration of vasopressors or additional IV fluid boluses along with the treatment of FHR abnormalities (maternal position changes, supplemental oxygen administration, tocolytic use, cessation of oxytocin) will be recorded.

 Operative delivery for non-reassuring fetal status in the 60 minutes after epidural placement will be recorded.

 Additionally, maternal demographic and medical/obstetric data, maternal and neonatal delivery and outcome data will be recorded.

 The technique for epidural placement and dosing will be standardized as follows.

 Epidural dosing will consist of 5 mL of 0.

125% bupivicane with 10 mcg/mL of fentanyl.

 This standard bolus dose will be administered and levels of sensory block and numeric patient pain scores will be recorded.

 If patients have not achieved a pain score of 4 or less at 15 minutes after the epidural bolus, an additional bolus will be administered to achieve appropriate pain control.

 The volume of additional epidural bolus will be recorded.

 Two independent obstetricians blinded to the randomization group and delivery outcome will interpret the FHR tracing for one hour before and after epidural placement.

 The FHR tracings will be divided into 15 minute epochs and categorized using the standard ACOG categories: I, II and III [24].

 Additional information including FHR baseline, FHR variability, and the presence or absence of accelerations or decelerations will be recorded for each 15min epoch.

 Discrepancies between the tracing interpretations will be reviewed by a third obstetrician for development of a consensus interpretation.

 Pulse Pressure and Post-epidural Fetal Heart Rate Changes@highlight

Epidural anesthesia, the most common method of pain control in labor, can contribute to alterations in maternal blood pressure and/or fetal heart rate changes.

 As a result, the administration of an IV fluid bolus ("preload") is standard prior to epidural placement.

 However, the optimal volume of preload is unknown and no clinical trials have evaluated a risk-factor based approach to dosing.

 Studies in the critical care, trauma, and obstetric literature have suggested that a narrow pulse pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures) is a marker of reduced intravascular volume status and may identify women at a higher risk for new onset fetal heart rate changes after epidural placement.

 Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess if an increased IV fluid preload bolus among women with a narrow pulse pressure reduces the risk of new onset fetal heart rate changes after epidural placement.
