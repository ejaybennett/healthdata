(thirdQuint)Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension With Sodium (Na) Reduction for Chinese Canadians.

 Hypertension has been identified as the most important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and accounts for a large proportion of stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure in the Chinese population.

 While unhealthy diet has been identified as a modifiable risk factor for hypertension, there is a lack of culturally sensitive dietary intervention targeting Chinese Canadians.

 The 8-week DASHNa-CC intervention incorporated Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, sodium reduction with the food therapy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and included an intervention manual, two sessions of classroom instruction delivered in Mandarin, and a 20-minute telephone follow-up.
