(fifthQuint)Using mHealth to Promote Post-Menstrual Regulation Contraceptive Uptake and Continuation in Bangladesh.

 The proposed study aims to develop and evaluate a mHealth intervention to promote post-abortion contraceptive uptake and continuation among menstrual regulation clients in the Sylhet, Chittagong and Dhaka regions of Bangladesh.

 The aim of the formative phase of the study is to develop an interactive two-way messaging service for post-MR clients.

 The messaging service will deliver information relating to the women's contraceptive method of choice as well as information about other modern contraceptive methods.

 This part of the study will focus on determining the modality, content, timing, language and acceptability of messaging services for post menstrual regulation clients.

 The aim of the RCT phase is to measure the effect of mHealth on uptake or switching to long-acting reversible contraceptives at the 4 month and 12 month follow ups.

 The investigators expect mHealth to have a positive effect on uptake and a negative effect on discontinuation rates of contraceptive users.
