(thirdQuint)Shared Care for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Across the Primary and Secondary Health Care Sector.

 The prevalence of patients with type 2 diabetes is in growth globally.

 In order to secure high quality in diabetes care it is necessary to rethink the way in which the care is organized.

 The investigators want to test a new model of shared care across the interface of primary and secondary care sector for patients with type 2 diabetes who are at risk stratification level 2.

 Based on a national and regional risk stratification model patients can be stratified to three levels according to risk and complexity of treatment: level 1 (uncomplicated), level 2 (intermediate risk) and level 3 (high risk).

 The objective of the study is to show equal outcomes among the participants being treated in either a shared care program or an established program in a specialized outpatient clinic.

 The study is a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial.

 The shared care model will be tested during a period of three years.

 All participants are offered four medical visits a year.

 The shared care intervention consists of one annual comprehensive check-up at the outpatient clinic and three quarterly visits at a general practice.

 The control group is followed with four quarterly visits at the outpatient clinic including an annual comprehensive check-up.

 The recruitment period spans over approximately 12 months, and participants are randomized to intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio.

The aim of the study is to test the effect of a new shared care model for type 2 diabetes care and compare it with a standardized care management program in a specialized hospital-based out-patient clinic.

 The hypothesis is that participants with type 2 diabetes followed in a shared care program will have a comparable outcome in HbA1c to participants receiving standard care.
