(thirdQuint)Engage 24: Evaluation of the Safety and Effectiveness of URG101 in Subjects With Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome.

 This is a biphasic adaptive design phase 2a, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, single-dose, pharmacokinetic study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of the combination product (URG101) with its individual components (Heparin Sodium and Lidocaine Hydrochloride).

 The study will consist of a run-in phase of 48 subjects and an investigational phase of up to 300 subjects.

 Eligible subjects exhibiting moderate to severe symptoms of bladder pain associated with their diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome who have signed informed consent, will be screened and provisionally enrolled for intravesical treatment.

 On the day of study drug administration subjects will be randomized (2:1:2:1; URG101:placebo:lidocaine:heparin) and will receive a single administration of one of four intravesical treatments in a blinded fashion, based on random assignment: 1.

 URG101 (buffered lidocaine-heparin) 2.

 Placebo 3.

 Lidocaine Hydrocholoride buffered alone 4.

 Heparin Sodium buffered alone The study is 24 hours in duration.
