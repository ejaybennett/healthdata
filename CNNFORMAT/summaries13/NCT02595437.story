(secondQuint)Triferic Pediatric Pharmacokinetic Protocol.

 This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, 2-period, single-dose study assessing the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Triferic (ferric pyrophosphate citrate, or FPC) administered via dialysate and IV to pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) receiving chronic hemodialysis (CKD-5HD).

 Total participation in the study is approximately three weeks and is comprised of a screening visit, two dosing (PK) visits, and a follow-up visit.

 Each patient will receive a single dose of Triferic administered IV into the venous blood return line over the duration of the dialysis.

 At the next scheduled dialysis session each patient will receive a single dose of Triferic administered via dialysate during a single hemodialysis session.

 Blood samples will be obtained at various times to analyze for serum iron parameters and for safety.

The main purpose is to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Triferic iron administered intravenously in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease on chronic hemodialysis (CKD-5HD).

 It is an open-label, two-period sequential dosing study.
