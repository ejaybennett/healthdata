(fifthQuint)Safety and Pharmacokinetics of IGSC 20% in Subjects With Primary Immunodeficiency.

 This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-sequence, 6-month, pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability study of IGSC 20% in subjects with primary immunodeficiency.

 Approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled in order to have approximately 30 adult subjects and 12 to 15 pediatric subjects (age 2-16 years) completing treatment with subcutaneously administered IGSC 20%.

 This study will include 3 treatment phases: Run-In Phase, IV Phase (IV administration of IGIV-C 10% treatment), and SC Phase (SC administration of IGSC 20%).

 Subjects, depending on their current IgG treatment regimen, may be required to enter the Run-In Phase to receive IV IGIV-C 10% treatment (Sponsor provided) to achieve an approximately steady-state condition prior to entering the IV Phase.

 They will then enter the IV Phase to determine the AUC profiles of IV infusions of IGIV-C 10%.

 Subjects with a qualifying IV IGIV-C 10% treatment regimen (on stable IGIV-C 10% doses of 300-800 mg/kg) can enter the IV Phase directly where they will receive IGIV-C 10%.

 In the IV Phase, steady-state IV PK assessments, including AUC, will be performed.

 After completing the IV Phase, subjects will enter the SC Phase to receive weekly SC doses of IGSC 20% for at least 24 weeks.

 The PK profiles of total IgG following administration of both IV (IGIV-C 10%) administration and SC (IGSC 20%) administration will be determined and compared after reaching approximate steady-state conditions.

 Safety and Pharmacokinetics of IGSC 20% in Subjects With Primary Immunodeficiency@highlight

This study was designed to determine a dose of weekly subcutaneously administered Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Caprylate/Chromatography Purified (Grifols) (IGSC 20%) that produces steady-state AUC of total IgG that is non-inferior to that of the regularly administered intravenous dose of Immune Globulin Injection (Human), 10% Caprylate/Chromatography Purified (Grifols) (IGIV-C 10%) in primary immunodeficiency subjects.

 This study was also designed to determine steady state trough total IgG levels after IGSC 20% infusion and after IGIV-C 10% infusion for comparison and to assess the safety and tolerability of IGSC 20%.
