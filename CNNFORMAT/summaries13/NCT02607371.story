(thirdQuint)Anticoagulation Preference by AF Patients Study.

 The objective of this study is to investigate the following research questions in a cross-sectional survey of German-speaking Swiss AF patients being treated either with a VKA or with a NOAC: - Which attributes of a medication to prevent stroke do AF patients view as important? - Do AF patients have a preference regarding the attributes of the medication options VKA or NOAC and, in case of NOACs, with regards to rivaroxaban attributes? - Are there subgroups of AF patients whose preference for one of the medication options appears above or below average? - What is the quality of life of Swiss German-speaking AF patients? Are there subgroups with differences in their quality of life (for example: subgroups of patients with different CHA2DS2-VASc scores)? - Which burden do German-speaking Swiss AF patients experience in association with their anticoagulation therapy? Are there differences in the burden of treatment (ACTS) between patients treated with VKA or with NOACs?.

 Anticoagulation Preference by AF Patients Study@highlight

The main research question of this patient survey is to assess AF (Atrial Fibrillation) patients' preferences associated with different attributes which describe the different available anticoagulation treatment options (Vitamin K Antagonists [VKA] or New Oral Anticoagulants [NOACs] and, in case of NOACs, Apixaban, Dabigatran, Edoxaban or Rivaroxaban).

 VKAs (Marcoumar(R), Sintrom (R)) will be grouped together and compared to Rivaroxaban.
