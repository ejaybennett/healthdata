(fifthQuint)Effect on Vascular Calcification of Replacing Warfarin by Rivaroxaban With or Without VitK2 in Hemodialysis Patients.

 The present study targets dialysis patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation requiring treatment with vitamin K antagonists.

 It addresses the question whether replacement of the vitamin K antagonist by rivaroxaban is able to slow progression of vascular calcification (VC).

 The second research question is whether addition of vitamin K2 to rivaroxaban can further beneficially affect the progression of VC.

 Two non-invasive methods are used to evaluate the impact of interventions on the progression of VC: i.

e.

 coronary artery calcification (CAC) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements.

 The detection of CAC is predictive for the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease and future coronary events.

 VC and stiffening of the central elastic-type arteries are independent predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients.

 Effect on Vascular Calcification of Replacing Warfarin by Rivaroxaban With or Without VitK2 in Hemodialysis Patients@highlight

This study examines patients on chronic hemodialysis with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, who have a CHA2DS2-VASc Score of 2 and therefore are candidates for or already receive a vitamin K antagonist.

 The first question is whether replacement of the vitamin K antagonist by rivaroxaban is able to slow progression of vascular calcification.

 The second question is whether addition of vitamin K2 to rivaroxaban can further slow down or even halt the progression of vascular calcification.
