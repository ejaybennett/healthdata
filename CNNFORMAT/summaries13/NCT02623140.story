(thirdQuint)BIOFREEDOM Stent Versus ORSIRO Stent: SORT OUT IX.

 SORT OUT IX is a randomized, multicenter, all-comer, two-arm, non-inferiority trial comparing the polymer-free Biolimus-eluting BIOFREEDOM stent with a biodegradable-polymer Sirolimus-eluting ORSIRO stent in treating atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions.

 Patients will be enrolled by the investigators and randomly allocated to treatment groups after diagnostic coronary angiography and before percutaneous coronary intervention.

 Block randomization by centre (permuted blocks of random sizes (2/4/6)) will be used to assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive the polymer-free Biolimus-eluting BIOFREEDOM stent (Biosensors) or the biodegradable-polymer Sirolimus-eluting ORSIRO stent (Biotronik).

 A web based Trial Partner randomization system will be used.

 BIOFREEDOM Stent Versus ORSIRO Stent: SORT OUT IX@highlight

The aim of the Danish Organization for Randomized Trials with Clinical Outcome (SORT OUT) is to compare the safety and efficacy of the polymer-free Biolimus-eluting BIOFREEDOM stent with a biodegradable-polymer Sirolimus-eluting ORSIRO stent in a population-based setting, using registry detection of clinically driven events
