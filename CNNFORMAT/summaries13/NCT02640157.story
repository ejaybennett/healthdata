(secondQuint)A Study Comparing Efficacy and Safety of ABT-493/ABT-530 to Sofosbuvir Dosed With Daclatasvir in Adults With HCV Genotype 3 Infection.

 This study was a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled multicenter study to compare efficacy and safety of ABT-493/ABT-530 to SOF and DCV in treatment-naive chronic HCV GT3-infected participants without cirrhosis.

 The study consisted of 2 periods, a treatment period (participants received 8 or 12 weeks of ABT-493/ABT-530 or 12 weeks of SOF with DCV) and a post-treatment period (participants who completed or prematurely discontinued the treatment period were followed for 24 weeks after their last dose of study drug to evaluate efficacy and to monitor HCV RNA and the emergence and persistence of viral variants).
