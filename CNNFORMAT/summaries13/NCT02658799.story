(fifthQuint)Effects of a Cyclic NSAID Regimen on Levels of GCF PGE-E2 and IL-1beta.

 Study Design This study utilized a randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group design to investigate the 6-month effect of a cyclic regimen of diclofenac potassium [50 mg, twice daily (b.

i.

d)] on clinical parameters of periodontal disease and levels of PGE2 and IL-1beta in GCF.

 After clinical and radiographic examination, subjects were divided into two groups: 28 patients in the test group and 13 patients in the control group.

 Of the 28 patients in the test group, ten (nine men, one woman) were smokers, eleven (six women, five men) were non-smokers, and seven (all men) were ex-smokers.

 Thirteen patients in the control group comprised six smokers (five men, one woman), five non-smokers (four women, one man) and two ex-smokers (both men).

 Test and control groups were administered either diclofenac potassium (50 mg) or placebo gel caps (containing inactive filler of starch flour and carboxymethylcellulose), respectively, b.

 after a meal for 6 months in a cyclic regimen.

 Administration of diclofenac potassium or placebo was undertaken from baseline to 2 months, no drug (diclofenac potassium or placebo) was administered from 2 to 4 months, then diclofenac potassium or placebo therapy was reinstituted (b.

) from 4 to 6 months.

 To promote compliance, each patient was recalled monthly.

 Patients in both groups were instructed on oral hygiene, including tooth brushing for at least 2 minutes (b.

) and daily interdental cleaning.

 SRP was not carried out during these recalls.

 During the screening period (baseline as well as 2, 4 and 6 months), all subjects underwent physical examinations and biochemical analyses (blood chemistry, complete blood count, urinalyses and pregnancy testing).

 Effects of a Cyclic NSAID Regimen on Levels of GCF PGE-E2 and IL-1beta@highlight

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used for inflammation control and pain relief.

 However, while adjunct use of NSAIDs is avoided for periodontal therapy because of related side effects, cyclic administration of NSAIDs may reduce or eliminate these effects.

 The investigators evaluated the effect of a cyclic diclofenac potassium regimen on clinical parameters and levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of subjects with periodontitis.

 Forty-one subjects with moderate to chronic periodontitis (33 men, 8 women) were divided into two groups (test and control) after initial periodontal therapy.

 During this 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, test (n = 28) and control (n = 13) groups were administered a cyclic regimen of diclofenac potassium (50 mg, twice daily) or placebo.

 Clinical measurements of disease severity and GCF sample collections were made at baseline, 2, 4 and 6 months.

 GCF levels of PGE2 and IL1-1beta were determined using EIA and ELISA kits, respectively.
