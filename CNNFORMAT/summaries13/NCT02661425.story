(fifthQuint)Retrospective Study of IBS-D Patients Previously Receiving SBI.

 - The first collection of information (Visit 1 - Chart Report Form) will be for the visit at which the SOC therapy, utilized immediately before the introduction of EnteraGam, was initiated.

 This data point will serve as the baseline for that SOC therapy.

 - The second collection of information (Visit 2 - Chart Report Form) will be for the visit at which the original prescription for EnteraGam was written and the patient was instructed to begin the therapy.

 Captured data will consist of information contained in the patient's chart for a minimum of eight weeks and a maximum of 12 weeks prior to initiation of EnteraGam therapy.

 This data point will serve as the baseline for initiation of EnteraGam therapy.

 - The third collection point (Visit 3 - Chart Report Form) will be at the next patient visit to the clinic - provided that visit is a minimum of eight weeks following initiation of EnteraGam therapy.
