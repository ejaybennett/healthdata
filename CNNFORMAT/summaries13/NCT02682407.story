(thirdQuint)Safety Study of IgAN, LN, MN, & C3 Glomerulopathy Including Dense Deposit Disease Treated With OMS721.

 This is a Phase 2, multicenter study of OMS721 in subjects with the following diseases: IgA Nephropathy (IgAN), Lupus Nephritis, Membranous Nephropathy (MN), or C3 Glomerulopathy, including Dense Deposit Disease.

 Three cohorts will be enrolled.

 Cohort 1 will be subjects with corticosteroid dependent IgAN, LN, MN, or C3 Glomerulopathy.

 Cohort 1 subjects will all receive OMS721 in an uncontrolled, open-label design.

 Cohort 2 and 3 will be subjects with IgA nephropathy who are not receiving corticosteroids.

 These cohorts will be randomized to receive either OMS721 treatment or D5W vehicle in a randomized double-blind design.

 Approximately 44 subjects will be enrolled (16 in Cohort 1, 10 in Cohort 2, and 18 in Cohort 3).
