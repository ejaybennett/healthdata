(secondQuint)Bone and Vascular Health in Postmenopausal Women With Type 1 Diabetes.

 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease requiring lifelong insulin treatment.

 Having T1D increases the risk of death, especially in women with T1D.

 Heart disease and fractures due to osteoporosis (brittle bones) are the leading causes of death in women with T1D.

 Since both diseases share certain common risk factors such as age, menopause, smoking, physical inactivity, and diabetes, this study is designed to find link between bone density and cardiovascular risk.

 This study has only one visit.

 All participants will undergone bone density testing using a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) machine and measurement of carotid intima media thickness (a marker of carotid atherosclerosis) using carotid ultrasound.

The study is designed to evaluate the differences in bone mineral density (BMD) and Carotid Intima Media Thickness (CIMT) between postmenopausal women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) compared to postmenopausal women without diabetes.
