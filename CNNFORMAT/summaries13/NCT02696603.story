 Living with Parkinson disease means coping with symptoms that change every day.

 Yet these changes are not tracked frequently enough.

 Most people with Parkinson disease see a clinician only once or twice a year.

 This study measures changes in Parkinson disease symptoms in real time using an app.

 The app remotely monitors Parkinson disease symptoms using surveys and the sensors on mobile devices.

 This study may contribute to increasing our understanding of the variability in Parkinson disease symptoms.

 This knowledge could be used to improve quality of life for people living with Parkinson disease.
