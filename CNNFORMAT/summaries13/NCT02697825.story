(secondQuint)Intraocular Pressure Versus Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter.

 Steep trendelenburg position is required for various robotic surgical procedures like hysterectomy, radical prostatectomy etc.

 Both Intraocular Pressure and Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter are found to get increased while in this position.

 Intraocular Pressure will be measured by schiotz tonometer over an hourly interval whereas Optic nerve sheath diameter will be measured with use of ultrasound using a probe of 7.

5 Mega hertz.

 Both values will be measured in both the eyes and will be compared statistically to find any correlation which may exist between the two.

 Intraocular Pressure Versus Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter@highlight

This study involves observing and comparing Intraocular Pressure and Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter in steep trendelenburg position.

 Both observations will be done in same patient over the surgical duration.
