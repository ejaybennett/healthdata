(fifthQuint)Sleep Apnea in Elderly.

 Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) has a high prevalence and is associated with adverse cardiovascular consequences in elderly Veterans.

 Positive airway pressure therapy is deemed cumbersome and often associated with non-adherence to therapy.

 This proposal will investigate whether alternative therapies can be developed by modulating specific physiologic mechanisms of ventilatory control.

 Specifically, the investigators will study whether interventions with sustained hyperoxia (Aim 1), finasteride (Aim 2) and acetazolamide (Aim 3) will reduce breathing instability during sleep by reducing chemoresponsiveness and/or increasing cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in order to alleviate sleep disordered breathing in the elderly with sleep apnea.

 The proposed aims will also allow us to delineate key mechanisms of breathing instability in the elderly.

 The investigators envision that the results obtained from this project will ultimately allow us to develop novel alternative therapies for sleep apnea in the elderly.

 We will also compare CVR in young vs older adults.

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB or sleep apnea) is very common among elderly Veterans and leads to increased morbidity and mortality in this population.

 The proposal aims to identity whether oxygen, finasteride and acetazolamide can be effective in reducing unstable breathing and eliminating sleep apnea in the elderly via different mechanisms.

 This proposal will enhance the investigators' understanding of the pathways that contribute to the development of sleep apnea in the elderly.

 The investigators expect that the results obtained from this study will positively impact the health of Veterans by identifying new treatment modalities for sleep apnea.

 A cumulative effect of the investigators' research will fulfill the long-term goal of improving the quality of life of elderly Veterans suffering from sleep apnea and its potential life-threatening complications.
