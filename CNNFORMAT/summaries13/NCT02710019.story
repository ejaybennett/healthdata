(fifthQuint)Good Shepherd: Back to Reality Series.

 This project examines the use of video game technology to help youth gain awareness of symptoms and problems associated with hazardous substance use.

 By playing the Back to Reality video games, youths may absorb knowledge about where and how to access community care for symptoms associated with psychosis and problematic cannabis use.

 The purpose of this study is to pilot test the effectiveness of the Back to Reality series at improving awareness of the social and emotional implications of underage substance use.

 Recognizing and overcoming hazardous substance use is essential for youth to develop positive self-identities and to flourish socially and academically.

 Improving mental health literacy may help youth to become better-informed consumers.

 This study involves a randomized single blind controlled trial of video games along with a post-intervention mixed method design.

 The results will be assessed using quantitative questionnaires and qualitative interviews.

 The qualitative interview assesses the participants understanding of potential emotional, social, and psychiatric manifestations of excessive marijuana use during youth.
