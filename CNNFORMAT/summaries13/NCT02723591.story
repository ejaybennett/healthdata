(thirdQuint)To Compare the Effects of Immediate-release Tacrolimus and Astagraf XL on Donor-Specific Antibody (DSA) Formation and the Development of Immune Activation (IA) in de Novo Kidney Transplant Recipients.

 This is an exploratory, two year, prospective, randomized, multi-center, open-label trial examining long-term kidney transplant outcomes through the use of an adaptive design and a two-part, composite surrogate endpoint.

 Specifically, it is designed to compare the effects of twice daily, immediate-release tacrolimus and once daily Astagraf XL on DSA formation and the development of a peripheral blood molecular profile indicating the presence of immune activation (IA) in de novo kidney transplant recipients during the first two years following transplantation.

 For the purposes of this study, IA will be defined as a molecular signature indicating either clinical acute rejection (cAR) or subacute rejection (subAR).

 Patients will be screened prior to surgery and randomized 1:1 to receive immediate-release tacrolimus, administered twice daily, or Astagraf XL, as a component of a standard immunosuppression maintenance regimen also consisting of corticosteroids (if given per institutional protocol) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (or Myfortic(R) equivalent).

 Investigators are encouraged to start subjects on the randomized study treatment (immediate release tacrolimus or Astagraf XL) within 48 hours of transplantation (pre-transplant administration of study treatment is not allowed).

 However, if medically indicated per the treating physician's discretion, initiation of study treatment may be delayed for up to seven days post-transplant.

 To Compare the Effects of Immediate-release Tacrolimus and Astagraf XL on Donor-Specific Antibody (DSA) Formation and the Development of Immune Activation (IA) in de Novo Kidney Transplant Recipients@highlight

This study will compare the incidence of a two-part composite endpoint consisting of de novo donor specific antibody (DSA) formation or a designation of "immune activation" (IA) on peripheral blood molecular profiling in patients maintained on twice daily, immediate-release tacrolimus versus those maintained on Astagraf XL in the first two years post-transplant.
