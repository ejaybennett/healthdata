(firstQuint)Single-Dose Study to Assess the Absorption, Metabolism, Excretion, and Mass Balance of Radiolabeled Galeterone.

 This is an open label, 1 period study under fed conditions.

 Six (6), healthy, adult, non tobacco using, male subjects will be enrolled.

 Screening of subjects will occur within 28 days prior to dosing.

 On Day 1, a single dose of radio-labeled galeterone will be administered orally.

 Blood, urine, and fecal samples will be collected until release criteria are met to measure total radioactivity, for analysis of galeterone concentrations, and for potential metabolic profiling.
