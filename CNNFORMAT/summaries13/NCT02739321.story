(fifthQuint)Examining the Efficacy of Mattress Technology in Improving the Sleep Quality of Children With ASD.

 The present study aims to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of a new mattress technology in improving the sleep quality of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

 Clinical and population studies indicate that children with ASD exhibit elevated rates of sleep disturbance compared to their typically-developing peers and that 50% to 80% of children with ASD have sleep problems.

 Sleep disturbance can include bedtime resistance, sleep onset latency, nighttime awakenings, decreased total sleep time, early morning awakenings, and other measures of sleep quality.

 Sleep problems in children with ASD are associated with greater externalizing and internalizing behavior problems during the waking day, poorer adaptive functioning, and can cause significant parental stress.

 Previous studies have examined the effectiveness of behavioral treatments, environmental modifications, melatonin, and psychopharmacologic treatments in decreasing the rates of sleep disturbance.

 However, none of these approaches have identified treatments that are effective for all ASD-affected children with sleep difficulties.

 Given the high prevalence of sleep disturbance in this population, there is a great need to identify additional treatments that may improve sleep in children with ASD.

 The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of the Sound To Sleep System cent using a single blind (actigraphy scoring blinded), cross-over design.

 The Sound To Sleep System cent is a mattress foundation designed to improve sleep quality in individuals with ASD and sleep disturbance by providing mattress vibrations that accompany and sync with auditory stimulation.

 For the present study, the primary objectives are as follows: Study Aim 1- To determine whether the use of the Sound To Sleep System cent in ASD-affected children with sleep disturbances is well tolerated as defined by group drop-out proportion due to issues with the mattress technology.

 The study will also explore the following objectives: Study Aim 2- To determine the efficacy of the Sound To Sleep System cent in improving parent-reported sleep quality in ASD-affected children with sleep disturbances.

 Study Aim 3- To determine the tolerability of the Sound To Sleep System cent as defined by study drop-out due to any reason and caregiver ratings of ease of mattress technology use.

 Study Aim 4- To determine whether use of the mattress technology improves functioning as defined by secondary outcome measures.

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of the Sound To Sleep System cent in improving the sleep quality of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

 The Sound To Sleep System cent is a mattress foundation designed to improve sleep quality in individuals with ASD and sleep disturbance by providing mattress vibrations that accompany and sync with auditory stimulation.

 For the present study, the primary objectives are as follows: * Study Aim 1 - To determine whether the use of the Sound To Sleep System cent in ASD-affected children with sleep disturbances is well tolerated as defined by group drop-out proportion due to issues with the mattress technology.

 The study will also explore the following objectives: - Study Aim 2 - To determine the efficacy of the Sound To Sleep System cent in improving sleep quality as measured by parent reported sleep quality in ASD-affected children with sleep disturbances.

 (Please note Study Aim 2 was changed from clinician-rated to parent-rated because we were not able to collect clinician-rated sleep quality information).

 - Study Aim 3 - To determine the tolerability of the Sound To Sleep System cent as defined by study drop-out due to any reason and caregiver ratings of ease of mattress technology use.

 - Study Aim 4 - To determine whether use of the mattress technology improves functioning as defined by secondary outcome measures.
