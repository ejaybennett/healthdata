(fifthQuint)Protective HA Factors.

 Patients will be given a link to audio files on dropbox which they can download onto their smartphone.

 They consist of breathing techniques, imaging, progressive relaxation, and more.

 Patients will be asked to perform 20 minutes of relaxation therapy at least 3 times a week.

 Patients will record their headache frequency and intensity, in addition to other symptoms, and the frequency of practicing the behavioral therapy using Curelator Headache.

 cent Curelator Inc.

 (Cambridge USA) has developed a proprietary, non-pharmaceutical, digital platform, called Curelator Headache, cent to collect daily data, identify trigger-attack associations and propose 'tests' of trigger modification.

 The Curelator approach requires high quality data from the individual, entered on a daily basis.

 Compliance is expected to be enhanced because the study if being offered by the individual's healthcare provider.

 This a pilot study of an initial 90 days use of a digital platform to identify potential migraine protective factors (Curelator Headache cent ) in subjects with physician-diagnosed episodic or chronic migraine or post-concussive headache.

 Subjects are recruited to Curelator Headache use by a physician and enter data each day.

 The baseline period (90 days) is followed by a test period (90 days) during which, under Curelator guidance, subjects make one or more modifications to their behaviors based on the data from the 90 day period.

 The study will include up to 100 patients with chronic or episodic migraine and 75 patients with postconcussive headache.

 At clinics, investigators will offer participation to consecutive migraine patients with 6-20 headache days a month and to consecutive concussion patients complaining of headache more than 1 month post concussive event.

 Protective HA Factors@highlight

This is a naturalistic study of 100 migraineurs and 75 post concussive headache patients who will be asked to record their headaches, medications, sleep and other behaviors in a smartphone app called Curelator.

 The software was developed to identify possible headache triggers.

 We seek to determine whether there might be protective headache factors.

 Patients will be given audio files with relaxation therapies.

 We seek to understand whether this self relaxation therapy and/or traditional evidence based behavioral treatment recommended during a patient visit is protective against migraine attacks.
