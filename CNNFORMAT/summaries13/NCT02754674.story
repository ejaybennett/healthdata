(thirdQuint)Comparison of Femoral Tunnel and Clinical Outcome Using Two Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Techniques.

 Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury patients : Total 66 1.

 Double bundle transportal technique with flexible reamer: 33 - Advantage: more normal ACL reconstruction than single bundle technique - Disadvantage: to make the two bone tunnel must remove all the residual tissue.

 2.

 Single bundle outside in technique with remnant preservation: 33 - Advantage: good for being synovium and revascularization.

 Remained proprioception function helps to functional recovery.

 - Disadvantage: difficult to ensure of visibility and tunnel drilling in the correct position because of remnant tissue.
