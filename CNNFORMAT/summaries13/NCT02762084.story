(thirdQuint)Trial of Patidegib Gel 2%, 4%, and Vehicle to Decrease the Number of Surgically Eligible Basal Cell Carcinomas (BCC) in Gorlin Syndrome Patients.

 This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of patidegib gel, 2% and 4% in comparison with that of vehicle.

 To be eligible for the study, subjects must be at least 18 years of age and must meet the diagnostic criteria for basal cell nevus syndrome BCNS.

 Approximately 18 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive patidegib gel 2%, patidegib gel 4%, vehicle gel.

 One or two tubes of the assigned study drug will be dispensed to the subject at the Baseline visit.

 Additional tubes will be dispensed at subsequent visits through Week 22.

 The study drug will be applied topically to the entire face as well as to treatment-targeted surgically eligible basal cell carcinomas (SEBs) at other anatomical sites twice daily for 26 weeks of treatment.

 Information on reported and observed adverse events will be obtained at each visit.

 An abbreviated physical examination will be performed at Baseline, Week 14, and Week 26.

 At Baseline and Weeks 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26, all visible BCCs (excluding areas below the knees) will be identified by the Investigator, circled in ink, photographed, measured, and recorded on a body diagram.

 Treatment targeted SEBs are defined as the five SEBs on the face and/or other anatomical areas identified at Baseline as SEBs will be treated during the 26 week treatment phase.

 If a subject has 5 eligible previously untreated facial SEBs (excluding tumors on nose and eyelids) these tumors will be the subject's 5 baseline treatment targeted SEBs and non-facial baseline SEBs will not be treated with study medication.

Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled evaluates the efficacy and safety of patidegib gel, 2% and 4% in comparison with vehicle in subjects at least 18 years of age that meet the diagnostic criteria for basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS).

 Subjects will be randomized to receive patidegib gel 4%, patidegib gel 2%, or the vehicle gel for a 26 week treatment period.
