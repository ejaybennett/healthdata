(firstQuint)A Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of MOR208 With Bendamustine (BEN) Versus Rituximab (RTX) With BEN in Adult Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).

 This is a randomised, two-arm, multicentre, open-label phase II/III efficacy and safety study of MOR208 in combination with BEN versus RTX in combination with BEN given to adult patients who have relapsed after or are refractory to at least one but no more than three prior systemic therapies and have failed, or are not candidates for HDC and ASCT, and have thus exhausted their therapeutic options of demonstrated clinical benefit.

 At least one prior therapy line must have included a CD20-targeted therapy.
