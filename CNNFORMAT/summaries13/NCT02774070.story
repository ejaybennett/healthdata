(secondQuint)Characteristics of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients With Atlantoaxial Synovitis Detected by Plain X-ray and MRI.

 Atlantoaxial joint affection in rheumatoid arthritis patients may have life-threatening complications if not detected early.

 It may not be detected unless it becomes symptomatic.

 However, asymptomatic atlantoaxial joint affection is not uncommon.

 Investigators will try to detect atlantoaxial joint affection at an early stage and its relation to symptomatology and other disease criteria.

 So investigators will use conventional plain X-ray examination combined with magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine to detect soft tissue as well as bony changes of this condition.
