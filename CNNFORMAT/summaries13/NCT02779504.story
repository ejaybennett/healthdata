(fifthQuint)Post Market Clinical Follow Up Study for Evaluation of Agluna METS.

 This post-market clinical follow-up study will be a retrospective data comparison study of a series of Agluna(R) treated and untreated METS cent modular prostheses conducted at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore.

 The expected sample size will be 106, with 53 patients in each treatment arm (Agluna(R) treated vs untreated).

 However there will be an initial pilot of 20 subjects to evaluate the feasibility of the study conduct and to identify if any further study design modification are required.

 The primary outcome is the estimation of the infection rate over 12 months following an Agluna (silver) treated METS cent endoprosthetic surgery.

 This will be compared to the infection rate of non-Agluna Treated devices in a similar population.

 Incidence of infection will be measured according to the accepted definition of periprosthetic joint infection from the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.

 The study follow up period is 12 months after implantation.

 Secondary objectives are to examine the health economic impacts of using the Agluna(R) Treated METS cent Modular Tumour System in comparison to the untreated METS cent Modular Tumour System and to establish clinically relevant superiority of the Agluna(R) Treated METS cent Modular Tumour System in comparison to untreated METS cent Modular Tumour System.

 Post Market Clinical Follow Up Study for Evaluation of Agluna METS@highlight

The Agluna(R) (antimicrobial ionic silver surface technology) is used to treat the surface of the METS (Modular Endoprosthetic Tumour System) medical devices, in order to reduce the risk of post surgical infections after orthopaedic endoprosthetic replacement surgery.

 This Post Market Clinical Follow up study is designed to retrospectively establish the infection rate of a cohort patients who have received an Agluna(R) Treated METS implant and compare the clinical data to patients that have received an untreated METS implant; in order to provide evidence to support the investigators' clinical claims.
