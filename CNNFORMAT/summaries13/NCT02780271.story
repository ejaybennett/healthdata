(fifthQuint)Diet and Physical Activity Changes Among Latina Breast Cancer Survivors.

 There are clear diet and physical activity guidelines for cancer survivors: eat a diet high in fruits/vegetables and low in energy-dense foods and engage in 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each week.

 However, cancer survivors are provided with few, if any, resources to meet these guidelines and there are limited data supporting how cancer survivors can achieve sustained dietary change.

 There are even fewer behavioral change resources available to minority cancer survivors.

 Few studies have examined the separate and synergistic effects of in-person education and electronic or "e-"communication strategies in changing and maintaining health behaviors.

 Diet and Physical Activity Changes Among Latina Breast Cancer Survivors@highlight

We will conduct a 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial to test the separate and synergistic effects of an in-person hands-on dietary and physical activity change curriculum (i.

e.

, Mi Vida Saludable program) and e-communication strategies (text messaging, emailed newsletters and an interactive website) on changing dietary and physical activity behaviors among a diverse population of Latina breast cancer survivors who have completed breast cancer treatment.

 Participants will be evenly randomized to 4 arms: in-person education alone, e-communication alone, in-person education plus e-communication, or control.
