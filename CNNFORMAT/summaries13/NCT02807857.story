(fifthQuint)A Prospective Evaluation of Natriuretic Peptide Based Referral of CHF Patients in Primary Care.

 In the majority of European countries, the primary management of chronic heart failure patients is performed by General Practitioners in collaboration with cardiologists (specialists).

 Previous studies have shown that many patients suffering from CHF do not receive optimal pharmacological and/or device treatment for their disease.

 An increase in natriuretic peptides (BNP, NT-proBNP) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in heart failure patients.

 The purpose of the present study is to assess if a referral of clinical stable chronic heart failure patients with reduced ventricular ejection fraction (EF or = 600 pg/mL to a specialist (cardiologist) will lead to treatment optimization, defined as adherence to the treatment recommendations according to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines.

 In addition, data obtained in this study will be used to describe demographic, clinical (including NT-proBNP levels) and treatment characteristics of CHF patients who are managed in the primary care setting across Europe.

This low interventional study, whose unique intervention will be to measure the blood level of a biomarker called NT-proBNP in chronic heart failure patients daily followed-up by Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) in Europe, will assess if the cardiologist referral guided by NT-proBNP measurement in patients who are currently judged by PCPs as being stable, will lead to optimization of HF treatment, defined in adherence to treatment recommendations of the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the treatment of heart failure.
