(fifthQuint)Haploidentical Bone Marrow Transplant With Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide for Patients With Severe Aplastic Anemia.

 Mismatched haploidentical donors will be identified for patients with severe aplastic anemia.

 These patients will undergo a preparative regimen of Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide/TBI followed by haploidentical bone marrow transplantation.

 Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide will be administered on Days 3 & 4.

 Immunosuppression with Tacrolimus and MMF will begin on Day +5; MMF will be discontinued on Day +35 while Tacrolimus continues until Day +180.

 Investigators hypothesize that haploidentical transplantation with the above-mentioned preparative regimen will have a <30% graft failure rate.

 The one-sided exact Binomial test at 5% significance level will be used to test this hypothesis.

 The size of 20 patients provides the power of 92.

5% for confirming the 30-day graft failure rate <30%.

 Haploidentical Bone Marrow Transplant With Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide for Patients With Severe Aplastic Anemia@highlight

Severe aplastic anemia is a rare and serious form of bone marrow failure related to an immune-mediated mechanism that results in severe pancytopenia and high risk for infections and bleeding.

 Patients with matched sibling donors for transplantation have a 80-90% chance of survival; however, a response rate with just immunosuppression for those patients lacking suitable HLA-matched related siblings is only 60%.

 With immunosuppression, only 1/3 of patients are cured, 1/3 are dependent on long term immunosuppression, and the other 1/3 relapse or develop a clonal disorder.

 Recent studies have shown that using a haploidentical donor for transplantation has good response rates and significantly lower rates of acute and chronic GVHD.
