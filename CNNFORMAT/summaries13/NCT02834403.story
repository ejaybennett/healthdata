(fifthQuint)L-NMMA Plus Docetaxel in Refractory Locally Advanced or Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients.

 This is a Phase Ib/II study assessing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and efficacy of L-NMMA when combined with docetaxel in refractory locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients.

 The Phase Ib portion of the study is designed to investigate the combination at two dose levels of docetaxel (75 and 100 mg/m2) and 7 dose levels of L-NMMA (5, 7.

5, 10, 12.

5, 15, 17.

5, and 20 mg/kg).

 The starting dose of L-NMMA will be 7.

5 mg/kg.

 L-NMMA dose will escalate/de-escalate based on DLT occurrence.

 For the 5, 7.

5, 10, 12.

5, and 15 mg/kg L-NMMA doses, docetaxel will be administered at 75 mg/m2.

 For the 17.

5 and 20 mg/kg L-NMMA doses, docetaxel will be administered at 100 mg/m2.

 In the Phase II portion of the study, the starting dose will be the RP2D determined in the Phase Ib portion of the study.

 Patients will receive up to 6 (21-day) cycles of the L-NMMA and docetaxel combination.

 L-NMMA will be administered via 2-hour intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1-5 of each cycle.

 Docetaxel will be administered via 1-hour IV infusion approximately 15 minutes after the Day 1 L-NMMA infusion.

 For L-NMMA-induced hypertension, amlodipine (10 mg) will be orally administered for 6 days at each cycle.

 Amlodipine administration will start 24 hours before the first dose of L-NMMA.

 For docetaxel-induced leukopenia, pegfilgrastim (6 mg) will be administered via subcutaneous injection approximately 24 hours after every dose of docetaxel.
