(secondQuint)Effect of Two Multiple-dose Regimens of BIA 3-202 on the Pharmacokinetics and Motor Response of Levodopa, and on the Erythrocyte Comt Activity in Parkinson's Disease Patients.

 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, four-way crossover study.

 The study consisted of 4 treatment periods in at least 16 patients with PD treated with standard release levodopa/carbidopa (Sinemet(R)).

 Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with placebo, nebicapone 75 mg, nebicapone 150 mg or entacapone 200 mg (Comtan(R)) in 4 different sequences.
