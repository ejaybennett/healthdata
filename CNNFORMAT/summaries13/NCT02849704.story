(thirdQuint)Fat Malabsorption in Chronic Pancreatitis.

 Reduced exocrine pancreatic function or pancreatic insufficiency (RPF/PI) contributes to poor clinical outcome in a number of diseases and conditions.

 The incidence, mechanism and substantial adverse clinical outcomes of pancreatic insufficiency (PI) are well known in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and the life sustaining role of pancreatic enzyme medication in CF care is well established.

 Much less is known about the incidence and impact of RPF/PI in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP).

 Reliable non-invasive screening or diagnostic tests with acceptable patient burden are not available for RPF/PI.

 This is a cohort study of subjects with CP who will be evaluated before and after pancreatic enzyme medication (Creon36 cent ) administration.

 A cohort of healthy subjects will serve as a comparison group and will be evaluated only once.

 Subjects with CP will receive Creon36 cent , a pancreatic enzyme medication, and fat and energy absorption will be evaluated using three methods: MBT, CFA, and BC before and after administration of Creon36 cent .

 Many patients with CP are at risk for RPF/PI yet they rarely undergo diagnostic testing.

 Pancreatic enzyme medication will likely improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in some of those with RPF/PI.

 A cohort of healthy volunteers will be evaluated with the three methods to provide essential comparison data to optimize the understanding and interpretation of the findings from the three methods and the RPF/PI cohort with CP.

 There will be no intervention for the healthy cohort.

 Fat Malabsorption in Chronic Pancreatitis@highlight

The objective of this study is to evaluate the malabsorption blood test (MBT), stool coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) and stool bomb calorimetry (BC) methods as potential screening or diagnostic tests for reduced exocrine pancreatic function or pancreatic insufficiency (RPF/PI).

 A further objective is to determine the test responses before and after pancreatic enzyme medication administration (Creon36 cent ) in the patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP).
