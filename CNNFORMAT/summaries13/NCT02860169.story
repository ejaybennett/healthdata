(thirdQuint)Motivation, Brain Function and Mood in Individuals With Cold and/or Flu.

 The study is designed in three parts.

 The first, Part A, is an online survey to select salient images (cold & flu related) to be used in the motivation task under investigation in Parts B and C.

 Part B is a pilot investigation of a novel measure of motivation, using a grip force cognitive task (PST, previously used in obesity literature) in a small group of participants with cold and flu compared to a group without.

 The result of this pilot study will inform task content and sample size for Part C.

 The final part will investigate the effects of cold and flu on motivation (using the PST), cognitive performance (using the Cambridge Cognition Cognitive Assessments [CANTAB] testing battery) and subjective mood and motivation in participants suffering from C&F and healthy participants.

 Motivation, Brain Function and Mood in Individuals With Cold and/or Flu@highlight

This study aim to adapt and test a novel indication of motivation in participants with cold & flu using the Picture Surfing Task (PST).

 The purpose of this task, in both healthy participants and those with cold & flu, will be to provide a measure of: 1) change in general motivation, 2) change in cold and flu-specific motivation, and 3) any change in general tendency to exert force to serve as a control.
