(secondQuint)Comparative Effectiveness of Microprocessor Controlled and Carbon Fiber Prosthetic Feet in Transtibial Amputees.

 Recent advancements in microprocessor controlled prosthetic ankle-foot systems have allowed additional functionality for the lower limb amputee, but research into the effectiveness of microprocessor controlled ankle-foot systems has been limited.

 In this research study, differences in perceived mobility, functional capabilities and gait parameters between energy storing and returning and microprocessor controlled ankle-foot mechanisms will be identified where they exist.

 Also a comparison of the initial function with a new system compared to the function after a four week accommodation period will provide insight into the time it takes for the prosthesis user to experience a benefit from a microprocessor ankle-foot.

The purpose of this research is to evaluate benefits of a microprocessor controlled prosthetic ankle-foot device compared to a non-microprocessor controlled or passive carbon fiber prosthetic ankle-foot device.
