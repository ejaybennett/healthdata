(firstQuint)Betamethasone to Control Postoperative Pain in Emergency Endodontic Care.

 To prevent post endodontic treatment pain, systemic administration of corticosteroids may have their effect maximized if the infiltration is performed in the oral mucosa, near the periapex of the tooth, which concentrates the inflammatory process.

 The administration of corticosteroids at this moment, taking advantage of the anesthetic effect still present, ensures continuous comfort during the postoperative period.

 The objective of this randomized double-blind clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of the systemic administration of betamethasone - through infiltration in the oral mucosa - to control pain and edemas in patients undergoing emergency endodontic treatment.
