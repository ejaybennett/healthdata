(firstQuint)Tranexamic Acid and Blood Clots in Knee Surgery.

 This study is anticipated to consist of 30 participants over 18 years of age scheduled for total knee arthroplasty at Sandoval Regional Medical Center with administered intraoperative tranexamic acid, who do not meet the exclusion criteria.

 The patients will be examined on postoperative day 1.

 Lower-extremity ultrasound will be used to screen for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

 Incidence data for DVT will then be compared with the historical incidence rate at our institution for total knee arthroplasty without the use of tranexamic acid, which is approximately 12%.

 Patients found on screening to have deep vein thrombosis will be referred for appropriate care.
