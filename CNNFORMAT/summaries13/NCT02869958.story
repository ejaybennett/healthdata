(fifthQuint)Digital Action Plan for Asthma Attacks.

 Asthma is a frequent chronic disease (10% prevalence in children and 7% in adults) during which acute exacerbations can occur that require adequate treatment, usually by the patients and/or his/her caregivers.

 Despite action plan for asthma exacerbation being recommended by national and international guidelines, urgent medical contact and often Emergency Department visits remain frequent for asthma exacerbation.

 Reasons for medical contact may be related to the inefficiency of the current Written Action Plan because of its stereotyped advice whatever the level of severity of the exacerbation, and because the patients might not have the paper with him/her where and when he/she needs it.

 The investigators sought that new electronic technologies could solve these issues of inadequacy of content and availability of the Written Action Plan.

 A program was built to provide sets of advices according to the severity of the exacerbation described by the patient using simple clinical descriptors included in the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), and weighted by the medication already used for the exacerbation.

 In this way the investigators feel that patients could be more confident in the appropriate treatment proposed by the algorithm.

 Second, the possibility to connect through portable electronic devices (Smartphone, tablet computer) make the action readily available as far as an internet connection is possible.

 The Digital Action Plan is designed to treat asthma exacerbations of all levels of severity and advice to visit a doctor within few days or to go at once to an emergency department as appropriate as by the situation based on the patients' information.

 The investigators designed a randomized study to assess the effect of the Digital Action Plan on unscheduled urgent medical contacts (phone calls, visits to physicians or to emergency departments, hospitalizations) in children and in adults with asthma.

 Methodology of the study A multicenter, controlled, randomized, open study, comparative on 2 parallel groups recruited in private practice and in hospitals within or outside the APHP consortium.

 Both arms have the Written Action Plan respecting the current recommendations; the experimental arm has in addition the possibility to connect to the AppWeb to obtain advices from the Digital Action Plan.

 The investigators hypothesized that the use of the digital action plan could reduce avoidable unscheduled visits due to mild or moderate exacerbations that could successfully be managed by the patient or his/her caregivers.

 In the long run, this kind of program could also become a tool for telemedicine Statistical analysis : about 25% of children and 20% of adults patients included will have a exacerbation within 3 months (TENOR study).

 The expected effect is of 10% (relative variation) for children and 20% (relative variation) for adults in the decrease of the main outcome, because Written Action Plan used in children is more targeted onto acute exacerbations as compared to the one used in adults that is more targeted onto asthma control.

 With this features, samples of N= 106 and N= 123 per group are necessary (80% power, bilateral alpha risk of 5% with an exact test used in children because of the statistical distribution of the binary variable).

 With an expected attrition of about 10%, a total of 240 children and 270 adults will be included.

 Number of participating centers = 43.

 Digital Action Plan for Asthma Attacks@highlight

It is recommended that patients with asthma owned a written action plan which must include the names, doses and dosing of the treatment they should take when acute respiratory symptoms occur.

 Current written action plans must be short to be readily used (1 page) and, therefore, cannot fit all acute situations.

 Moreover, they may not be available where and when required.

 The investigators sought that a digital action plan, available through Smartphone or tablet computer connected to the internet, could adequately provide suitable action plans according to the severity of the described exacerbation, and would be more easily available when useful.

 The aim of the study is to study the effect of the use of a digital action plan for asthma exacerbation, on the frequency of unscheduled medical contacts (phone calls, visits to physicians or to emergency departments, hospitalizations) in children and in adults with asthma.

 The investigators hypothesized that the use of the digital action plan could reduce avoidable unscheduled visits due to mild or moderate exacerbations that could successfully be managed by the patient or his/her caregivers.
