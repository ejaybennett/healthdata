(thirdQuint)FOLFOX6 Totally Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation Therapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer: A Single Arm Phase II Study.

 Preoperative 5FU based chemoradiotherapy is still the standard of treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer.

 About 15-20% of patients would achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant CRT, and the survival outcome was much better than that of non-pCR.

 However, distant metastasis would occur in about 30% of patients even after CRT.

 To improve the survival of rectal cancer patients, we hope to improve the pCR rate.

 In our previous FOWARC study, mFOLFOX6 with radiation had the pCR rate of 27.

5%.

 It had been reported that adding FOLFOX after neoadjuvant chemo radiation in locally advanced rectal cancer would improve pCR rate.

 Here, we are going to choose mFOLFOX6 during neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and after radiotherapy, another 4-6 cycles of mFOLFOX6 would be given before surgery.

 With more intensive neoadjuvant treatment, higher pCR rate might be observed.

 We aimed to enhance the neoadjuvant treatment, adding mFOLFOX6 during CRT and after radiotherapy, to improve the pathologic outcome and the survival outcome.
