(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Safety Study of CNTO 2476 in Participants With Visual Acuity Impairment Associated With Geographic Atrophy (GA) Secondary to Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

 This is a Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single subretinal administration of CNTO 2476 compared with the untreated control group, as well as to assess the safety and usability profile of the procedure and the device for cell therapy delivery in participants with visual acuity impairment associated with Geographic Atrophy (GA) secondary to Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

 The duration of participation in the study for each participant is approximately 3 years.

 Efficacy will be evaluated at 6 month, 12 months and every 6 month thereafter.

 Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.
