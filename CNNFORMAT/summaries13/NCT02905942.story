(firstQuint)PEG-rhG-CSF in Lymphoma Patients After Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.

 At present, there is few related research of Recombinant Human Granulocyte Colony-stimulating Factor applying to AHSCT in China.

 The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PEG-rhG-CSF in lymphoma patients after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

 Eligible patients were randomly assigned to PEG-rhG-CSF group or rhG-CSF group.

 Patients in PEG-rhG-CSF group received PEG-rhG-CSF day +1 after transplantation with a dose of 1001/2g/kg.

 Patients with the weight more than 45kg were suggested a dose of 6 mg.

 Patients in control group received rhG-CSF day +1 after transplantation with a dose of 51/2g/kg once per day until the recovery of neutrophil.
