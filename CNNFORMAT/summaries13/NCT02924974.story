(firstQuint)Spinal Morphine in Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.

 This study is a randomized controlled trial.

 It will randomize 160 patients who are scheduled for Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.

 The intervention group will receive a single spinal injection of a bupivacaine (12,5 mg)/morphine(300 mcg) mixture.

 Controlgroup will receive a subcutaneous injection of lidocaine for placebo purposes and an intravenous loading dose of morphine at the end of surgery.

 Both groups will receive general anesthesia during surgery in a standardized fashion.

 After the surgery, both groups will receive a Patient-Controlled Analgesia pump for post-operative pain control.

 Primary outcome is patient satisfaction as measured by the Quality-of-Recovery-15 questionnaire.

 This questionnaire will be taken at baseline, day 2 and 1 week after surgery.

 Secundary outcomes are morphine use per PCA, duration of hospital stay, side-effects and ease of surgery.
