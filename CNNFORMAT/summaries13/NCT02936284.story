(thirdQuint)Infant Environment Study.

 Obesity is a disorder of positive energy balance in which energy intake exceeds energy expenditure.

 The motivation to eat is a basic human need, which is present at birth.

 One factor that may lead to increased energy intake is the imbalance between the motivation to eat and the motivation to engage in other behaviors.

 The motivation to eat versus engaging in other behaviors can be operationalized as the relative reinforcing value of eating versus alternative behaviors.

 A strong motivation to eat instead of engaging in alternative behaviors has been related to increased energy intake in adults.

 The motivation to eat is cross-sectionally and prospectively related to obesity in children, adolescents, and adults, and cross-sectionally related to weight status in infants.

 Shifting the balance from high motivation to eat to increased motivation to engage in alternative behaviors can reduce energy intake, and may be protective against weight gain.

 A structured program to enhance music engagement in infants who are strongly motivated to eat can shift their choice from food to music.

 This study will expand on this preliminary research and examine long-term effects of this intervention in infants who are highly motivated to eat.

 Infant Environment Study@highlight

This study evaluates the effect of a music enhancement program to strengthen the motivation to engage in music related behaviors rather than eating in infants who are high in motivation to eat.

 Half the participants will participate in a Music Together Program, while the other half will participate in a Play Date control.

 For both groups, participants will attend 34 weekly sessions for one year, and 12 monthly sessions the next year, in 4 cohorts.
