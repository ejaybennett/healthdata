(thirdQuint)Transarterial Radioembolisation in Comparison to Transarterial Chemoembolisation in Uveal Melanoma Liver Metastasis.

 This is a randomized phase II trial to evaluate the effect of transarterial radioembolisation with yttrium-90 microspheres (SIRT) and transarterial chemoembolisation with cisplatin (DSM-TACE) in patients with liver metastases due to advanced uveal melanoma in terms of progression-free survival and multiple secondary endpoints.

 Patients in study arm A will receive transarterial radioembolisation one time only.

 Patients in study arm B will receive transarterial chemoembolisation every 4 to 6 weeks until complete tumor devascularisation is observed or disease progression or intolerable toxicity occur.

 At the time of local tumor progression patients will be offered the other treatment respectively (either SIRT or DSM-TACE) as part of the study.

Characterisation of effect of SIRT and DSM-TACE as local treatment options for liver metastases in patients with advanced uveal melanoma with respect to progression-free survival and exploratory comparison of secondary endpoints regarding application, activity, adverse effects and impact on quality of life in a randomized study design.
