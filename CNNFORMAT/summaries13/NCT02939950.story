(thirdQuint)Silicone Hydrogel Soft Contact Lens 7-Day Extended Wear Basis.

 Approximately 816 subjects (1,632 eyes) will be enrolled in this 12-month randomized, parallel, Investigator/Sponsor masked study at approximately 35 investigative sites in the US.

 At the Screening/Dispensing Visit, approximately one-half of the subjects will be randomized to receive Bausch + Lomb investigational samfilcon A soft contact lenses (Test) and approximately one-half of the subjects will be randomized to receive Bausch + Lomb PureVision contact lenses (Control).

 Both groups will wear the assigned lenses bilaterally on a 7-day extended wear basis throughout the 12 month study.

 The lenses are to be worn overnight for up to six consecutive nights per week.

 The lenses are to be removed, cleaned and disinfected on the seventh night and re-inserted the following morning.

 The lenses will be replaced with new lenses at the beginning of each month.

 Lenses will be provided at the Screening/Dispensing, 3-Month, 6-Month and 9-Month Follow-Up Visits to maintain a monthly replacement schedule.

 Subjects will also be required to complete a paper diary.
