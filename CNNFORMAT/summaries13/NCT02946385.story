(thirdQuint)Study to Assess the Immunological Long-term Persistence of Antibodies (Abs) 2 Years After GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Meningococcal ABCWY Vaccination in the V102_15 (NCT02212457) and Response to a Booster in Adolescents.

 Naive subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive MenABCWY or rMenB+OMV at Day 1.

 No randomization to treatment arm for follow-on subjects is required as vaccine groups remain the same as in the parent study V102_15 (NCT02212457).

 Response to a booster dose of MenABCWY vaccine will also be assessed in follow-on subjects who received 2 or 3 doses of MenABCWY (at 0.

2-, 0,.

6- or 0,.

2,.

6-month schedules) in the parent study, and will be compared with responses to a single dose of MenABCWY in naive subjects (subjects who are meningococcal vaccine-naive and of similar age to subjects enrolled from the parent study).

 Response to a booster dose of GSK Meningococcal B Recombinant vaccine (rMenB+OMV) will be assessed in subjects who received 2 doses of rMenB+OMV (at 0, 2-month schedule) in the parent study, and will be compared with responses to a single dose of rMenB+OMV in naive subjects.

The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of 2 (given at 0, 2 months) or 3 (given at 0, 2, 6 months) doses of the GSK MenABCWY vaccine administered to healthy adolescents in study V102_15 (NCT02212457), against a panel of randomly selected U.
