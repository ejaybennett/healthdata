(fifthQuint)A Phase II Trial to Compare Efficacy and Safety of CRT VS Neo-CRT in Patients Who Achieved CCR for Esophageal Cancer.

 1.

 Compare progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of definitive radiochemotherapy versus(VS) neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection for esophageal cancer patients who achieved clinical complete response after neoadjuvant treatment; 2.

 Compare the toxic and side effects of definitive radiochemotherapy versus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection for esophageal cancer patients who achieved clinical complete remission after neoadjuvant treatment; 3.

 Compare the relationship and consistency between pathological complete response of endoscopic biopsy specimens after neoadjuvant treatment and pathological complete response of surgical specimens in neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection group; 4.

 Assess impact of definitive radiochemotherapy versus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection on quality of life of patients.

 Clinical Complete Response After Neoadjuvant Treatment: Endoscope biopsy pathologic diagnosis indicate pathologic complete response after Neoadjuvant treatment; upper gastrointestinal/chest CT and symptom assessment indicate clinical complete response after Neoadjuvant treatment (Concurrent Radiochemotherapy: Radiotherapy, Intensity Modulation Radiation Therapy(IMRT), 40Gy; Chemotherapy, Docetaxel (25mg/m2)+Cisplatin (25mg/m2), 1st/8th/15th/22nd day.

 A Phase II Trial to Compare Efficacy and Safety of CRT VS Neo-CRT in Patients Who Achieved CCR for Esophageal Cancer@highlight

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy(Neo-CRT) plus surgery has been regarded as a standard of care for patients with resectable locally advanced oesophageal cancer.

 Many studies suggest that definitive Radiochemotherapy(CRT) has similar efficacy as neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery for esophageal cancers who respond to chemoradiation.

 Herein, a single center prospective randomized phase II clinical trial will be carried out to compare efficacy and safety of definitive radiochemotherapy versus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection in patients who achieved clinical complete response(CCR) after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy for stage II-III esophageal Cancer.
