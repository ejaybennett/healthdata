(thirdQuint)Crossover Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of UX007 in the Treatment of Movement Disorders Associated With Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome (Glut1 DS).

 UX007G-CL301 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to assess the efficacy and safety of UX007 in Glut1 DS.

 The study will enroll approximately 40 pediatric, adolescent, and adult subjects who are not on KD and are having disabling paroxysmal movement disorders.

 A movement disorder event is defined in this study as a period of time when the subject experiences one or more movement disorder symptoms, including symptoms that are experienced during a movement disorder event alone or significant worsening of continuous movement disorders.

 In this study, movement disorder events are defined as disabling if they affect or limit a subject's activities of daily living.

 During the 6-week Run-in Period, subjects will record disabling paroxysmal movement disorder events in a daily electronic Glut1 DS symptom diary; if the minimum criterion for number of events is not met or subjects complete <80% of the daily electronic Glut1 DS symptom diary, the subject will be considered a screen failure and will not be randomized.

 Individuals may be allowed to rescreen, at the discretion of the Principal Investigator, subject to approval by the Medical Monitor.

 At the end of the Run-in Period, eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to one of two treatment sequences (UX007/placebo or placebo/UX007).

 At Randomization, subjects will begin a 10-week double-blind Treatment Period 1.

 Treatment Period 1 will consist of a 2-week titration period and an 8-week Maintenance Period.

 At the end of Treatment Period 1, subjects will discontinue treatment and begin a 2-week washout period to minimize any potential carryover effect.

 Subjects will crossover to the second randomized, double-blind treatment assignment (placebo to UX007, UX007 to placebo) for an additional 10 weeks during Treatment Period 2.

 Treatment Period 2 will consist of a 2-week titration period and an 8-week Maintenance Period.

 At the end of the blinded crossover period (Week 22), all active subjects will have the option of rolling into the open-label Extension Period, to continue UX007 treatment for up to 3 years or until one of the following occurs: the subject withdraws consent, the subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator, the study is terminated, or until commercial availability of the study drug in a subject's region, whichever occurs first.

 Long-term safety and maintenance of effect of UX007 will be assessed during the open-label Extension Period.

 A Safety Follow-up Phone Call will be conducted 30-35 days after the last dose of UX007G-CL301 study drug.
