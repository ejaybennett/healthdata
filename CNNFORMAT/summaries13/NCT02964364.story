(fifthQuint)China Takayasu Arteritis Registry (CTA Registry).

 Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic vasculitis that causes inflammation of the aorta and its main branches and is characterized by adventitial thickening and cellular infiltration of the tunica media, with local destruction of vascular smooth muscle cells and elastin.

 The disease is very rare but most commonly occurs in China.

 In the last decade, the results of our study indicated that HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 gene alleles were associated with TA in Chinese Han population.

 And the clinical features of patients with TA were analyzed.

 The cytokines such as hs-CRP, NT-proBNP and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) can be used to monitor TA activity.

 But there are still many unknown fields in TA, such as the epidemiology and pathophysiology.

 This study is to build a Chinese national registry system for TA to obtain real-world information, such as current status of characteristics, diagnosis, disease activity, the severity of disease, treatment and outcomes of Chinese TA patients.

 To analysis and development of effective treatment strategies.

 China Takayasu Arteritis Registry (CTA Registry)@highlight

Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic large-vessel vasculitis that mainly affects the aorta and its major branches.

 The epidemiology and pathophysiology of TA is still unclear in China, although many studies have been done.

 Our previous study supporting by National Natural Science Foundation of China indicated the cytokines such as hs-CRP, NT-proBNP and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) can be used to monitor TA activity, and HLA gene alleles were associated with TA in Chinese han population.

 Further investigations with larger samples are needed to fully understand the a pathophysiology of TA.

 The purpose of this study is to build a Chinese national registry system for TA to obtain real-world information, such as current status of characteristics, diagnosis, disease activity, the severity of disease, treatment and outcomes of Chinese TA patients.

 To analysis and development of effective disease monitoring and treatment strategies.
