(thirdQuint)Dimethyl Fumarate (DMF) in Systemic Sclerosis-Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.

 A double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in 34 Systemic Sclerosis-Pulmonary Hypertension (SSc-PAH) patients.

 The study medication will be added to stable background PAH medication(s).

 Subjects will be dosed for 24 weeks, will undergo examination every 8 weeks, and will be finally evaluated 12 weeks after completion of treatment.

 Dosage will be twice daily oral doses of 120mg for the first 7 days followed by the maintenance dose of 240mg twice a day.

Participation will be for a total of 40 weeks, including a 4-week screening period, 24 weeks of drug, and a safety follow-up 12 weeks after the last dose.

 The study will determine the safety and the primary outcome variability for DMF in treating SSc-PAH; the primary outcome of clinical efficacy in this pilot trial will be improvement in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD).
