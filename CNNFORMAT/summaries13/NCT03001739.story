(fifthQuint)Intensive Blood PRessure Control in Patients With Acute Type B AortIc Dissection.

 Aortic dissection (AD) aneurysm is a common catastrophic aortic disease in clinical setting.

 In the U.

S.

, the prevalence is approximate 2.

9-3.

5 cases/100000 persons per year, with recent evidence showing an increasing incidence of up to 14 cases per 100000 patients per year.

 AD aneurysm can be classified into the types of Stanford A and B based on whether the ascending aorta was being involved.

 For acute type B aortic dissection (ABAD), which is generally accounted for one thirds of all aortic dissection and is especially more common among Chinese due to the suboptimal control of blood pressure.

 Optimal treatment of ABAD from symptom onset remains uncertain.

 Conservative therapy of heart rate and blood pressure control in the acute phase is the essential treatment for patient without serious complications such as concurrent mesenteric artery or lower limb arterial embolism.

 The long-term survival of ABAD is still low though great improved in medication optimization and surgical repair technique in the past decades.

 It was reported that 5-year and 10-year survival rates for ABAD were 60% and 35% respectively.

 As the development of minimally invasive techniques in recent years, the endovascular repair procedure has become a routine procedure in the treatment of patient with ABAD, this rendered an improved prognosis with a 5-year survival rate close to 80%.

 Hypertension is well known as the most common cause for AD.

 The statistics from International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) demonstrated that 72.

1% of AD patients had a history of hypertension.

 The hypertension may aggravate hematoma expansion and results in serious consequences.

 Therefore, effectively blood pressure control may alleviate the severe pain caused by acute AD and lessen the progression of arterial dissection.

 The control of hypertension is the primary treatment for acute aortic dissection, and should be maintained throughout the entire treatment.

 Currently, all guidelines recommended to decline the transaortic pressure via controlling the heart rate and blood pressure for AD patient in acute phase.

 Theoretically, to control the blood pressure to the minimal level meeting the sufficient end-organ perfusion can decrease the risk of vessel rupture as much as possible.

 Whereas, too much low blood pressure target may increase the mortality of patients.

 Powell and his colleague found when the minimum blood pressure increased by 10mmHg (vs.

 = 0.

05.

 Considering a dropout rate of 10%, it is proposed to include 360 cases totally into the study.

 A formal interim analysis was conducted halfway during study enrollment.

 The overall type I error was controlled using an O'Brien-Fleming spending function, with a final significance level of 0.

05 for the primary end point.

 Statistical analysis Descriptive data were reported as either mean SD, median (interquartile range) or number and percentage.

 With respect to the differences between two groups, categorical variables were compared using chi-square analysis.

 Continuous variables were compared using Independent Sample T test for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data.

 For survival analyses, Kaplan-Meier estimates were generated to assess differences between groups using the log-rank test, and expressed the data as cumulative mortality curves.

 Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 16.

0 (Chicago, Ill, USA) and PASS 11.

0.

 Statistical significance was defined as a P value 140 mm Hg.

 Hence, most guidelines recommended a reasonable initial target for systolic blood pressure is between 100 and 120 mm Hg.

 However, this target is based on the hypothesis that all the end-organs blood supply is not compromised.

 Data from International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) has shown that approximately one quarter of patients presenting with acute type B aortic dissection are followed into complicated category, including malperfusion of spinal arteries leading to paresis, and paraplegia or malperfusion of visceral arteries leading to abdominal pain.

 Thus, how to balance the decrease of blood pressure to the lowest amount and maintain adequate end-organ perfusion is a challenge.

 Given vast majority patients with type B aortic dissection had a history of hypertension, a too lower target of blood pressure may comprise the cerebral perfusion or complicated organ perfusion, which consequently caused stroke or other morbidity such as ischemic intestinal necrosis.

 On the other hand, a much strict blood pressure target and sometimes constrain on the patients daily activities may aggravate patients' worry, which inversely increased increase the blood pressure.

 Unfortunately, there is no empirical data or trials to guide the optimal blood pressure target setting for various patients.

 Hence, the study was designed to bridge the gap.

 In conclusion, the investigators believe that the study will provide new insight into the of blood pressure management of patients of acute Type B aortic dissection and subsequently improve the outcomes.

 Intensive Blood PRessure Control in Patients With Acute Type B AortIc Dissection@highlight

Aortic dissection (AD) aneurysm is a common catastrophic aortic disease in clinical setting.

 Conservative therapy of heart rate and blood pressure control in the acute phase is the essential treatment as guidelines recommended.

 Nevertheless, there is no unanimous optimal target for blood pressure in patients with AD so far.

 The American Heart Association and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommend the blood pressure should be controlled to lower than 140/90mmHg, while for patients with diabetes or chronic renal failure, the blood pressure target should be no less than 130/80 mmHg.

 Recently, the Japanese Circulation Society recommended that the blood pressure should be controlled to no less than 130mmHg.

 However, there was few large-scale, randomized, controlled studies reported on the effect of different blood pressure control levels on the prognosis of patients with AD.

 Hence, the intensive control of blood pressure to <120 mmHg, compared to <140 mmHg, may improve the patients' outcome.

 Thus, in this study, the effect of intensive blood pressure control (<120mmHg) with conventional blood pressure control (<140mmHg) on the prognosis of ABAD patients will be compared, and to identify the therapeutic efficacy of intensive blood pressure control on the ABAD patients.
