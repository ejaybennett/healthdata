(secondQuint)Transcatheter Aortic Prosthesis Function: A Long-term Follow-up Study.

 There is limited available information on long term TAVR valve function.

 In this observational study, the investigators will enroll subjects who underwent TAVR or SAVR more than 3 years ago.

 Clinical and procedural data from the implant/surgery will be collected, alongside clinical and echocardiographic data from subsequent follow-up visits.

 Up-to-date echocardiography will be performed and analyzed in a Core Lab to assess valve function yearly.
