(firstQuint)Telephone Counseling to Enhance the Quality and Safety of Romantic and Sexual Relationships in People Living and Aging With HIV.

 Estimated rates of condomless anal and vaginal intercourse among HIV-positive older adults remain high.

 Brief motivational interventions delivered face-to-face have demonstrated efficacy at reducing condomless sex in HIV-positive persons.

 However, these interventions are not contextualized to the unique sexual health needs of HIV-positive older adults.

 Further, many HIV-positive older adults have difficulty accessing face-to-face services due to transportation, stigma, and other barriers.

 Telehealth interventions represent one delivery approach that overcomes such barriers.
