(secondQuint)A Phase II Study of Weekly Genexol-PM in Patients With Hepatocelluar Carcinoma After Failure of Sorafenib.

 Hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) is a highly vascular neoplasm characterized by arterial enhancement on CT or MRI.

 Angiogenesis provides a target for novel prognostic and therapeutic approaches to HCC.

 Sorafenib is the standard 1st-line therapy shown to significantly improve overall survival in advanced HCC.

 However, sorafenib benefits are mostly transient and modest.

 In addition, sorafenib is associated with major toxicities, and about 30% of patients stop it because of intolerance.

 Effective therapies are needed for patients who experience progression during or after receiving sorafenib or who have sorafenib intolerance.

 Paclitaxel has an antiagiogenic activity and weekly administration of paclitaxel is considered to have enhanced efficacy over 3-weekly administration due to greater drug exposure or a direct antiangiogenic effect.

 A previous phase I study showed that weekly paclitaxel has activity in hepatocellular carcinoma and further investigation in phase II trials is warranted.

 Genexol-PM, a cremophor-free, polymeric micelle-formulated paclitaxel, is believed to be superior to conventional paclitaxel in terms of the obviation of premedication and the delivery of higher paclitaxel doses without additional toxicity.

 A Phase II Study of Weekly Genexol-PM in Patients With Hepatocelluar Carcinoma After Failure of Sorafenib@highlight

This study evaluate activity and safety profile of weekly Genexol-PM in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma for whom sorafenib treatment failed.

 Patients will receive Genexol-PM on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks.
