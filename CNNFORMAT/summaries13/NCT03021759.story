(secondQuint)Pragmatic, Randomized Evaluation of Statin Active Choice to Reach Improved Outcomes Based on Evidence.

 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.

 Strong evidence indicates that statin medications can reduce the risk of CVD and for those with CVD statins have been shown to reduce mortality.

 Despite this evidence, statins are under-prescribed.

 In this study, the investigators will test the effectiveness of nudges targeted to physicians using active choice and social comparisons feedback to increasing the rate at which statin medications are prescribed to patients eligible based on national practice guidelines.

In this study, the investigators will conduct a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, controlled trial to evaluate an active choice intervention with and without social comparison feedback to increase physician statin prescribing rates for eligible patients.
