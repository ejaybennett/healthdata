(secondQuint)Trial of Sirolimus for Cognitive Impairment in Sturge-Weber Syndrome.

 Sirolimus will be administered as an adjunct to all current medications.

 The impact of sirolimus upon cognitive functioning in Sturge-Weber syndrome is the primary outcome measure.

 This outcome will be assessed using a panel of testing selected based upon extensive experience in testing cognitive function in adults and children with SWS at the Kennedy Krieger Sturge-Weber Center.

 Changes in a quantitative EEG before and after the trial, Sturge-Weber syndrome clinical neuroscore, port-wine birthmark score, and the impact of sirolimus upon seizures will be assessed.
