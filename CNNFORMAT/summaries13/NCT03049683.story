(thirdQuint)Simultaneous Recordings of Cervical and Ocular Vestibular-evoked Myogenic Potentials.

 The combined evaluation of ocular and cervical VEMPs permits the assessment of both endorgans and whole vestibular nerve function, as well as the ascending and descending vestibular pathways in the brainstem at once.

 In about 30 healthy participants and 20 patients with acute unilateral vestibular neuritis, unilateral simultaneous cVEMP and oVEMP recordings in each side during monaural stimulation (air-conducted sound, 500Hz tone bursts, 100 nHL), and bilateral simultaneous recordings of each VEMP while binaural stimulation were compared to the conventional method of sequential recording each VEMPs on each side at a time.

 Simultaneous Recordings of Cervical and Ocular Vestibular-evoked Myogenic Potentials@highlight

To lower the threshold for clinical application by reducing the testing time for recording vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs), we evaluated whether a simultaneous recording of ocular and cervical VEMPs after unilateral or bilateral stimulation can be achieved without a loss in diagnostic sensitivity.
