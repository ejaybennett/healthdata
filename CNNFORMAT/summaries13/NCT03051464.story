(thirdQuint)No Surgery Trial / Two Dose-escalation Strategies.

 It is becoming clear that there is a now an international consensus that rectal cancer research efforts need to be more focused in optimizing a non-surgical approach.

 This concept is very relevant to an ageing patient population with multiple co-morbidities regularly seen at the Jewish General Hospital and across the province.

 We are therefore proposing a pilot study of 40 patients to compare the two best known radiation dose escalation strategies and to achieve a complete clinical response.

 Patients with a clinical T2-3 N0-1 rectal cancer will be randomized to two arms (arm A: standard chemoradiation (45 Gy in 25 with concomitant 5-FU or Xeloda chemotherapy) and an external beam boost of 9 Gy compared to arm B: standard chemoradiation (45 Gy in 25 with concomitant 5-FU or Xeloda chemotherapy) and followed by a brachytherapy boost of 30 Gy in 3 fractions).

 Patients that have a high risk of recurrence or with more advanced stages of the disease will be excluded from the study, as only the local disease is being treated.

 The primary outcome for this proposal is rectum preservation in treated patients.
