(fifthQuint)A Mobile Phone Game to Prevent HIV Among Young Africans.

 This project will test the feasibility of an electronic game for preadolescents, delivered via inexpensive Android smart phones.

 The game is informed by socio-behavioral and pedagogical theories, evidence-based practice, and formative research on youth sexual culture in sub-Saharan Africa.

 It is designed to: educate young players, ages 11-14, about sexual health and HIV/AIDS; build risk-reduction skills and related self-efficacy for prevention of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unintended pregnancy; challenge harmful gender norms and HIV stigma; and foster dialogue with parents and caregivers.

 The proposed feasibility test will be conducted in Western Kenya.

 Sixty preadolescents will be enrolled in the trial, 30 in the study arm and 30 in the control arm.

 In addition, 30 parents (one for each preadolescent in the study arm) will be enrolled to provide feedback on their experience of the study via focus group discussions.

 The Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) has established community advisory boards (CABs) in Kisumu, which will be available to the proposed study.

 Data collection will take place at KEMRI offices, health clinics, or in the meeting room of a local community-based organization (CBO).

 In addition, data on game-play will be automatically collected on mobile phones given to preadolescent study participants.
