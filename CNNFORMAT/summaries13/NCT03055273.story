This research is being done to find out the best ways to help people with end stage kidney disease take care of their daily lives and improve their social functioning.

 Investigators want to learn whether services in the Community Aging in Place, Advancing Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE) study such as help with medications, muscle strengthening, balance training, pain management, changes to houses and improved social support can be tailored to fit the needs of older adults with kidney disease to help improve their ability to balance, walk, and take care of themselves.

 People aged 60 years and older who have end stage kidney disease and have been receiving dialyses for at least 6 months, may join.
