(thirdQuint)EXhaled Hydrogen Peroxide As a Marker of Lung diseasE (EXHALE) Pilot Study.

.

 Hydrogen Peroxide levels in Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC) is a direct biomarker of oxidative stress from the airway epithelium.

 Levels have been shown to be raised in asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) both in stable and exacerbating states.

 Previously it has been difficult to measure this volatile compound away from a laboratory based setting.

 However a new device has been developed to measure Hydrogen peroxide levels in exhaled breath by the patients side.

 This Pilot study will test this new device in a clinical setting.

 It will assess whether the device can monitor levels consistently and reliably and whether it can distinguish disease from healthy individuals.

@highlight

This Pilot study evaluates the use of a new device called Inflammacheck and whether it can consistently measure hydrogen peroxide levels in exhaled breath condensate.

 It will also assess whether exhaled breath condensate hydrogen peroxide levels as measured by Inflammacheck can differentiate people with asthma and COPD from healthy individuals.
