.

 At screening, patient will have taken blood samples and performed hepatic vein pressure gradient.

 After randomization, patient will be seen at follow up every 3 months to do blood sample and every 12 months to undergo hepatic vein pressure gradient , according to the guidelines.

 In addition, metabolomics analysis will be performed at screening and every 3 months.

 The results will be analyzed in relation to emergence of decompensation during follow up period, in order to identify specific metabolomics characteristics that may be able to predict decompensation.

This is a single-center and prospective study to identify specific biomarker in order to predict development of decompensation in cirrhotic patients.

 The duration of the study is 36 months and it provides a cohort of 200 patients.
