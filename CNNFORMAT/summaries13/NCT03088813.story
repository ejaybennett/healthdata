(thirdQuint)Study of Irinotecan Liposome Injection (ONIVYDE) in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 The study will be conducted in two parts: Part 1: Open-label dose finding study of irinotecan liposome injection.

 Approximately 24-36 patients will be enrolled.

 Part 1 Primary Objectives: - Describe the safety and tolerability of irinotecan liposome injection monotherapy administered every 2 weeks - Determine the irinotecan liposome injection monotherapy dose (85 mg/m2 or 70 mg/m2 administered every 2 weeks) for Part 2 of this study Part 2: A randomized, efficacy study of irinotecan liposome injection versus IV topotecan.

 Approximately 450 patients will be enrolled in part 2.

 Part 2 objectives: Detailed in the Primary & Secondary outcome measure sections.
