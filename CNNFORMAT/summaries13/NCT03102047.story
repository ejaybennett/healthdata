(fifthQuint)Study of Durvalumab (MEDI4736) After Chemo-Radiation for Microsatellite Stable Stage II-IV Rectal Cancer.

 The FR-2 study is designed as a phase II, open label, single arm study in patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) stages II-IV rectal cancer, to assess the activity of PD-L1 inhibition with durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy after standard chemo-radiotherapy (chemoRT).

 The study's primary aim is to determine the safety and efficacy of durvalumab immediately following chemoRT in patients undergoing subsequent surgery with stage II-IV rectal cancer.

 One dose of durvalumab will be given every 2 weeks for four total doses beginning within 3-7 days of completing chemoRT.

 Surgery for all patients must occur within 8-12 weeks of the final dose of RT.

 Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical recovery is at the discretion of the treating physician.

 During a safety run-in, the first 6 patients will be closely followed for 30 days after last dose of durvalumab without further accrual of patients.

 Patients will receive durvalumab (750mg IV infusion once every 2 weeks) for 4 total doses.

 No other concurrent anti-neoplastic medications or treatments aside from standard supportive care will be allowed during the durvalumab treatment phase.

 The safety run-in portion of the study will proceed to full enrollment at the proposed study therapy dose, (750 mg IV infusion every 2 weeks), if one or less dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or significant safety concern attributable to durvalumab is identified during the observation period of the first 6 patients.

 If there are two or more DLTs, accrual to the study will stop with reassessment of the protocol.

 A total of 47 patients will be enrolled in this study for a sample size of 41 surgically evaluable patients.

 Required tissue and blood samples will be collected at specific time points and submitted for correlative science studies.

 Optional tumor and blood samples will be collected from consenting patients upon disease recurrence or progression.

 Study of Durvalumab (MEDI4736) After Chemo-Radiation for Microsatellite Stable Stage II-IV Rectal Cancer@highlight

This study is being done to look at the safety and response to the investigational drug durvalumab (MEDI4736) following chemo-radiation therapy for patients with MSS stage II to IV rectal cancer.

 Durvalumab recognizes specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells and triggers the immune system to destroy the cancer cells.

 The chemoRT portion of the treatment will be completed just before the course of durvalumab is initiated.

 In order to learn more about certain characteristics of rectal cancer tumors, this study includes special research tests using samples from diagnostic tumors, a tissue sample from tumors removed during surgery, fresh tumor samples from an area where the cancer has recurred, and blood samples.
