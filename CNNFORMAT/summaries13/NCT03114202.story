 Considering that head and neck cancer patients usually present reduced food intake with consequent involuntary weight loss and significant worsening of quality of life, this study investigates the effects of nutritional counseling versus standard nutritional care on nutritional status and quality of life in patients with head and neck cancer submitted to radiotherapy.

 Half participants (45) will receive intensive nutritional counseling, that is, once they are admitted to the study and once a week during radiotherapy, following the protocol of nutritional care to cancer patients in radiotherapy proposed by the American Dietetic Association (ADA).

 The other half (45) will receive standard care, that is, nutritional counseling / education performed by hospital nurses and nutritional care performed by the hospital nutritionist (when there is a demand, usually 1 to 2 times during oncologic treatment).
