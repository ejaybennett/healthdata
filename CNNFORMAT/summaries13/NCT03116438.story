(thirdQuint)CADence Performance as a Rule-Out Modality in Long Beach Veterans Administration Heart Catheterization Lab Patients.

 The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the CADence device by comparing it to the results obtained from standard coronary angiography.

 The CADence device collects acoustic (sound) data from locations on the chest for the purpose of identifying coronary artery turbulence, which may be indicative of coronary artery disease (CAD).

 The CADence3 is an electronic auscultatory device, intended to provide support to the physician in the evaluation of patients' heart sounds.

 Turbulence within the coronary arteries produces a distinct audio signal that can be identified using a proprietary algorithm built into the device.

 The CADence System is indicated for patients that have chest pains in addition to at least two other coronary artery disease risk factors such as obesity and hypertension.

 The device intends to be an alternative screening tool to nuclear stress testing for detecting coronary artery blockages.

 CADence acquires and records the acoustic signals of the heart and analyzes these signals.
