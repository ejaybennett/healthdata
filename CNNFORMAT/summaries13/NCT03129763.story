(firstQuint)Perfusion Assessment With Indocyanine Green-SPY Angiography After Tissue Expander Filling.

 This is a randomized controlled trial that designed to optimize the tissue expander expanding method.

 All the patients were randomly divided into five groups, patients in different groups received an expansion weekly with different capsule pressure of 60mmHg, 70mmHg, 80mmHg, 90mmHg and 100mmHg respectively.

 Each patient received an expanding once a week, and a hemodynamic assessment of SPY-ICG angiography every two weeks.

 The total follow-up for each patient is 8 weeks.
