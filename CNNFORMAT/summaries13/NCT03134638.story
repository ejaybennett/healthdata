(fifthQuint)A Phase 1 Study of SY-1365 in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 This study will consist of two parts.

 Part 1 is a dose-escalation/safety evaluation to identify a dose and regimen for further evaluation in Part 2.

 SY-1365 will be administered intravenously weekly & twice weekly for 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle.

 Dose escalation will proceed until the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or a recommended dose and regimen for evaluation in Part 2 of the study.

 Approximately 35 patients may be enrolled into Part 1, with the ultimate number based on the safety (DLTs).

 Following the identification of a recommended dose and regimen from Part 1, the study will enter Part 2 to further evaluate safety and the antitumor activity of SY-1365 in patients with select solid tumors, and to confirm target engagement and downstream pathway impact in patients with any solid tumor histology.

 Preliminary anti-tumor activity will be evaluated in approximately 82 patients in 5 cohorts of Part 2, with SY-1365 administered alone, in combination with carboplatin, or in combination with fulvestrant.

 Part 2 will consist of five cohorts: - Cohort 1: approximately 24 patients with advanced ovarian cancer with 3+ previous lines of treatment.

 Monotherapy - Cohort 2: approximately 24 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer with previous platinum therapy.

 SY-1365 + Carboplatin - Cohort 3: approximately 12 patients with primary platinum refractory ovarian cancer.

 Monotherapy - Cohort 4: approximately 10 patients with biopsy-accessible, advanced solid tumors of any histology.

 Monotherapy.

 - Cohort 5: approximately 12 patients with HR+ metastatic breast cancer post CDK4/6 + aromatase inhibitor treatment.

 SY-1365 + fulvestrant.

 Overall, the study may enroll approximately 117 patients across dose escalation (Part 1) and expansion cohorts (Part 2, Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).

 A Phase 1 Study of SY-1365 in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors@highlight

This study will consist of two parts.

 Part 1 is a dose-escalation/safety evaluation to provisionally identify a dose and regimen of SY-1365 for further evaluation in Part 2.

 Approximately 35 patients with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled into Part 1 of the study.

 Following the identification of a recommended dose and regimen from Part 1, the study will enter Part 2 to further evaluate safety and the antitumor activity of SY-1365 in patients with select solid tumors, and to confirm target engagement and downstream pathway impact in patients with any solid tumor histology.
