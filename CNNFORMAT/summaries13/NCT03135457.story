(fifthQuint)TACO Crossover TRIAL.

 Coronary arterial bypass grafting surgery patients with reduced left ventricular function will be allocated to either infusion of 300mL saline with a subsequent autologous RBC (cell saver) transfusion of 300 mL at a rate of 10mL/min, or the same in the reversed order.

 Prior to start of the intervention, 15 minutes following start of infusion and a the end of infusion, the investigators will measure right-ventricular pressure and wedge pressure (PCWP), as well as extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) and CO estimation through PICCO(R) and Pulmonary Artery Catheter.

 The investigators will identify fluid responsiveness by performing a passive leg raise test (PLR).

 The investigators aim to measure total vessel density (TVD), perfused vessel density (PVD), proportion of perfused vessels (PPV), microvascular flow index (MFI), and blood vessel diameters (Obv) from the oral microcirculation by CytoCam microscope system.

 The investigators will estimate the effective circulating blood and plasma volume through dilutional infusion of indocyanine green prior to initial infusion, between and at the end of subsequent infusion.

 TACO Crossover TRIAL@highlight

This is an open-label, prospective crossover randomized controlled trial to investigate wether TACO is solely hydrostatic pressure overload or arises from a combination of hydrostatic pressure overload and capillary leakage, by investigating the difference in change in static pressure parameters (PCWP), dynamic volume parameters (PICCO) as indirect measurements of volume status and capillary leakage after autologous transfusion or saline infusion.

 The investigators will estimate effective circulating volume following autologous transfusion or saline infusion.

 Furthermore, the investigators will investigate the effect of fluid loading on the microcirculation.
