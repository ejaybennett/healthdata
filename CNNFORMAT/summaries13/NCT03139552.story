(thirdQuint)Influence on Food Liking of Adding Spices to Replace Sugar Using CLT.

 The investigators will compare the overall consumer acceptability of each of three test items (tea, oatmeal and apple crisp) across the three test conditions using central location test (CLT) and cross-over design.

 The three test conditions for each test item will be (1) Full sugar ("FS"), (2) reduced sugar (and calorie) with no added spice ("RS") and (3) reduced sugar (and calorie) plus spice ("RSS").

 The two reduced sugar items will be matched for calories.

 Subjects will be provided the test items using sequential monadic CLT methodology (Central Location Test methodology which involves product evaluation after a brief exposure (one sample-subject contact) under standardized conditions whereby subjects are given each of the 3 recipes of each test item (e.

g.

, oatmeal with full sugar, oatmeal with reduced sugar, oatmeal with reduced plus spice) back to back (all within one sitting) in a random order.

 The investigators are interested in using the sequential monadic CLT methodology and having subjects taste all 3 recipes of each item in one sitting which is a commonly used test modality for sensory studies.

 Influence on Food Liking of Adding Spices to Replace Sugar Using CLT@highlight

This study aims to reduce the amount of sugar in a particular food item and add spices to see if the food liking of that item rates as high or higher in a post meal survey.

 Through taste testing of the menu items (using sequential monadic CLT methodology) the investigators will determine an opinion of the participants.

 Results of these surveys will determine whether participants enjoy the reduced sugar options as much as their full sugar counterparts.
