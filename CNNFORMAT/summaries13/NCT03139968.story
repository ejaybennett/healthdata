(secondQuint)Reduction of Catheterization Radiation Exposure Pad.

 A total of 750 consecutive diagnostic angiograms and percutaneous coronary interventions were randomly assigned to the radiation-attenuating (RADPAD(R)), a dummy drape or a control group in a 1:1:1 ratio.

 The drapes will be used in addition to conventional shielding material.

 Primary radiation exposure is measured blindly by a dose aware meter (Philips) positioned at a set location on the operator.

 Radiation exposure is measured by the X-ray systems (DAP in Gycm2).

 The primary outcome is the effective dose received by the first operator (mSv/Gycm2).

The RECAP-trial is a randomized controlled, double blinded, superiority trial studying the efficacy of the RADPAD(R), a protective drape, that potentially reduces the scattered radiation received by the operator during diagnostic angiograms and percutaneous coronary interventions.
