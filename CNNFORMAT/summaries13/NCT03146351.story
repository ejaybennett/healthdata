(fifthQuint)The Effects of Family Centered Intervention Program on Preterm Infants.

 Fifty-two preterm infants corrected age less than 6 months included in this study.

 They were separated by their birth weeks.

 Babies with gestational ages between 34-36 weeks and 6 days (including the given days) are categorized as late preterm, while those born before 34 weeks are grouped as moderate and early preterm.

 Each group contains 26 infants.

 First, sociodemographic information and histories of babies are obtaining.

 Ages and contact information of the parents are recording.

 Prenatal and natal risk factors of the mothers are querying.

 Gestational ages and height, weight, and head circumferences of babies at birth are recording.

 Number of pregnancies, live births and abortions, type of delivery, multiple pregnancies for mothers as well as consanguinity between parents are asking.

The Alberta Infant Motor Scale is using to evaluate spontaneous motor movements of the baby.

 After the detailed examination, intervention program set up for infants.

 Both groups receive 3 months family based intervention program.

 After the intervention program, both groups re-examined.

 The Effects of Family Centered Intervention Program on Preterm Infants@highlight

Infant born preterm have an increased risk of adverse long-term developmental outcomes.

The risk associated with preterm birth increase as gestational age decreases, and vulnerability remains in moderate and early preterm (34 weeks).

 There are many studies in the literature showed that the prevalence of developmental delay increases with premature birth.

 However, there is no study in the literature investigates effect of early intervention program motor performance in subgroups of preterm infants.

 Hence the aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in effects of early intervention program on motor development in early and moderate (<34 weeks) and late preterm infants.
