 Up to 20 patients will be treated at each dose in Part I of the study.

 In Part II of the study, one of the treatment dose levels will be selected for further evaluation.

 The dose selection will be based on clinical and laboratory assessments of patients recruited in Part I.

 Patients will only participate in either Part I or II.

 A total of 64 patients will be treated in Part I and Part II combined.

 Eligible consenting patients will receive NUC-1031 by IV infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle.
