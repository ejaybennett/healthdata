 Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases around the world, with a high prevalence of anxiety disorders.

 Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been shown to increase psychological well-being for anxiety-related asthma.

 Ten participants will be included in a single-subject multiple baseline design.

 They will all receive 10-12 sessions of CBT.
