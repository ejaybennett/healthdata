(fifthQuint)The Analgesic Efficacy of Ultrasound Guided Transversus Abdominal Plane Block After Abdominal Cancer Surgeries.

 Adult patients of both sexes undergoing major lower abdominal cancer surgeries were enrolled in the study.

 After obtaining written informed consent from all the patients, they were randomly allotted to either Study (TAP) Group or Control group.

 Standard general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation was performed in all the patients.

 Preoperatively all patients received information about Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for Pain Score from 1 to 10 depending on intensity of pain and about the use of Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) Pump.

 After the end of surgery and before extubation bilateral Ultrasound guided Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block was performed with 16 G Tuohy needle and 18 G Braun Perifix epidural catheter was placed about 6-8 cms in situ.

 Bupivacaine 0.

25 % 20 ml was given bilaterally and repeated 8 hourly in the Postoperative Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU) for first 24 hours.

 The PCA Pump was set to deliver bolus Intravenous Morphine 1 milligram ( mg ) with lock out interval 10 minutes.

 In the PACU heart rate, Non invasive blood pressure, Visual Analogue Score at rest and on knee flexion, Sedation score, nausea and vomiting, any side effects as itching was noted by care provider at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours.

 Total and good PCA demands upto 24 hours was recorded.

Effective postoperative pain control results in decreased cardiac and pulmonary complications, patient satisfaction and early mobilization.

 A prospective, randomized comparative study was done of analgesic efficacy, opioid requirement and side effects in patients undergoing lower abdominal cancer surgeries.

 In Study Group Ultrasound guided Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block was given and control Group no TAP block was given.

 Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with intravenous morphine was given to both group patients, and total good PCA demands in both the groups was studied.
