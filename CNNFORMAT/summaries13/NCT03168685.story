(secondQuint)Hemophilia Mobile App Usability Pilot.

 HITLAB will conduct a segmented rapid user acceptance study ("rapid UX study") of a smart phone app and an actigraphy device with a connected scale.

 During the first segment, of one month's duration, subjects will use the app, actigraphy device, and scale.

 Next, over an interphase period of up to 6 weeks, subjects will only use the app.

 During this time, the app will be modified based on data collected during the first segment.

 Finally, during the second period, also of one month's duration, subjects will use the modified app, actigraphy device, and scale.
