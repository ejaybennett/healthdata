(fifthQuint)Communitas: A Program for Teens Living With Chronic Illness and Their Families.

 The Communitas pilot study is a survey study of Communitas, a pre-existing integrative medicine and mind-body skills group visit for adolescents living with chronic illness and their parents.

 The goal of this study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and feasibility for these group visits.

 Approximately 50-100 patients and 50-100 parent enrollees of the Communitas group visits will be recruited to participate in this survey study optionally.

 During the group visits, both the patient and parent groups will learn about and experience various coping, self-care, pain and stress-reduction modalities, participate in group sharing to promote engagement with a diagnosis and provide emotional support, and benefit from facilitated discussions about some of the more practical aspects of living with chronic illness.

 The group visits will be offered to patients and their parents as clinical service, regardless of enrollment in the survey study, and will be billed to insurance as consult group visit with the pediatrician.

 The group visits will be held at both the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine and Mission Bay Children's Hospital and will be led by a pediatrician, starting in October 2016.

 The study will be set up as a pre-post evaluation, without a control group, using patient-report and parent-report qualitative and quantitative assessments at baseline, after completion of the series of group visits, and 3 months later.

 In addition, some families may be asked if they would like to participate in a videotaped interview before and after the start of the program.

The proposed pilot study is an evaluation of Communitas, a mind-body skills group visit and for 12-19 year-olds living with chronic physical illness.

 The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy and feasibility of these group visits.

 During 2017-2018, the investigators will recruit 50-100 patient and 50-100 parent enrollees of Communitas to participate in this study.

 The study will be a pre-post evaluation, without a control group, using validated patient-report assessments at baseline, after completion of the group visits, and 3 months later.

 The primary outcome variables will be physical and mental wellbeing, stress, mood, resilience, mindfulness, and social support.

 Paired t tests will be used to assess changes from baseline to immediately post-intervention & 3 months post-intervention.

 The investigators will also calculate Cohen's d effect sizes, to help them understand the degree to which an effect is present in the population.
