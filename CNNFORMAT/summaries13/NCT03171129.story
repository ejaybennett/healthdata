(firstQuint)ADINA vs.

 High Flow Nasal Cannula Comparison Study.

 NCPAP has been used increasingly to manage respiratory distress in newborns as well as apnea of prematurity.

 Humidified high flow nasal cannula devices (flows 1-8 lpm) have also been used in neonatal intensive care units.

 This study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a pressure limited nasal cannula system instead of a high flow nasal cannula system in the management of premature babies with respiratory distress.
