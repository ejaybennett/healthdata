(fifthQuint)Evaluation of a Treatment and Education Program for Diabetic Patients Who Use Flash Glucose Monitoring.

 The investigators developed a new psychoeducational treatment and education program - called FLASH - for diabetic patients on an intensive insulin therapy who use flash glucose monitoring (FGM).

 FLASH is a self-management-based treatment and education program.

 It is designed to empower patients to adequately use FGM in daily life and to train patients how to analyze their glucose data.

 FLASH consists of four lessons (90 minutes each).

 FLASH is tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a waiting-list control group since no certified and effective treatment and education program for FGM exists.

 This study is a multi-center study.

 Study centers are specialized diabetes practices throughout Germany.

 Patients will be approached by their respective practice and informed about the study.

 Study measurements as well as the conduct of FLASH will take place at the respective practice.

 Baseline measurement will take place prior to the beginning of FLASH.

 After completion of baseline measurement, all patients from one study center will be randomized centrally by the Research Institute of the Diabetes Academy Mergentheim (FIDAM).

 2 weeks and 6 months after the completion of FLASH, follow-up measurements will be conducted at the respective study center.

 HbA1c as a marker of glycemic control will be analyzed in a central laboratory.

 Time-in-range and the frequency and duration of hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes will be assessed via stored glucose data on patients FGM devices.

 The other secondary outcome measures will be assessed via psychometrically tested questionnaires or via patient files.

 Evaluation of a Treatment and Education Program for Diabetic Patients Who Use Flash Glucose Monitoring@highlight

This study is a randomized, controlled, prospective trial with a 6-month follow- up.

 A newly developed psychoeducational treatment and education programme for diabetic patients on an insulin therapy who use flash glucose monitoring (FGM) will be tested compared to a waiting group.

 Primary outcome variable is the difference in glycemic control between baseline and the 6-month follow-up.

 Secondary outcome variables are: time-in-range, frequency and duration of hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes, diabetes-related distress, depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, diabetes self-efficacy, self-care behavior, and hypoglycemia awareness.
