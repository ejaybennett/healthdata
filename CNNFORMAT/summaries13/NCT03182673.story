(fifthQuint)The Study of SHR7390 in Combination With SHR-1210 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 This is an open-label, dose escalation study of repeated doses of SHR7390 combined with SHR-1210 in the patients with advanced solid tumors that have no targeted agent as standard of therapy.

 Subjects receiving a single dose of SHR7390 (Run-in) are observed in 7-10 days, then accepted two drug combination therapy, SHR7390 is administered once daily orally for 28 days for a treatment cycle.

 At the same time, SHR-1210 was given intravenously per 2 weeks at the 200mg fixed dose.

 Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) will be assessed during the Run-in and first cycle of treatment.

 the trial is dose escalation and is designed by Accelerated Titration Designs during initial accelerated phase.

 when the significant toxicity or DLT is observed in any course of treatment,the accelerated titration trial terminates and subsequent dose escalations are become a conventional design of 3+3 patients.

 If one adverse event (AE) meets dose limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria at a given dose, 3 additional patients will be enrolled in this dose cohort.

 If 2 DLTs are determined at a given dose level, this dose will be designated as the MTD.

 Additional patients will be enrolled for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluations at different dose levels based on preliminary safety and tolerability.

 Multiple blood samples at designated time points will be collected for PK evaluations.

 The safety, tolerability and AEs will be closely monitored throughout the study duration.

 The preliminary effectiveness and clinical benefits of SHR7390 combined with SHR-1210 will be evaluated.

 The Study of SHR7390 in Combination With SHR-1210 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors@highlight

This aim of study to assess the safety and tolerability of SHR7390 combined with SHR-1210 and to define Dose limiting toxicity(DLT)and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SHR7390 in the patients with advanced solid tumors.

 To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of SHR7390 in patients with advanced solid tumor.

To assess the antitumor activity of SHR7390 combined with SHR-1210 in patients with advanced solid tumors preliminarily and recommend reasonable dosage regimen of SHR7390 for the follow-up clinical trial.
