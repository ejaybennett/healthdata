(firstQuint)Detection of Integrin avb6 in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Using PET/CT.

 Stanford University has developed a new PET tracer that selectively binds to integrin avb6, a cell surface receptor that is overexpressed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

 Increased avb6 receptors on IPF lung tissue has been well documented, while its expression remains relatively non-existent in the healthy adult lung.

 The selected PET tracer [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 has shown promise identifying integrin avb6 in both preclinical and clinical studies at Stanford University.

 The investigators have demonstrated low [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 radiopharmaceutical uptake in the heart and lung region of healthy volunteers, which was an expected biodistribution (the normal tissue uptake of the radiopharmaceutical within the body) based on immunohistochemical staining of healthy lung tissue, which demonstrated the presence of minimal avb6 receptors in healthy lung tissue.

 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 PET/CT scanning in patients with IPF.

 Feasibility will be measured by drawing regions of interest (ROI) around the lungs of participants with IPF and the lungs of healthy adult volunteers and comparing the calculated standarized uptake value maximum(s) (SUVmax).

 The tracer's physiologic biodistribution, safety and tolerability will also be studied.
