(thirdQuint)Rapidly Absorbing Polyglactin 910 Versus Monocryl for Laceration Repair.

 This randomized controlled trial will be conducted and VCU medical center comparing 2 types of suture: rapid polyglactin 910 (Vicryl Rapide) and monofilament (Monocryl) for first and second-degree lacerations or uncomplicated episiotomies requiring suture repair.

 Patients will be enrolled in the study immediately after vaginal delivery if a laceration occurs spontaneously or if episiotomy if performed.

 Patients will be randomized to one of the 2 sutures after enrollment.

 Randomization will be obtained via computer generation in consecutively numbered, opaque sealed envelopes with the name of one of the suture materials.

 The envelope will be opened at the time of repair of perineal laceration once inclusion criteria have been met by the physician or midwife performing the laceration repair.

 Repair with the chosen suture will be performed using the continuous suture technique using a 3-0 suture, which is current standard practice.

 Patients will not be informed of the type of suture used, although the type of suture will be recorded in the patient's electronic medical record.

 Various maternal and fetal characteristics will be recorded including maternal age, gravity and parity, gestational age at delivery, birth weight, mode of vaginal delivery (spontaneous or operative) and whether the patient had pre-pregnancy dyspareunia.

 Pain will be evaluated using a numeric pain scale at their 6 week postpartum visit and at 3 months postpartum via a telephone interview.

 At 3 months postpartum they will also be asked the following questions - Have you resumed sexual intercourse(yes/no)? How long after delivery was it before you resumed intercourse? Did you have pain the first time after delivery (yes/no)? Do you have continued dyspareunia (1-10)? Do you have residual perineal pain unrelated to intercourse? How satisfied are you with your laceration repair (very unsatisfied -1, neutral-3, very satisfied- 5).

 They will also be administered a 6 question validated Female Sexual Function Index.

 The electronic medical record will be reviewed for their 6 week visit and the presence of wound breakdown, infection, granulation tissue and the need for suture removal will be recorded.
