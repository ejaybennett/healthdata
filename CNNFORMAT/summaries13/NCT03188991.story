(secondQuint)Intracystic Injection of NanoPac in Subjects With Mucinous Cystic Pancreatic Neoplasms.

 In this open-label, dose rising trial with an expanded cohort at the dose of NanoPac(R) (Sterile Nanoparticulate Paclitaxel) determined to have the best tolerability and safety profile, subjects with mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms will receive intracystic NanoPac(R) via endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle injection (EUS-FNI).

 The study will include a dose escalation phase and a dose confirmation phase.

 Subjects will be enrolled in sequential cohorts of NanoPac(R) at 6, 10, and 15 mg/mL at volumes equal to the amount of fluid aspirated from the cyst.

 Each cohort will have three subjects, with cohorts enrolled sequentially starting at the lowest concentration.

 Following Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review of the cohort data, the next cohort may begin enrolling, an additional three at the current dose may be enrolled, or if the first dose does not provide adequate safety and tolerability the study may be halted.

 The dose determined to be the most suitable for further evaluation, defined as the highest dose with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile (as determined by the DSMB), will enroll additional subjects to provide a total of 12 subjects at that dose level.

 Plasma samples will be taken on the day of NanoPac(R) injection at 1 and 2 hours after injection, as well as at each of the subsequent study visits, to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of intracystic NanoPac(R).

 Subjects will be followed for 6 months after NanoPac(R) injection for safety, and cyst response to therapy (as shown by imaging).

 Cyst fluid will also be extracted and analyzed for cyst fluid markers.
