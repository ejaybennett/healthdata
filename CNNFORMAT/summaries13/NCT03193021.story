(thirdQuint)The AMBULATE Trial: A Randomized, Multi-center Trial to Compare Cardiva Mid-Bore VVCS to Manual Compression in Closure of Multiple Femoral Venous Access Sites in 6 - 12 Fr Sheath Sizes.

 A prospective, randomized, controlled multi-center clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the study device in sealing multiple femoral venous access sites and providing reduced times to ambulation compared with manual compression at the completion of catheter-based procedures performed through 6 - 12 Fr introducer sheaths.

 Only patients with multiple access sites will be enrolled in order to support the desired indication.

 Randomization will be stratified to account for patients with varying numbers of access sites in a 1:1 treatment device to control arm ratio to ensure treatment and control arms have the same proportion of access sites/patient, i.

e.

 3 access sites/patient vs.

 4 access sites/patient.

 The AMBULATE Trial: A Randomized, Multi-center Trial to Compare Cardiva Mid-Bore VVCS to Manual Compression in Closure of Multiple Femoral Venous Access Sites in 6 - 12 Fr Sheath Sizes@highlight

The objective of the trial is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Cardiva Mid-Bore Venous Vascular Closure System (VVCS) in sealing femoral venous access sites and providing reduced times to ambulation (TTA) compared with manual compression at the completion of catheter-based procedures performed through 6 - 12 Fr introducer sheaths.
