(secondQuint)Melatonin Decreases Eye Pressure in Normotensive Patients.

 Melatonin has been shown to be effective to decrease intraocular pressure in experimental animal researches.

 Agomelatine is a melatonin derivative drug approved for the treatment of depression, which is also available in our country.

 Depending on animal experiments, it can be assumed that agomelatine can decrease intraocular pressure.

 Demonstrating that agomelatine is effective to reduce eye pressure may give a concurrent treatment of depressive patients with glaucoma.

 With this it may be possible to treat both diseases at the same time with single drug.

 In this study, the researchers intended to investigate the changes in ocular tension in normotensive depressive patients treated with agomelatine.
