(thirdQuint)Utilization of Somatic Tissue Oxygen Saturation Monitoring in Pregnant Women.

 In both normotensive women and others with pregnancy induced hypertension, in previous research simultaneous tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) were measured in both forearms, with a blood pressure cuff above the tissue oximetry probe on one side.

 StO2 values were continuously monitored on each side during unilateral blood pressure (BP) cuff inflation (to suprasystolic pressure for 3 min), and then during deflation.

 Despite similarity in the forearm StO2 decline observed with cuff inflation in all women, the rise following cuff deflation - indicative of reactive hyperemia - appeared reduced in hypertensive patients, suggesting a relationship with impaired endothelial reserve.

 Utilization of Somatic Tissue Oxygen Saturation Monitoring in Pregnant Women@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare 3 methods of assessing endothelial function in healthy female volunteers and pregnant women with and without pregnancy induced hypertension.

 The methods under comparison are simultaneous tissue oxygen saturation (StO2), EndoPAT and Sphygmocor (pregnant women only).

 35 participants (15 healthy, 10 pregnant normal blood pressure, 10 pregnant with hypertension) will be enrolled.
