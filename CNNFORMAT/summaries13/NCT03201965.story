(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Daratumumab in Combination With Cyclophosphamide, Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (CyBorD) Compared to CyBorD Alone in Newly Diagnosed Systemic Amyloid Light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis.

 Participant involved in study for approx.

 8 years duration includes Screening Phase (complete clinical evaluation will be done), Treatment Phase (monitoring of adverse events (AEs), laboratory abnormalities and clinical response), Post-Treatment Observation Phase (disease evaluations will be done) and a Long-term Follow-up Phase (Subsequent anticancer treatment, response to subsequent treatment, date of progression and survival status will be obtained every 16 weeks).

The primary hypothesis is that daratumumab in combination with CyBorD will improve the overall complete hematological response rate compared to CyBorD alone in AL amyloidosis participants.

 Safety will be measured by AEs, laboratory test results, electrocardiogram, vital sign measurements, physical examination, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daratumumab plus cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) compared with CyBorD alone in treatment of newly diagnosed amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis participants.
