(secondQuint)A Phase 2 Study of NIR178 in Combination With PDR001 in Patients With Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.

 The study has four parts: part 1: Multi-arm Bayesian adaptive signal finding design in solid tumors and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL); part 2: NIR178 schedule exploration in NSCLC; part 3: Further evaluation of intermittent dosing schedules of NIR178 in combination with PDR001 in additional tumor types, if part 2 identifies an intermittent dosing schedule of NIR178 as warranting further exploration; part 4: A separate safety run-in part will be conducted in Japan in order to adequately characterize the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of NIR178 as a single-agent.

 Parts 1, 2 and 4 will enroll in parallel.

 Part 3 will be opened based on the results from part 2.

 Patients enrolled in this study will receive NIR178 either BID continuously or based on the assigned intermittent schedule within 60 minutes prior to PDR001 infusion.

 PDR001 will be administered via IV infusion over 30 minutes once every 4 weeks.

 Each treatment cycle is 28 days.

 Patients enrolled in the Japanese safety run-in part will receive NIR178 as single agent for the first cycle (28 days).

 If the patients complete cycle 1 without experiencing DLTs, they will initiate combination therapy with PDR001 starting cycle 2 onwards, and continue at the same dose of NIR178.

 Patients will receive treatment with the combination until disease progression (assessed by investigator per immune-related response criteria (irRC) or Cheson 2014, unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from study treatment for any other reason (e.

g.

, withdrawal of consent, start of a new anti-neoplastic therapy or at the discretion of the investigator), otherwise known as End of Treatment.

 A Phase 2 Study of NIR178 in Combination With PDR001 in Patients With Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma@highlight

The purpose of this phase 2 study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NIR178 in combination with PDR001 in multiple solid tumors and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and further explore schedule variations of NIR178 to optimize immune activation through inhibition of A2aR.
