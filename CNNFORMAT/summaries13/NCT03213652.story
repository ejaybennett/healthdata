(thirdQuint)Ensartinib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, or Histiocytic Disorders With ALK or ROS1 Genomic Alterations (A Pediatric MATCH Treatment Trial).

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in pediatric patients treated with ensartinib with advanced solid tumors (including central nervous system [CNS] tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor ALK or ROS1 fusions or that harbor ALK missense mutations.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with ensartinib with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor ALK or ROS1 fusions or that harbor ALK missense mutations.

 II.

 To obtain information about the tolerability of ensartinib in children with relapsed or refractory cancer.

 III.

 To provide preliminary estimates of the pharmacokinetics of ensartinib in children with relapsed or refractory cancer.

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate other biomarkers as predictors of response to ensartinib and specifically, whether tumors that harbor different missense mutations or fusions (including the crizotinib resistant F1174L ALK variant) will demonstrate differential response to ensartinib treatment.

 II.

 To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

 OUTLINE: Patients receive ensartinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

 Courses repeat every 28 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Ensartinib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, or Histiocytic Disorders With ALK or ROS1 Genomic Alterations (A Pediatric MATCH Treatment Trial)@highlight

This phase II Pediatric MATCH trial studies how well ensartinib works in treating patients with solid tumors, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or histiocytic disorders with ALK or ROS1 genomic alterations that have come back or do not respond to treatment and have spread to other places in the body.

 Ensartinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
