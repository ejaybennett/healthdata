(fifthQuint)Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of AZD2811 Nanoparticles in Patients With Relapsed AML/High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Treatment-Nave Patients.

.

 This is a Phase I/II clinical study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AZD2811 in patients with relapsed AML/high risk myelodysplastic syndrome or treatment-naive patients not eligible for intensive induction therapy or allogeneic transplantation.

 The study was also explore the potential clinical activity by assessing anti-tumour activity in patients.

 The study will be conducted in two parts, designated Part A, dose escalation, and Part B, dose expansion.

 In Part A the dose escalation and de-escalation plan for evaluating AZD2811 will follow the Bayesian Adaptive Design scheme which combines prior expectations about the dose toxicity relationship and applies the data at the end of each cohort to recommend a dose for the next cohort.

 Patients will receive a single 2- or 4- hour IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 4 of each 28-day cycle.

 Dosing frequency and schedule may be adjusted during the study on the basis of emerging safety and pharmacokinetic data.

 Part B will include up to 24 additional evaluable patients at the maximum tolerated dose and/or below, in order to further explore the tolerability, PK and clinical activity at this dose.
