(secondQuint)Early Diagnosis of Active Tuberculosis Using Ultra Low-dose Chest CT.

 The early diagnosis of active tuberculosis in close contacts have not yet been established.

 To evaluate the early detection of active pulmonary tuberculosis using ULDCT, the investigators will establish the observational cohort of close contacts living in the same space with active pulmonary tuberculosis.

 Participants will visit our center at enrollment, after 3 months, and 12 months and will be received ULDCT, chest X-ray and Interferon-gamma assays at each visit.

 One chest radiologist will interpret findings of ULDCT and chest X-ray.

 Patients diagnosed with active tuberculosis will be excluded from the study and treated based on World Health Organization guidelines.
