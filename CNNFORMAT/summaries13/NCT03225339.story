(fifthQuint)Diabetes Intervention Accentuating Diet and Enhancing Metabolism.

 The aim of the proposed study is to conduct a pragmatic randomised controlled clinical trial randomising young adult patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes to an intervention incorporating a low calorie diet and physical activity or usual care.

 The investigators hypothesise that patients in the low calorie intervention arm will have greater weight reduction leading to significant improvement in glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk.

 The primary outcome will be weight loss.

 The low calorie diet intervention arm is designed to achieve and maintain significant weight loss through decreased calorie intake, increased physical activity, and behaviour change.

 Usual care will include routine advice about diet and physical activity.

 Secondary outcomes include diabetes control, body composition, and quality of life.

 Diabetes Intervention Accentuating Diet and Enhancing Metabolism@highlight

Diabetes is one of the greatest challenges faced by healthcare services worldwide.

 It is associated with serious complications such as heart attacks, stroke, and peripheral artery disease as well as kidney disease, eye disease, and nerve dysfunction.

 Data from weight loss with bariatric surgery suggest that with the appropriate intervention, it should be possible to reverse diabetes and that the earlier the intervention occurs, the greater the chances of placing diabetes into remission.

 There is now a need to translate this knowledge into the medical care of younger patients with early diabetes who are overweight/obese.

 The aim of this study is to see if younger adult patients with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes who are participants in a programme incorporating a low energy diet and physical activity (lifestyle) will lower their weight, cardiovascular risk and improve their glycaemic control as compared to the usual care.
