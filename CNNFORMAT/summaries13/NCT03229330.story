(thirdQuint)Low-level Light Therapy on Treatment of Venous Ulcers Assesed by Nursing Outcome Classification (NOC).

 There are several therapeutics with different mechanisms of action to reach tissue repair.

 The conventional treatment of venous ulcers is based on the alternation of exercising the lower extremities with resting, the application of topical treatments associated with compressive therapy, and the use of medications.

 Despite the diversity of bandages available, there are still lesions with difficult prolonged healing process.

 Therefore, Low-level Light Therapy has been used as an adjuvant technological alternative therapy, due to its photochemical effects on the tissues, such as the modulation of inflammation, increase of granulation tissue, contraction of the wound, reduction of the inflammatory process, and reduction of pain.

 This therapy contributes to accelerate and improve the tissue repair process.

 Studies assessed by Nursing Outcomes Classification about the usage of the treatments above combined are not available.

 Consequently, more robust clinical studies over venous ulcers to evaluate the tissue repair must be proposed using reliable instruments.

 Low-level Light Therapy on Treatment of Venous Ulcers Assesed by Nursing Outcome Classification (NOC)@highlight

This study compares the effect of adjuvant treatment of Low-level Light Therapy with conventional treatment in the tissue repair of venous ulcers in patients undergoing outpatient nursing consultation.

 For the evaluation of the cases clinical indicators of Nursing Outcomes Classification have been used.
