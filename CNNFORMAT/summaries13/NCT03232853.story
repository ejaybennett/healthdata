(firstQuint)E-learning to Prevent Drug Errors in Anesthesia.

 Before the study, the investigators selected 15 preventive measures to avoid medication errors during anesthesia.

 These measures were learned to the entire anesthesia team (nurse, resident and anesthesiologist) during conventional meetings.

 An initial evaluation of the application of these measures will be carried out before the introduction of e-learning.

 This assessment will be conducted by nurses without the knowledge of the anesthetic team evaluated.

 After this initial evaluation, e-learning will be broadcast on the hospital intranet.

 Then a second evaluation of the application of the preventive measures will be carried out 6 month and 1 year after the introduction of e-learning.
