(fifthQuint)Ixazomib In Combination With Cyclophosphamide And Dexamethasone for Newly Diagnosed AL Amyloidosis.

 This study is a phase 1/2 study to assess safety and hematologic response rate of Ixazomib (MLN) in combination with Cyclophosphamide (CTX) and Dexamethasone (DEX).

 This is an open label multi-center, dose escalation safety study for patients with newly diagnosed AL Amyloidosis.

 A 3+3 design will be utilized to determine the MTD for MLN + CTX + DEX in 28-day treatment cycle.

 Treatment cycles will be repeated up to 6 cycles or until disease progression or until development of significant treatment-related toxicities.

 A total of up to 30 patients are planned to enroll into the study, with a maximum of 18 patients in the dose escalation arm and 18 patients in the MTD expansion arm.

 The cohort of 6 patients treated at the MTD during the dose expansion phase will also serve as the initial 6 patients for the expansion Phase II cohort.

 These 6 patients will contribute data to both the phase I dose escalation study and the phase II expansion study.

 To complete the Phase II cohort, an additional 12 new patients will need to be enrolled.

 MLN will be taken orally on days 1, 8, and 15 at doses of 3 mg or 4 mg.

 CTX will be taken orally on the same days with dose escalation from 300 mg up to 500 mg.

 DEX will be taken orally on days 1, 8, 15, 22 at 20 mg in the 28-day cycle.

 Ixazomib In Combination With Cyclophosphamide And Dexamethasone for Newly Diagnosed AL Amyloidosis@highlight

Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a bone marrow disorder that affects a wide range of organs that can lead to organ dysfunction and death.

 Amyloid is an abnormal protein that is produced in your bone marrow and cannot be broken down.

 It builds up in different organs preventing them from working well.

 The most commonly affected organs are the kidneys, heart, liver, spleen, nervous system, and digestive tract.

 Treatment with chemotherapy can stop the growth of abnormal cells that produce this abnormal protein.

 Decrease in amyloid protein in the body improves the function of the affected organs.

 The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safest dose of the medications and how well you tolerate them or the "maximum tolerated dose" (MTD).

 The study uses Ixazomib in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone to treat people with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis.

 This combination of medications is an oral regimen that is taken over 6 cycles.

 The first part of study will determine the safety of this regimen and the second part of the study will determine how effective this combination of drugs is to treat your disease.
