(firstQuint)A Trial Comparing the Incidence of Hypophosphatemia in Relation to Treatment With Iron Isomaltoside and Ferric Carboxymaltose in Subjects With Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA-05).

 Existing IV iron complexes differ in relation to the compounds capability to induce unintended hypophosphatemia to a degree defined as medical significant.

 This trial is designed evaluate the effect of IV iron isomaltoside compared to IV ferric carboxymaltose on phosphate in subjects with IDA.
