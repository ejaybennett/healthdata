(fifthQuint)A Pilot Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Combined With Bevacizumab for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer.

 Objective: compared with the postoperative adjuvant therapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has shown better compliance of LARC patients, and may be more effective in reducing the incidence of local recurrence and distant metastasis.

 This study used the anti-angiogenesis drugs beacizumab and chemotherapy in patients with LARC for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and investigated the short-term efficacy to provide objective basis for the selection of neoadjuvant therapy.

 Methods: 70 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma clinical staging in Stage II or Stage III were included for neoadjuvant therapy followed by TME, of which 35 underwent neoadjuvant radiotherapy, and other 35 underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy+beacizumab.

 A Pilot Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Combined With Bevacizumab for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer@highlight

Background: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and total mesorectum excision (TME) has become the standard therapy for the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) to reduce the local recurrence rate, however, no improvement of distant metastasis rate was observed, and the incidence of postoperative local recurrence and distant metastasis can reach more than 25%.

 It is still a challenge for us to improve the RO resection rate of locally advanced rectal cancer and reduce the incidence of local recurrence and distant metastasis.
