(fifthQuint)Peer-led Psycho-education for Schizophrenia.

 Objectives: This study is to test the effectiveness of a peer-expert-led psycho-education group programme for Chinese outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders over an 24-month follow-up.

 The program is an integrated,psycho-education program that addresses patients' knowledge and self-management of schizophrenia and problem-solving skills.

 Methods: A single-blind, multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 342 Chinese patients with schizophrenia in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan.

 In each of three study sites, the participants will be randomly selected from the eligible patient list (i.

e.

, 114 subjects from each study site) and after baseline measurement, be assigned to either the peer-led psycho-education program, profession-led psycho-education group, or usual psychiatric care.

 The patients' mental and psychosocial functioning, insights into illness, and their re-hospitalization rates will be measured at recruitment and at one week, and 6, 12 and 24 months after completing the interventions.

 Hypothesis: The patients in the peer-led psycho-education program will report significantly greater improvements in their symptoms and re-hospitalisation rates (primary outcomes) and other secondary outcomes (e.

g.

, insight into illness and functioning) over the 24-month follow-up, when compared with those in profession-led psycho-education group and/or usual care.

 Conclusions: The findings will provide evidence whether the peer-led psycho-education group program can better improve Chinese schizophrenia sufferers' psychosocial functioning and reduce their illness relapse.

 Peer-led Psycho-education for Schizophrenia@highlight

Profession-led psycho-education programs for people with schizophrenia are evidenced to improve patients' knowledge about the illness, mental state and relapse rate.

 Nevertheless, other benefits to patients, for example, their functioning and insight into illness or to be substantive in a longer term (>12 months) are inconsistent and uncertain, especially in Asian populations.

 This single-blind multi-site randomized clinical trial was to test the effects of a peer-expert-led psycho-education group intervention (in addition to usual care) for adult patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders over a 24-month follow-up, in comparison to a profession-led psycho-education group or treatment-as-usual only.
