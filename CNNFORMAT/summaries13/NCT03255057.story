(fifthQuint)Extracorporeal CO2 Removal With the Hemolung RAS for Mechanical Ventilation Avoidance During Acute Exacerbation of COPD.

 The Hemolung RAS provides low-flow ECCO2R using a single, 15.

5 French dual-lumen catheter inserted percutaneously in the femoral or jugular vein.

 Low-flow ECCO2R offers an alternative or supplement to invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) for patients suffering from acute, reversible, hypercapnic respiratory failure.

 In contrast to invasive MV, low-flow ECCO2R provides partial ventilatory support independently of the lungs.

 The rationale for this study is that low-flow ECCO2R with the Hemolung RAS can be used to provide supplemental CO2 removal in COPD patients experiencing acute hypercapnic respiratory failure to either avoid or reduce time on invasive MV.

 In this patient population, avoidance or reduced time on invasive MV may have significant clinical benefit in reducing the many complications associated with invasive MV.

 The major complication risks of low-flow ECCO2R are associated with central venous catheterization and the need for anticoagulation during treatment.

 This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Hemolung RAS plus standard-of-care as compared to standard-of-care alone.

 Extracorporeal CO2 Removal With the Hemolung RAS for Mechanical Ventilation Avoidance During Acute Exacerbation of COPD@highlight

This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of using the Hemolung RAS to provide low-flow extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) as an alternative or adjunct to invasive mechanical ventilation for patients who require respiratory support due to an acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

 It is hypothesized that the Hemolung RAS can be safely used to avoid or reduce time on invasive mechanical ventilation compared to COPD patients treated with standard-of-care mechanical ventilation alone.

 Eligible patients will be randomized to receive lung support with either the Hemolung RAS plus standard-of-care mechanical ventilation, or standard-of-care mechanical ventilation alone.
