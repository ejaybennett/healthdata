(thirdQuint)Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in Children and Maxillary and Mandibular Development.

 Obstructive Sleep Apnea syndrome (OSA) shows a 10% morbidity rate in children with a higher rate between the ages of 3 and 5.

 Generally speaking, its prevalence is underestimated.

 Furthermore, detecting OSA remains difficult due to its particular physiopathology.

 The decrease in nasopharyngeal airway dimensions is the most common etiology.

 This decrease is related to soft tissues as well as maxillomandibular abnormalities.

 The aim of the study is to show that reducing sleep apnea in children remains possible when inducing rapid palatal expansion and mandibular advancement using the Yookid cent system.

 The Yookid cent system associates a mandibular advancement appliance and repositioning of the patient during sleep.

Assessment of the association of maxillary expansion using a rapid palatal expansion, use of a mandibular advancement appliance (MGA cent ) and of a device allowing sleep in a semi-seated position (Yoobreath cent ) in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OAS).

 MGA cent and YooBreath cent constitute the Yookid system cent .
