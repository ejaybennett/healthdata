(fifthQuint)Simulation-based Low-dose High Frequency (LDHF) Plus Mobile Mentoring (m-Mentoring) Study in Nigeria.

 Simulation-based low dose high frequency (LDHF) training has emerged as a new strategy for delivering key content and improving the competencies of health workers.

 In facility-based driven simulation-based LDHF trainings, providers are not removed from clinical practice for the extended periods of time, and a heavy emphasis is placed on simulation with practice and feedback.

 The Maternal and Child Survival Program (MCSP) in Nigeria is working in selected health facilities in Ebonyi and Kogi States to improve the quality of care received by mothers and newborns on the day of birth using high-impact evidence-based lifesaving interventions.

 The simulation-based LDHF/m-Mentoring evaluation comparing it to the traditional group-based training will contribute to the body of knowledge on this approach.

 The study design is cluster randomized control trial.

 Sixty (60) health facilities will be selected from the list of 120 facilities which are supported by MCSP and randomized to intervention and control group.

 Selection will be based on caseload, level of service delivery, and ownership.

 Thereafter, these will be randomly assigned to simulation-based LDHF/m-Mentoring Group (intervention arm) or Group-Based Training Group (control arm).

 Simulation-based Low-dose High Frequency (LDHF) Plus Mobile Mentoring (m-Mentoring) Study in Nigeria@highlight

The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and cost of a simulation-based low dose high frequency (LDHF) plus m-Mentoring training versus the traditional group-based training approaches in improving knowledge and skill in maternal and newborn care and to determine trainees' satisfaction with the approaches in Ebonyi and Kogi states.

 The specific objectives are to: 1.

 Compare knowledge and skill learning outcomes between the two groups of birth attendants trained through the simulation-based LDHF/m-Mentoring versus group-based training approaches in Kogi and Ebonyi states over 12-months.

 2.

 Assess the trainees' satisfaction with a simulation-based LDHF/m-Mentoring and group-based training approaches in improving skills of birth attendants in the selected facilities in Kogi and Ebonyi state over 12-months.

 3.

 Determine the cost and cost-effectiveness of LDHF/m-Mentoring and group-based training approaches in improving skills of birth attendants in the selected facilities in Kogi and Ebonyi state over 12-months.
