(secondQuint)Comparison of Sternal Wound Infiltration With Liposomal Bupivacaine v.

 Bupivacaine Hydrochloride.

 There are no studies to date on the use of LB infiltration and its analgesic efficacy in cardiac surgery done through sternotomy, even though the majority of cardiac surgeries utilize this approach.

 Moderate to severe pain is common in patients undergoing these surgeries and is usually inadequately treated.

 Other various pain treatment modalities such as opioid and neuraxial anesthesia are avoided due to potentially dangerous side effects in this cohort.

 The efficacy of local anesthesia techniques, such as bupivacaine, are limited due to short duration of action and increased incidence of wound infection.

 On the other hand, slow release liposomal bupivacaine may last up to 72 hours, indicating it's potential for more adequate analgesia compared to bupivacaine.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of wound infiltration with liposomal bupivacaine (LB) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and compare it with bupivacaine hydrochloride infiltration
