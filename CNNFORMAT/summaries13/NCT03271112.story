(fifthQuint)Frailty Prevention in Elders From Reunion Island.

 Regular physical activity has been shown to slow down sarcopenia, and increase strengh in elders.

 Nevertheless, senior with low incomes do not usually have access to physical activity areas.

 Social partners are in close relationship with these elders and could promote free exercise programs dedicated to elders classified as "GIR5-6" according to the French scale "AGIRR".

 The AGIRR scale takes into account several criteria allowing the evaluation of the level of autonomy.

 The level of autonomy is closely related to frailty and could be reversed since elders have not reach a dependant-state.

 The "GIR5-6" level means that elderly people are still not dependant but exhibit several frailty risk factors.

 The level of frailty and the physical performance of the participants is assessed by standard geriatric evaluation before the 12-wks exercice program.

 The improvement of the physical performance is assessed after he 12-wks exercice program.
