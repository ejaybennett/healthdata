(secondQuint)MRI as an Alternative to CT for Exploration of Acute Abdominal Pain in Young Women.

 Methods : Consecutive women aged 18-40 years old with acute abdominopelvic pain referred to CT by the emergency Physician or gynaecologist after a non contributive ultrasonography will be included.

 After obtaining informed consent, all patients will undergo standard CT followed by an additional MRI examination, performed using a short MRI protocol and within 6 hour from CT.

 The gold standard or reference diagnosis will be established in consensus by an expert panel at 3 months follow up using a standardized diagnosis form.

 A retrospective reading will be performed independently for CT and MRI by radiologists blinded to the reference diagnosis, using the same standardized diagnosis form.

 CT and MRI accuracies will be compared.
