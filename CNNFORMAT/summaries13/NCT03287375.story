(thirdQuint)Treatment of Peritoneal Carcinomatosis With Pressurized IntraPeritoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy -.

 Patients with peritoneal metastases (PM) will be reviewed by the interdisciplinary tumor board and included based on predefined in- and exclusion criteria.

 Eligible candidates with primary colorectal or appendiceal cancers will be treated with intraperitoneal oxaliplatin delivered by the PIPAC procedure, while patients with other primary cancers will be treated with a combination of cisplatin and doxorubicin.

 Three PIPAC treatments will be scheduled in intervals of five weeks.

 MRI and QoL questionnaires will be performed at baseline and after three PIPAC treatments.

 If the patients respond to the PIPAC treatment, further courses of PIPAC can be planned at the tumour board meeting.

 In brief, PIPAC is performed during a standard laparoscopy using two access ports, where the magnitude of PM is evaluated using the Peritoneal Carcinosis Index and the Dutch 7 regions count.

 Afterwards, the peritoneum is biopsied at different regions and peritoneal lavage fluid is sent for cytology.

 Then, chemotherapy is aerosolised within the abdomen, and after 30 minutes, the aerosol has been absorbed by the peritoneum, and the patient is closed according to departmental guidelines.

 The patients are expectedly discharged within 24 hours, and will after each PIPAC treatment be screened for adverse events using the CTCAE and Dindo-Clavien classification.

This is a study, where the efficacy of Pressurized IntraPeritoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) against peritoneal metastases will be evaluated.

 Furthermore, this study will focus on the best evaluation method, where both Quality of Life questionnaires, repeated histology, cytology and MRI will be used.
