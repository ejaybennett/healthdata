(firstQuint)Effects of Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation on the Phenotype of Blood Platelets and Leucocytes.

 The present study plan to investigate platelet activation in vivo using a variety of biomarkers previously identified as sensitive to high shear stress in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis before and after trans arterial valve replacement.

 As one of the best biomarker is a high degree of platelet-leukocyte interactions, the study will study in parallel leukocytes activation/differentiation.

 These parameters will be compared at 3 time-points, before and after LAVD implantation in ambulatory patients.
