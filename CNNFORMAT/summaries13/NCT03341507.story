(secondQuint)Tracheal Intubation With the Rigid Tube for Laryngoscopy- a New Method.

 The rigid tube for laryngoscopy is a 15 to 30 cm long metallic tube with a bevel end and a diameter of 0.

5-2.

0 cm , an instrument used to inspect the larynx and surrounding areas.

 It resembles a rigid bronchoscope but it is shorter.

 When in use, it has to be attached to a light source.

 The hypothesis of the study stands that the rigid tube for laryngoscopy it could be more efficient in tracheal intubation for difficult airway patients than classical intubation with a curved blade laryngoscope.

 The retromolar approach in both sides together with bujie intubation is the technique of intubation used in this study.

 Tracheal Intubation With the Rigid Tube for Laryngoscopy- a New Method@highlight

This study evaluates the efficiency of the rigid tube for laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation in patients with presumed difficult airway and compare the classical laryngoscopy and this method in matter of glottis visualisation and tracheal intubation.
