(fifthQuint)Online Mind/Body Program for Fertility.

 Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive a child.

 A couple may be acknowledged as infertile if conception has not occurred after 12 months of having regular, unprotected intercourse.

 Over six million couples in the United States are affected by infertility.

 Research suggests that there is a relationship between psychological distress and infertility, but the relationship is complex.

 The information from this study will be used to better understand the relationship between psychological distress and infertility among couples.

 Furthermore, the investigators are interested in testing Dr.

 Alice Domar's Mind/Body Fertility Program that was designed to help individuals regain control of their life and learn new lifestyle habits that can increase their chances of conceiving.

 There is evidence that individuals that participated in the group format of this treatment protocol showed statistically significant decreases in physical and psychological symptoms of stress and increases in conception rates.

 Our primary goals are to evaluate patients willingness to be recruited and randomized as well as their adherence and attrition to the program.

 Our secondary goals are to evaluate reductions in emotional distress (i.

e.

, anxiety, depression, and stress) and enhance emotion regulation skills as well as pregnancy rates.
