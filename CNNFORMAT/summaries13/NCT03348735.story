(thirdQuint)Localized Neuropathic Pain: Topical Treatment Versus Systemic Treatment.

 A multicentre, randomized, open-label comparative trial evaluating topical treatment options versus oral systemic treatment in adult patients suffering from localized neuropathic pain (LNP) syndromes.

 A wide variety of peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes will be included such as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), post-surgical NP/post-traumatic NP/scar pain, post-amputation NP, post-radiation therapy NP, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type 1.

 In contrast to most (or even all) commercial clinical studies we will not limit the inclusion to one or two distinct neuropathic pain syndromes such as post-herpetic neuralgia (inclusion based on etiology of the neuropathic syndrome).

 In this pragmatic trial we will however include all patients suffering from a clinical neuropathic syndrome with distinct clinical features such as hyperalgesia/allodynia, presence of spontaneous positive sensory phenomena and lasting for more than 3 months without making any exclusion based on etiology.

 Initial pain intensity indicates the presence of either moderate or severe pain in these adult patients (NRS 4/10).

Evaluation of topical treatment with lidocaine 5% patch (daily administration) or capsaicin 8% patch (periodic administration - upon reoccurrence of pain symptoms) in adult patients suffering from localized neuropathic pain (LNP) across a wide variety of etiologies, with a duration between 1 and 12 months (subacute to chronic neuropathic pain (NP)).
