(fifthQuint)Tolcapone in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

 The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tolcapone in adults with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

 The hypothesis to be tested is that tolcapone will be more effective and well tolerated in adults with OCD compared to placebo.

 The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder where current treatments are often ineffective.

 The primary aim of this application is to conduct a randomized placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy trial using tolcapone in 20 participants with OCD.

 The study will consist of two phases: a 2 week active treatment phase with tolcapone, a one-week wash-out phase, and a 2 week placebo phase.

 The subjects will be randomized to either receive tolcapone or placebo treatment in the first 2 weeks, and the other during the remaining 2 week phase.

 This will be one of few studies assessing the use of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of OCD in adults.

 Assessing the efficacy and safety of tolcapone will help inform clinicians about additional treatment options for adults suffering from this disorder.

The proposed study will consist of a 5-week double-blind cross-over study trial of tolcapone in 20 people (ages 18-65).

 The study will be divided into an initial 2 week phase and a second 2 week phase, with one of the 2 week phases consisting of active treatment with tolcapone, and the other 2 week phase consisting of inactive placebo treatment.

 There will be a one-week wash-out phase between the 2-week treatment phases.

 Participants will be randomized to receive either tolcapone or placebo during the first 2 week phase on a 1:1 basis.

 This blinding will be maintained by the IDS pharmacy at the University of Chicago.
