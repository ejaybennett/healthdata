(fifthQuint)Biomarkers in Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity.

 Therapy with chemotherapeutic drugs can make a huge impact on survival and quality of life in patients with cancer.

 Advances in medical monitoring and the effectiveness of these therapies have significantly improved outcomes so that a definitive cure or long-term survival is more likely.

 Cancer survivors are used to dealing with serious side effects of their therapy; however, some of the side effects from the chemotherapy drugs persist even after the medication course is completed.

 The impact of these sequelae on quality of survival is increasingly being appreciated and forming an important new direction of cancer care.

 One of the more severe side effects of chemotherapy is peripheral neurotoxicity resulting in neuropathy or neuronopathy.

 Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is one of the least predictable and most prolonged sequelae with effects ranging from pain, numbness and tingling to diffuse weakness sometimes to the extent of paralysis.

 It results from damage or alteration in function of peripheral nerves usually, but not always, in a length-dependent manner.

 An indirect impact of CIPN includes difficulties with balance and susceptibility to falls.

 There are currently no therapies that have been proven to prevent CIPN.

 Similarly, there are few medications that are known to be effective in the reversing CIPN once it develops or effectively treating symptoms of CIPN.

 Currently diagnosis is based mainly on clinical examination and electrophysiological testing to monitor CIPN;identification of candidate biomarkers through which disease onset can be identified at an earlier stage and which reflect presumed pathophysiologic mechanisms is of paramount importance.

 There are different theories of CIPN pathogenesis.

 One of the leading hypotheses relates to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress affecting both the dorsal root ganglia neurons and supportive endothelial cells of the vasa nervorum.

 Here at Dartmouth, a specialized technique has been developed that allows the non-invasive assessment of tissue oxygen in and around peripheral nerve.

 This technique, called "electron paramagnetic resonance" (EPR) oximetry, allows for repeated measurements over time that can be correlated with other metrics of peripheral nerve function.

 Given its relevance to an important pathophysiologic mechanism of disease, EPR oximetry may provide an early marker of disease onset.

 In this proposal, the investigators will be testing the hypothesis that this could be a biomarker of CIPN.

 It is hoped that this measurement will (i) reflect the changes that occur on a cellular level and that damage nerves, (ii) reflect the damage occurring to nerves more sensitively than existing techniques, and (iii) help to better understand the reason the nerves are being damaged.

 It is also hoped that this will be something that can be used in future clinical trials.

 Biomarkers in Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity@highlight

This pilot study will attempt to establish the feasibility of using tissue oxygen measurements as a potential biomarker for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

 Thirty (30) subjects scheduled to begin taxane-based chemotherapy for breast tumor will be assigned to receive an India ink injection under the skin of the foot.

 The ink will be used to make up to five (5) 45-minute "electron paramagnetic resonance" (EPR) oximetry readings prior to the start of chemotherapy.

 Subjects will undergo electrophysiologic assessments including electromyography and nerve conduction studies, in addition to a neurological examination prior to the start of chemotherapy.

 Subjects will have the EPR oximetry readings, electrophysiologic tests, and neurological examination two more times: at the halfway point of their chemotherapy treatment -- or at the onset of CIPN symptoms -- and again after chemotherapy has been completed.
