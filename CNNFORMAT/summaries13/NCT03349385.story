(thirdQuint)Registry of Secondary Revascularization.

 Secondary or repeated revascularization refers to any repeated coronary intervention following an index coronary revascularization procedure, and represents a wide proportion of patients received in catheterization laboratories.

 These patients have an increased complexity and worse outcomes than patients without previous revascularization.

 Clinical investigation has focused in lesion-specific treatments when a single previous revascularization fails, but there is paucity of patient-level information including complex patients with multiple revascularizations.

 Other gaps in evidence addressed by this study are the absence of a a prognosis-oriented classification of previously revascularized patients and a clinical meaningful definition of revascularization failure.

 The registry as well intends to provide insights on how secondary revascularization decisions are taken and long term prognosis after secondary revascularization.

 The registry of secondary revascularization (in Spanish: Registro multicentrico de reVAscularizacion SECundaria, REVASEC) is a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study that incudes consecutive patients with at least one previous coronary revascularization undergoing a clinically indicated diagnostic coronary angiography, in different Spanish hospitals.

 The aims are describing the incidence, clinical profile, therapeutic management and prognosis of these patients.

The study will evaluate patients with, at least, one previous procedure of coronary revascularization (surgical, percutaneous or both), that are referred for a new, clinically indicated, diagnostic coronary angiography, to describe their clinical characteristics, management, and prognosis, and will propose a prognosis-oriented classification.
