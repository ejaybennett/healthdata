(secondQuint)Phase I-II Study in CD30 Positive Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Patients Refractory to First Line Chemotherapy or in First Relapse.

 Patients with primary refractory or relapse diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after R-CHOP have a dismal prognosis.

 Only 25% long term survivors are observed after salvage with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).

 CD30 expression is observed in 30% of refractory/relapse DLBCL.

 Monotherapy with brentuximab vedotin is effective in relapse CD30 positive DLBCL.

 The addition of brentuximab vedotin to R-DHAP might improve the prognosis of these patients.

 Treatment will consist of 3 cycles of brentuximab-vedotin in combination with R-DHAP.

 During the phase I part the recommended dose level for this combination will be established.

 Cycles will be given every 3 weeks.

 Responsive patients will be treated with BEAM followed by ASCT.

 Total treatment duration is approximately 16 weeks.

 Subsequently patients will be followed until 5 years after registration.

Patients with CD30 positive DLBCL, primary refractory or in first relapse after R-CHOP or R-CHOP-like therapy will receive brentuximab vedotin in combination with R-DHAP, followed in responsive patients by high dose chemotherapy and ASCT.
