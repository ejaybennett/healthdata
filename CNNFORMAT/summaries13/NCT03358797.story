(fifthQuint)Community-Based Lifestyle Intervention for Diabetes Prevention in Arab Women.

 The purpose of this study is to design, implement and evaluate a community based lifestyle intervention that integrates a leadership skills training for Palestinian women living in East Jerusalem.

 A pre-post study design will be utilized, where all community participants will be exposed to intervention components.

 The sample was selected from pre-existing groups in the local community center, based on their leadership potential (n=39).

 The Community-Based Lifestyle Intervention (CBLI) was developed by integrating leadership skill training to the gold standard Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).

 According to social cognitive theory, engaging in lay leadership can help maintain health behaviors by providing leaders with social support, behavioral reinforcement, outcome expectancies, reciprocal determinism, and building self-efficacy.

 Fostering social change and empowering individuals, mobilizing community members is also an effective, low cost method for widespread impact on health behavior and health outcomes within the members' community.

 This is particularly true for women and minority populations.

 All intervention components were adapted to the specific culture, language, gender, and religious sensitivities of Palestinian female society.

 The program will consist of 22 sessions presented by multiple professionals (nutritionists, exercise trainers, health coaches, and psychotherapists).

 Session content includes Mediterranean diet education, social support, food tasting and cooking, goal setting, self-monitoring, planning, conscious eating, leadership and lay leader training, initiative-taking, group dynamics, project design, community needs assessment, and project evaluation.

 The study is implemented in partnership with local community centers.

 It is hypothesized that Arab women who participate in this community intervention will have improved - and maintained- healthy eating behaviors (i.

e.

 Mediterranean Diet), reduced unhealthy eating behaviors (i.

e.

 Western diet), increased engagement in physical activity and reduced risk of obesity (weight, BMI).

 Community-Based Lifestyle Intervention for Diabetes Prevention in Arab Women@highlight

Arab women present increased risk for diabetes, with a 70% greater risk for adult-onset diabetes and a significantly younger age at onset compared with Jewish Israelis.

 In fact, the rate of diabetes for Arab women in Jerusalem is 4 times higher compared with their Jewish counterparts.

 Group lifestyle interventions such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) have documented effectiveness in preventing diabetes; however, many fail to demonstrate outcome maintenance.

 We predict that integrating leadership skills training into the gold standard DPP would improve the long-term outcome maintenance.

 A pre-post study design will be utilized, where all community participants will be exposed to intervention components.

 The sample was selected from pre-existing groups in the local community center, based on their leadership potential.
