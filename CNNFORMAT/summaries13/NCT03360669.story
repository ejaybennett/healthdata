(fifthQuint)Comparison of Blood Pressure Measurement With an Omron HEM-907 Device in a Clinical Setting and a Research Setting.

 Hypertension is a common condition, with an estimated prevalence around 20 percent in Canada.

 It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

 Recently, Hypertension Canada has updated its guidelines and recommend we should consider a 120 mm Hg systolic blood pressure target in high-risk patients aged 50 years or older.

 This recommendation derives mainly from the SPRINT trial.

 In this trial, blood pressure was measured with an automated oscillometric blood pressure (AOBP) device, the Omron HEM-907 (Omron Healthcare).

 However, it is not known if measurements performed with this device in a clinical setting are equivalent to those made in a research setting.

 Therefore, this randomized-controlled trial was designed.

 It aims to compare the blood pressure measurements of 70 patients in a clinical and a research setting.

 Patients will be randomized to a clinical/research or a research/clinical sequence.

 Comparison of Blood Pressure Measurement With an Omron HEM-907 Device in a Clinical Setting and a Research Setting@highlight

Automated office blood pressure (AOBP) devices are recommended for high blood pressure diagnosis.

 One of those devices is the Omron HEM-907 (Omron Healthcare).

 It is currently not known if blood pressure measurements performed with this device in a clinical setting are equivalent to those made in a research setting.

 Therefore, this randomized-controlled trial was designed.

 It aims to compare the blood pressure measurements performed in a clinical and a research setting.

 Seventy patients will be included and randomized to a clinical/research or research/clinical sequence.
