(thirdQuint)Volumetric Intensity Modulated Arc Therapy vs.

 Conventional Radiotherapy for Cancer Pain.

 Radiotherapy to painful sites of metastasis can provide pain relief.

 Side-effects from radiotherapy is dependent on the volume and dose received by normal tissues.

 Conventional radiotherapy techniques delivers similar doses of radiation to the targeted cancer lesion and the normal tissues along the entrance and exit paths of the radiation.

 Volumetric intensity-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is an advanced technique of radiotherapy that spares normal tissues from receiving high-dose irradiation.

 However, VMAT increases the volume of normal tissues receiving low-dose irradiation.

 This study aims at comparing the quality of life and side-effect profiles of patients treated by palliative radiotherapy using the conventional technique vs.

 VMAT.

 Volumetric Intensity Modulated Arc Therapy vs.

 Conventional Radiotherapy for Cancer Pain@highlight

This study compares the use of conventional radiotherapy technique with volumetric intensity-modulated radiotherapy (VMAT) in the treatment of painful cancer metastases.

 Half of the patients will receive radiotherapy using a conventional technique, while the other half will receive their treatment using a the VMAT technique.
