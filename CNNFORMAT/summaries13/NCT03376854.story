(fifthQuint)Pilot RCT of Therapeutic Hypothermia in ARDS Patients Receiving Neuromuscular Blockade.

 Background: Despite recent advances in supportive care for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mortality remains >40%.

 Fever worsens and hypothermia mitigates animal models of ALI.

 A small non-randomized controlled trial of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) in moribund patients with septic shock and ARDS showed improved survival (3 of 9 vs.

 0 of 10) in the TH group.

 However, the study preceded modern ARDS definition and management and mortality in both groups was much higher than current experience.

 Since oxygen utilization decreases ~10% per 1C reduction in core temperature, TH may reduce injury in part by allowing lower levels of assisted ventilation.

 TH likely exerts additional lung protective effects by directly modifying temperature-dependent cellular processes in endothelium, epithelium, and leukocytes.

 However, cooling in critically ill patients is complicated by shivering and its adverse metabolic consequences.

 Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) is increasingly used in patients with ARDS to facilitate low tidal volume ventilation and prone positioning and based on results of the ACURASYS trial.

 Since NMB is the ultimate anti-shivering treatment, such patients offer a convenient population for an initial study of TH in ARDS.

 A retrospective study of 58 ARDS patients treated with NMB showed that NMB alone does not cause hypothermia.

 An open-label study of 8 ARDS patients showed that studying TH in NMB-treated ARDS patients was feasible.

 In this study, the TH-treated patients had greater 28-day ventilator-free days (VFDs), ICU-free days (ICU-FDs) and hospital survival (75% vs.

 25%; p = 0.

027) than historical controls.

 Within the limits of historical comparisons, these results support further study of TH in ARDS.

 Focus of Study: The focus of the Cooling to Help Injured Lungs (CHILL) program is to test the central hypothesis that TH reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with ARDS in a Phase III randomized control trial (RCT).

 CHILL-RCT-pilot, a single-site Phase IIb RCT of TH vs usual temperature management in NMB-treated ARDS patients is the next step toward achieving this objective.

 CHILL-RCT-pilot has been started as a self-funded pilot with plans to transition to an NHLBI R33/61-funded phase contingent on grant funding.

 The data from the single-center study will provide additional data to support and plan a larger, more definitive multicenter Phase IIb or III trial.

 Primary and secondary objectives: The primary objective is to assess in an RCT whether mild TH is beneficial in patients with ARDS.

 The single-center pilot will provide information for planning a multicenter Phase IIb RCT TH vs.

 usual temperature management in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2:FIO2 (P/F) ratio-35C for 48h using surface cooling devices.

 As a prerequisite for randomization, all patients will receive deep sedation, continuous infusion of cisatracurium and mechanical ventilation for at least 48h.

 Decisions about transition to unassisted breathing, extubation, and transfer from ICU will be based on criteria in the CHILL study protocol.

 TH arm: Once sedation and NMB are confirmed, TH to 34-35C will be initiated using either cooling blankets or Arctic Sun Device based on availability.

 Temperature will be measured from a central probe.

 Once target temperature is reached, TH will be maintained for 48h.

 Patients will then be rewarmed to 35.

5C by 0.

3C/h and the cooling devices removed.

 Post-TH fever suppression is not part of the CHILL protocol.

 Following ~54h treatment period, patients will receive antipyretics and surface cooling or warming at the discretion of the primary ICU team.

 Early stopping rules for TH include: persistent severe bradycardia, uncontrolled bleeding, and intractable arrhythmias.

 Usual temperature management arm: Patients will receive sedation and NMB as described for the TH arm.

 During the 54h post-randomization/NMB treatment period, acetaminophen will be given for core temperature >38C and surface cooling will be initiated if core temperature remains >38C within 45 minutes of receiving acetaminophen and adjusted to maintain core temperature 38C.

 Patients in the usual temperature management arm with core temperature C will receive surface warming to restore core temperature to 37C.

 Following the 54h treatment period, patients will receive antipyretics and surface cooling or warming at the discretion of the primary ICU team.

 Concomitant Treatment: Since prone positioning independently improves survival in ARDS, starting and stopping rules for prone positioning have been protocolized.

 Primary and Secondary Endpoints: Primary endpoint: 28-day VFDs.

 Decisions about transition to unassisted breathing will be made based on criteria in the CHILL protocol.

 The 28-day VFDs will be calculated at day 28.

 Intermediate endpoint: The low and high core temperatures in each 2-hour period will be recorded and the mean core temperature for each of the first four study days will be calculated.

 Secondary endpoints: Clinical: (a) 28-day ICU-FDs: Decisions about transfer out of the ICU will be made based on criteria in the CHILL protocol.

 The 28-day ICU-FDs will be calculated at day 28 and recorded on the Day 28 case report form (CRF); (b) day 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 non-neurologic SOFA score; (c) Glasgow coma score at hospital discharge; (d) 60- and 90-day survival; (e) 60- and 90-day functional status.

 Pilot RCT of Therapeutic Hypothermia in ARDS Patients Receiving Neuromuscular Blockade@highlight

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a serious condition that occurs as a complication of medical and surgical diseases, has a mortality of ~40%, and has no known treatment other than optimization of support.

 Data from basic research, animal models, and retrospective studies, case series, and small prospective studies suggest that therapeutic hypothermia (TH) similar to that used for cardiac arrest may be lung protective in patients with ARDS; however, shivering and its metabolic impact is a major complication of TH, often requiring neuromuscular blockade (NMB) to control.

 NMB has now become part of standard of care for patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

 Since many of these patients are already receiving the ultimate anti-shivering therapy, the investigators reasoned that such patients would provide an ideal population for an RCT of TH in ARDS.

 The investigators have completed a retrospective study of patients with ARDS on NMB and an open label pilot study of TH in 8 such patients that demonstrated feasibility and safety of performing such an RCT.

 Furthermore, a comparison of the subjects in the open-label study with the historical controls from the retrospective study suggested that TH will be beneficial in patients with ARDS.

 To generate further support for grant applications to support a Phase IIb multicenter RCT, the investigators plan on performing a small pilot single center RCT of TH (core temperature 34-35C) for 48h vs.

 standard of care in patients with ARDS who are receiving NMB.

 Primary outcome will be 28 day ventilator-free days and secondary outcomes will include physiologic measures, mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay, and serum biomarkers collected on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.
