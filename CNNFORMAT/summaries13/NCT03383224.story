(fifthQuint)PRISM-GENOMICS-Smoking Cessation for Patients With Coronary Artery Disease Undergoing Cardiac Catheterization or Having a Heart Attack at Barnes Hospital in St.

 In this study, the investigators propose to show the feasibility of incorporating genotype-guided therapy into post-MI smoking cessation therapy and/or smoking cessation therapy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) using the CHRNA5 rs16969968 variant as the pilot case.

 The investigators propose to genotype 1/2 of PRISM-GENOMICs patients who are active smokers within 48 hours of admission and to guide their smoking cessation therapy based on CHRNA5 rs16969968 genotype (A allele carriers will be given pharmacologic therapy and GG homozygotes will be given counseling).

 The investigators will use the other 1/2 as controls.

 The participants will be followed and the investigators will test whether the genotype-guided group has better rates of smoking cessation compared to the control group.

 This pilot study will lay the foundation for personalized, genotype-guided, post-MI therapy and/or therapy in patients with CAD.

It has previously been shown that patients with coronary artery disease may have a harder time quitting smoking if they have a specific genetic profile and that these individuals have a better chance at quitting if they receive nicotine replacement therapy.

 The investigators hypothesize that determining which individuals with coronary artery disease should receive nicotine replacement therapy based on their genotype may improve the number of individuals who are able to quit smoking.

This study randomizes treatment to that determined by the patient's genotype compared to standard, non-genotype-guided, treatment.
