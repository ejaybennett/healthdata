(secondQuint)Effect of Exercise and Omega-3 on Metabolic Health in Elderly.

 Aging is associated with development of disturbances of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and with systemic pro-inflammatory state similarly to the alterations observed in obese individuals.

 Metabolic and immune dysfunction of adipose tissue has been suggested as an important contributing trigger to this condition.

 EXODYA project is a clinical study in elderly individuals that aims to establish benefits of lifestyle intervention and nutritional supplementation -either alone or in combination- for the amelioration of systemic and adipose tissue metabolic and immune disturbances.

 Effects of 4 months intervention with combined aerobic plus resistive exercise training and supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on systemic metabolic profile and molecular characteristics of adipose tissue will be investigated in elderly women.

 Thus, a proof-of-concept will be provided for novel recommendations and guidelines for lifestyle interventions in elderly population.

 Effect of Exercise and Omega-3 on Metabolic Health in Elderly@highlight

The aim of this project is to investigate in elderly women, the effect of combined aerobic and resistive training and concomitant supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids on adipogenesis, metabolic functions and pro-inflammatory status of adipose tissue and on systemic metabolic profile.
