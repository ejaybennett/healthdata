(secondQuint)Laparoscopic Guided Transversus Abdominis Plane Block for Postoperative Analgesia After Pediatric Laparoscopic Surgery.

.

 Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a promising effective method for postoperative pain control after major abdominal surgery.

 TAP block provides analgesia by inhibiting nerve conduction from the anterior abdominal wall arising from the intercostal nerves, subcostal nerves, and first lumbar nerve (T6-L1).

 Using a landmark technique, it is easily performed, but its popularity has decreased because of reduced efficacy due to inaccurate injection and the potential for intra-peritoneal organ damage.

 Ultrasound-guided TAP block provides better results and fewer complications, but it requires experienced operators.

 Surgically administered TAP (sTAP) block guided by the video camera of the laparoscope is a simple technique and may cause no complications.

 Also, under laparoscopic guidance, block of ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genitofemoral nerves can be possible with anesthetic injection in the plane between psoas major and the fasciae covering its anterior aspects [laparoscopic-assisted psoas (LAP) blockade].

The aim of this study will be to investigate the safety and analgesic efficacy of Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAB) Block versus psoas block blockade.

 Both blocks will be administered surgically and guided by the laparoscopy screen in children undergoing laparoscopic surgery.
