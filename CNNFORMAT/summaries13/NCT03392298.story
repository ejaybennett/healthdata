(fifthQuint)Study on the Mechanism of Colla Corri Asini in the Treatment of Thalassemia Patients With Pregnancy Anemia.

 Thalassemia is a type of hemolytic anemia disease caused by genetic defect of synthesis in one or more globin chains.

 Among all the single genetic disorders, thalassemia has the highest incidence rate in the world and causes heavy burdens on public health system.

 In China, the southern provinces suffer from high incidence of thalassemia, which is particularly common in the population of Guangdong, Guangxi and Yunnan provinces.

 Epidemiological studies showed that in Guangdong alone about 17.

83 % of the 14,332 pregnant women across 21 regions examined were diagnosed as carriers of thalassemia.

 Recent studies showed that after pregnancy, anemia in -thalassemia patients tends to turn more serious, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes accordingly increase.

 Currently, no consensus has been reached in treating pregnant thalassemia patients due to lack of safe and effective treatment.

 Regulation of globin gene expression is the key link of -thalassemia treatment, but the accessible western medicines have many limitations, including bone marrow suppression, carcinogenicity and teratogenicity, and are not suitable for pregnant patients.

 In China, Colla corii asini (CCA, E'jiao) is a gelatin-like traditional Chinese medicine refined from donkey hide and has been widely used in clinical antanemic therapy for more than 2000 years.

 In the last decade, many studies had addressed the effect of CCA on the anemia using modern pharmacological approaches.

 The results indicated that CCA contains collagen protein,glycogen and a variety of trace elements, a variety of amino acids, etc.

 the main components of CCA can promote hematopoiesis by a number of mechanisms which eventually increase the peripheral erythrocyte counts and Hb concentration.

 Therefore, the investigators proposed that the hematopoietic effects of CCA might also contribute to the treatment of thalassemia with insuffcient or abnormal Hb concentration.

 Our previous clinical study showed that CCA can significantly increase the level of hemoglobin and adult hemoglobin (HbA,22) in the pregnant women with -thalassemia, it was speculated that CCA might induce globin gene expression, which would be more beneficial to pregnant women than the globin gene inducer.

 But its regulatory pathway is not clear.

 This study is designed to explore the pathways and targets of regulating globin expression by using the transcriptomics method, which might be related to CCA treating pregnant anemia in -thalassemia patients.

 And then the results of transcriptomics study will be further verified by expanding the clinical samples and implementing cell experiments, aiming to explore the mechanisms of CCA in treating -thalassemia with pregnant anemia by regulating globin expression.

 Study on the Mechanism of Colla Corri Asini in the Treatment of Thalassemia Patients With Pregnancy Anemia@highlight

This study aims to explore the pathways and targets of regulating globin expression, which might be related to Colla corii asini (CCA, E'jiao) treating anemia in pregnant women with -thalassemia.

 Firstly, ten pregnant patients who meet inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group or control group in a 1: 1 ratio.

 The patients in the treatment group will be given 15 g of CCA daily for 4 weeks and followed up, while the control group will be treated with nothing and followed up in the same period.

 The transcriptional test and bioinformatics analysis would be conducted to detect and determine the potential pathways and targets of regulating globin expression before and after the treatment.

 Secondly, sixty pregnant patients who meet inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group or control group in a 2: 1 ratio.

 The treatment group and control group respectively received the same treatment and follow-up regimen as the transcriptional study mentioned above.

 According to the results of the transcriptional study, the target gene signaling pathway molecules, Hb concentration, and the levels of -,-,- and -globin will be detected and compared.
