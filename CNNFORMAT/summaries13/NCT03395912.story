(fifthQuint)Wound Infiltration With Bupivacaine/Adrenalin During Cesarean Section and Postoperative Pain.

.

 Cesarean section is one of the most common procedures in the world.

 There is an advantage in preventing pain after cesarean section, as opposed to treating pain that has already started.

 The infiltration of surgical wounds by local anesthetics is accepted as an effective method for preventing pain after various operations.

 In this study women who are admitted for a cesarean section will be randomly allocated into 2 groups.

 In the study group after the closure of the fascia above the rectus muscles, and before closing the skin, both sides of the incision (top and bottom) will be infiltrated by 30 ml of 0.

25% BUPIVACAINE and ADRENALIN at 1: 200,000 concentration and then closing the skin.

 In the control group, the skin will be closed without infiltration.

 Wound Infiltration With Bupivacaine/Adrenalin During Cesarean Section and Postoperative Pain.

@highlight

Thus study evaluates the advantage of infiltration of the surgical wound by local anesthetics in cesarean section on post operative pain relief.

 In the study group before closing the skin, both sides of the incision (top and bottom) will be infiltrated by 30 ml of 0.

25% BUPIVACAINE and ADRENALIN at 1: 200,000 concentration and then closing the skin.

 In the control group, the skin will be closed without infiltration.

 Our hypothesis is that subcutaneous infiltration of the surgical wound by BUPIVACAINE + ADRENALIN at the end of cesarean section will reduce the intensity of post operative pain.
