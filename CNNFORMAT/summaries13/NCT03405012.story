(fifthQuint)Regional Bone Turnover Using 18F-fluoride-PET/CT in HIV-1-infected Men: PETRAM Study.

 Study Design: This is an observational, open-label, non-randomised, single centre, 48-week study to explore the utility of a novel scanning platform exploring bone turnover during an immediate or deferred (for 48 weeks) switch from Eviplera(R) to Odefsey(R) in HIV-1 infected men aged 40 years or older, and stable on Eviplera(R).

 Participants: HIV-1-infected males, aged 40 years, on Eviplera(R) >24 weeks, with plasma HIV RNA (pVL) 40, stable on Eviplera(R) (rilpivirine (RPV)/emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)) and remaining on EvipleraO for 48 weeks on study; 2.

 HIV-1-infected males aged 40 years, switched to Odefsey(R) (RPV/FTC/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)) at study enrollment.

 Study Hypothesis: We hypothesis that there will be ongoing subclinical loss of bone at the hip and lumbar spine as measured by 18F-fluoride-PET/CT in those remaining of Eviplera(R), and in those switching to Odefsey(R) there will be reversal of some of this subclinical loss at 24 and 48 weeks post switch.

 Primary Outcome Measure(s):To determine the change in regional bone formation at the hip and lumbar spine as measured by 18F-fluoride-PET/CT at 24 weeks post switch from Eviplera(R) to Odefsey(R).

 Secondary Outcome Measure(s): 1.

 To determine the change in regional bone formation at the hip and lumbar spine as measured by 18F-fluoride-PET/CT at 48 weeks post switch from Eviplera(R) to Odefsey(R); 2.

 To determine the safety and tolerability of switching to Odefsey(R); 3.

 To compare DXA changes at the hip and lumbar spine to those detected on 18F-fluoride-PET/CT; 4.

 To determine the changes in plasma/serum bone biomarkers over 24 and 48 weeks; 5.

 To determine the changes in FRAX(R) score at week 48.

 Regional Bone Turnover Using 18F-fluoride-PET/CT in HIV-1-infected Men: PETRAM Study@highlight

This is a 48 week study to explore the pathogenesis of HIV treatment related bone disease by using a novel imaging technique, 18F-Fluoride Positron Emission Tomography (18F-PET/CT), which measures regional bone formation.

 The study will include other standard methods (serum bone markers and DXA) for comparison.

 Patients enrolled will have baseline, week 24 and week 48 assessment, with baseline being the date of replacing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in their HIV treatment regimen with tenofavir alafenamide fumarate (TAF), compared to a control group continuing TDF.

 Allocation to change to TAF or continue TDF will be randomised to allow an unbiased assessment of bone changes.
