(fifthQuint)Lesion Detection in Cirrhotic Patients With Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound and the Accuracy of Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Li-RADS for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Diagnosis.

 If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, within 2 weeks after your routine care MRI scan, you will have a standard ultrasound performed on your abdomen without using a contrast agent.

 This involves placing some ultrasound gel directly on the skin and moving a transducer (probe) over the surface of your abdomen, as you lie (usually face-up) on an examination table.

 You will then have another ultrasound performed in the same way.

 However, before this ultrasound, the contrast agent Lumason will be injected into your vein in your arm.

 The 2 ultrasounds will take about an hour to complete.

 As part of this study, some of the information from your medical record will also be collected as needed.

 The information from your medical record and the images from the 3 scans (the routine MRI and the 2 ultrasounds) will be stored in a research database indefinitely.

 Your data will be given a code number.

 No identifying information will be directly linked to your data.

 Only the researchers in charge of the database will have access to the code numbers and be able to link the data to you.

 This is to allow medical data related to the data to be updated as needed.

 Length of Study: Your participation on this study will be over after the 2 ultrasounds.

 Your primary care team will follow up with you, according to standard care.

 Lesion Detection in Cirrhotic Patients With Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound and the Accuracy of Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Li-RADS for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Diagnosis@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if ultrasound scans using a contrast agent called Lumason (sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres) can help doctors more easily find liver lesions (including hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]), compared to ultrasounds without contrast agent.

 Contrast agents are drugs that are injected into a vein in order to help certain organs and tissues show up more clearly on scans.

 Researchers will also compare the effectiveness of liver ultrasounds using Lumason versus standard MRI imaging, in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.

 This is an investigational study.

 Ultrasound and MRI scans on this study are performed using FDA-approved and commercially available methods.

 Up to 150 patients will be enrolled on this research study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
