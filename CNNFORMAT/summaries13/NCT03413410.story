(secondQuint)A Multi-Center Study on the Metoprolol Optimal Dosing Pathway of Metoprolol Application in Chinese Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome.

 Acute coronary syndrome(ACS) is one of the main manifestations of cardiovascular disease and one of the main causes for hospitalization in adults.

 Previous studies showed that -receptor blockers can reduce ACS patients' cardiovascular risk in both acute phase and secondary prevention.

 We summarized the metoprolol optimal dosing pathway based on Chinese and foreign guidelines as well as Chinese clinical practice.

 Primary endpoint is the percentage of patients achieving target dose at time of discharge.

 Secondary endpoints are the mean HR & BP at discharge and during the follow up period of the Patients who have achieved target dose at discharge.

 A Multi-Center Study on the Metoprolol Optimal Dosing Pathway of Metoprolol Application in Chinese Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome@highlight

This study is to test the feasibility and tolerability of the metoprolol optimal dosing pathway by observing the percentage of patients achieving target dose followed the pathway on ACS patients during hospitalization.
