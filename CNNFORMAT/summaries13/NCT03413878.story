(secondQuint)Snow Properties and Its Modeling for Studying Gas Exchange Under the Simulated Avalanche Snow.

 The study is a part of a university research project aimed at studying physiological conditions and development of breathing parameters of a person breathing in the simulated avalanche snow.

 Presence of an air pocket and its size play an important role in survival of victims buried in the avalanche snow.

 Even small air pockets facilitate breathing, yet they do not provide a significant amount of fresh air for breathing.

 The investigators hypothesize that the size of the air pocket significantly affects the airflow resistance and work of breathing.

 The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of the air pocket volume on gas exchange and work of breathing in subjects breathing into the simulated avalanche snow.

The aim of the study is to investigate respiratory parameters of a person in the simulated avalanche snow and consequent use of the measured data for development of a mathematical-physical model of breathing during increasing hypercapnia in the avalanche.
