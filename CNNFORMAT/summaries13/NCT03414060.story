(thirdQuint)Feasibility of the Menstrual Cup for VVF.

 Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) is a debilitating maternal morbidity that largely results from complications of prolonged, obstructed labor when the trapped fetal head applies direct pressure to pelvic/vaginal tissues and causes widespread ischemia, tissue necrosis, and subsequent extensive fistula formation.

 Women living with VVF, the most common anatomical presentation of obstetric fistula, experience urinary incontinence which causes discomfort, malodor, and skin infection, as well as social and psychological consequences that increase their vulnerability to the negative effects of stigma and reduce their quality of life.

 Traditional management requires surgical repair; however, many women either do not have access to surgery, or access is delayed due to various individual, social, or structural barriers.

 Non-surgical management, previously explored with non-invasive techniques for residual urinary incontinence, has been under-examined for fistula-related urinary incontinence.

 The menstrual cup may be a useful option for non-surgical management of obstetric fistula.

 Clinical and programmatic reports suggest a potential translation of the menstrual cup for collection or control of urine leakage in women with VVF; however, evidence has not been collected and examined systematically within a population in an endemic setting.

 While surgical management of fistula remains the gold standard in treatment, research on non-surgical therapies is necessary.

Therefore, this study aims to assess the feasibility (including efficacy, safety, and acceptability among users) of using the menstrual cup over a short period among women seeking care for VVF in a clinical setting and, unlike prior reports, includes standardized measures of leakage and prioritizes user perspectives.

 A repeated measures design compared volume of leakage with the and without the cup to baseline leakage via a 2-hr pad test among women with VVF seeking surgical repair at a health facility in Ghana.

 A questionnaire was later administered followed by a physical exam.

 A paired t-test was used to analyze effect.

 Feasibility of the Menstrual Cup for VVF@highlight

This study examines the feasibility and acceptability of the vaginal menstrual cup for short-term management of vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) among 11 women seeking treatment at a health facility in Ghana.

 The repeated measures design utilizes a 2-hr pad test to compare urinary leakage with and without the insertable cup, a questionnaire on acceptability and perceived effect is administered and a clinical exam is completed.
