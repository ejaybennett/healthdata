(fifthQuint)Mobile Tablet Education to Advance Caregiver Health.

 The proposed project studies the effects of an education and skill-building rehabilitation intervention, designed to be low-cost and clinically translatable through mobile media devices (i.

e.

, tablets), on family caregivers of Veterans with dementia.

 Intervention effects will be examined longitudinally at baseline and 3 months post-intervention.

 Advanced statistical techniques will be used to determine the impact of the intervention on: quality of life in caregivers of Veterans with dementia (Aim 1), perceived stress and depressive symptoms in caregivers (Aim 2), and socialization and engagement in pleasant activities in caregivers (Aim 3).

 If this rehabilitative intervention proves successful, it may represent an approach to Veteran- and family-centered dementia care that can be used throughout VA with low staff, resource, and cost burdens.

To address the high burden of caring for a Veteran with dementia, the investigators propose to study the effect of a low-cost, rehabilitative intervention for family caregivers of Veterans with dementia.

 The investigators' novel approach will use mobile media technology that can reach caregivers in rural areas who do not have easy access to major VA medical centers.

 If this rehabilitative intervention proves successful, it may represent an approach to Veteran and family-centered dementia care that can be used throughout VA with low staff, resource, and cost burdens.
