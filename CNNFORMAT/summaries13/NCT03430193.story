(fifthQuint)Fragility Fracture Integrated Rehabilitation Management (FIRM).

 The purpose of this prospective study To develop a standardized fragility fracture integrated rehabilitation management (FIRM) based on the critical rehabilitation pathway for fragility fractures.

 1.

 Standardization of initial evaluation for fall and re-fracture risks before rehabilitation 2.

 Standardization in initial screening for prevention for common complication after fracture and early diagnosis 3.

 Evidence based standardization in rehabilitation after fragility fracture 4.

 Development for safe return to normal daily life.

 Fragility Fracture Integrated Rehabilitation Management (FIRM)@highlight

A number of studies for clinical pathway (CP) after hip fracture have been suggested to improve post-fracture outcome.

 However, CP is not carried out properly in most countries due to inadequate system and awareness, and lack of interdisciplinary approach among orthopaedists, geriatricians and rehabilitation specialists.

 Thus, we developed Fragility fracture integrated rehabilitation management (FIRM), a new standardized guideline and the multidisciplinary fragility fracture care based on the clinical rehabilitation pathway and conducted a prospective study to evaluate the effects of FIRM compared to conventional rehabilitation.
