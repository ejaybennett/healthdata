(thirdQuint)Nalbuphine as an Adjuvant to Local Anaesthetic Mixture in Peribulbar Cataract Surgery.

 44 patients (22 in each group) scheduled for elective cataract surgery using peribulbar block.

 Patients of Group N received local anesthetics received 6 ml of 0.

5% bupivacaine 1 ml hyaluronidase (75 IU), and 4mg of Nalbuphine in 1 ml of saline (total 8 ml) and patients of Group C received 6 ml of 0.

5% bupivacaine, 1 ml hyaluronidase (75 IU) and1 ml saline (total 8 ml).

 Addition of nalbuphine to bupivacaine in peribulbar block is associated with reduced the time of onset of globe akinesia, increased the duration of globe akinesia and analgesia with better postoperative pain relief.

 Nalbuphine as an Adjuvant to Local Anaesthetic Mixture in Peribulbar Cataract Surgery@highlight

Nalbuphine has been used as an adjuvant to bupivacaine in intrathecal, epidural, caudal anesthesia and peripheral nerve blocks showing an increase in the efficacy and the duration of postoperative analgesia.

The aim of this study is evaluation of the effect of nalbuphine when used as an adjuvant to a local anesthetic mixture in peribulbar block undergoing cataract surgery
