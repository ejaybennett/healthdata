(fifthQuint)Feasibility of a Mobile Application to Support Reflection and Dialog About Strengths in People With Chronic Illness.

 In this pre-post design pilot study participants will be recruited from two settings:1) self-management courses and 2) an outpatient rehabilitation unit for people with rheumatic diseases.

 In setting 1, before using the application participants will be asked to report their strengths in a written format.

 After using the mobile application to reflect on their strengths the participants will be interviewed about their experience of using the application and on the task of reflecting on their strengths.

 They will also be asked to fill out a questionnaire on perceived usefulness and user-friendliness.

 Before and after using the application the participants fill out questionnaires on emotions (Positive and Negative Affective Scale) and self-efficacy (The Arthritis Self-efficacy Scale).

 In setting 2, participants will be asked to use the application to reflect on their strengths and to use the summary of their strengths (from the the application) in a consultation with one of their care provider at the unit.

 The consultation will be audio-taped and analysed with a qualitative approach.

 As in setting 1, participants will also be asked to fill out a questionnaire on perceived usefulness and user-friendliness of the application.

 Before and after the consultation the participants fill out questionnaires on emotions (Positive and Negative Affective Scale) and self-efficacy (The Arthritis Self-efficacy Scale).

 The patients and health care providers will be interviewed about the experience of using the application and the summary of strengths in the consultation.

 All interviews will be audio-taped and analyzed with a qualitative approach.

 Descriptive analysis will be applied for quantitative data.

 Feasibility of a Mobile Application to Support Reflection and Dialog About Strengths in People With Chronic Illness@highlight

Self-management of chronic illness can be highly demanding and people need to mobilize their personal strengths in order to live well with their condition.

 A mobile application was designed in collaboration with people with chronic illness and health care providers with the aims to support awareness of patients' strengths and patient-provider dialogues that include strengths.

 The aim of the present study is to evaluate with mixed methods the perceived usefulness and usability of the application and potential effects of the application on patients and patient-health care provider communication on strengths.
