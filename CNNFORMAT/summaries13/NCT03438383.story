(secondQuint)Bi-PAP vs Sham Bi-PAP on Pulmonary Function in Morbidly Obese Patients After Bariatric Surgery.

 In the present study the effect of Bi-PAP on the postoperative respiratory function and related complications of MOP undergoing OBS through a randomized sham-controlled design was investigated.

 Bi-PAP was applied at individualized pressures in order to optimize respiratory support and sham Bi-PAP was also used in order to neutralize possible placebo device related effect and researcher related bias.

 The investigators hypothesized that the use of Bi-PAP at individualized pressures in MOP undergoing OBS, ameliorates postoperative respiratory function as well as diminishes related pulmonary complications, postoperative pain and duration of hospitalization.

 Primary endpoints were the difference in pre- and postoperative measurements of certain pulmonary function parameters (FEV1, FVC, PEFR and SpO2) and the incidence of certain pulmonary complications postoperatively (hypoxemia, atelectasis, lower respiratory tract infections).

 Secondary endpoints were postoperative pain and days of hospitalization.

The effect of Bi-PAP at individualized pressures on the postoperative pulmonary recovery of morbidly obese patients (MOP) undergoing open bariatric surgery (OBS) and possible placebo device-related effects (sham-Bi-PAP) were investigated.
