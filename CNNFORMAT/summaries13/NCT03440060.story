(thirdQuint)Procalcitonin-guided Antibiotic Therapy During Severe Acute Exacerbation of COPD.

 Recently, procalcitonin gained interest as the most reliable biomarker in predicting bacterial origin in low respiratory tract infections and sepsis.

 Procalcitonin was shown to be non-inferior to standard guidelines in guiding antibiotic therapy during COPD exacerbation, without worsening patients' outcomes, and with a significant reduction in antibiotic exposure.

 Its use to guide antibiotic treatment during COPD exacerbation may be more challenging because of the frequent colonization of the airways in patients with COPD, and thus it needs further evaluation.

 Additionally, until today, no interventional studies evaluating procalcitonin protocol have been conducted in ventilated COPD patients.

 Procalcitonin-guided Antibiotic Therapy During Severe Acute Exacerbation of COPD@highlight

This study assess whether a procalcitonin guided antibiotic therapy can reduce significantly unnecessary antibiotic prescription during severe exacerbation of COPD requiring mechanical ventilation without compromising patients' outcome.

 The first group of patients will receive systematically empiric antibiotic therapy and the second group will receive antibiotics only if procalcitonin value is at or greater than 0.
