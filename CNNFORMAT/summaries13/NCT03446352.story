(fifthQuint)Multimodal Exercise Programs for Falls Prevention: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

 Aging is associated with a decline in executive functions, negatively influencing the motor, social and emotional capacities of older adults.

 (1) These losses will contribute to increase the risk of falling, so much that most falls occur during the performance of a dual-task (DT) (2).

 The lack of balance, strength and poor body composition are seen as causes of falls, and should therefore be considered in the prevention programs of these events in older adults.

 (3-5) A psychomotor exercise program uses the body and movement as mediators, relying on the prevention of cognitive, sensory, perceptive, emotional and affective deterioration, exploring the neuroplasticity.

 (6,7) Therefore, this sensorimotor and neurocognitive program may prevent falls, but it is important to analyze its real impact in reducing either falls or the risk factors for falls in the older adults.

 No studies focusing on this subject were found.

 The intervention through the whole body vibration (WBV) is referred in the literature as promoting the improvement of balance, mobility and agility, and preventing falls in the older adults.

(8,9) WBV will have long-term therapeutic effects promoting the increase of muscle strength and increased bone mineral density.

 (10) Being two intervention methods with potential good results on falls prevention, it is not known whether there will be additional benefits in an intervention that combines both methods.

 Multimodal Exercise Programs for Falls Prevention: A Randomized Controlled Trial@highlight

The aim of present study is to analyze and compare the effect of two exercise programs - psychomotor exercise program vs exercise combined program (psychomotor + whole body vibration) - on risk factors for falls and falls occurrence of community-dwelling older adults who are fallers or are "at high risk of falling".

 This experimental study is a randomized controlled trial.

 The program will run for 16 weeks (3 sessions / week of 75 minutes), followed by 8 weeks of follow-up without intervention.

 Participants will be assessed 1) at baseline, 2) at the end of the program, and 3) after the follow-up.

 Participants will be randomly allocated to three groups: experimental group 1 (psychomotor program); experimental group 2 (combined program) and control group.
