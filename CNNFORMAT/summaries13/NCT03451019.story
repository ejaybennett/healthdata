(secondQuint)Different Effects of Non-calcium Phosphate Binders on Serum Calcium.

 Recent experimental studies have shown that a non-calcium based phosphate binder sevelamer hydrochloride can increase intestinal calcium absorption in contrast to lanthanum carbonate.

 It is unknown whether such the difference may have an effect on bone metabolism and/or modify the development of vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease.

 The aim of the study was to compare the effect of a single dose of 1000 mg of lanthanum carbonate with 2,4 mg of sevelamer hydrochloride on serum and urine calcium following an oral load of 5 g of calcium carbonate given with a meal with standardized phosphate content.

Sevelamer hydrochloride (SE) can increase intestinal calcium absorption in contrast to lanthanum carbonate (LA).

 Study compared effect of LA and SE on serum and urine phosphate and calcium, and hormones regulating mineral-bone metabolism.
