(secondQuint)Quality of Perioperative Invasive Ventilation in PICU.

 20 neonates and infants undergoing elective surgery and requiring postoperative treatment and follow up in PICU will be included in this prospective observational study.

 Swisstom BB2-monitor and NeoSensorBelts will be used to monitor their ventilatory care from arrival to the operation room (prior intubation) to postoperative intensive care (until 2 hours after extubation).

 EIT parameters assessing lung aeration and ventilation distribution will be used to assess the quality of invasive ventilation.

 Quality of Perioperative Invasive Ventilation in PICU@highlight

This is purely observational study in which quality of invasive ventilation is observed with electrical impedance tomography (EIT) during perioperative intensive care.

 EIT parameters will be used to assess if protective ventilation strategies are successfully followed during routine care.
