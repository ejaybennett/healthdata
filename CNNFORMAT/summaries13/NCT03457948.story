(fifthQuint)Pembrolizumab and Liver-Directed Therapy in Treating Patients With Well-Differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumors and Symptomatic and/or Progressive Liver Metastases.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the best observed overall response rate (ORR) in lesion(s) not targeted for liver-directed therapy (abscopal effect) to pembrolizumab plus liver-directed therapy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.

1 for patients with metastatic well-differentiated (World Heath Organization [WHO] grade 1 or 2) neuroendocrine tumors (WD-NETs).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with liver-directed therapies in this patient population.

 II.

 To evaluate duration of response (DOR) in patients receiving pembrolizumab in combination with liver-directed therapies.

 III.

 To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in subjects treated with pembrolizumab in combination with liver-directed therapies.

 IV.

 Best observed radiographic ORR per modified RECIST (mRECIST) in lesions targeted for liver-directed therapy.

 V.

 Duration of response in lesions targeted for liver-directed therapy by mRECIST.

 OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 groups.

 GROUP I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients with up to 6 liver lesions, largest being no larger than 4 cm who have < 25% liver parenchyma replacement by tumors, undergo computed tomography (CT)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) over 2-3 hours, 3-7 days following the first dose of pembrolizumab.

 GROUP II: Patients receive pembrolizumab as in Group I.

 Patients with any number of liver lesions, largest being no larger than 5 cm, who have < 75% liver parenchyma replacement by tumors, undergo transarterial embolization (TAE) over 2-3 hours, 3-7 days following the first dose of pembrolizumab.

 GROUP III: Patients receive pembrolizumab as in Group I.

 Patients with any number of liver lesions, largest measuring more than 5 cm, who have < 75% liver parenchyma replacement by tumors, undergo yttrium-90 microsphere radioembolization (RE) 3-15 days following the first dose of pembrolizumab.

 GROUP IV: Patients receive pembrolizumab as in Group I.

 Patients with up to 6 liver lesions, largest being no larger than 4 cm who have < 25% liver parenchyma replacement by tumors, undergo CT-guided cryoablation over 2-3 hours, 3-7 days following the first dose of pembrolizumab.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6 months thereafter.

 Pembrolizumab and Liver-Directed Therapy in Treating Patients With Well-Differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumors and Symptomatic and/or Progressive Liver Metastases@highlight

This pilot phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and liver-directed therapy works in treating patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and symptomatic and/or progressive tumors that have spread to the liver.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

 Liver-directed therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, transarterial embolization, yttrium-90 microsphere radioembolization, and cryoablation may help to shrink tumors that are not being directly targeted.

 Giving pembrolizumab and liver-directed therapy may work better in treating patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and symptomatic and/or progressive tumors that have spread to the liver.
