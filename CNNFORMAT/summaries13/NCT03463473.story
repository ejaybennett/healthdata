 This is a first-in-human (FIH), open-label, Phase 1 dose-Escalation Study of MSB2311, a humanized anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

 Qualified subjects will be enrolled to receive their assigned dose regimen of MSB2311 until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever occurs first.

 The maximum treatment duration is 2 years.

 During the study, subjects will be evaluated for safety and toxicity, PK/PD, immunogenicity, biomarkers, and anti-tumor activity of MSB2311.
