(thirdQuint)Adipose-Derived Stem Cell Injections for Knee Osteoarthritis.

 This study will be a randomized controlled trial to compare outcomes between intra-articular injection of ADSC+PRP and intra-articular injection of corticosteroid in patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee.

 ADSC will be harvested at the subcutaneous tissue by lipoaspiration.

 Once fat tissue is obtained, it will be processed with minimal manipulation (Adiprep) in the clinic room.

 PRP is prepped from the peripheral blood.

 Up to 30 ml of peripheral blood is drawn from the peripheral blood vessel then it is transferred to the tube for centrifugation to yield a platelet-rich plasma layer.

 This process is expected to take up to 1 hour.

 To be considered for participation in this study, patients must have radiographic evidence of mild to moderate osteoarthritis of medial and/or lateral weight-bearing compartments (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 2 or 3).

 In addition, patients must meet several inclusion/exclusion criteria to be randomized and included in this study.

 Adipose-Derived Stem Cell Injections for Knee Osteoarthritis@highlight

This is a non-surgical trial comparing the clinical and functional outcomes of patients with osteoarthritis treated with Intra-articular injection of autologous Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (ADSC) combined with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) versus conventional therapy of Intra-articular injection of corticosteroid.
