(firstQuint)Goal Directed Therapy Aiming to Optimise Oxygen Central Venous Saturation in Children Undergoing Cardiac Surgery.

 Pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk for adverse clinical outcomes due a inadequate tissue perfusion.

 Recent studies have been demonstraded which the monitorization of continuos central venous saturation could be benneficial.

 There is evidence that monitoring continues venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) can be beneficial in patient outcomes, guided by ScvO2 therapy has been associated with improved outcomes in resuscitation of critically ill patients with sepsis and after congenital heart surgery complexa.

 The early detection and treatment of tissue hypoxia can prevent morbidity and mortality.

 tissue hypoxia may be a result of the imbalance between supply (DO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2).

 If the fault supply, oxygen consumption is maintained by increased oxygen extraction resulting in decreased central venous oxygen saturation.

The purpose of this study is evaluate goal-directed therapy with continuous central venous saturation compared to standard therapy in children undergoing cardiac surgery.
