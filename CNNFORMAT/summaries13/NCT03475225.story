(fifthQuint)Vitamine D in Drug Resistant Epilepsy.

 The goal of this study is to establish the effect of the compensation of vitamin D deficiency in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy with a high level of evidence in a large population.

 For that, the investigator aim to perform a controlled multicentre prospective double-blind randomized study in 400 patients.

 Experimental design After a reference period for the collection of clinical data and seizure frequency, all eligible patients will undergo biological analyses including serum vitamin D levels, calcium, creatinine and albumin.

 In case of proven deficiency (25(OH)D 10 and 100ng/mL and/or serum calcium levels >2.

70mmol/l; if the serum calcium is >2.

60 and 2.

60mmol/L.

 Vitamine D treatment will be stopped also if creatinine is >2001/2mol/L.

 Vitamin D causes no known drug interactions.

 However its metabolism is accelerated when combined with enzyme-inducing drugs, including antiepileptic drugs.

 The entire treatment will be provided to each patient using a kit of 5 doses of UVEDOSE after randomization in the experimental group and the unblinding in the control group according to the protocol established.

 The treatment scheme will be clearly explained and dates of treatment indicated on the attached schedule.

 Maintenance therapy will be provided on the same terms.

 Patients will note on this calendar the effective date of each dose and bring empty containers during the visit at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.

 The labeling will be performed by the laboratory CRINEX, the kits will be delivered to pharmacy centers.

 The pharmacy of each participating center will handle the management of returns and the destruction of processing units.

 Patients in the control group will receive placebo of vitamin D in the same manner as experimental patients.

 The study entails a screening-visit followed by a 3 months reference period, an inclusion visit followed by randomization, two follow-up visits (3 and 6 months) and an end-study visit at 12 months.

 The duration of study for each patient is 12 months following the 3 months reference-phase.

 The double-blind phase is between the randomization (V1) and the 3 month visit (V2), followed by a 9 month open phase for the 2 groups Eventually, all patients with a vitamin D deficiency will be compensated with a 3-month higher dose treatment phase and a 6-month maintenance phase for the experimental group.

 The control group will receive the placebo for 3 months, then a vitamin D treatment including a 3-month higher dose and a 3 month maintenance phase.

 The duration of the inclusions is scheduled for 12 months, for research duration of 24 months.

 All eligible patients who meet ILAE (International League Against Epilepsy) criteria of drug-resistance and inclusion criteria will be informed of the opportunity to participate in this research.

 If accepted, the participants will be asked to fill out a precise seizure diary for 3 months before their inclusion in the study (V0).

 The antiepileptic treatment should not be changed during the reference period.

 The patient cannot receive vitamin D during this period.

 Inclusion visit (V1): After obtaining informed consent and verification of inclusion criteria, seizure frequency is noted and determination of serum 25(OH)D level is done.

 The vitamin D serum concentration is determined with the same technic in each center (immunoluminometric CLIA (Chemiluminescence Immunoassay Analyzer) - Liaison XL).

 The concentration serum calcium, albumin and creatinine is determined at the biochemistry laboratory of the participating center.

 The self-questionnaires (Fatigue impact scale : FIS, Hospital anxiety depression scale :HAD, Quality of life in epilepsy : QOLIE 31) are completed and handed to the investigator.

 Clinical and demographic data are collected on the case report.

 After receipt of 25(OH)D level results, patients in whom deficiency is objectified (25(OH)D 100 ng/mL and/or serum calcium>2.

70mmol/L and/or creatinine>200 1/2mol/L.

 Control of serum calcium if between 2.

60 and 2.

70 mmol/L, stop if> 2.

60 mmol/L.

 6 month-visit (V3): similar to V2, maintenance supplementation in the 2 groups: 1 dose per month for 3 months, except if biological contraindication.

 End-study visit (V4, 12 months) similar to V1-V2, vitamin D trial stop.

 In case of deterioration of the clinical situation requiring modification of the antiepileptic treatment (excluding one-time treatment with benzodiazepines), the patient will be considered not-responder but will not be excluded from the study.

 The seizure frequency in this case for the primary judgment criterion will be the one before the treatment change (LOCF method).

 Vitamine D in Drug Resistant Epilepsy@highlight

Almost all patients with epilepsy living in the region of Paris have vitamin D deficiency, which is severe in 1/3 of the cases.

 The impact of this deficiency on epilepsy is unknown, despite the suggested benefits of vitamin D therapy including better seizure control and improvement of comorbidities (fatigue, anxiety, depression) in drug-resistant patients.

 Recommendations for vitamin D supplementation based on the serum level in the general population cannot be applied to patients with epilepsy due to interference of antiepileptic drugs in the vitamin D metabolism.

 Animal models, mechanisms of action studies and ecological information provide objective data for a direct antiepileptic effect of vitamin D.

 Human studies seem to confirm the antiepileptic effect of vitamin D but there are no controlled studies on large populations.

 The investigators aim to assess prospectively the effect of the treatment of vitamin D deficiency providing a high level of evidence.

 The investigators propose a multicentre placebo controlled randomized double-blind study, testing vitamin D supplementation against placebo in 400 drug-resistant patients to assess the short-term (3 months) and long-term (1 year) benefits on epilepsy.

 The investigators hypothesize that the treatment of vitamin D deficiency will result in significant reduction of seizure frequency, and improvement of comorbid symptoms as well as quality of life.

 The impact on the care of patients is important because better epilepsy control allows reduction of the antiepileptic drugs and side effects.

 This again is a key for the recovery of social and professional activities, and reduction of costs related to the disease.
