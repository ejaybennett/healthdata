(secondQuint)A 15-year Single Center Experience of Endovascular Treatment of Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis.

 The aim of this study was to evaluate the post-operative outcomes following endovascular treatment of TRAS (Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis).

 This retrospective, monocentric study included patients with peri-anastomotic stenosis of the renal graft from 2000 to 2017.

 The stenosis is defined by a reduction of at least 50% of the arterial diameter during arteriography.

 Technical success was defined as residual stenosis less than 30% of the arterial diameter after the procedure.

Stenosis of the renal graft arteries occurs in 1 to 26% of cases and can damage the graft.

 Endovascular treatment is first-line treatment.

 The main objective of this study is to identify the predictive factors of failure of peri-anastomotic.
