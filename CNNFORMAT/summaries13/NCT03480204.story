(firstQuint)Patient Status Engine (PSE): EARLY FEASIBILITY AND USABILITY STUDY.

 This study evaluates the feasibility and usability of a wearable patch cardiac monitor, gateway and server concomitant with standard-of-care cardiac telemetry monitoring for non-ICU hospitalized patients on a selected nursing ward at the Cleveland Clinic Heart and Vascular Institute.

 All patients will receive routine clinical care on the basis of the traditional telemetry monitoring using the usual processes.

 The patch monitor data will not be reviewed in real-time, and only analyzed post hoc for agreement with the standard-of-care.
