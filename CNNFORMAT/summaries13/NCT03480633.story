(fifthQuint)Biorepository Studying the Relationship Between Biomarkers and Heart Failure.

 All ambulatory patients, 18 years and older, with a history of HF, meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible.

 Age and sex matched patients with no history of HF will also be considered eligible.

 Blood samples will be collected at baseline as well as at 1 year follow up.

 At both time points, a total blood volume of up to 50 mL will be collected using EDTA and serum tubes, while patients are seated.

 Samples will be spun at 1800 rpm and plasma aliquoted.

 Samples will be frozen immediately at -80 C.

 The investigators will compare baseline biomarker concentrations across the three groups of patients (i.

e.

 HFpEF, HFrEF, and no history of HF) as well as across all study subjects.

 Baseline measures will be compared against one-year follow up data for all variables delineated and one-year major cardiovascular adverse events, with a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization.

 Additionally, the investigators will examine genetic variants and their associations with HF subtypes.

 To achieve this, the investigators will relate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with left ventricular remodeling pathways to HF subtypes.

 In a subgroup of patients for whom baseline echocardiographic data is available in the medical record, the investigators will compare echocardiographic measures of diastolic dysfunction (including LAVI, transmitral E/A ratio, and E/E' ratio) across the three groups.

 When available, DICOM images of transthoracic echocardiograms will be collected in order to collect precise measures of dysfunction.

 Biorepository Studying the Relationship Between Biomarkers and Heart Failure@highlight

This study aims to prospectively evaluate the relationship between serial measurement of several biomarkers, such as insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), bone morphogenic protein 1 (BMP1), and carboxyterminal propeptide of type-I procollagen (PICP), and echocardiographic features of diastolic dysfunction in three groups, including patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and patients without a history of heart failure (HF).

 The relationship between these novel biomarkers and one year major cardiovascular adverse events will also be evaluated.
