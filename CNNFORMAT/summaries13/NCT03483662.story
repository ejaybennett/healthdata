 Recently, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) reported that more intensive blood pressure (BP) treatment (target systolic BP50 years.

 SPRINT clearly answered the question - Will lowering BP more than the currently recommended goal further reduce the risk of CVD and mortality? The next important question is how to implement a more intensive BP treatment program in real-world clinical practice, especially in underserved patients.

 The IMPACTS trial is an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial to simultaneously test the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention program for more intensive BP treatment and the feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability of implementing the program in underserved patients with hypertension in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi.

 The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research has been used to guide the development of the multicomponent intervention, including dissemination of SPRINT study findings among patients, providers and policymakers; team-based collaborative care using a stepped-care protocol adapted from the SPRINT intensive-treatment algorithm, BP audit and feedback, and home BP monitoring; and health coaching on antihypertensive medication adherence and lifestyle modification.

 The investigators will collaborate with 36 federally qualified health center clinics that serve low-income populations in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi to recruit 1,260 trial participants and conduct the IMPACTS trial.

 The primary clinical outcome is the difference in mean change of systolic BP from baseline to 18 months.

 The fidelity of the intervention, measured by intensification of treatment by providers and adherence to medications in patients, will be the primary implementation outcome.

 This study will generate urgently needed data on effective, adoptable, and sustainable intervention strategies aimed at eliminating health disparities and reducing the BP-related disease burden in underserved populations in the US.

The IMPACTS study utilizes an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 2 design to achieve two primary goals simultaneously: 1).

 to test the effectiveness of a multifaceted implementation strategy for intensive BP control among underserved hypertensive patients at high risk for CVD, and 2).

 to assess the acceptability, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability of the multifaceted implementation strategy in patients, providers, and healthcare systems.
