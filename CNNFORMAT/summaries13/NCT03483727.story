(fifthQuint)Use of a Hand-held Digital Cognitive Aid in the Early Management of Simulated War Wounds.

.

 In a first study (MAX, BJA 2017, Lelaidier et al) the investigators designed a digital cognitive aid (MAX for Medical Assistant eXpert) under the form of a smartphone application including 5 scenarios of anaesthesia and intensive care crises (malignant hyperthermia, anaphylactic shock, acute toxicity of local anaesthetics, severe and symptomatic hyperkalaemia, ventricular fibrillation), designed to be used in the hand of the leader managing the situations.

 Technical and non-technical skills were improved in 4 out of 5 scenarios.

 Combat casualties are dealt with a stereotyped management in the French army, and all soldiers learn the algorithm (acronym) designed for this purpose, the MARCHE RYAN.

 Situations requiring the use of the MARCHE RYAN are extremely stressful (on the battlefield, performed by non-medical personal, often on a comrade).

 The present study exclusively deals with the management of combat casualties with the digital cognitive aid MAX adapted for MARCHE RYAN algorithm.

 Use of a Hand-held Digital Cognitive Aid in the Early Management of Simulated War Wounds.

@highlight

Combat casualty care has proven to increase survival rate in military conflict by treating without delay the quickest-to-kill wounds.

 The French militaries are trained to the MARCHE RYAN acronym, an algorithm designed to help every soldiers provide simple treatment in order to bring the patient to the surgeon alive.

 Our first study (MAX, Lelaidier et al, BJA 2017) clearly showed that the use of a digital cognitive aid in the hand of the leader significantly improves the management of anaesthesia & intensive care emergencies (malignant hyperthermia, anaphylactic shock, acute toxicity of local anaesthetics, severe and symptomatic hyperkalaemia).

 The present study exclusively deals with the management of combat casualties with the same digital cognitive aid adapted for MARCHE RYAN algorithm.
