(thirdQuint)A Study of FF-10501-01 in Combination With Azacitidine in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome.

 This is an open-label, Simon 2-stage clinical study of the combination of FF-10501-01 and azacitidine in previously untreated patients with high-risk MDS, or in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are otherwise candidates for treatment with azacitidine in the judgment of the Investigator.

 The Phase 2 portion of the trial will be preceded by a Phase 1 "run-in" to evaluate the safety of the combination of FF-10501-01 plus azacitidine.
