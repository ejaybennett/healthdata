(secondQuint)Virtual Reality Analgesia for Pediatric Burn Survivors.

 All patients always receive their usual pain medications.

 Using a within-subjects, within-wound care design, in the current study, pediatric patients being treated for severe burn injuries will receive music distraction during some portions of their wound care (active comparator condition), and they will receive what we predict will be an unusually strong distraction, immersive virtual reality (the experimental treatment) during other comparable portions of the same wound cleaning sessions.

 During virtual reality, each patient will look into virtual reality goggles, and will play a simple cartoon-like virtual reality game SnowWorld during burn wound cleaning.

 After each wound care session, the patient will rate how much pain they experienced during wound care during No VR (music only) compared to how much pain they experienced during wound care during virtual reality, on each study day, for up to 10 study days per patient.

 Treatment order randomized.

 Virtual Reality Analgesia for Pediatric Burn Survivors@highlight

Many children with large severe burns report severe pain during burn wound cleaning.

 The current study explores whether adjunctive immersive Virtual Reality distraction may help reduce the intensity of pain experienced by children during burn wound cleaning by taking the patient's mind off their pain.
