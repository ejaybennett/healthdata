(fifthQuint)Melatonin in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

.

 The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the change in 24 hour urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6SMT) collected for 24 hours in two twelve hour sessions.

 The secondary objectives are to evaluate the change in serum morning melatonin level.

 In addition, quality of life (QOL) measures will be assessed including the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

 Clinical objectives include the number of relapses during the trial and a change in the Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) & Performance Scales (PS).

 The pilot study is a one-year randomized, rater- and dose-blinded trial evaluating the potential role of melatonin in subjects with relapsing multiple sclerosis who have been taking a stable dose of an oral disease modifying therapy (DMT) for at least 6 months.

 The oral DMTs include dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, and teriflunomide.

 Thirty subjects with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis who meet all of the eligibility criteria will be enrolled at Providence Neurological Specialties in Portland, Oregon.

 Melatonin in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

@highlight

To date, there are no published data on the role of melatonin supplementation or the appropriate dose for patients with multiple sclerosis.

 Because of the potential benefits of melatonin, this pilot study will be an exploratory investigation to evaluate the effect of supplementing melatonin in subjects with multiple sclerosis who are taking an oral disease modifying therapy (DMT) for 6 months or longer.

 It is our intent that the results of this study will support the rationale and be a prelude to a larger trial which can focus on clinical efficacy of melatonin therapy outcomes.
