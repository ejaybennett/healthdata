(fifthQuint)Health Education During Ramadan Fasting in Type 1 Diabetes.

 Adult Muslims are obliged to start fasting during the month of Ramadan.

 Fasting entails refraining from all food, drink, tablets and injections(vitamins & fluids) between sunrise and sunset; a period which varies by geographical location and season.

 Although exempt, many diabetics refuse to take this concession as they feel psychologically & spiritually inclined to fast along with other Muslims.

 Fasting at Ramadan carries a very high risk for people with T1DM.

 This risk is particularly exacerbated in poorly controlled patients and those with limited access to medical care, hypoglycemic unawareness, unstable glycemic control, or recurrent hospitalizations.

 Structured education interventions have been endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence as important in empowering patients to improve their journey with diabetes.

 In a large observational study, patients who fasted during Ramadan without attending a structured education session had a fourfold increase in hypoglycaemic events, whereas those who attended an education programme focusing on Ramadan had a significant decrease in hypoglycemic events.

 Conversation Map aims to help people with diabetes experience a healthier Ramadan.

 The interactive Map covers a number of topics including understanding the risks and complications of fasting and the importance of creating a diabetes management plan during this time.

 Health Education During Ramadan Fasting in Type 1 Diabetes@highlight

Adult Muslims are obliged to start fasting during the month of Ramadan.

 Fasting entails refraining from all food, drink, tablets and injections(vitamins & fluids) between sunrise and sunset; a period which varies by geographical location and season.

 People with type 1 Diabetes are among those who are risky to fast this holy month in the Muslim faith and thus are exempted from fasting.

 Yet many patients fast in spite of medical advice and religious exemption and for those patients, healthcare professionals should provide the utmost care and continuous diabetes education.

 Different diabetes education modalities exist like DSME (Diabetes self-management education with proven efficacy.

 One modality is the Diabetes Conversation Map which delivers diabetes education interactively through a series of maps that address different issues in diabetes management and includes a specially designed Ramadan map.

 In this study, two modalities of Diabetes focused Ramadan education will be compared regarding aiding patients to fast Ramadan safely.

 One modality will be Diabetes conversation maps and the other the International Diabetes Federation Education modules.
