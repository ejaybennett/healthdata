(fifthQuint)The Impact of Physical (In)Activity on Sleep Quality.

 Sleep, which makes up approximately one third of an individual's life, plays a vital role in normal bodily functioning by regulating metabolic and endocrine function.

 Disturbed sleep, defined as any alteration to normal sleep patterns, is highly prevalent, affecting 35% and 41% of the general population in the United States and has been linked to poor cardiovascular health, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.

 Young adults are a population at high risk for disturbed sleep-related health outcomes due to negative lifestyle behaviors such as alcohol consumption, drug use, study patterns, and excessive screen time that remain with advancing age.

 Due to the importance of improving or maintaining health outcomes through adequate sleep quality (SQ), the proposed research will examine the role of physical activity (PA) on altering SQ while systematically examining novel mechanisms that may drive changes in SQ.

 Specifically, this study will examine how alterations (increases and decreases) in PA impact SQ and how these alterations modify inflammation, oxidative stress, and sympathetic stimulation in young adults.

The proposed research will examine the role of physical activity (PA) on altering sleep quality (SQ) while systematically examining novel mechanisms that may drive changes in SQ.

 Specifically, the study will examine how a 2 week reduction in PA alters sleep quality in young, healthy individuals.

 Additionally, during this reduction in PA, the study will examine changes in inflammation, oxidative stress, and sympathetic activity to identify potential mechanisms for alterations in sleep quality.
