(fifthQuint)Selective Microbiota Transplantation for Radiation Enteritis.

 The present clinical trial aims to re-establish a gut functionality state of intestinal flora through selective microbiota transplantation (mini-FMT) for as a therapy for radiation enteritis (RE).

 mini-FMT aims to stimulate the efficiency of fecal microbiota transplantation.

 It is a new concept and technology and has been a hotspot in translational medicine area.

 Patients in this study will receive mini-FMT three times and follow-up for at least 4 weeks.

 Blood test, endoscopy and questionnaire will be used to access participants at study start and at study completion.

 Fecal microbiota compositions, blood and urinary metabolic profiles of patients will be analyzed to assess associated microbial changes.

 Selective Microbiota Transplantation for Radiation Enteritis@highlight

Radiation enteritis is one of the most feared complications after abdominal or pelvic radiation therapy.

The gut microbiota is considered to constitute a "microbial organ" which has pivotal roles in the intestinal diseases and body metabolism.

 Evidence from animal studies demonstrated the link between intestinal bacteria and radiation enteritis.

 This clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of selective microbiota transplantation (mini-FMT) for radiation enteritis.
