(thirdQuint)Financial Burden Assessment in Patients With Stage I-III Colon or Rectal Cancer Undergoing Treatment.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the change in level of self-reported financial burden from baseline (within 60 days of diagnosis) to 12 months after diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer treated with curative-intent.

 SECONDARY OBJECTVIES: I.

 Evaluate reported access and utilization of financial services (i.

e.

 financial counselor, navigator, social workers) and its association to financial burden in the first 12 months after diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer treated with curative-intent.

 II.

 Evaluate the change in level of self-reported financial burden and employment limitations from baseline (within 60 days of diagnosis) to 3, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer treated with curative-intent.

 III.

 Evaluate long term outcomes at 24 months after diagnosis including financial burden, employment limitations and adherence to clinical follow-up guidelines.

 IV.

 Evaluate the change of quality-of-life outcome (QoL) from baseline to 12 months and its association with predictors.

 V.

 Evaluate the change in level of self-reported financial burden from baseline to 12 months using alternate measures of financial burden (i.

e.

 impact of cost questions and single item from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] questionnaire [Q]30).

 OUTLINE: Patients complete questionnaires over 20-60 minutes at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after cancer diagnosis.

 Financial Burden Assessment in Patients With Stage I-III Colon or Rectal Cancer Undergoing Treatment@highlight

This research trial studies the financial burden in patients with stage I-III colon or rectal cancer who are undergoing treatment.

 Collecting data from patients about their cost and quality of life may help doctors to better understand the impact of cancer treatment on a patient?s employment and finances.
