(fifthQuint)Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplant With Prophylactic With Natural Killer DLI for Lymphoma, Multiple Myeloma, and CLL.

 This is a single center Phase I trial of a new haploidentical stem cell transplant regimen intended to assess safety.

 Two groups of patients are planned: patients with lymphoma and patients with multiple myeloma.

 Each subject will receive a haploidentical stem cell transplantation using peripheral blood stem cells.

 Bendamustine-fludarabine-rituximab-TBI conditioning will be used, followed by stem cell infusion, with PTCy and tacrolimus for GVHD prophylaxis.

 Patients will receive a CD56-selected DLI on day +7.

 Evaluations will be taken at baseline and at each of the study visits.

 Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility.

 Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study.

 Total duration of subject participation will be one year.

 Total duration of the study is expected to be three years.

 Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplant With Prophylactic With Natural Killer DLI for Lymphoma, Multiple Myeloma, and CLL@highlight

This study seeks to examine the investigational use of the conditioning regimen (bendamustine, fludarabine, and retiuximab) prior to haplo peripheral blood allogeneic stem cell transplantation with PTCy.

 The study will also test the investigational use of CD56-enriched Donor Lymphocyte Infusion to see if this treatment is safe and whether or not it will help patients achieve better outcomes post-transplant, including reduced risk of Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) and preventing disease relapse.
