(secondQuint)Prestoma-Trial for Parastomal Hernia Prevention.

 Parastomal hernia after permanent colostomy formation is a common problem.

 The European Hernia Society recommends the use of prophylactic mesh when the stoma is constructed.

 So far, there're no trials comparing the methods to prevent the parastomal hernia.

 Prestoma Trial is designed to compare the most researched retromuscular mesh (Parietene Macro by Medtronic) with two different types of intraperitoneal meshes (Parietex Parastomal by Medtronic and Dynamesh IPST) in parastomal hernia prevention after laparoscopic or robotic-assisted abdominoperineal resection for rectal adenocarcinoma.

Prestoma Trial is designed to compare the safety and efficiency of three different meshes and techniques to prevent parastomal hernia after laparoscopic or robotic-assisted abdominoperineal resection for rectal adenocarcinoma.
