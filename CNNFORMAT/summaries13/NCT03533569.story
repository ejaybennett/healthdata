(fifthQuint)Early Biomarkers for ARthritic PAIN to Guide Improved Treatments for Arthritis.

 Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis worldwide.

 OA causes major disability and pain and places a huge financial burden on healthcare worldwide.

 In recent work, the gene expression profile of bone marrow lesions (BML) in osteoarthritis has been evaluated.

 BML in OA have a novel gene expression profile which includes genes involved in inflammation, neurogenesis and matrix turnover.

 The plan is to investigate the functional significance of the genes found at the protein biomarker level in studies of joint tissue, blood and urine from participants with knee OA and compare these changes with participants who have other forms of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis.

 Early Biomarkers for ARthritic PAIN to Guide Improved Treatments for Arthritis@highlight

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a condition affecting the whole joint and is a major cause of pain and disability worldwide.

 Although OA is very common, the initial steps which lead to the development of pain and tissue damage are not fully understood.

 In this study participants will be investigated for markers in the blood, joint and urine in people who have a diagnosis of osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis and are receiving a steroid injection for their condition.

 Markers will be evaluated in participants with osteoarthritis compared with other types of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis.
