(fifthQuint)The Effect of Food Labelling and Satiety on Individuals Food Choice.

 Previous research has shown that nutritional knowledge is a key indicator in healthy eating choices, but real-life examinations of the associations between both nutritional knowledge and state of hunger and satiety on individuals' food choice of healthy vs unhealthy snacks is limited (Drichoutis, Lazaridis, & Nayga, 2005; Grunert, Wills, & Fernandez-Celemin, 2010; Nayga, 2000; Petrovici, Fearne, Nayga, & Drolias, 2012; Soederberg Miller & Cassady, 2015; Viola, Bianchi, Croce, & Ceretti, 2016).

 As there is currently little research combining these facets, it would be interesting to investigate whether individuals who are provided with food labelling information would choose unhealthy snacks when hungry as than when satiated and whether this would differ for those who are not provided with food labelling information.

 Based on this, the present study aims to investigate whether the presence of nutritional information in the form of food labels will affect participants' food choice when hungry and when satiated.

 The General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire will be used to assess participants baseline nutritional knowledge and will be used as a covariate in the research project.
