(fifthQuint)PREHABILITATION COLORECTAL SURGERY.

 Protocol for colorectal neoplasia patients who need surgery by modifying the current one.

 Until now, in the preoperative time, the anesthetist evaluated the need for some specific action such as pre-operative iron administration to avoid perioperative transfusions or the need to assess some of the patient's morbidities to try to optimize it.

 In the perioperative period in our hospital, the criteria of the Multimodal and Fast-Tcack Rehabilitation programs have been applied for a long time and there are some trajectories that allow standardization of patient management once they have been admitted.

 It is demonstrated in other centers and in other surgical pathologies that, in addition to what we are already applying to our center, modify the preoperative preparation of our patients and try to improve their "functional capacity" results of lower morbidity and mortality and the subsequent recovery of patients can greatly improve .

 This is called prehabilitation.

 Pretreatment consists in a change in preoperative preparation at three levels.

 The concept of preoperative preparation changes and the patient is actively involved in it.

 Three levels of the patient are controlled: functional or physical level, nutritional level and emotional level, by means of pots and they are encouraged to make a series of changes in their habitual life (exercise, dietary advice, mindfullness techniques) that increase its functional capacity.

 This is related to a decrease in morbidity and mortality and in addition to a better and faster postoperative recovery.

 PREHABILITATION COLORECTAL SURGERY@highlight

Preoperative preparation protocol (prehabilitation) for patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer who need surgery.

 It consists of a change in the preoperative preparation.

 The patient is an active part of their preparation and the professionals help to achieve a better functional capacity to diminish morbidity and accelerate recovery.

 Three levels are controlled: - Physical: control and stimulation to exercise at home.

 - Nutrition: control and advice through homemade recipes.

 - Emotional: control of the level of haste or depression and advice of mindfullness techniques at home.

 If they need specific help they are derived from specialized professionals (rehabilitator, nutritionist / endocrinologist, psychologist).
