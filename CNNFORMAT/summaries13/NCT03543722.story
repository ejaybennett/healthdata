(fifthQuint)Independence Project.

 Tens of thousands of veterans with disabilities transition from military service each year, often destined for lives dependent on disability insurance and disengaged from community life.

 The personal and societal costs of not helping these veterans re-integrate into civilian life are enormous, including suicides, addiction, family problems, and rapidly increasing costs to the Veterans Disability Compensation Program (VDC).

 The current project is an evaluation of the National Career Coach Program to assist veterans as they transition to civilian life.

 Instead of existing veteran services (including the VDC) that emphasize brokenness and pay veterans small amounts based on what they cannot do, this innovative program emphasizes strengths and abilities by front-loading intensive support, motivation, human-capital investment, and incentives to help veterans become permanently engaged in meaningful work, thereby boosting morale, positive identity, and community integration.

 The design of this study is a randomized controlled trial comparing an intensive employment model (National Career Coach Program) to usual community employment services available to unemployed veterans recently separated from active duty (Local Community Resources).

 The investigators will enroll 400 participants over an 8-month period, randomly assigning them to the two conditions and following them over a three-year period.

 The primary outcome domains are competitive employment and VDC disability benefits.

 Independence Project@highlight

The Independence Project is a study to evaluate the effectiveness of an intensive employment intervention for young veterans with disabilities recently separated from military service.

 The study is a randomized controlled trial comparing an intensive employment model (National Career Coach Program) to usual community employment services available to unemployed veterans recently separated from active duty (Local Community Resources Program).

 The investigators will evaluate if people who receive the National Career Coach Program have better employment outcomes and reduced Veterans Disability Compensation participation than people who receive the Local Community Resources Program.
