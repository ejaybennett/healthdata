(fifthQuint)Taekwondo Training and Postmenopausal Women With Stage-2 Hypertension.

 Menopause is associated with an age-related increase in both blood catecholamine levels and arterial stiffness as well as a decrease in muscular strength, which can collectively contribute to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

 This is of particular importance for postmenopausal women, as epidemiological studies have demonstrated that postmenopausal women have a greater risk for CVD than that of premenopausal women.

 Both age and menopause can increase blood catecholamine levels, specifically epinephrine (EP) and norepinephrine (NE), which may be result from attenuated autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity.

 This impaired ANS activity is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of CVD, as higher catecholamine levels have been observed in patients with CVD, such as older individuals with hypertension, including postmenopausal, hypertensive women.

 Elevated pulse wave velocity (PWV), an index of arterial stiffness, is one of the major risk factors of atherosclerosis, hypertension and heart diseases, and is commonly observed in post-menopausal women.

 In fact, an increase of only 1 m/s in PWV was found to be associated with a 12% increase in the risk of cardiovascular events in adults with high CVD risk.

 An elevated PWV is also associated with muscle mass and strength loss in older adults.

 Indeed, several studies have shown that sarcopenia is inversely associated with PWV, and this relationship has been shown to be greater in women than in men.

 Moreover, muscle strength is believed to have a protective effect against arterial stiffness and hypertension, which suggests that improvements in muscle strength could lead to cardiovascular benefits and improved overall health.

 Therefore, there is a need to reverse the increased blood catecholamine levels and arterial stiffness, as well as the reduced muscle strength and mass, experienced in post-menopausal women with hypertension.

 Exercise training has been utilized to achieve this, as both aerobic and resistance exercise has been shown to protect against age-related cardiovascular disease risk factors, including increased blood catecholamine levels, arterial stiffness, high blood pressure and loss of muscle strength.

 Taekwondo may be a useful mode of exercise for this population as it can be conducted at various intensities, incorporates both aerobic and resistance training components and may improve strength, motor coordination, and cardiovascular health.

 Additionally, Taekwondo is an enjoyable exercise modality that may increase exercise program adherence in elderly people.

 However, there are no studies to our knowledge that examine the effects of Taekwondo training on these parameters.

 Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a 12-week Taekwondo training program on blood catecholamine levels, arterial stiffness, blood pressure and muscular strength in postmenopausal women with stage-2 hypertension.

The major findings from the study are that 12-weeks of Taekwondo training reduced the elevated blood catecholamine levels and arterial stiffness in post-menopausal women with stage-2 hypertension.

 In addition, we found that Taekwondo training was able to reduce resting heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

 Furthermore, Taekwondo training was able to increase both hand grip and leg strength, which have been shown to be negatively correlated with cardiovascular risks.

 To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the beneficial effects of Taekwondo as a therapeutic exercise modality to improve cardiovascular health and muscular strength in post-menopausal women with stage-2 hypertension.
