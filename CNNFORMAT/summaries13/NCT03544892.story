(fifthQuint)The Effects of a Low Carbohydrate, Non-Ketogenic Diet Versus Standard Diabetes Diet on Glycemic Control in Type 1 Diabetes.

 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is marked by total insulin dependence with challenges regarding glycemic control and concomitant sequela.

 While standard of care medical nutrition therapy for this disease centers on matching carbohydrate to insulin at meals, recent literature and clinical reports have shown superior glycemic control and cardiovascular measures with lower carbohydrate dietary patterns (40% energy from fat due to the macronutrient distribution.

 With innate risk of cardiovascular disease in T1D, standard of care has supported restriction of total fat consumption, especially saturated fat, in effort to control cholesterol.

 While the American Diabetes Association recognizes that dietary fat is a controversial and complex issue, eliminating trans-fats is the only consensus point across the field.

 To date, most low CHO diet studies in both T1D and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) have not shown adverse effects on lipids and tend to show decreases in triglycerides and either no change or increases in HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol.

 The Effects of a Low Carbohydrate, Non-Ketogenic Diet Versus Standard Diabetes Diet on Glycemic Control in Type 1 Diabetes@highlight

This randomized, crossover nutrition intervention seeks to examine the effects of a non-ketogenic low carbohydrate (CHO) diet (60-80g per day) on glycemic control, lipids, and markers on inflammation in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).

 This study will be used to inform clinical practice, especially in teaching medical nutrition therapy to new-onset diabetes patients and those struggling with glycemic control and hyperlipidemia.

 At this time, no evidenced-based universal recommendations from randomized controlled trials exist to support low carbohydrate dietary patterns as a front-line approach in individuals with T1D.

 The investigators hypothesize a diet consisting of 60-80 g carbohydrate diet will result in greater improvement in glycemic control compared to a 50% carbohydrate diet in patients with Type 1 diabetes over 12 weeks in the outpatient setting.
