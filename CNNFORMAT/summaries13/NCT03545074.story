(secondQuint)Efficacy of Spanish or English Language Versions of Mindfulness Meditation on Depression.

 This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with an experimental condition (MAPs Mindfulness intervention) and an active control group (Health Education), using a pretest and immediate posttest research design.

 Both conditions are comprised of a 6-week group intervention, which will be administered at the UCLA Westwood Medical Campus.

 The sample (N=80) will be drawn from a population of adults (18-65 years old), residing within a 10mile radius of the UCLA Westwood Medical Campus.

 To determine initial eligibility, potential participants will self-select based on perceived high levels of stress.

 Participants will respond self-report questionnaires to assess for psychological symptoms and will be drawn blood samples (180ml total) to assess levels of pro inflammatory cytokines before and after the interventions.

 Participants will attend a total of 8 visits.
