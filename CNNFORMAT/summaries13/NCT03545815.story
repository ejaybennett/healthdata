 1.

 To evaluate the feasibility and safety of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated PD-1 and TCR gene-knocked out chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in patients with mesothelin positive multiple solid tumors.

 2.

 To evaluate the duration of in vivo persistence of transferred CAR-T cells.

 3.

 To observe and measure anti-tumor responses for patients with detectable mesothelin positive tumor lesions.

@highlight

Multiple solid tumors have positive targets of mesothelin expressed on the surfaces of the tumor cells, we use the technique of CRISPR-Cas9 to knocked out the PD-1 and TCR of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to effect the immuno-microenvironment around tumors.
