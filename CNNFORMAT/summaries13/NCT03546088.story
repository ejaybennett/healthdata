(thirdQuint)Awake Nasal Intubation in Laryngopharyngeal Tumors.

 Awake naso-tracheal fiberoptic intubation is an established method of securing a difficult airway.

 The patient's comfort and optimum intubation conditions are paramount for success.

 The study proposes to analyse a series of patients with obstructive supraglottic pathology, following the degree of satisfaction, reliability of the procedure and any incidents or complications.

 Awake intubation could be the safest way to control difficult airway as the patient maintains spontaneous respiration and intact reflexes.

 Main concerns for the success of this procedure should be a good technique, a calm and cooperative patient and good preparation with careful topical anaesthesia and appropriate sedation.

 The tool used in this study will be a flexible nasolaryngoscope of 2.

8 mm diameter and 350 mm length which might offer an advantage over lengthier fiberscopes in matter of manoeuvrability and patient comfort.

 Prior intubation the patients will have an upper airway fiberscopic exam from nostrils to tracheae with the same tool.

This study evaluates the efficiency of awake naso-tracheal intubation and patient satisfaction when using a small diameter flexible nasolaryngoscope together with topical anaesthesia and light sedation with a combination of benzodiazepine, fentanyl and droperidol.

 The selected patients will have difficult airway access because of obstructing oro- and hypo-pharynx tumours.
