(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate Safety, Feasibility, Efficacy of Multiple Dosing With VB10.

NEO Immunotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cancer.

 This open labelled first in human dose phase 1/2a study is designed to evaluate safety, feasibility and efficacy of multiple dosing with individualised VB10.

NEO immunotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), clear renal cell carcinoma, urothelial cancer or squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), who did not reach complete responses with immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy as their standard of care (SOC) treatment.

 Upon screening, the patients must have been receiving for at least 12 weeks a CPI (anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1) as the patient's standard of care, and according to currently approved indications.

 The VB10.

NEO vaccine will be added to this continuing CPI treatment and shall not replace, omit, postpone or terminate the standard therapy.

 Patients will be enrolled in case of some benefit to CPI treatment is expected, as defined by partial remission, stable disease or disease progression (in case of a mixed response to CPI, provided at least one lesion shows measurable regression and patient, according to the investigator, would have a clinical benefit of continued immunotherapy).

 The assumption is to combine the immuno-stimulating effect of CPIs with immune responses towards specific neo-antigens in the vaccine, which may possibly increase the anti-tumour effect to reach durable efficacy The study will be conducted in two parts.

 Part A will evaluate safety, feasibility and efficacy of individualised VB10.

NEO immunotherapy.

 The expansion part B will explore efficacy and safety in further patients with selected types of cancer showing signs of effect during part A.
