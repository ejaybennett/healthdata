(secondQuint)d68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT Assessment of Cardiac Sarcoidosis.

 Prospective study of 15 consecutive patients with suspected or newly diagnosed cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) who are referred for a clinically indicated 18FDG (and 13NH3) PET/CT scan for cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) will be approached to undergo a 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scan.

 Comparison will then be made between the 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and the 18FDG and 13NH3 PET/CT to determine if 68Ga-DOTATATE detects CS.

The Researchers are trying to determine if 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging will have a similar accuracy as 18FDG PET/CT in diagnosing cardiac sarcoidosis and if it will be able to do so without the need for complex patient dietary preparation that is required with 18FDG PET/CT.
