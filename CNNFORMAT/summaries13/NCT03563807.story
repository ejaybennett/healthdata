(fifthQuint)Golf Instruction Versus Tai Chi for People With Parkinson's Disease.

 Approximately, 40-50 participants with Parkinson's Disease (H&Y stage 2 to 3) will be enrolled in this study.

 Participants who provide informed consent will be randomized 1:1 to either group golf instruction or group Tai Chi classes.

 Participants will be evaluated before and after the intervention with a battery of cognitive, motor and balance assessments including the UPDRS, the Mini-BESTest of balance, and timed up and go tests.

 They will participate in classes twice weekly for 10 weeks which will be provided free of charge.

 At the end of the intervention period they will repeat the assessments.

 The primary outcomes of the study are feasibility and tolerability.

 The key secondary objectives are to measure the efficacy of golf instruction on measures of balance, risk of falls.

 Golf Instruction Versus Tai Chi for People With Parkinson's Disease@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and tolerability of golf instruction for participants with moderate to advanced Parkinson's disease (PD).

 Other forms of exercise have been shown to be beneficial for PD.

 Golf is a low impact sport that utilizes balance and strength.

 Currently, there are no data looking at the effects of golf on PD.

 This pilot study aims to test the effects of golf in the PD patient population, particularly its effect on balance.

 In this study, we will be comparing group golf instruction to group Tai Chi lessons (the gold standard balance exercise for patients with PD).
