(thirdQuint)MTX110 by Convection-Enhanced Delivery in Treating Participants With Newly-Diagnosed Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the safety and tolerability of repeated administration of MTX110 co-infused with gadoteridol given by intratumoral convection enhanced delivery in children with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the clinical efficacy of repeated administration of MTX110 given by intratumoral convection-enhanced delivery (CED) in children with newly diagnosed DIPG in the confines of a phase I and early efficacy study.

 OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

 Participants receive panobinostat nanoparticle formulation MTX110 intratumorally (IT) by CED infusion on day 1 or days 1 and 2 as determined by dose level.

 Courses repeat every 4-8 weeks for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment participants are followed up at 30 days and then every 2 months.

 MTX110 by Convection-Enhanced Delivery in Treating Participants With Newly-Diagnosed Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma@highlight

This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of panobinostat nanoparticle formulation MTX110 (MTX110) in treating participants with newly-diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.

 Panobinostat nanoparticle formulation MTX110 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
