(thirdQuint)Temozolomide Plus Anti-angiogenesis Drugs and Radiotherapy as a Treatment for Glioblastoma.

 Glioma is the highest incidence of the central nervous system tumor.

 Among them, the pleomorphic glioblastoma (GBM) has the highest malignant degree, highly invasive and difficult to treat.

 Surgical treatment is one of the most important therapeutic methods in patients with glioblastoma.

 But since malignant glioma is a highly invasive tumor, the rate of surgery failure is .

 So the postoperative therapy shall be accompanied by radiotherapy.

 Since 1998, the clinical application of Temozolomide(TMZ) has brought hope for malignant glioma patients with its definite curative effect.

 According to the results of several clinical studies, TMZ synchronous plus radiotherapy and subsequent as adjuvant therapy can significantly improve the survival rate of newly diagnosed GBM patients and break the survival limit of GBM patients.

 Besides, antiangiogenic therapy is also a choice for the treatment of glioblastoma patients.

 Vascular endothelial growth factor receptors(VEGFRs) inhibitors block the new formation around the tumor and cut down the supply of oxygen, nutrients and metabolic waste, so that the tumor is hard to proliferate and metastases.
