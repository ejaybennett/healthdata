(thirdQuint)The Accuracy of Ultrasound in Detecting Rotator Cuff Tears in Proximal Humerus Fracture Patients.

 Although most of the focus concerning proximal humerus fractures is on the bony structures, injuries in the musculotendinous insertion regions of the rotator cuff musculature may also need attention in the treatment.

 Ultrasound is a painless and non-invasive screening modality in patients with a suspected rotator cuff tear.

 It is a user-dependent modality and health professionals must possess the competence and training before using it.

 To the investigators knowledge, no studies have investigated the accuracy of ultrasound in detecting rotator cuff tears, in patients who sustained a proximal humerus fracture.

 The Accuracy of Ultrasound in Detecting Rotator Cuff Tears in Proximal Humerus Fracture Patients@highlight

The aim of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography (US) in detecting full-thickness (a lesion that extends through both the bursal and articular part of the tendon) rotator cuff tear in patients who have sustained a proximal humerus fracture, using operative examination as the golden standard.
