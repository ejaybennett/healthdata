(thirdQuint)Methionine-Restricted Diet to Potentiate SBRT for Malignancies of the Lung.

 Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is the preferred radiation therapy technique for medically inoperable early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 Its use is associated with high rates of local control, but still a high percentage of patients develop regional and/or distant metastases.

 SBRT is also commonly used to treat oligometastatic sites of disease involving the lung from a variety of primary tumors in order to eradicate all gross disease, but still patients often eventually develop progressive disease in micrometastatic sites.

 Some tumors also may not be amenable to SBRT (or require a reduced radiation dose) if they are in close proximity to central structures like the proximal airway.

 For all of these reasons, research focused on interventions designed to improve the cancer control and safety of SBRT are appropriate in order to expand the value of SBRT in the clinical management of lung tumors.

 Safety may be improved via selective radiosensitization of cancer cells while sparing normal tissue, whereas efficacy may be improved by better eradicating micrometastatic disease.

 An innovative strategy that has potential to enhance both the safety and efficacy of SBRT is a methionine-restricted diet (MRD) as an adjunct to SBRT.

 While normal cells can tolerate some degree of methionine deficiency, the vast majority of cancer cells are methionine auxotrophs that require dietary intake of methionine.

 In the absence of methionine, cancer cells undergo cell cycle arrest and cell death.

 Preclinical data suggests that consuming a reduced quantity of methionine sensitizes cancer cells to radiation therapy and reduces metastasis formation and disease progression in mice; Phase 1 clinical trials have also demonstrated the safety of the diet with and without concurrent chemotherapy; however, dietary restriction of methionine has not been tested in combination with radiation therapy in humans.

 SBRT is an ideal form of radiation to combine with the MRD since a treatment course is completed in relatively quickly in 1-2 weeks, and does not also involve concurrent chemotherapy and its associated side effects.

 However, the potential for increased radiation-induced toxicity due to a synergistic effect from the MRD is unknown.

 This protocol will test our hypothesis that a MRD will be a safe addition to SBRT for malignancies of the lung.

 Methionine-Restricted Diet to Potentiate SBRT for Malignancies of the Lung@highlight

A diet consisting of a reduced quantity of the essential amino acid methionine sensitizes cancer cells to radiation therapy and reduces metastasis formation and disease progression in mice.

 However, to date, dietary restriction of methionine has not been tested in combination with radiation therapy in humans as a strategy to improve patient outcomes.
