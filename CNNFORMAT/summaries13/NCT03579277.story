(thirdQuint)Radial Forearm Versus the Ulnar Forearm Free Flap.

 The radial forearm free flap and the ulnar forearm free flap are both well-described procedures used for free tissue transfer in reconstructive surgery.

 Although forearm free flaps are frequently performed, there is insufficient prospective data looking at the morbidity of the radial compared to ulnar forearm free flaps.

 The goal of this research study is to characterize the outcomes for each of these two flaps, and to determine if there is surgical equipoise, or if one flap is better than the other.
