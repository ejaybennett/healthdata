(fifthQuint)Active Immunization of HIV-1 Infected, Pregnant Women With CD4 Lymphocyte Counts >= 400/mm3: A Phase I Study of Safety and Immunogenicity of VaxSyn Recombinant gp160 (NOTE: Some Patients Receive Placebo).

 Evidence suggests that an advanced stage of disease with high plasma viremia is associated with increased transmission of HIV-1 to the fetus.

 Slowing the progression of disease, reducing the titer of virus in plasma, and increasing the titer of epitope-specific antibody are potentially attainable goals through active immunization of the mother during pregnancy.

 Pregnant women are randomized to receive an initial injection of VaxSyn or alum placebo between week 16 and week 24 of gestation, followed by monthly booster injections concluding at the end of pregnancy, for a total of five injections.

 Patients may have optional booster immunizations (vaccine or placebo) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after delivery.

 Mothers and infants are followed through 18 months after delivery.

To evaluate the safety of gp160 vaccine (VaxSyn) in HIV-1 infected pregnant women with CD4 counts >= 400 cells/mm3.

 To evaluate the immunogenicity of this vaccine in pregnant women and the passive acquisition of vaccine-specific antibody in their infants.
