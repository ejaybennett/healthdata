(thirdQuint)A Study of Stem Cells and Filgrastim.

 Patients and volunteers receive seven daily subcutaneous injections of G-CSF.

 On days 5 and 6 of drug administration, patients have peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested by leukapheresis.

 HIV-positive patients are stratified into three cohorts based on CD4 count and presence of symptoms.

 If no increase in number of harvested stem cells and no grade 4 bone pain toxicity occur in two of the first three patients in a cohort, then the last three patients in that cohort will receive a dose escalation.

 Patients are followed for 24 weeks.

 A Study of Stem Cells and Filgrastim@highlight

To determine the safety of stem cell harvesting after administration of filgrastim ( G-CSF ) to mobilize bone marrow stem cells into the peripheral blood in patients at various stages of HIV-1 infection as well as in HIV-negative volunteers.

 To determine the surface phenotypic and functional characteristics as well as the viral load in the stem cells obtained following this procedure.
