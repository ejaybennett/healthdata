(fifthQuint)Combination Chemotherapy and Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the effect of marrow ablation with high dose busulfan/cyclophosphamide on engraftment, incidence of posttransplant relapse, incidence and severity of graft versus host disease (GVHD), and incidence and severity of nonGVHD posttransplant complications in patients with acute or chronic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who are eligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplants from HLA identical/compatible donors but who cannot or should not receive total body irradiation as part of their cytoreductive regimen.

 OUTLINE: 2-Drug Combination Cytoreductive Chemotherapy followed by Bone Marrow Transplant with, as indicated, CNS Prophylaxis.

 Busulfan, BU, NSC-750; Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271; followed by Allogeneic Bone Marrow, AlBM; with, as indicated, Intrathecal Cytarabine, IT ARA-C, NSC-63878.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 15 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Combination Chemotherapy and Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of busulfan and cyclophosphamide followed by bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who have acute or chronic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.
