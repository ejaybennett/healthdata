(thirdQuint)Gallium Nitrate in Treating Children With Brain Tumor, Neuroblastoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, or Refractory Solid Tumors.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the safety and side effects of gallium nitrate (GAN) when used as an anticancer agent in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors, including malignant brain tumors, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 II.

 Evaluate these side effects in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy.

 Gallium Nitrate, GAN, NSC-15200.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 3 patients will be accrued at each dose studied.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: : Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gallium nitrate in young patients who have malignant brain tumors, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or refractory solid tumor.
