(secondQuint)Radiolabeled Folic Acid and Imaging to Detect Ovarian Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the effectiveness of folic acid conjugated with indium In 111 to diagnose ovarian cancer and locate metastatic disease.

 OUTLINE: This is a diagnostic study.

 Patients receive an injection of folic acid conjugated with indium In 111.

 The patient then undergoes imaging studies at various time points (e.

g.

, 1, 4, and 24 hours).

 Patients then undergo exploratory surgery, the results of which are then compared to the imaging studies.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
