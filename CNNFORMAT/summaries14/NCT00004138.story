(thirdQuint)Positron Emission Tomography for Detecting Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary Objective: To ascertain whether FDG-PET scanning can detect lesions that would preclude pulmonary resection in patients found to be surgical candidates by standard imaging procedures.

 Secondary Objectives: To use the data collected to generate hypotheses to be used in future studies, such as which types of previously undetected lesions FDG-PET is best able to identify.

 Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) IV followed 45-60 minutes later by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

 Confirmatory studies, such as biopsy, fine needle aspiration, or other imaging studies are then conducted to confirm the PET findings.

 Patients with no mediastinal nodal or distant metastases identified by FDG-PET scan may undergo thoracotomy and pulmonary resection within 1 month of evaluation.

 Patients are followed at 5-6 months after surgery.

RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET), may improve the ability to detect the extent of non-small cell lung cancer.

 PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to study the effectiveness of PET for detecting lesions in patients who have newly diagnosed stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.
