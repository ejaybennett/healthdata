(fifthQuint)Radiation Therapy and Cyclophosphamide Plus Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Hodgkin's Disease or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the toxicity of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation following involved field radiotherapy, high dose cyclophosphamide, and total body irradiation in patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 II.

 Determine the response in patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo involved field radiotherapy on days -16 to -7.

 Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 and -5.

 Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days -4 to -1.

 Autologous peripheral blood stem cells are reinfused on day 0.

 Patients are followed every month for 1 year.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified.

RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy and cyclophosphamide plus peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
