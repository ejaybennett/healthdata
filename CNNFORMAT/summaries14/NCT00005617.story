(secondQuint)Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV or Relapsed Malignant Melanoma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety of administering MART-1 peptide-pulsed dendritic cells to patients with stage IV or relapsed malignant melanoma.

 - Determine the immunological and clinical responses in this patient population after this therapy.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients undergo leukapheresis between days -14 to -8.

 Mononuclear cells are isolated, used to generate dendritic cells (DC), and then pulsed with MART-1 peptide.

 Patients are vaccinated with MART-1 peptide-pulsed DC either IV or intradermally on days 0, 14, and 28.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MART-1 peptide-pulsed DC until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 Patients are followed until death.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV or Relapsed Malignant Melanoma@highlight

RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have stage IV, or relapsed malignant melanoma.
