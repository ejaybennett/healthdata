(secondQuint)Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Metastatic Germ Cell Tumors That Have Not Responded to Cisplatin.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the efficacy of temozolomide in patients with cisplatin refractory metastatic germ cell tumors.

 II.

 Determine the safety of this treatment in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study over 25 months.
