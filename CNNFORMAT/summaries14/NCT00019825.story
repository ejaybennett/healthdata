(secondQuint)Decitabine in Treating Patients With Unresectable Lung or Esophageal Cancer or Malignant Mesothelioma of the Pleura.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of decitabine in patients with unresectable primary small cell or non-small cell lung cancer, unresectable esophageal cancer, or malignant pleural mesothelioma.

 - Measure the expression of NY-ESO-1 in tissue samples of these patients before and after receiving this drug.

 - Assess the serologic response to NY-ESO-1 in these patients before and after receiving this drug.

 - Measure the expression of p16 tumor suppressor gene in these patients before and after receiving this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study for each stratification group.

 Patients are stratified according to number of prior therapies (2 or fewer vs 3 or more).

 Patients receive decitabine IV continuously on days 1-3.

 Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients with stable or responding disease after completion of the second course receive 2 additional courses.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of decitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 Once the MTD is determined for a particular stratum, additional patients from that stratum are treated at the MTD.

 Patients are followed for 1 month.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 72 patients (36 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.

 Decitabine in Treating Patients With Unresectable Lung or Esophageal Cancer or Malignant Mesothelioma of the Pleura@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of decitabine in treating patients who have unresectable lung or esophageal cancer or malignant mesothelioma of the pleura.
