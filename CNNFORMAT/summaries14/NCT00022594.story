(secondQuint)Liposomal Lurtotecan in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Locally Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the therapeutic activity of lurtotecan liposome in patients with metastatic or loco-regionally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

 - Determine the objective response, duration of response, and time to progression in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the possible pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to presence of a target lesion in a previously irradiated field (within vs outside).

 Patients receive lurtotecan liposome IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 6 weeks.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38-72 patients (19-36 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal lurtotecan in treating patients who have metastatic or locally recurrent head and neck cancer.
