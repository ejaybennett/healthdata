(secondQuint)PS-341 in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective tumor response in women with metastatic breast cancer treated with bortezomib.

 - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the progression-free survival in patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds twice weekly for 2 weeks.

 Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-24 months.
