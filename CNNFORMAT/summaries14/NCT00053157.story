(fifthQuint)Sargramostim in Reducing Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients Who Are Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplantation for Hematologic Cancer or Aplastic Anemia.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of sargramostim (GM-CSF) to mobilize CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells in donors and to reduce graft-vs-host disease in patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for hematologic malignancy or aplastic anemia.

 - Determine the safety of GM-CSF after allogeneic SCT transplantation in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

 - Donors: Donors receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 1-6.

 Donors undergo stem cell harvest on day 7.

 Donors may undergo up to 3 apheresis procedures to reach the target stem cell dose and may receive additional GM-CSF prior to each collection.

 - Patients: Patients receive conditioning therapy as per transplantation protocol RP98-15.

 Patients undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation on day 0.

 Patients then receive GM-CSF SC once daily beginning on day 7 and continuing until blood counts recover.

 Patients are followed weekly until day 100 and then at days 180 and 360.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients and 10 donors will be accrued for this study.

 Sargramostim in Reducing Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients Who Are Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplantation for Hematologic Cancer or Aplastic Anemia@highlight

RATIONALE: Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

 Giving sargramostim to the stem cell donor and the patient may reduce the chance of developing graft-versus-host disease following stem cell transplantation.

 PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of sargramostim in decreasing graft-versus-host disease in patients who are undergoing donor stem cell transplantation for hematologic cancer or aplastic anemia.
