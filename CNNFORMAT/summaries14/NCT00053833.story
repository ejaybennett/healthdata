(secondQuint)S0025 Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Refractory Ovarian Epithelial, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial response rates of patients with platinum- and taxane-refractory ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer treated with irinotecan.

 - Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

 - Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8.

 Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.
