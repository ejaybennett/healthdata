(fifthQuint)HerpeVac Trial for Young Women.

 This study is a double-blind, randomized, controlled Phase III trial to assess the prophylactic efficacy and safety of gD-Alum/MPL vaccine in the prevention of genital herpes disease in young women who are herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and -2 seronegative.

 The primary efficacy objective is to evaluate vaccine efficacy in the prevention of genital herpes disease caused by HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 between months 2 and 20 in healthy adult women who were initially HSV-1 and HSV-2 seronegative.

 The secondary efficacy objectives are to: evaluate vaccine efficacy in the prevention of genital herpes disease caused by HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 occurring between the months 7 and 20; evaluate vaccine efficacy in the prevention of HSV-2 infection between months 2 and 20; and to evaluate vaccine efficacy in the prevention of HSV-2 infection occurring between months 7 and 20.

 The study will enroll approximately 7,550 women, ages 18-30 years.

 Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 possible study groups: candidate vaccine; or control vaccine (hepatitis A vaccine).

 The study duration for each subject will be approximately 20 months.

 Study procedures will include 9 scheduled study visits (including the screening visit) and additional unscheduled visits for evaluation of suspected herpes disease episodes.

 Three doses of vaccine or control will be administered intramuscularly in the non-dominant deltoid on a 0, 1, and 6 month schedule.

 Subjects will attend clinic visits at screening, months 2, 7, 12, 16, and 20.

 In subjects who present with suspected herpes disease between months 17 and 20, an additional visit to collect a serum sample will be scheduled 3 months after the evaluation for suspected genital herpes.

 HerpeVac Trial for Young Women@highlight

The primary purpose of this study is to see if a herpes vaccine may prevent genital herpes disease in women who are not infected.

 The study will enroll approximately 7550 healthy women.

 These women will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 possible study groups: herpes vaccine (experimental group) or hepatitis A vaccine (control group).

 Participants will receive their assigned vaccine at 0, 1, and 6 months.

 Participants will have 9 scheduled study visits and additional unscheduled visits for an evaluation of herpes if it is suspected.

 Participants will be involved in study related procedures for up to 20 months.
