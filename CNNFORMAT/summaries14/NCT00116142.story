(firstQuint)Hormone Suppression and Radiation Therapy for 6 Months With/Without Docetaxel for High Risk Prostate Cancer.

 Radiation therapy plus six months of hormone therapy is one standard way of treating men with high-risk prostate cancer.

 In this study, we want to see whether or not adding the chemotherapy drug docetaxel (Taxotere)will make this treatment more effective.

 Docetaxel has shown a benefit in median survival when given to men who have become resistant to hormonal therapy and in men who have metastatic prostate cancer (spread to other areas of the body).
