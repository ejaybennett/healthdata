(secondQuint)Stem Cells in Myocardial Infarction.

 Intracoronary infusion of bone-marrow stem cells after a ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) seems to improve cardiac function.

 An alternative strategy is increase of circulating stem cells by mobilisation from the bone marrow with Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF).

 Objective: To determine the short-term (30 days) safety of G-CSF therapy after a STEMI treated with acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

 Methods: Patients with STEMI treated with PCI 1/2g/kg/d) or placebo for 6 days in a double-blind design.

 Other inclusion criteria: age 20-70 years, culprit lesion in a large coronary artery, and peak CKMB >100 microgram/L.

 Follow-up was done after 1, 5 and 6 months, with an angiogram at 5 months.

The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effect of treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) bone marrow stimulation on circulating stem cells' ability to develop new blood vessels in the myocardium after an acute myocardial infarction.
