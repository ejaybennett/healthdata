5% Roxithromycin Lotion for Androgenetic Alopecia.

 The topical therapy for androgenetic alopecia is still not enough to improve cosmetically.

 Thereforem we try to find new effective and safe topical therapy for this disease.

 Roxithromycin has not only antibacterial action but also immunomodulatory and anti-inflamatory potency.

 For example, roxitromycin inhibits T cell responces to mitogens and production of cytokines, IL-2 and IL-5.

 We firstly found that roxitromycin increased human and murine hair elongation in vitro to inhibit apoptosis of hair bulb.

 Then, we wish to apply roxithromycin on the therapy for androgenetic alopecia.
