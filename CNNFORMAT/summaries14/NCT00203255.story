(thirdQuint)Clinical Study Examining Use of an Over-the-Counter Supplement for the Prevention of Menstrually-Associated Migraine Headache.

 Many women have increased headache attacks at the time of their period (menses).

 The migraines experienced around the menstrual cycle are most often associated with premenstrual complaints such as nausea, backache and breast tenderness.

 The condition of hormone-related headache (i.

e.

 menstrual migraine) is unclear.

 Soy isoflavones have been used to alleviate the symptoms of menopause.

 They contain natural estrogens (female hormones).

 Since menstrual migraine is thought to be associated with the withdrawal of estrogen, or the natural fall of estrogen levels, the use of this natural source of estrogen may be helpful in the prevention of menstrually-associated migraine.

The purpose of this trial is to study the use of soy isoflavones in the prevention of menstrually-associated migraines.

 Additionally, this trial may provide insight into the menstrual cycle and menstrually-related headaches in women.

 With this information, we may be able to change current treatment methods or even develop new methods in order to advance current approaches in the treatment of menstrual migraine.
