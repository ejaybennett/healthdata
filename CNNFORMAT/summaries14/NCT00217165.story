(firstQuint)Taurine as an Anti-Manic Agent: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.

 Taurine is an amino acid that has some actions similar to mood stabilizers.

 Taurine is widely sold as a component of over-the-counter mood enhancing agents.

 However, controlled studies examining the mood effects of taurine are limited.

 An initial study in this laboratory looked at taurine's mood effects in individuals with bipolar disorder.

 This follow-up study is designed to further examine taurine's effects on manic symptoms.

 Subjects in the current follow-up study will add taurine or placebo to their current treatment regimen.

 Both depressive and manic symptoms will be tracked for three months to determine whether the addition of taurine affects mood symptoms.
