(thirdQuint)Study of NGX-4010 for the Treatment of Painful HIV-Associated Neuropathy (HIV-AN) or Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN).

 Study C118 is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study for subjects who successfully completed a previous NGX-4010 study and have not received open-label or blinded NGX-4010 study patches within the 12 weeks prior to study entry.

 One hundred eligible subjects will receive an initial open-label NGX-4010 study patch application and up to three additional open-label NGX-4010 applications at intervals of no less than 12 weeks, based on the presence or return of pain.

 Eligible subjects will have moderate to severe neuropathic pain secondary to HIV-AN or PHN, with average pain levels deemed appropriate for further treatment with NGX-4010 as judged by the Investigator.
