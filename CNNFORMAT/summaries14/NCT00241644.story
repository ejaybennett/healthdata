 Vaccine Efficacy Against Rotavirus Diarrhea; Vaccine Given With Routine Childhood Vaccinations in Healthy African Infants@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to determine if the GSK Biologicals' human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine (pooled HRV groups) given concomitantly with routine expanded program on immunisation (EPI) vaccinations can prevent severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (11 on the 20-point Vesikari scoring system [Ruuska, 1990]) caused by the circulating wild-type RV strains during the period from 2 weeks after the last dose of HRV vaccine or placebo until Visit 5.

 The primary objective will be reached if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) on vaccine efficacy is >0%.
