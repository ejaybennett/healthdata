(thirdQuint)Comparison of Delta-8-THC to Ondansetron in the Prevention of Acute Nausea From Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy.

 The study is comparing the use of inhaled delata-8-THC in the prevention of nausea and vomitting in patients being treated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, and the patients will continue use for 3 days afterward.

 Patients will be given rescue medication and will fill out VAS scales for nausea, pain, appetite and dizziness.

 Patients will be treated for 2 cycles, one cycle receiving active drug (one of 2 doses) and the other placebo.

 Patients receiving placebo will receive ondansetron injection before chemo and patients receiving active drug will receive a normal saline injection.

 Patients will take the drug 4 times daily for 3 days.

 The patients will return to clinic for a visit after 24-48 hours and 4 days.

 Patients will bring a urine sample to measure metabolite.

 Patients will be given a diary to monitor dosing and side effects as well as concomitant medication.

 The study will be conducted in 2 - 3 centers.

 There will be 108 patients enrolled with 27 in each of 4 groups: Group 1 cycle 1 - Placebo cycle 2 - 300 mcg of delta-8-THC per dose Group 2 cycle 1 - Placebo cycle 2 - 600 mcg of delta-8-THC per dose Group 3 cycle 1 - 300 mcg of delta-8-THC per doseGroup cycle 2 - Placebo Group 4 cycle 1 - 600 mcg of delta-8-THC per dose cycle 2 - placebo.
