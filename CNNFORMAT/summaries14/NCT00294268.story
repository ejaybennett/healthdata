(secondQuint)Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Obesity.

 The primary aim of the present study is to improve the maintenance of weight loss, and hence the physical, psychological and social well-being, of obese patients who have sought weight loss treatment.

 To do so, it will implement a cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) with motivational enhancement strategies specifically designed to target weight maintenance.

 It is hypothesized that the maintenance-oriented CBT approach will result in sustained weight loss, as well as improved physical, psychological and social well-being.
