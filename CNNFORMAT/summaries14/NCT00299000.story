(secondQuint)A Phase 4 Two Dose Level Study of Naglazyme(TM) (Galsulfase) in Infants With MPS VI.

 The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of two dose levels of Naglazyme in preventing the progression of skeletal dysplasia in infants under the age of one year who have MPS VI by monitoring physical appearance, x-ray of the skeletal system and growth.

 The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the two dose levels of Naglazyme in preventing several measures of disease progression in infants under the age of one year who have MPS VI by monitoring urinary GAGs, gross and fine motor function, cardiac function, vision, hearing, and use of health resources.

 The safety objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of two dose levels of Naglazyme in infants under the age of one year who have MPS VI.
