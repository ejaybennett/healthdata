(fifthQuint)Anaesthesia With Propofol Versus Midazolam : Effect on Oxidative Stress in the Brain of Head Trauma Patients.

 Severe traumatic brain injury is associated with an increased production of free radicals causing brain damage.

 First line treatment of these patients aims to maintain cerebral perfusion and includes deep anaesthesia.

 Propofol has recently shown anti oxidant properties that need to be confirmed when used in these patients.

 The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of propofol compared to midazolam on intra cerebral oxidative stress following severe traumatic brain injury.

 Measurements will be performed by use of intracerebral microdialysis.
