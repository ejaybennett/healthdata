(secondQuint)Intra-arterial Stem Cell Therapy for Patients With Chronic Limb Ischemia (CLI).

 Despite advances in surgical and radiological vascular techniques, a significant number of patients with chronic critical limb ischaemia (CLI) are not eligible for revascularization procedures, often leaving amputation as the only option.

 Consequently, exploring new strategies for revascularization of ischemic limbs is of major importance.

 Preclinical studies and pioneering clinical trials suggest that administration of bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells (MNC) into ischemic limbs enhances neovascularization, improves tissue perfusion and prevents amputation.

 However, no definite proof is available as the clinical studies thus far have been small and lacked double-blinded controls.

 JUVENTAS is a randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial in 109 - 160 patients with CLI to investigate the potential clinical effects of repeated intra-arterial infusion of BM-MNC in these patients (the exact number of patients to be included cannot be specified in advance because of the planned group sequential interim analyses).

 In addition, it will study the functional characteristics of the BM-MNC obtained from CLI patients and relate BM-MNC dysfunction to clinical outcome.

The purposes of this study are to determine whether intra-arterial injection of autologous stem cells is effective in the treatment of chronic limb ischemia (CLI), to characterize stem cell dysfunction in patients with CLI, and to relate the stem cell function with clinical outcome.
