(thirdQuint)A Multifaceted Intervention to Improve Hand Hygiene.

 A cluster randomized controlled trial of the intervention will be conducted where hospital units (wards) in three hospitals will be allocated to either the intervention or usual practise.

 We will stratify by hospital site in order to minimize confounding by hospital-level factors.

 The unit of allocation, intervention, and analysis will be at the level of the hospital unit.

 Thirty hospital units will be randomized to either the intervention or comparison arm.

 We will compare adherence to hand hygiene, MRSA rates, and other outcomes between the two study arms.
