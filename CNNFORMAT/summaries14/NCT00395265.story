(fifthQuint)Evaluating the Relationship Between Blood Clotting Disorders, Inflammation, and Obesity in Individuals With Venous Disorders and Post-Thrombotic Syndrome.

 The long-term effects of venous thrombosis, known collectively as PTS, include persistent swelling, pain, cramps, and numbness in the leg.

 These symptoms result from impaired return of blood through the veins of the lower leg to the heart.

 PTS is believed to occur as a result of direct damage to the valves and walls of the vein.

 There may be specific factors that make certain individuals more prone to PTS.

 Individuals who are obese, have a genetic predisposition to blood clotting disorders, or have high levels of inflammation biomarkers may have an increased risk of developing venous diseases.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible link between these factors and the occurrence of chronic venous disease and PTS.

 The study's findings will be useful in developing new prevention and treatment strategies.

 This study will examine previously collected data from participants in the San Diego Population Study, a study that gathered information on the prevalence of chronic venous disease in a multi-ethnic group of individuals.

 There will be no study visits specifically for this study.

 Researchers will examine stored genetic and biologic samples of 370 control participants and 370 participants with chronic venous disease.

 Specifically, levels of inflammation biomarkers, levels of obesity-related biomarkers, and genetic predispositions for blood clotting disorders will be studied.

 Evaluating the Relationship Between Blood Clotting Disorders, Inflammation, and Obesity in Individuals With Venous Disorders and Post-Thrombotic Syndrome@highlight

Venous thrombosis is the development of a blood clot in a vein.

 Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a painful condition that can develop following a venous thrombosis in one of the deep veins of the leg.

 While PTS is mainly thought to occur because of damage to the vein, other factors may be responsible for the development of this condition.

 This study will analyze genetic and biologic samples from participants of a previous study to examine other possible causes of venous diseases and PTS.
