(fifthQuint)Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Patients With Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (PETHEMA LPA 2005).

 Treatment of induction with the simultaneous administration of ATRA (45 mg/m2 day until the RC) and idarubicine (12 mg/m2 days 2, 4, 6 and 8), 3 monthly cycles of consolidation with ATRA (45 mg/m2 days 1-15) and idarubicine (5 mg/m2 days 1-4) in the cycle #1, mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2 days 1-3) in the cycle #2 and idarubicine (12 mg/m2 day 1) in the cycle #3.

 The consolidation was reinforced for the group of patients with intermediate risk by means of an increase of the idarubicine to 7 mg in the cycle #1 and to 2 days in the cycle #3.

 In the patients of high risk, the consolidation was reinforced with the addition of altar-c in the cycles #1 and #3.

 For the maintenance treatment, one will administer to intermittent ATRA (15 days every 3 months) and chemotherapy low doses with methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurina during two years.

 Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Patients With Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (PETHEMA LPA 2005)@highlight

Primary objectives - To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a risk-adapted protocol that use idarubicin for induction and consolidation therapy in patients with APL.

 - To evaluate the impact of mitoxantrone reduction on the event-free, disease-free, and overall survival, as well as on the duration of remission and cumulative incidence of relapse in low- and intermediate-risk patients with APL.

 - To evaluate the impact of the addition of ara-C to idarubicin courses of consolidation for high-risk patients (administered as in the original GIMEMA protocols) on the event-free, disease-free, and overall survival, as well as on the duration of remission and cumulative incidence of relapse.

 - To evaluate the toxicity of the induction, consolidation, and maintenance chemotherapy in the whole series and in each treatment group in patients with APL.

 Secondary objectives cent To compare all outcomes with those achieved with the PETHEMA LPA99 protocol.
