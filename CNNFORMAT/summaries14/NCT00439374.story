(secondQuint)RCT of Progesterone to Prevent Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women With a Short Cervix.

 Preterm births, defined as the delivery of a baby less than 37 weeks of gestation, are responsible for the majority of neonatal mortality and morbidities.

 Studies have shown that a number of risk factors, including never having a baby before and having a short cervix are associated with early delivery.

 Recently the NICHD did a study in women who were pregnant again after having delivered preterm.

 It showed that giving 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) medication during pregnancy decreased the chance of delivering another preterm baby by 34%.

 This placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial will address the primary research question: does treatment with 17P initiated before 23 weeks of gestation prevent delivery prior to 37 weeks in nulliparous women with a singleton gestation who have a short cervix?.

The purpose of this study is to see if giving progesterone medication to pregnant women, who have never delivered a baby after 19 weeks of pregnancy and who have a short cervix, lowers the risk of early delivery and improves the health of their baby.
