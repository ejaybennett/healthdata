(firstQuint)External Micropulse Diode Laser Transscleral Trabeculoplasty (EMDLT) for Severe Open Angle Glaucoma.

 Micropulse diode laser trabeculoplasty applied through a gonioscopy len has been shown to be effective in lower the pressure for patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).

 We believe that applied externally, the contact diode micropulse laser will be effective in lowering intraocular pressure for patients with advance open angle glaucoma with minimal side effects.
