(thirdQuint)Evaluation of the Use of a Urin Test Strip to Determine the Spread of Schistosoma Infections in Areas Where Schistosomiasis Infections Are Low in Kenya.

 The study will compare the use of the urine test strip with the conventional method used and with a "golden standard" methode, in an area of Kenya where the infection transmission is low.

 Furthermore will the urine test strip be evaluatied in its ability to monitor the intensity of infections in school children before and after they are been treated for the infections.

 A total of 1100 school children in the age between 10 and 18 years will be included in the study.

 Children have to submitt a stool and a urine sample on three consecutive days.

 Children who are found to be infected with the schistosomiasis parasite will be offered treatment.
