(secondQuint)Dasatinib in Treating Patients With Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE I.

 Determine the efficacy of dasatinib in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE II.

 Determine the objective response rate (complete and partial response) in patients treated with this drug.

 III.

 Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

 IV.

 Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-21.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at least every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 3 years.
