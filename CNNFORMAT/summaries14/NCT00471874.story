(firstQuint)Study Evaluating Health Related Utility in Rheumatoid Arthritis.

 At a routine visit to the clinic, patients will be asked to answer questions about their symptoms, have a routine examination by the doctor, fill out a questionnaire that will ask questions about them, about their arthritis, about how it affects their well being and quality of life, and about treatment and costs.

 The questionnaire will take them about 30 minutes to complete.

 A blood test may also be required.

 This ends the patient's involvement with the study.
