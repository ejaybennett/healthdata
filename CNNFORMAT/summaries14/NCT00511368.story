(thirdQuint)Phase 2 Safety and Efficacy Study of Bevirimat Functional Monotherapy in HIV Treatment-Experienced Patients for 2 Weeks*.

 Bevirimat (PA103001-04) represents a new class of antivirals that blocks HIV replication by disrupting virus maturation; specifically, by inhibiting a late step in the Gag processing cascade.

 Short term (7-10 days) functional monotherapy studies (conducted in patients with detectable viral loads on a failing regimen)help in determining the potency of the drug, and enable dose finding.

 This is a two part (A and B)randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study in HIV treatment-experienced patients on a failing regimen (harboring resistance mutations to at least one member of the NRTI, NNRTI or PI classes.

 The antiretroviral activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of up to 5 different dose levels of bevirimat will be compared to placebo when added to a failing approved antiretroviral regimen.

 The study is conducted in two parts: A and B.

 In Part A following 14 days of daily dosing patients commenced a new optimized ART regimen in addition to their randomized treatment.

 In Part Part B dosing with the randomized treatment ends after the initial 14 days of daily dosing.

 Phase 2 Safety and Efficacy Study of Bevirimat Functional Monotherapy in HIV Treatment-Experienced Patients for 2 Weeks*@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate antiretroviral activity of up to five different oral doses administered for two weeks of bevirimat versus placebo in HIV treatment experienced patients, who have documented genotypic resistance to at least one major mutation from the IAS-USA list (2007)of resistance mutations for NRTIs, NNRTIs, or PIs.

 Patients will also be monitored for side effects, and the pharmacokinetics of bevirimat will be determined.
