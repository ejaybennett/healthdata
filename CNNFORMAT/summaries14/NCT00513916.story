(thirdQuint)Effect of Dietary Soy on Estrogens in Breast Fluid, Blood, and Urine Samples From Healthy Women.

 OBJECTIVES: - Examine the effects of two daily servings of soy on estrogen levels in nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) and serum.

 - Investigate cytologic patterns of epithelial breast cells obtained from NAF as a measure of proliferation in relation to soy intake.

 - Explore the effect of two daily servings of soy on cytochrome alterations of estrogen metabolism as expressed in the formation of urinary 2-, 16-, and 4-hydroxy estrogen metabolites.

 - Compare estrogen levels in NAF and serum measured at the same time during the luteal phase.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

 - Arm I: Participants partake in a high soy diet consisting of 2 daily soy servings (approximately 50mg isoflavones).

 The choice of soy foods will include 1/2 cup of tofu, 3/4 cup of soy milk, or 1/4 cup of soy nuts.

 Replacement of currently consumed foods with soy foods will be encouraged.

 - Arm II: Participants will be asked to keep their soy intake below 3 servings per week.

 The participants will also receive general nutrition counseling.

 In both arms, intervention continues for 6 months.

 After 6 months, participants undergo a 1-month washout period and then cross-over to the other intervention arm.

 Nipple aspirate fluid, urine, and blood samples are collected periodically to measure laboratory endpoints.

RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming.

 Eating a diet high in isoflavones, compounds found in soy foods, may keep cancer from forming.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying the effects of dietary soy on estrogens in breast fluid, blood, and urine samples from healthy women.
