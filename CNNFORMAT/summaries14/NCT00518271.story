(secondQuint)Study Comparing Standard Dose and Reduced Dose Tacrolimus + Sirolimus + Corticosteroids in Renal Allograft Recipients.

 This study evaluated renal graft function based on calculated creatinine clearance at 6 months after transplantation in patients receiving a regimen of 'reduced' or 'standard' dose tacrolimus plus sirolimus and corticosteroids.

 Blood serum creatinine, the incidence of biopsy-confirmed acute graft rejection, and patient and graft survival were also evaluated at 6 months post transplantation.
