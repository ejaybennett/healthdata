(secondQuint)Cardiovascular Safety Research: Bupivacaine With Vasoconstrictor Versus Ropivacaine in Brachial Plexus Block.

 The intoxication by Bupivacaine is considered life threatening.

 Currently the most safety local anesthetic in substitution to bupivacaine is ropivacaine, however in Brasil there is a bupivacaine mixture of 75% levobupivacaine plus 25% racemic bupivacaine.

 The research design is: Patients involved: 48; age: 18 to 40 years old; both sex; ASA I and II.

 Surgery: elective upper extremity orthopedic surgery.

 Anesthesia technique: brachial plexus block.

 Primary endpoint: cardiovascular safety; analysis by continuous Holter.

 Secondary endpoint: anesthetic and analgesic efficacy.

 Cardiovascular Safety Research: Bupivacaine With Vasoconstrictor Versus Ropivacaine in Brachial Plexus Block@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if bupivacaine (75% levobupivacaine plus 25% racemic bupivacaine) with vasoconstrictor is effective and safety as ropivacaine in brachial plexus block for orthopedic surgery.
