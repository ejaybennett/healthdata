(thirdQuint)Monitoring Functional Variation in the Breast During Menstrual Cycle by Using Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy.

 Variations in breast physiology due to hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle can correlate to quantitative changes in Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy functional parameters such as hemoglobin, lipid and water concentration and tissue scattering.

 Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy imaging can show increase blood flow in breast tissue after ovulation with a concomitant increase in mitotic activity, changes in hemoglobin concentration and in tissue scattering.

 Increases in fibroglandular breast tissue after ovulation have also been observed.

 Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy imaging can determine after time of ovulation has been detected during the two months of self-monitoring.

 Monitoring Functional Variation in the Breast During Menstrual Cycle by Using Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy@highlight

The purpose of this study is to do determine the changes in physiological and optical properties in healthy pre-menopausal breast tissue during the menstrual cycle using Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy.

 The Researcher can determine 1) how large variations in breast tissue components are 2) how predictable and repeatable these variations are 3) the effects of endogenous hormones on breast tissue physiology.
