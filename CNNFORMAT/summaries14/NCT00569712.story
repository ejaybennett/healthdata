(fifthQuint)Studying Genes in Blood and Lung Fluid Samples From Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease With or Without a Previous Diagnosis of Lung Cancer or With Asthma Treated With Budesonide and Formoterol.

 OBJECTIVES: - To collect and integrate background information on the genetic, epigenetic, and gene expression profiles of small airway cells and markers of inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with or without a prior diagnosis of lung cancer and from patients with asthma.

 - To examine the effects of budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate inhalation aerosol (Symbicort Turbuhaler) on methylation and gene expression profiles of airway cells as well as on inflammatory, oxidant, and other pathways in these patients.

 - To determine if it would be feasible to conduct a larger study that would allow a definitive analysis of the differences in the bronchial cells and the inflammatory proteins in bronchial secretions and blood from patients with COPD with or without a prior diagnosis of lung cancer.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate inhalation aerosol (Symbicort Turbuhaler) twice daily for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicities.

 Patients undergo blood sample collection and bronchoscopy at baseline and at 4 weeks.

 Blood and bronchoalveolar fluid samples are analyzed for inflammatory biomarker measurements.

 Bronchial brushing cell samples are analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization array, whole genome methylation array, and gene expression profiling.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 week by telephone interview.

 Studying Genes in Blood and Lung Fluid Samples From Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease With or Without a Previous Diagnosis of Lung Cancer or With Asthma Treated With Budesonide and Formoterol@highlight

RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of blood and lung fluid in the laboratory from patients receiving budesonide and formoterol may help doctors learn more about the effect of budesonide and formoterol on gene expression and biomarkers.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genes in blood and lung fluid samples from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with or without a previous diagnosis of lung cancer, or with asthma treated with budesonide and formoterol.
