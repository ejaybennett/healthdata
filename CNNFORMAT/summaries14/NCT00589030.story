(thirdQuint)Yttrium Y 90 Radiolabeled Glass Beads in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Provide supervised access to treatment with yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere(R)) to eligible patients with primary cancer to the liver and who are not surgical resection candidates.

 - Evaluate patient experience and toxicities associated with TheraSphere(R) treatment.

 - Enter treatment experience into a liver database.

 Secondary - Determine the tumor response rates in patients receiving this treatment.

 OUTLINE: This is a humanitarian device exemption use study.

 Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere(R)) via percutaneous hepatic arterial infusion.

 Patients may be retreated between 30-90 days after the initial infusion.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days and then annually thereafter for up to 2 years.

RATIONALE: Internal radiation therapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells.

 Using radiolabeled glass beads to kill tumor cells may be effective treatment for liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

 PURPOSE: To provide expanded access and study the side effects of yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.
