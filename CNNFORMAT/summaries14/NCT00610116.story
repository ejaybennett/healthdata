(secondQuint)Electronic Repositioning With Acuity and Easytrak Leads.

 "Bipolar leads for left ventricular pacing (LVP) such as the newly available ACUITY TM or the standard EASYTRAK TM II and EASYTRAK TM III leads from GUIDANT in combination with suitable devices for cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) allow for the non-invasive programming of different LVP configurations.

 Hence, this Electronic RepositioningTM (ER) may help physicians to overcome problems in CRT such as ineffective biventricular pacing, high LVP thresholds and phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) without the need for an additional patient's operation to reposition LV leads.

The ERACE study it a multi-centre, prospective, non-randomized clinical study to document and evaluate appropriate performance of GUIDANT's Electronic Repositioning cent in the clinical routine with respect to the following major aspects: avoidance of PNS and low LVP thresholds (for low battery consumption and extended device longevity) in standard cardiale resynchronisations therapy (CRT).
