(thirdQuint)Optimized Treatment Algorithm for Patients With Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

 In newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis patients it is recommended to treat as soon as possible with methotrexate and steroids However, this treatment algorithm, will only bring one third of the patients into remission and cannot stop progressive, persistent joint damage.

 The possible benefits and risks of adding adalimumab to this conventional treatment algorithm is unknown.

 The aim of the study is to clarify the possible benefits of adding adalimumab an anti-TNF-alfa inhibitor versus placebo to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patients, who are treated very early and given methotrexate and intraarticular triamcinolone hexacetonide.

 Efficacy will be evaluated by DAS 28, ACR 20/50/70, HAQ, progressive changes in X-ray, MRI and DXA-scans.

 Adverse events will also be registered.
