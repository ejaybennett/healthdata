(thirdQuint)Assessment of the Treatment of Severely Burned With Anabolic Agents on Clinical Outcomes, Recovery and Rehabilitation.

 The University of Texas Medical Branch(UTMB) project improves outcomes for severely burned children by instituting and evaluating two modifications to traditional rehabilitation: (1) an intensive rehabilitation program including active resistance exercise; (2) long term administration of anabolic agents.

 Effectiveness is assessed by comparison with functional outcomes achieved in traditional outpatient rehabilitation programs.

 Results indicate improvement in strength, endurance and bone density with these modifications.

 The project also maintains a longitudinal database that includes measures of cardiopulmonary function, growth and maturation, bone density, range of motion, and psychosocial adjustment.

The purpose of the program is to study and characterize the outcome of burn injury with particular attention to improving the rehabilitation of burn survivors, including children.

 Various agents are assessed for effectiveness on long term burn outcome, such as growth hormone, oxandrolone, propranolol,ketoconazole, inhospital exercise and home exercise.
