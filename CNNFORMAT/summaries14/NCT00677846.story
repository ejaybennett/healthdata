(fifthQuint)Venous Thrombus Investigation With Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Imaging.

 1.

 Study set up and Study design It will be an open, non-randomized prospective clinical pilot study to assess the value of contrast agents in venous thrombus investigations.

 a.

 Hypothesis - The relative signal intensity increase in decibel after intravenous contrast media injection as a tool to measure thrombus - revascularization, assessed in defined regions of interests in the thrombus is smaller in acute occluding ( 2000 ultrasound investigations, specialty degree in ultrasound investigation IP and DG).

 The visibility score according to the one described by Gehrig et al is assessed.

 The scores are compared for the 2 investigators as well as for the 3 investigation modes.

 4.

 Inclusion criteria - Age > 18 and sitting position) 3.

 Study Endpoints Primary study endpoint: Detection of re - vascularization in > 3 months old thrombosis in patients with initially occluded veins, assessed with ultrasound contrast agent, the parameter used will be the difference between baseline and peak of the time intensity curve.

 Secondary study endpoint: Visibility of the newly developed small vessels in patients with occluding thrombus assessment during application of contrast agent, with color Doppler and power Doppler mode.

 The parameter used will be the visibility score.

 4.

 Sample size Sample size is estimated to 9 patients in each group assuming a significant difference of 4.

7 % for the mean values for the "time to peak" in patients with acute compared to chronic thrombosis with a significance level (alpha) of 0.

05 and a power of 95 % (beta) assuming a standard deviation of 2.

 Sample size calculation was performed using Graphpad Prism 4.

0b and StatMate 2.

 5.

 Statistics All parameters are analyzed as an independent unit.

 Statistical analysis will be calculated using the Stat View software package version 5.

0 for Mac OS 9 (Stat View Software by Abacus C.

, Berkley, California) and Graph Pad Prism version 4 for Mac OS X (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, California).

 Results will be given in median and interquartile ranges.

 Comparison between visits in the same patients will be done by the non-parametric, paired Wilcoxon signed rank test or if more than two groups are involved the Kruskal Wallis test.

 A probability level of < 0.

05 will be considered significant.

 The inter - reader agreement will be measured using the kappa value.

 Venous Thrombus Investigation With Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Imaging@highlight

Background: During the repair process of deep venous thrombosis, capillary formation is seen from day 18 to day 25.

 Contrast agent investigation is well known to detect small vessels in arterial disease.

 We intend to use this method to detect early vascularisation in the thrombus, in order to get more information about the evolution of the thrombosis in vivo.

 Aims of the study: Investigation of a newly diagnosed occluding venous thrombus with duplexsonography, using contrast agent and compare the degree of vascularization in the same patient after 3 weeks and 3 months.

 The relative signal intensity difference (baseline to peak) of the time intensity curve (TIC) is measured in defined region of interests (ROI).

 Comparison of the visibility of revascularisation between color duplexsonography, power mode and contrast agent will be done.

 Method: Patients with venous thrombosis of the proximal limb veins (femoral or popliteal vein) will be investigated with ultrasound agent in supine position.

 5 ml of the contrast agent sulfur hexafluoride is given intravenously into a vein of the dorsal foot.

 The measurements are done in a defined area, where the thrombus is fully occluding in color Doppler investigation.

 The regions of interest will be the vessel walls and the centre of the thrombus in cross section view.

 The signal intensities are measured at baseline and peak (in decibel) in the centre and in the peripheral part of the vein.

 20 patients with acute deep venous thrombosis will be included in this pilot study and investigated at baseline, after 3 weeks and 3 months.

 Previously (before contrast agent application), the veins are investigated with color - and power Doppler to test visibility in comparison to the contrast agent investigation.
