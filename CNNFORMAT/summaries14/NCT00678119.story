(firstQuint)Study Testing the Biologic Activity and Safety of a Immunotherapeutic in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Advanced Stage Kidney Cancer in Combination With a Marketed Renal Cell Carcinoma Treatment.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate an anticancer immunotherapeutic, AGS-003, when used in combination with sunitinib (the treatment regimen) in a single-stage, Phase II design in subjects with previously untreated advanced stage RCC after nephrectomy/excisional biopsy/metastasectomy.

 AGS-003 is formulated using mature DCs co-electroporated with CD40L IVT RNA and autologous total tumor RNA.
