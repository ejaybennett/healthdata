(secondQuint)Corifollitropin Alfa in Participants Undergoing Repeated Controlled Ovarian Stimulation (COS) Cycles Using a Multiple Dose Gonadatropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Antagonist Protocol (Study 38825)(P05714).

 This trial is designed as an open-label, uncontrolled, repeated cycle trial to assess the non-immunogenicity and safety of corifollitropin alfa in participants undergoing repeated COS cycles for in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using a multiple dose GnRH antagonist protocol.

 The trial period per participant will cover 1, 2 or 3 COS treatment cycles and no more than three (in-between two stimulation cycles) Frozen-Thawed Embryo Transfer (FTET) cycles following either or both of the first two treatment cycles.

 In each stimulation cycle, participants receive a single injection of corifollitropin alfa and one week later, treatment is continued with a daily dose of any FSH-containing preparation up to the day of (rec)hCG administration for final oocyte maturation.

 Assessment of anti-corifollitropin alfa antibodies and local tolerance after corifollitropin alfa injection are important safety endpoints in this trial.

The objective of the trial is to assess the non-immunogenicity and safety of corifollitropin alfa (also known as Org 36286, SCH 900962 and MK-8962) in participants undergoing repeated COS cycles using a multiple dose GnRH antagonist protocol.
