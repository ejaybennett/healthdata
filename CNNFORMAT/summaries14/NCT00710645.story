(fifthQuint)Lido Workset Study.

 The information gathered from testing individuals with spasticity due to multiple sclerosis with the Lido Workset has been important in making adjustments to the Lido Workset to show a greater degree of sensitivity in assessing varying degrees of spasticity.

 Healthy control subjects will be used to compare the spasticity data of multiple sclerosis subjects with subjects with normal muscle tone to determine the sensitivity of the Lido measurements.

 The testing will be performed one time for each patient and will take approximately 25 minutes.

 The servo-controlled torque motor system will analyze resistance to passive movement of the knee.

 This testing may be repeated for a group of randomly selected subjects from both the MS subjects and control subjects.

 The testing for this subset of subjects will be done as follows: first session, second session one week after the first session, third session three weeks after the first session.

 The total length of time for participation in this study may be up to three weeks.

 This additional testing will be done in order to compare the results with the Lido data obtained at similar timepoints from the subjects enrolled in the Cannabis for Spasticity in MS study.

 Each subject will be given the option to participate in the extended testing or to decline.

 Lido Workset Study@highlight

This is a single-site, pilot study.

 In this study, we hope to learn if the Lido Workset is a sensitive measure of limb spasticity in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

 The Lido Workset is a FDA approved, non-invasive device which has been used to assess motor function and spasticity.

 The testing will take approximately 25 minutes.

 Subjects will lie down on a table and have a leg attached to the Lido Workset device arm.

 The Lido Workset will move the leg back and forth many times at different speeds.

 The Lido Workset will also analyze resistance to passive (while subject is not moving or resisting movement) movement of the wrist and knee.
