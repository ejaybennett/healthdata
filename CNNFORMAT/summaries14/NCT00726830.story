(thirdQuint)Methadone, Morphine, or Oxycodone in Treating Pain in Patients With Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To compare the effectiveness of an opioid rotation to oral methadone versus an opioid rotation to another long-acting strong opioid (sustained-release morphine or oxycodone) in controlling pain (i.

e.

, analgesia) in patients with cancer.

 Secondary - To compare the tolerability of an opioid rotation to oral methadone versus an opioid rotation to another long-acting strong opioid (sustained-release morphine or oxycodone).

 - To identify a subset of patients most likely to benefit from an opioid rotation to oral methadone, in terms of significant improvement in pain control or opioid tolerability.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to their baseline opioid (morphine vs oxycodone).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients are switched from their current opioid medication (oxycodone or morphine) to methadone.

 Patients receive oral methadone 2-3 times daily for 4 weeks.

 - Arm II: Patients currently receiving oxycodone are switched to sustained-release (SR) morphine.

 Patients currently receiving morphine are switched to SR oxycodone.

 Patients receive either oral SR morphine or oxycodone 2-3 times daily for 4 weeks.

 Patients are assessed for pain control and complete a symptom questionnaire on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 28.

 Methadone, Morphine, or Oxycodone in Treating Pain in Patients With Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Methadone, morphine, or oxycodone may help relieve pain caused by cancer.

 It is not yet known whether methadone is more effective than morphine or oxycodone in treating pain in patients with cancer.

 PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying methadone to see how well it works compared with morphine or oxycodone in treating pain in patients with cancer.
