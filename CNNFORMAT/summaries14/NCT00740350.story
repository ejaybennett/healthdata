(secondQuint)Logan Basic During Pregnancy on Labor and Childbirth.

 This study will be designed to test if the Logan Basic Technique system of adjusting pregnant women can reduce labor time and increase the ease of labor and delivery as compared to the labor times reported by Kilpatrick and Laros in the obstetric literature.

 It is proposed that women who have regular chiropractic care throughout pregnancy or at least for the third trimester will have an easier labor and delivery as well as a shorter labor time than is reported in the literature.
