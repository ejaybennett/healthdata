(firstQuint)A Randomized Control Trial to Assess Early Clinical and Functional Outcome of the ROCC and LCS Total Knee Implant Designs.

 This study compares two similar designs of cementless rotating bearing total condylar knee replacements.

 The study will be conducted at a single clinical unit with a senior orthopaedic surgeon implanting all devices.

Their performances will be assessed by clinical scores and comprehensive function outcome documentation undertaken by qualified physiotherapists.

 The persons undertaking the assessments will be blinded to which implants the patients have.
