(secondQuint)Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery Based on KDIGO Criteria.

 This was a single center study.

 We evaluated retrospectively patients from the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit in Hospital de Base, Sao Jose do Rio Preto Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

 Demographics, type of surgery, laboratory data and preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative information were retrieved from a prospectively collected database of 2878 patients older than 18 years undergoing isolated CABG (1786) or CVS (1092), from January 2003 to June 2013.

 After applying the exclusion criteria (51 patients with incomplete data and 23 patients with end-stage kidney disease) we analyzed 2804 patients in total, 1738 (62%) underwent CABG and 1066 (38%) underwent CVS.
