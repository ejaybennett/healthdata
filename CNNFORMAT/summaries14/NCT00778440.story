(fifthQuint)Risk Level of Suffering From Traffic Injury in Primary Health Care: LESIONAT Project.

 Methodology: Design: Observational, transversal, and multicentric research Field of study: 20 PHC users from urban areas Population of study: random consecutive sampling of 16 years old drivers with open medical history.

 Measure's tools: Two means for data collection: survey among health professionals with medical history and structured telephonic survey about behaviours and risk perceptions in drivers.

 Variables: Sociodemographic data, chronic pathologies related to TI, consumption of medications ,Alcohol consumption (AUDIT-C test), Psychoactive substances consumption (self declared), Level of perception of risk according to professionals.

 Telephone survey: Class and age of driving license, Type of roads, Weekly driving time, Safety behaviours, Record of collisions/injuries in last year,Self perception of health level(SF-12) andSelf perception of risk level.

 An descriptive analysis of population will be performed, a distribution of risk elements associated to TI will be described through bivariant analyses, and for describing the factors associated to perceived risk levels a linear regression multiple model will be built.

Main objectives: - To know the distribution of risk elements of traffic injuries Secondary objectives: - To study the distribution of risk elements related with the possibility of suffering from a TI in relation to medication, chronic health problems, and consumption of psychoactive substances (alcohol and others).

 - To know the relation between levels of perception of risk of suffering from a TI and the presence of chronic problems, medications, or consumption of psychoactive substances.
