(fifthQuint)Anti-Diabetic Effect of Gynostemma Pentaphyllum Tea as add-on Therapy With Sulfonylureas in Type 2 Diabetic Patients.

 In Vietnam, herbal extracts have been used as a long-standing tradition to treat diabetic patients, but effects of these extracts have not been studied adequately.

 Based on previous results in experimental animal, the investigators have selected the plant Gynostemma pentapyllum (GP), which grows in the mountain region of Northern Vietnam.

 GP extract had a hypoglycemic effect on mice and rat.

 In addition, GP has been shown to reduce both hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetic Zucker fatty rats.

The present study aimed at investigating effect of Gynostemma pentapyllum (GP) extract, administered as a "tea", as add-on therapy with Sulfonylurea (SU) in drug-naive patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

In addition to monitoring effects plasma glucose regulation, the investigators also studied possible effects on plasma lipids, kidney and liver function as well as body weight and blood pressure.
