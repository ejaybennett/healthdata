(firstQuint)Development of Pharmacogenomic Method to Predict Antidepressant Responsiveness.

 The difficulties to treat depressed patients are 1)the patients don't respond to antidepressant is about 40% of which, and 2) The time lag is existed until the patients respond to antidepressant and show the treatment effects.

 If it is predicted the response of antidepressant in advance, it would be overcome such problems.

 Drug response generally is known to be related to the individual genetic information and the environmental factors.

 We are going to investigation about antidepressant response using these approaches.

The Purpose of this study is to predict antidepressant response in advance using pharmacogenomics and peripheral biological markers in depressed patients.
