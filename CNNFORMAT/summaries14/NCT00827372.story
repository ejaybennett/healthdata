(thirdQuint)A Study of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Inhibition in Patients With Unilateral Upper Extremity Lymphedema Following Treatment for Cancer.

 Pazopanib inhibits the growth of blood vessels in tumors by inhibiting a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (commonly called VEGF).

 Pazopanib is not currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and therefore considered an experimental medication.

 High levels of VEGF cause blood vessels to leak fluid, increasing the pressure in tumors similar to the increased pressure in lymphedema.

 Previous studies have found that treatment with pazopanib decreases the fluid pressure in tumors.

 That is why we think pazopanib might be an effective treatment for lymphedema.

The major purpose of this study is to determine if a new drug called pazopanib decreases lymphedema in subjects previously treated for cancer.

 Lymphedema, or swelling of the arm, is a result of damage to the lymphatic vessels in the arm during surgery and/or radiation.

 The damaged vessels can not adequately drain fluid from the arm, resulting in increased pressure and swelling.

 Pazopanib has not previously been studied as a treatment for lymphedema.
