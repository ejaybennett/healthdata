(thirdQuint)n-3 Fatty Acid Infusion and Type 2 Diabetes.

 Evidence indicates that n-3 fatty acids exert several beneficial effects.

 However, the effects of marine n-3 fatty acids on intermediary metabolism have not been completely elucidated.

 In a previous study of a high intake of marine n-3 fatty acids during 9 wk we demonstrated reduced insulin sensitivity and altered proportion of carbohydrate vs.

 fat oxidation in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

 These results question the use of high doses of n-3 supplements in type 2 diabetes.

 It is not known to what extent such effects in type 2 diabetes can be reproduced by intravenous administration of n-3 fatty acids and/or whether short term intravenous administration has other effects.

 n-3 Fatty Acid Infusion and Type 2 Diabetes@highlight

The purpose of this experimental study is to investigate whether an acute lipid infusion added marine n-3 fatty acids produces effects on insulin sensitivity in subjects with type 2 diabetes, when compared with an acute lipid infusion without marine n-3 fatty acids.

 Furthermore other effects on intermediary metabolism are tested for.
