(thirdQuint)2nd Line Erlotinib Treatment With (Out) Chemotherapy of Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

 Open randomized multicenter phase II study in patients in need of 2nd line treatment for advanced/metastatic NSCLC.

 Efficacy and safety of monotherapy with erlotinib will be compared with combination therapy of erlotinib and chemotherapy.

 In recent studies it was established that pemetrexed activity is more pronounced in non-squamous NSCLC in comparison to squamous cell carcinoma.

 Therefore in patients with non-squamous carcinoma pemetrexed will be used.

 As in second line treatment of NSCLC docetaxel is registered also for usage in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, docetaxel will be used in patients with squamous histology.

 Chemotherapy will be limited to 4 courses.

 Erlotinib will be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Erlotinib as monotherapy will be administered continuously.

 In combination with chemotherapy, erlotinib will be given from day 2-16 of every course of 3 weeks.

 2nd Line Erlotinib Treatment With (Out) Chemotherapy of Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess if the combination of erlotinib and chemotherapy (docetaxel in case of squamous cell NSCLC or pemetrexed in case of other histological types) is superior to erlotinib alone and has acceptable tolerability and safety in the 2nd line treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
