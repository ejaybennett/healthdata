(fifthQuint)Reconstruction of 12-Lead Electrogram From Intracardiac Signals From Defibrillators During or After Implantation.

 Reconstructing a 12-lead surface ECG from intracardiac EGM vectors of patients implanted with defibrillators can be of great value.

 It allows implantable devices that have thus far been used exclusively for arrhythmia detection and treatment, to be used for diagnostic purposes in similar ways as the ECG.

 The advantage of the reconstruction process is that it provides real-time continuous monitoring, which can be used for multiple purposes, including but not limited to: 1.

 Ischemia detection 2.

 Myocardial Infarction detection 3.

 Electrolyte abnormalities detection 4.

 Assessment of effect of medications 5.

 Improved rhythm discrimination.

 Reconstruction of 12-Lead Electrogram From Intracardiac Signals From Defibrillators During or After Implantation@highlight

The purpose of this study is to reconstruct a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) from intracardiac (IC) electrograms (EGM) obtained from defibrillator devices (ICD).

 The purpose of such a reconstruction is to allow the use of IC EGM for diagnosis of clinical conditions for which ECG have historically been used, and to test the feasibility of a reconstruction technique for the standard 12-lead or extended electrocardiogram from electrical potentials obtained from inside a patient.
