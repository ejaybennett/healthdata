(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Safety Study of DP-b99 in Treating Acute Ischemic Stroke.

 This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multi-national, parallel-arm, pivotal study comparing a placebo group to a DP-b99 group treated with intravenous 1.

0 mg/kg/d for 4 consecutive days, in acute ischemic stroke patients with an entry National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 10-16 and a clinical syndrome that includes at least 1 of the following: language dysfunction, visual field defect or Extinction and Inattention (formerly Neglect) (as reflected by at least 1 point on any of the corresponding items of the NIHSS: 9, 3 or 11).

 An interim analysis for futility will be performed after Day 90 (or last available observation) primary endpoint data have been collected on about 45% of subjects planned to be enrolled.

 Clinical trial material (CTM) will be administered within 9 hours after the onset of acute ischemic stroke symptoms.

 Subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive either DP-b99 or placebo.

 A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will assess the accumulating safety data periodically and will oversee the interim futility analysis.

 Efficacy and Safety Study of DP-b99 in Treating Acute Ischemic Stroke@highlight

The purpose of this trial is to determine if intravenous administration of the metal ion trapping agent DP-b99 up to 9 hours following acute ischemic stroke onset, and then for 3 additional days (4 consecutive days in total) is effective in improving long term outcome.

 Patients will be followed up for 3 months after the stroke.
