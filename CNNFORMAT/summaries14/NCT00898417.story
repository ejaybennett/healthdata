(thirdQuint)Biomarker Study of Blood Samples From Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel With or Without Bevacizumab.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To develop a serum proteomic classifier using matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of blood samples from patients with non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer to predict benefit, in terms of survival and time to progression, from treatment with bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

 Secondary - To better quantitate candidate biomarkers by using more advanced mass spectrometric technologies, including multiple-reaction monitoring and heavy-labeled peptides.

 OUTLINE: Previously collected pre-treatment samples of serum or plasma are randomly selected from patients enrolled on protocol ECOG-4599 (i.

e.

, 60 from the bevacizumab arm and 30 from the control arm).

 Samples are analyzed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify patterns from protein spectra that correlate with patient survival.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients undergoing treatment for non-small cell lung cancer may help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

 PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at proteomic patterns in stored blood samples from patients undergoing treatment for non-small cell lung cancer.
