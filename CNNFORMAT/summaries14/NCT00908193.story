(thirdQuint)Laparoscopic "DA VINCI" Robot Assisted Abdominal Wall Hernia Repair.

 Laparoscopic Robot Assisted abdominal wall hernia repair : a prospective randomized trial: The main judgement criterion is post operative pain reflected by morphine consumption during the first 48 hours.

 Secondary criteria are morbidity, quality of life, duration of surgery, conversion rate, complications, the the length of stay and hospital costs.

 In this single centre study, inclusion criteria are age above 18, no previous repair of the hernia with a mesh and a diameter of the parietal defect of less than 10 cm.

 Contraindications are chronic use of pain drugs of level II or above and renal insufficiency (clearance =5% and =10%).

 The total duration of the study is 30 months (12 months of follow-up for each patient).
