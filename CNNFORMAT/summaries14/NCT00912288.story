(secondQuint)A Phase 3 Efficacy Study Of Dimebon In Patients With Moderate To Severe Alzheimer's Disease.

 This study was terminated on May 7, 2010 due to modification of the dimebon development plan following the lack of demonstration of efficacy in the completed DIM14 (CONNECTION) Study.

 The study was not terminated due to any safety findings.

 Dimebon has been well-tolerated in clinical trials.

 Demonstration of efficacy for dimebon in Alzheimer's disease is pending completion of the ongoing DIM18 (CONCERT) Study.
