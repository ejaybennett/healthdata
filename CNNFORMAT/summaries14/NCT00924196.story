(fifthQuint)Natural History Study of Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type I.

 BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant, progressive genetic disorder characterized by diverse clinical manifestations.

 Patients with NF1 have an increased risk of developing tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system including plexiform neurofibromas (PN), dermal neurofibromas, optic pathway tumors, brain tumors, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, and pheochromocytomas.

 In addition, NF1 manifests in essentially every organ system, with for example, skeletal and vascular abnormalities, and cognitive deficits.

 Thus, the care for individuals with NF1 requires a multidisciplinary approach.

 The natural history of NF1 related tumor and other manifestations is poorly understood, and for most NF1 related tumor manifestations the only standard treatment option is surgery.

 The NIH Clinical Center provides the ideal infrastructure for evaluation of the natural history of rare diseases.

 A better understanding of the natural history of NF1 related tumor and other manifestations will be helpful for the design of treatment studies.

 The NCI, POB has an active clinical trials program for NF1 related tumor manifestations including PN, MPNST, and in collaboration with Dr.

 Douglas Stewart from the NHGRI, dermal neurofibromas.

 Unlike individuals with refractory solid cancers, individuals with NF1 have near normal life expectancy, and their benign tumors progress more slowly than solid cancers.

 Individuals with NF1 may thus participate in multiple treatment trials.

 OBJECTIVES: The overall purpose of this descriptive NF1 Natural History study is to serve as an umbrella protocol for the ongoing NF1 clinical trials program to allow the longitudinal evaluation of individuals with NF1 for NF1 related tumor and non tumor manifestations irrespective whether they are currently enrolled on a treatment study or not, and to develop a better understanding of the biology of NF1 related manifestations.

 Following these patients longitudinally will allow investigators to develop a better understanding of the natural history of these manifestations, provide the basis for the development of endpoints for clinical trials and to potentially develop more effective treatments.

 NF1 manifestations, which will be followed longitudinally, include PN, MPNST, optic pathway tumors, dermal neurofibromas, NF1 associated pain, and neuropsychological, motor, and endocrine function.

 A comprehensive treatment plan and recommendations will be developed and communicated with the patient and primary caregivers.

 ELIGIBILITY: Children, adolescents, and adults with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of NF1 or a confirmed NF1 mutation.

 DESIGN: Attempts will be made to have all individuals undergo a comprehensive baseline evaluation including clinical phenotyping, genotyping, imaging of tumor manifestations, and pain, quality of life, neuropsychological, motor, and endocrine evaluations.

 The NF1 manifestations will be longitudinally monitored with a frequency of every year to every three years, with the extent and timing of follow-up evaluations depending on the findings at baseline.

 Natural History Study of Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type I@highlight

Background: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder in which patients are at increased risk of developing tumors (usually non-cancerous) of the central and peripheral nervous system.

 The disease affects essentially every organ system.

 The natural course of NFI over time is poorly understood.

 For most patients the only treatment option is surgery.

 A better understanding of NF1 may be helpful for the design of future treatment studies.

 Objectives: To evaluate people with NF1 over 10 years in order to better understand the natural history of the disease.

 To characterize the patient population and to examine how NFI affects patients quality of life and function.

 Eligibility: Children, adolescents, and adults with NF1.

 Design: Participants have a comprehensive baseline evaluation including genetic testing, tumor imaging, pain and quality-of-life assessments, and neuropsychological, motor and endocrine evaluations.

 Patients are monitored every 6 months to every 3 years, depending on their individual findings at the baseline study.

 Tests may include the following, as appropriate: - Medical history, physical examination and blood tests.

 - Whole body and face photography to monitor visible deformities.

 - Neuropsychological testing, quality-of-life evaluations, motor function tests, endocrinologic evaluations, heart and lung function tests, hearing tests, bone density scans and other bone evaluations.

 - MRI and PET scans to detect and assess plexiform neurofibromas (tumors that arise from nerves and can cause serious problems), paraspinal neurofibromas (tumors that arise from nerves around the spine and can cause problems by compressing the spinal cord), and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (a type of cancer that arises from a peripheral nerve or involves the sheath covering the nerve).

 - Eye exams, MRI scans and PET scans to evaluate optic pathway gliomas (tumors arising from the vision nerves or the brain areas for vision) and the chemicals within the tumor and brain.

 - Eye exams and photographs to evaluate the development of Lisch nodules (non-cancerous tumors on the eye).

 - Photographs of dermal neurofibromas (tumors of the skin), cafe-au-lait spots (dark or pigmented areas on the skin that are often the first signs of NF1) and other skin problems.

 - Pain evaluations to monitor the different types of pain patients experience, causes of the pain, how often the pain occurs, effect of the pain on quality of life, and what pain medications and alternative treatments, such as acupuncture, are effective.
