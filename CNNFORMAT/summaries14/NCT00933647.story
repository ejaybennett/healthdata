(firstQuint)Cardioprotective Effects of Green Tea Versus Mat Intake.

 Recommendations of lifestyle and dietary content changes are often made for primary prevention and improvement of many health conditions, including cardiovascular disease.

 For centuries, green tea (Camellia sinensis) has been linked to good health.

 Nowadays, it is considered a functional food because of its physiological benefits, mainly in terms of cardiovascular prevention.

 Green tea is considered one of the best sources of phenolic compounds, which possess antioxidant properties that may contribute to a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease.

 Lesser-known worldwide, but widely consumed in southern Latin America countries, yerba mate tea (Ilex paraguariensis) is also a good source of phenolic compounds.

 The antioxidant capacity of green tea has been extensively studied; however, few studies have reported that the antioxidant properties of mate tea is even greater than green tea.

 For this reason, the present study aims to compare the possible effects of the oral ingestion of mate and green tea on the lipid and inflammatory profiles in a southern Brazilian population.
