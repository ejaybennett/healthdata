(secondQuint)CYPRESS - CYPHER for Evaluating Sustained Safety.

 During Phase I (non-randomized phase) of this study, the primary objective is to assess the rate of target lesion failure in subjects implanted with the CYPHER(R) stent and receiving dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 months.

 During Phase II (randomized phase) of this study, the primary objective is to assess safety (major and minor bleeding), MACCE, and ST rates in subjects treated with dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 or 30 months following CYPHER(R) stent implantation.

 *Subjects treated with the CYPHER(R) 2.

25mm stent will be followed through 60 months.

 **The last 500 patients enrolled will not be eligible for randomization.
