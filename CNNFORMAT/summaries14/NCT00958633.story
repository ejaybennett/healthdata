(fifthQuint)Mood Stabilizer (MS)+ Antidepressant vs MS + Placebo in Maintenance of Bipolar Disorder.

.

 Study Design: The investigators propose a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with BD who are currently experiencing a depressive episode.

 The trial will consist of two phases: an open-label acute treatment phase, and a double-blind maintenance treatment phase.

 OPEN-LABEL ACUTE TREATMENT PHASE Experimental Design Patients with BD depression who are receiving treatment with antimanic medication(s), defined as: 1) a mood stabilizer (lithium or divalproex ), 2) a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, or ziprasidone), or 3) combination anti-manic therapy (two mood stabilizers; or a mood stabilizer plus an SGA (the SGA asenapine will also be permitted if prescribed with a mood stabilizer); or a mood stabilizer or SGA plus lamotrigine), will have open-label escitalopram 10-30 mg/day or bupropion XL 150-450 mg/day added to their medication(s) for up to 16 weeks.

Patients who complete at least 4 weeks of treatment and achieve remission from their index depression which is maintained for 2 weeks will be eligible to enter the double-blind study phase.

 The duration of treatment in the open-label phase will be 4-16 weeks, depending on the time required to achieve remission.

 DOUBLE-BLIND MAINTENANCE TREATMENT PHASE Patients who are in remission from their index depression for 2 weeks and 8 weeks are eligible to take part in the double-blind maintenance phase.

 There are two routes to enter the double-blind phase: - following completion of the open-label phase, or - following a period of clinical treatment, not exceeding 16 weeks, with the same medications used in the open-label phase.

 Patients who respond to clinical treatment with carbamazepine plus an antidepressant may also enter the double-blind phase.

 Experimental Design During the double-blind phase, all patients will continue treatment with their anti-manic medication(s) and will be randomized to one of two treatment arms for up to 52 weeks: - Patients randomized to the "8 week arm" will discontinue antidepressant treatment after 8 weeks, as recommended in current clinical practice guidelines.

.

 - Patients randomized to the "52 week arm" will continue treatment with their antidepressant medication for 52 weeks, or until withdrawal from the study.

 Mood Stabilizer (MS)+ Antidepressant vs MS + Placebo in Maintenance of Bipolar Disorder.

@highlight

Patients with bipolar I disorder (BD) experience depression 3 times more frequently than mania, and antidepressants are prescribed as adjuncts to mood stabilizers in up to 70% of patients.

 However, no placebo-controlled trials have assessed the efficacy or safety of modern antidepressants in combination with mood stabilizers in the maintenance treatment of BD.

 The investigators propose a multicentre, randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing mood stabilizer plus antidepressant (escitalopram or bupropion XL) to mood stabilizer plus placebo in the maintenance treatment of BD.

 The investigators hypothesize that in clinically representative patients with bipolar disorder, who respond to acute treatment with a newer antidepressant medication in conjunction with a mood stabilizing medication, continuing the antidepressant for 12 months will reduce the risk of relapse into any mood episode, including depression, mania, and hypomania, compared to stopping the antidepressant after 8 weeks.
