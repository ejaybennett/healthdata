(firstQuint)Study of Mitomycin C and Nasal Splint to Treat Nasal Synechiae.

 Nasal synechiae is an important cause for the failure of many a nasal surgery.

 Septal splints have been widely used for the treatment of nasal synechiae, but are associated significant morbidity until removal.

 This is a preliminary study taken up to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Mitomycin C in the treatment of nasal synechiae.
