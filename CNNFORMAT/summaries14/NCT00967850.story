(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Intravitreal Bevacizumab in the Treatment of Choroidal Neovascular Membranes Associated to High Myopia.

 Bad response in choroidal neovascularization in High myopia to Photodynamic therapy, which is the current approved treatment for that pathology, and the high incidence of this pathology in these patients, together with the great functional impact in their vision has fostered the search for new therapeutic strategies.

 Intravitreal bevacizumab has already been tested in small series of patients with choroidal neovascularization associated to high myopia, whether as first treatment option or after the failure of photodynamic therapy with good results.

 In the published series an improvement of visual acuity is described after 1-2 injections, with a reduction in the macular edema and a good safety profile.

 The lack of published trials that describe the efficacy of frequency of treatment in this pathology is the main reason for this trial.
