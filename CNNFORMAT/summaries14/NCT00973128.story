The present study was designed as a randomized, single blind, placebo-controlled, study to evaluate the effect of 400 mu g of recombinant human GM-CSF applied intralesionally and associated with half of the total dose of antimony in a reduced time schedule (20mgSbV/Kg/d for 10 days) as compared to the full dose of antimony (20mgSbV/Kg/d for 20 days) to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis ulcers.
