(secondQuint)The Effect of Whey Protein and Its Hydrolysate on Pre- and Post-Fixed Meal Glycemia and Insulin in Young Adults.

 A randomized, cross-over design study was conducted.

 Whey protein preloads (5-40 g) and hydrolysate whey protein (10 g) were provided in 300 ml water.

 At 30 min following consumption, subjects were fed a preset pizza meal (12 kcal/kg, experiment 2).

 Satiety, insulin and blood glucose were measured at baseline and selected intervals pre- and post-meal.
