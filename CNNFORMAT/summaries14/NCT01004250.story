(thirdQuint)A Study of Pemetrexed and Bevacizumab for Participants With Advanced Non-Small Cell Cancer.

 The study will have 3 periods: a baseline period; a study treatment period, including both induction and maintenance treatment; and a follow-up period.

 Approximately 110 participants will be enrolled into the study, with the aim of having 100 evaluable participants.

 Eligible participants will first receive 4 cycles of induction chemotherapy with pemetrexed-cisplatin-bevacizumab.

 Participants who achieve a response or do not progress after completion of induction chemotherapy and have an adequate performance status will receive maintenance therapy with pemetrexed-bevacizumab.

 Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

 When treatment is discontinued, the participants health status will be monitored till death, loss to follow-up or data cut-off date.

 Participants who continue to receive benefit from treatment at the time of data cut-off may receive continued access to pemetrexed and bevacizumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any other reason at investigator or participants decision.

 A Study of Pemetrexed and Bevacizumab for Participants With Advanced Non-Small Cell Cancer@highlight

Participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will receive a first-line treatment of Pemetrexed, Cisplatin and Bevacizumab as induction therapy followed by a maintenance treatment of Pemetrexed and Bevacizumab.

 Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

 The primary objective of this study is to measure how long this treatment could prevent the disease progression.
