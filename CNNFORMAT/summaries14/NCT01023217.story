(fifthQuint)Entecavir Plus Adefovir in Lamivudine-Resistant Chronic Hepatitis B Patients Who Fail Lamivudine Plus Adefovir.

 In this randomized, open label, two-arm, single center phase IV trial, the investigators will assess and compare the efficacy and safety of continuation of ADV plus LAM versus switching to ADV plus ETV up to 52-weeks in Korean adults with chronic hepatitis B who have resistant mutants to LAM and show suboptimal response to combination of ADV plus LAM.

 All study subjects who complete the initial treatments of 52-weeks will be thereafter treated with the combination of ADV plus ETV for 52 more weeks.

 Study period: Nov 2009 - October 2012 Patient enrollment period: November 2009 - December 2010 Study protocol 1.

 Group A (ADV+LAM group): Adefovir (10 mg/day) + Lamivudine (100 mg/day) for 52 weeks, and thereafter, Adefovir (10 mg/day) + Entecavir (1 mg/day) for 52 more weeks 2.

 Group B (ADV+ETV group): Adefovir (10 mg/day) + Entecavir (1 mg/day) for 104 weeks.

 Entecavir Plus Adefovir in Lamivudine-Resistant Chronic Hepatitis B Patients Who Fail Lamivudine Plus Adefovir@highlight

The presence of persistent inadequate or suboptimal virologic response is a strong risk factor for viral resistance and breakthrough and also for disease progression of chronic hepatitis B, and thus, a change in therapy is required.

 The combination of entecavir (ETV) and adefovir (ADV) is a promising treatment for patients with lamivudine (LAM)-resistance who show suboptimal response to the combination of LAM and ADV.

 In this randomized, open labeled trial,the investigators will compare the efficacy of continuation of ADV plus LAM versus switch to ADV plus ETV in adults with LAM-resistant chronic hepatitis B who shows suboptimal response to the combination treatment of ADV and LAM.
