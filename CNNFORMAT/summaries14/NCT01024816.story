(firstQuint)Practicing Restorative Yoga or Stretching for the Metabolic Syndrome.

 Metabolic abnormalities, including visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia, occur together and are associated with excessive caloric intake and inadequate physical activity.

 Persons with the metabolic syndrome are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

 Lifestyle and behavioral interventions reduce these risks, but many individuals with increased metabolic risk find it difficult to achieve and maintain weight loss and increased physical activity.

 We are conducting a rigorous randomized controlled trial at two clinical sites to determine if Restorative yoga compared to stretching exercises improves the metabolic syndrome among overweight and underactive individuals who meet criteria for the metabolic syndrome.
