(fifthQuint)A Study of Panobinostat (LBH589) as Second-Line Therapy in Patients With Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease.

 Chronic GVHD is an autoimmune, inflammatory disorder that occurs in the majority of patients who experience acute GVHD.

 Long-term corticosteroids are still standard therapy for chronic GVHD.

 Corticosteroids are associated with high morbidity and non-relapse mortality.

 In addition, corticosteroids are broadly immunosuppressive and can also decrease the GVL effect and increase the incidence of relapse.

 There is a clear need for effective, steroid-sparing agents for the management of chronic GVHD.

 Thus, agents like HDAC inhibitors, with the potential of decreasing pro-inflammatory events leading to GVHD without affecting GVL, may have a central role in the prevention and treatment of GVHD.

 This study will look at the efficacy of panobinostat (LBH589), an HDAC inhibitor, in the treatment of patients with chronic GVHD who have failed corticosteroids.

 In this group of patients, effective steroid-sparing options are limited and are usually associated with profound immunosuppression and decreased GVL effect.

 A Study of Panobinostat (LBH589) as Second-Line Therapy in Patients With Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease@highlight

There is a clear need for effective, steroid-sparing agents for the management of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

 Thus, agents like Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, with the potential of decreasing pro-inflammatory events leading to GVHD without affecting graft-versus-leukemia (GVL), may have a central role in the prevention and treatment of GVHD.

 This study will look at the efficacy of panobinostat (LBH589), an HDAC inhibitor, in the treatment of patients with chronic GVHD who have failed corticosteroids.

 In this group of patients, effective steroid-sparing options are limited and are usually associated with profound immunosuppression and decreased GVL effect.
