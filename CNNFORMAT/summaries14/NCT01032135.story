(fifthQuint)Adaptive Treatment for Alcohol and Cocaine Dependence.

 3.

 Secondary objective #1: Examine outcomes on three secondary measures: percent days abstinent from all substances, negative consequences of drug use, and HIV high risk behaviors.

 - Hypothesis 1: Outcomes on the secondary measures will be better in MI-PC than in MI-IOP.

 4.

 Secondary objective #2: Test hypotheses concerning potential mediators of the predicted main effect favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP.

 - Hypothesis 1: The predicted advantage of MI-PC over MI-IOP will be mediated by greater increases in motivation, self-efficacy, commitment to abstinence, and self-help involvement in MI-PC.

 5.

 Secondary objective #3: Test hypotheses concerning effect of additional MI intervention after initial non-engagement persists through 12 weeks.

 - Hypothesis 1: A second telephone MI intervention will produce higher rates of subsequent engagement and less cocaine use than no further MI.

 Adaptive Treatment for Alcohol and Cocaine Dependence@highlight

1.

 Primary objective #1: Determine the relative effectiveness of MI-IOP and MI-PC in the full study sample with regard to treatment engagement over weeks 1-12 and cocaine/alcohol use over weeks 1-24.

 - Hypothesis 1: An intervention that explores several possible treatment options with the patient and provides the chosen option (e.

g.

, MI-PC) will produce higher rates of treatment engagement than an intervention focused on engagement in IOP only (e.

g.

, MI-IOP).

 - Hypothesis 2: An intervention that explores several possible treatment options with the patient and provides the chosen option (e.

g.

, MI-PC) will produce better cocaine/alcohol use outcomes than an intervention focused on engagement in IOP only (MI-IOP).

 - Secondary analysis 1: Among the Non-engaged patients, determine rates of selection of each of the three options in MI-PC, retention rates within each option, and cocaine/alcohol use outcomes in each option.

 - Secondary analysis 2: Among the Engaged patients, determine rates of selection of each of the three options in MI-PC, retention rates within each option, and cocaine/alcohol use outcomes in each option.

 2.

 Primary objective #2: Determine whether the relative effectiveness of MI-IOP and MI-PC varies as a function of engagement group, with regard to treatment engagement over weeks 1-12 and cocaine/alcohol use outcomes over weeks 1-24.

 - Hypothesis 1: The predicted main effect on retention favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP will be significantly larger among patients in the Non-engaged group than among those in the Engaged group.

 - Hypothesis 2: The predicted main effect on cocaine/alcohol use outcomes favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP will be significantly larger among patients in the Non-engaged group than among those in the Engaged group.
