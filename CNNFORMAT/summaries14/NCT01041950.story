(secondQuint)A Randomised Controlled Trial of Lumbar Drainage to Treat Communicating Hydrocephalus After Severe Intraventricular Hemorrhage.

 All patients requiring external ventricular drain (EVD) for treatment of acute obstructive hydrocephalus receive intraventricular fibrinolysis with rt-PA via the ventricular catheter.

 Lumbar drainage (LD) is inserted at a timepoint, when communication between the internal and the external CSF-spaces is recognizable on CT ("opening" of third and fourth ventricle and aqueduct).

 A Randomised Controlled Trial of Lumbar Drainage to Treat Communicating Hydrocephalus After Severe Intraventricular Hemorrhage@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if usage of early lumbar drainage leads to less shunt surgery and less catheter associated complications in patients with communicating hydrocephalus after intracerebral hemorrhage with severe ventricular involvement.
