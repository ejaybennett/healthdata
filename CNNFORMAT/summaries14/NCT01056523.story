(secondQuint)Use of Ribavirin and Low Dose Ara-C to Treat Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 Primary Objectives In the Phase I portion of this study, we will determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of ribavirin and low-dose ara-C.

 The primary objective of the Phase II portion of the study is to determine the overall response rate, including the complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), partial remission (PR) or blast response (BR), to therapy with ribavirin and low dose ara-C at the RP2D.

 STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION This is a multicentre, open-label, single arm Phase I/II study of oral ribavirin and low-dose ara-C for patients with AML M4/M5 or AML with high expression of eIF4E, who have relapsed or refractory disease, or who are not suitable candidates for induction chemotherapy.

 This study will determine the recommended phase II dose and will evaluate efficacy.

 Correlative studies will be included to assess relevant molecular targets.

 Use of Ribavirin and Low Dose Ara-C to Treat Acute Myeloid Leukemia@highlight

The purpose of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of ribavirin, when given in combination with low-dose ara-C and to determine if it is safe and well-tolerated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
