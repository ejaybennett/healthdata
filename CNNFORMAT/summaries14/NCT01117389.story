(fifthQuint)Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Among Survivors of Childhood Cancer.

 Effective vaccination is now available to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common sexually transmitted infection and the cause of cervical cancer, the second most common cancer among women worldwide.

 HPV vaccine uptake is particularly important for females surviving childhood cancer, many of whom are at high risk for HPV complications due to the direct and indirect effects of cancer treatment.

 Thus, Version 3.

0 of the Children's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer has recently recommended HPV vaccination for all eligible females surviving childhood cancer.

 Because this vaccine was only FDA approved in 2006, little is known about the complexity of vaccination uptake among those surviving cancer, and how the factors influencing vaccination decision-making differ among families with and without a history of pediatric cancer.

 The purpose of this exploratory study is to estimate the prevalence of HPV vaccination and to assess predictors of HPV vaccination (and intent) among 9-26 year old females who have survived childhood cancer, while making comparisons to healthy acquaintance controls.

 In a cross-sectional design, those surviving childhood cancer (and acquaintance controls) will be asked to complete a questionnaire which queries sociodemographic, medical, and psychological variables which may relate to HPV vaccination or intent.

 Current vaccination rates will be examined and factors which associate with HPV vaccination (and intent) will be identified.

 Findings of the present study will inform recruitment strategies for future studies examining the immunogenicity, safety, tolerability, and behavioral outcomes of HPV vaccination among females surviving childhood cancer.

 More immediately, this work will further our understanding of familial decision-making regarding HPV vaccination among female survivors of childhood cancer and will determine whether vaccination recruitment models developed for healthy adolescents and young adults generalize to the pediatric cancer population.

This study will focus on the primary objectives: - To estimate the prevalence of HPV vaccination among a large cohort of childhood cancer survivors and an acquaintance control group.

 - To describe the difference in HPV vaccination rate and HPV vaccination intent among preadolescent/adolescent females surviving childhood cancer and an acquaintance control group.

 This study will also focus on the secondary objectives: - To examine sociodemographic, medical, and psychological differences between those who have/have not initiated HPV vaccination and between those who do/do not intend to get vaccinated in the future.

 - To assess the general predictive influence of sociodemographic, medical, and psychological variables on HPV vaccination and intent among mothers with preadolescent/adolescent daughters.
