(secondQuint)Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of Intravenous Carbamazepine in Adults With Epilepsy.

 This was a phase III, multicenter, open-label study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of intravenously administered CBZ in adult patients with epilepsy.

 This study included a 28 day Lead-in Period, a Confinement Period (up to 7 days and 6 nights) and a 28 day Follow-up Period.

 Patients began confinement on Day -1 of the trial, continuing to take their oral CBZ as prescribed by the investigator.

 On the morning of Day 0, Day 4, and Day 17, patients began the 24hr urine collection for evaluation of urinary biomarkers.

 All patients temporarily discontinued their prescribed oral CBZ and begin IV CBZ administration on the morning of Day 1, continuing administrations every 6 hours (Q6h) through the morning of Day 4.
