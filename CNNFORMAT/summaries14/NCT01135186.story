(firstQuint)Impact of KUVAN on Gastric Relaxation in Women With Diabetic Gastroparesis.

.

 Patients are invited to participate in a research study of Kuvan(R) (sapropterin dihydrochloride).

 We hope to learn whether treatment with Kuvan(R) is safe and effective in improving the ability of the stomach to relax after eating and improving the symptoms of diabetic gastroparesis.

 Women are selected as a possible participant in this study because they have diabetes and moderate to severe gastroparesis (meaning stomach empties slowly).
