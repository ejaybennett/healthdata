(secondQuint)A Pilot Study to Determine Optimal Procedure Steps to Obtain and Maintain Uterine Artery Occlusion With the D-UAO Device.

 1.

 Group 1 - beginning with the use of the current instructions for use (IFU) will have adjustments made as necessary to the D-UAO procedural steps for uterine artery occlusion confirmed by 2/3-D Power Colour Doppler ultrasound (2/3DPD).

 2.

 Group 2 - verify that optimal D-UAO IFU procedural steps generated in Group 1 as confirmed by 2/3DPD.

 3.

 Group 3 - verify that the optimal D-UAO procedural steps are reproducible in the hands of multiple surgeons in addition to the group 1 investigators, as confirmed by 2/3DPD.

 A Pilot Study to Determine Optimal Procedure Steps to Obtain and Maintain Uterine Artery Occlusion With the D-UAO Device@highlight

This pilot study has a sequential design involving three groups to ensure appropriate development and evaluation of the optimal procedural steps of the D-UAO device and to confirm that those steps are reproducible in the hands of multiple surgeons.
