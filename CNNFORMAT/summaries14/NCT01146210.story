(thirdQuint)Identification of de Novo Fanconi Anemia in Younger Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Identify children with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated on COG-2961 and COG-AAML03P1 who are at high risk of having de novo Fanconi anemia.

 II.

 Procure diagnostic samples from the COG AML Biology Repository and identify Fanconi anemia patients using western blot techniques.

 OUTLINE: Previously collected cryopreserved cells are analyzed via western blot to identify patients with Fanconi anemia.

This research study is studying identification of de novo Fanconi anemia in younger patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.

 Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to Fanconi anemia in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
