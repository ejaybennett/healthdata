(fifthQuint)Dose Defining Study For MK-2206 Combined With Gefitinib In Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

 Preclinical data from communication with Merck clinical and pre-clinical group support the application of MK2206 and an EGFR-TKI, and the synergistic effect of this combination.

 This proposed study is a phase I dose defining study to define the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) of MK-2206 when combined with gefitinib.

 MK-2206 is a potent, orally active, allosteric inhibitor of human AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 with preclinical anti-tumor activity.

 This is a Phase I, single-center, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.

 Patients who previously failed and progressed through EGFR inhibitor such as erlotinib or gefitinib and up to one line of chemotherapy will be enrolled into the study.

 Patients will be administered with oral MK-2206 and a standard dose of EGFR inhibitor gefitinib.

 This study will be conducted in three cohorts to identify a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of MK-2206 in combination with standard dose of gefitinib (250 mg QD).

 Cohorts of 3 patients will be enrolled sequentially on escalating doses of MK-2206 administered in combination with a standard dose of gefitinib.

 Patients will advance doses of MK2206 if 0/3 patients or 0-1/6 develop DLT (Dose-Limiting Toxicity).

 If 1/3 patient develops DLT, the cohort will be expanded to 6.

 If 2/6 patients developed DLT, the dose will be de-escalate to 90 mg Qwk.

 The highest dose cohort with 0-1/6 with DLT will be deemed as MTD and used as cohort expansion for a total of 15 patients.

 Dose Defining Study For MK-2206 Combined With Gefitinib In Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)@highlight

This is a phase I study of MK2206 (an AKT inhibitor)and gefitinib in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients who failed prior chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI).

 The patient population is enriched for EGFR mutations.

 The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is safe to administered MK-2206 in combination with gefitinib in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

 The second purpose of this study is to define the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) of MK-2206 when combined with gefitinib.

 A standard 3-3 dose escalation scheme of MK-2206 with fix dose gefitinib is used in this study.
