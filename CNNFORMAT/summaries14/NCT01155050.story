 Primary emphasis will be on assessing the effect of tele-health home monitoring combined with motivational telephone coaching on weight loss and waist circumference as compared to self-directed, home monitoring alone, and telephone coaching alone.

 Secondary outcomes such as blood pressure, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood sugar, and cholesterol will be examined as well.
