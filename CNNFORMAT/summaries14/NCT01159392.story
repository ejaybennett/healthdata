(fifthQuint)Alveolar Recruitment in Brain Injury.

 Patients with severe brain injury comprise a significant portion of admissions to critical care units.

 These patients are unable to adequately protect their airways and are usually intubated and mechanically ventilated.

 The goal of mechanical ventilation in patients with brain injury is to optimize blood gas exchange while minimizing intrathoracic pressure to avoid interference with cerebral venous drainage.

Over the last 20 years, a plethora of experimental and clinical data have shown that mechanical ventilation can cause or aggravate lung damage in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

 The aim of this pilot study was to assess the effects of a single standardized recruitment maneuver (RM) on oxygenation and on systemic and cerebral hemodynamics in severe brain injury patients with ALI/ARDS.

 Only patients with brain injury, as defined by a Glasgow Coma Score 20% changes in baseline systemic blood pressure, (ii) ICP 20 mmHg, or (iii) SaO2 90%.

 After the RM is performed, respiratory mechanics, arterial and SjO2 blood samples and systemic and cerebral hemodynamics will be obtained at 30 min and 8 hours.

 Alveolar Recruitment in Brain Injury@highlight

Development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with severe brain injury has been associated with poor outcome.

 The application of lung recruitment maneuvers (RM) for a short period of time to open collapsed alveoli and reverse hypoxemia in early ARDS has been recommended.

 However, little is known about the cerebral and vascular effects of RM in brain injury patients with ALI/ARDS.

 The aim of this study is to assess the effects of a single standardized RM on oxygenation and on systemic and cerebral hemodynamics in severe brain injury patients with ALI/ARDS.
