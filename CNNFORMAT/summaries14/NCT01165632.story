(thirdQuint)Fluorine F 18 Fluorodopa-Labeled PET Scan in Planning Surgery and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed High- or Low-Grade Malignant Glioma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine correlation between 18F-FDOPA PET activity, MRI contrast enhancement, and high- or low-grade glioma biopsies.

 II.

 To compare radiotherapy target volume delineation with and without 18F- FDOPA-PET metabolic imaging information to determine role of metabolic imaging in radiotherapy treatment planning.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine correlation between concordance of 18F-FDOPA PET activity, MRI contrast enhancement, and high- or low-grade glioma biopsies and patient outcomes including overall survival and progression free survival.

 OUTLINE: Beginning at no more than 1 week before biopsy and resection, patients undergo fluorine F 18 fluorodopa-labeled PET/CT scan and pre-operative MRI.

 Patients then undergo stereotactic craniotomy.

 Some patients may also undergo radiation therapy.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every year for 5 years.
