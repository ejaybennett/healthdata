(thirdQuint)The HeartWare Ventricular Assist System as Destination Therapy of Advanced Heart Failure: the ENDURANCE Trial.

 The HeartWare Ventricular Assist System (VAS) is intended for use in patients with chronic Stage D/NYHA Class IIIB/IV left ventricular failure who have received and failed optimal medical therapy and who are ineligible for cardiac transplantation.

 The ENDURANCE clinical study is a prospective, randomized, unblinded, multi-center, non-inferiority evaluation of the HeartWare(R) VAS versus a control group consisting of any FDA-approved Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) approved for destination therapy.

 Patients are randomized to HeartWare(R) VAS or control LVAD in a 2:1 ratio.

 Each patient receiving the HeartWare(R) VAS or control LVAD is followed to the primary endpoint at 2 years, with a subsequent follow-up period extending to 5 years post implant.
