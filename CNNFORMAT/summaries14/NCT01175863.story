(secondQuint)Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) Versus Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) in Intermediate Coronary Artery Disease.

 This trial is a prospective, randomized, open label, two arm designed multi-center trial.

 When diagnostic coronary angiogram shows that the target lesion is intermediate stenosis, IVUS and/or FFR will be performed in order to decide PCI or defer by 1:1 randomization.

 The patients would be followed up to 2 years clinically.
