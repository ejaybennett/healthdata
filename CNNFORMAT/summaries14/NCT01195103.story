(firstQuint)Lusedra (Fospropofol Disodium) for Minimal to Moderate Sedation for Regional Anesthesia Block Prior to Orthopedic Surgery.

 The study overall is aimed at establishing the superiority of a single intravenous bolus-dose of Lusedra for routine use in preoperative regional blocks that avoids deeper levels of sedation and increased risk of nerve damage in an over-sedated individual.

 The shorter half-life of Lusedra should also demonstrate a superior recovery profile compared to midazolam when used as a rescue comparator.

 While this study will only enroll patients undergoing regional blocks prior to orthopedic surgery, the clinical utility and value of the larger initial intravenous dosing for Lusedra may be evident for many different monitored anesthesia care anesthetic management situations requiring rapid and effective onset of effects.
