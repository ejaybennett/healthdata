(secondQuint)Pea Protein and Postprandial Response (PEA).

 Arginine is potential interesting considering the metabolic syndrome.

 Studies so far indicated both long-term effects, as well as acute - postprandial - actions; especially when metabolism is already challenged, e.

g.

 in diabetic patients or after a high-fat meal.

 If arginine-rich proteins are equally effective is not known.

 Therefore we are interested in the effect of (arginine rich) protein on postprandial (dys)metabolism, inflammation and endothelial function, within 6 hours after a meal.

 Pea Protein and Postprandial Response (PEA)@highlight

The main objective is to investigate the postprandial effect of arginine-rich protein (i.

e.

 pea-protein) on metabolic control, inflammation and endothelial function after a high-fat meal in subjects with characteristics of the metabolic syndrome.
