(thirdQuint)Comparison of a Pain Pump Versus Injectable Medication for Analgesia in Knee Arthroscopy.

 Arthroscopic knee patients were randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

 A) 30mL of ropivacaine (0.

5%), 30mg of ketorolac and 8mg of morphine sulfate injected plus a pain pump containing 100mL of ropivacaine (0.

5%) administered at 4 mL/hour; B) an identical solution plus a pain pump containing 100-mL of normal saline administered at 4 mL/hour; C) an identical solution and no pain pump.

 Pain level, the amount of pain medication used and time to discharge were recorded.

 Clinical and radiographic evaluation was performed at nine months after surgery.

 There were 24 males and 25 females, with a mean age of 51.

2 years.

 On the first post-operative day, Group B patients had significantly less pain and used significantly less pain pills.

 There was no significant difference in pain scores between Groups A and C on this day.

 No significant difference in pain scores was found among the 3 groups for all other time intervals.

 At nine months, all patients had subjective pain of < 2 and there was no difference in pre-op and recent radiographic scores.

Hypothesis: Ropivacaine, morphine and ketorolac injected after knee arthroscopy is as effective as this solution plus ropivacaine administered intra-articularly for twenty-four hours.

 Three groups were assigned random patients, each group provided a different method of pain medication in order to determine the effectiveness of each treatment.
