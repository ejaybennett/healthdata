(fifthQuint)Dairy Attenuation of Metabolic Disease.

 This study is designed to determine the effects of a dairy-rich diet on oxidative and inflammatory stress in metabolic syndrome patients in the presence and absence of obesity.

 Forty overweight and obese subjects (BMI 25-39.

9) with metabolic syndrome as defined by NCEP ATP III criteria will be randomized to inadequate (0-0.

5 daily serving) or adequate (3.

5 servings) dairy diets in the presence of a eucaloric weight maintenance diet for 12 weeks.

 All subjects will undergo a 14-day lead-in period to establish a stable baseline of dietary and physiological measures (described below), followed by the 12-week intervention period.

 Baseline dietary assessments will be conducted by the project dietitian during the two-week lead-in period which will be used to provide an initial estimate of a maintenance level of caloric intake.

 This will be refined by calculating energy needs using DRI equations for calculation of age- and physical activity (PA) adjusted total energy expenditure (TEE) for men and women.

 Energy requirements will be confirmed via measurement of resting metabolic rate via indirect calorimetry.

 Subjects will be given diets isocaloric to those consumed during the lead-in period, with macronutrient and fiber levels maintained equivalent at levels approximating the estimated U.

S.

 average (described in Diets section).

 Subjects on the inadequate dairy diets will be assigned diets containing and oxidized LDL at weeks 0, 1, 4 and 12, and inflammatory stress will be assessed by measurement of IL-6, IL-15, MCP, C-reactive protein, adiponectin and TNF- levels in plasma at the same time intervals.

 Glucose tolerance, HOMAIR, fasting plasma lipids, PTH and 1,25-(OH)2-D levels will be determined at the same time intervals (0, 4, and 12 weeks).

 All data will be analyzed via two-factor multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).

 An additional global evaluation of diet-induced changes in cytokines will be conducted using cytokine protein arrays to profile relative changes in 36 additional potentially relevant cytokines.
