(secondQuint)Unstable Dorsally Displaced Fractures of the Distal Radius in the Elderly.

 We will perform a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing open reduction and internal fixation with a volar plate with closed reduction and plaster treatment in elderly patients with a displaced Colles' fracture in order to test the null hypothesis that the patient-perceived result is equal after conservative or operative treatment.

 Secondary outcomes are objective physical measurements.

The purpose of this study is to examine whether operation and fixation with a metal plate gives better result from the patient's perspective than plaster treatment in elderly patients with a displaced wrist fracture.
