(thirdQuint)MK2206 and Erlotinib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Progressed After Previous Response to Erlotinib Hydrochloride Therapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the efficacy (with the primary endpoint of disease control at 12 weeks) and tolerability of the combination of MK2206 plus erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) in previously erlotinib-treated patients with recurrent or progressive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are either epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated or EGFR wild-type.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine progression-free survival of previously erlotinib-treated patients with NSCLC who are treated with MK2206 plus erlotinib.

 II.

 To determine the overall survival of previously erlotinib-treated patients with NSCLC who are treated with MK2206 plus erlotinib.

 III.

 To assess the toxicity experienced by previously erlotinib-treated patients with NSCLC treated with MK2206 plus erlotinib.

 IV.

 To perform correlative analysis of tumor biomarkers to assess, in a preliminary manner, the association between tumor mutations and/or abnormalities and clinical outcome of previously erlotinib-treated patients with NSCLC treated with MK2206 plus erlotinib.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) every other day (QOD) of a 28-day course, and erlotinib hydrochloride PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for one year and then annually thereafter.

This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well Akt inhibitor MK2206 (MK2206) and erlotinib hydrochloride works in treating patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have progressed after previous response to erlotinib hydrochloride therapy.

 MK2206 and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
