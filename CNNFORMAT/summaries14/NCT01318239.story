(secondQuint)Perfusion and Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Phosphorylation of Circulation Endothelial Cells to Determine Anti-anogenic Effect of Chemotherapeutic Regimens in Colorectal Liver Metastasis Patients.

 The purpose of our study is to establish the accuracy of the perfusion MRI parameters and the availability of the VEGFR2 signaling assay using phosphospecific flow cytometry in predicting the response of liver metastasis from colorectal cancer to treatment with antiangiogenic agent.

 IRB approval will be obtained to enroll 60 naive patients (30 patients who will get antiangiogenic agent (Avastin) combined chemotherapy and 30 patients who will get chemotherapy without antiangiogenic agent) with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.

 MRI and blood test (VEGFR2 signaling assay) will be undergoing at three time points in the patients with Avastin chemotherapy; at baseline (pretreatment), 3 days after Avastin alone treatment, 3 days after Avastin combined chemotherapy (about 10 days after initial Avastin alone treatment).

 MRI and blood test (VEGFR2 signaling assay) will be undergoing at two time points in the patients who will get chemotherapy without antiangiogenic agent; at baseline (pretreatment), 3 days after chemotherapy.
