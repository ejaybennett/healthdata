(fifthQuint)The Effect of Vorinostat on HIV RNA Expression in the Resting CD4+ T Cells of HIV+ Pts on Stable ART.

 This is a Phase I-II single-center study in participants (ppts) with HIV-1 infection receiving stable ART, with plasma HIV RNA 60 days elapses between the final safety visit of step 3 (Visit 7) and their re-entry to Step 3, they will re-screen (visit 1 only) to qualify to continue in the study.

 Step 4: After a period of at least 6 weeks, to allow data analysis, participants who demonstrate an in vivo response to the 2nd of the paired dose of VOR will proceed to Step 4 and receive 10 doses of VOR 400 mg administered at the same interval at which cell-associated HIV-RNA induction was observed in Step 3.

 If greater than 60 days elapse between Visit 7 and Visit 8, participants will repeat the screening visit labs to qualify for continued participation in the study.

 At the completion of 10 doses, participants will then be assessed via a 4th and final leukapheresis for in vivo response to the serial dosing of VOR.

 It is anticipated that Step 4 will occur over a minimum of 4 weeks; however this may vary among participants based on their Step 3 dosing interval stage.

 Accumulated blood volumes and the timing between leukapheresis procedures will determine the length of time between each step.

 Participants completing this protocol (version 6.

0), who respond initially in Step 3 will receive a total of 5200 mg of Vorinostat.

 Participant completing the study, who repeat Step 3, will receive a total of 6000 mg of Vorinostat.

 For reference, participants who completed the previous version (5.

0) received a total of 10,000 mg of Vorinostat without clear evidence of any durable drug-associated toxicity thus far.

 The change in the frequency of HIV-1 infection per million resting CD4 + cells will be measured after repeated short interval dosing with VOR in Step 4.

 The 4th leukapheresis (Visit 12) will be compared to the baseline leukapheresis done at Visit 2.

 If the VOR 400 mg dosing in Step 4 is interrupted due to toxicity or intolerance, then the leukapheresis will be performed as soon as possible after the VOR interruption.

 This is justified as if a depletion of resting cell infection can occur; new resting cell infection is unlikely to occur in the presence of ART.

 Test dosing in this Step will continue until the study's stopping (lack of response in five) or toxicity rules are met.

 The Effect of Vorinostat on HIV RNA Expression in the Resting CD4+ T Cells of HIV+ Pts on Stable ART@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare HIV RNA expression and infection within resting (CD4)+ cells in HIV-infected patients on stable ART before and after a single exposure to Vorinostat (VOR), after exposure to short intervals of VOR, and after repeated short interval exposure to VOR dosed over several weeks.

 Hypotheses: 1.

 The frequency of resting CD4+ T cell- associated HIV RNA (RCVL) will be increased following single and repeated exposure to VOR when given at appropriate intervals, and 2.

 That repeated exposure to VOR will reduce the frequency of HIV infection within resting CD4+ T cells (RCI)
