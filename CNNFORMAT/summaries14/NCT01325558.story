(fifthQuint)A Study of ALT-836 in Combination With Gemcitabine for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors.

 Tissue Factor (TF) is over-expressed in most cancer types.

 Results from many recent studies have suggested a key role for TF in the development of cancer-associated thrombosis, tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis.

 ALT-836, a recombinant human-chimeric monoclonal antibody, is designed as a direct TF antagonist to block TF displayed by cancers and to inhibit cancer-associated venous thromboembolism, tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis and tumor metastasis.

 In numerous pre-clinical studies in laboratory animals, including non-human primates, ALT-836 exhibits potent anti-tumor, anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory activities with a remarkable safety profile.

 In humans, ALT-836, administered as a single bolus and monotherapy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), is safe and exhibits anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory effects.

 A Phase II study using a multi-dose regimen of ALT-836 is being conducted in patients with ALI/ARDS.

 In the dose-escalation study described in this protocol, the investigators will assess the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ALT-836 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced malignancies known to overexpress TF and in which venous thromboembolism is a major complication.

 A Study of ALT-836 in Combination With Gemcitabine for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors@highlight

This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center, competitive enrollment and dose-escalation study of ALT-836 in combination with standard of care gemcitabine in participants who have locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of ALT-836 given with gemcitabine.

 The clinical benefit, progression-free survival and overall survival of study participants will also be assessed.
