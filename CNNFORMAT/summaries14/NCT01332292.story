(secondQuint)Pharmacokinetics and PharmacoDynamics of GW685698 in Paedeatric Asthmatic Patients.

 This study will investigate the effect of dosing with fluticasone furoate 100 1/2g (micrograms) in asthmatic subjects aged 5-11 years of age.

 Fluticasone furoate is currently under development as the inhaled corticosteroid component of a combination product containing an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist.

 The study will be a randomized two-way crossover, with a placebo control.

 During each treatment period subjects will receive a daily dose via a novel dry powder inhaler for 14 days.

 Approximately 26 subjects will be recruited to this study, with the aim that 20 will complete the study.

 Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and serum cortisol levels will be investigated.
