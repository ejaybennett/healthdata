(firstQuint)Recombinant Versus Highly Purified FSH in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

 Patients will be randomized using sealed and numbered envelopes and will be assigned to receive a similar ovarian stimulation regime incorporating either Gonal-F or highly purified Fostimon as the hormonal analog.

 Ovarian response using either of the two compounds, pregnancy rates and miscarriage rates will be compared to define possible statistical significance.
