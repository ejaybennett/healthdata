 An Efficacy and Safety Study of Oral Netupitant and Palonosetron for the Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting@highlight

NETU-08-18 is a two-arm clinical study assessing efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of netupitant and palonosetron, two antiemetic drugs, versus oral palonosetron, both given with oral dexamethasone.

 The objective of the study is to demonstrate that netupitant and palonosetron are more effective than palonosetron alone, to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy after administration of repeated cycles of chemotherapy.
