(firstQuint)Immunogenicity of Hepatitis A Vaccine in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Patients.

 The spread of hepatitis A has prompted the need for vaccination against this virus.

 It is uncertain that IBD patients can achieve a truly protective response after vaccination.

 The efficacy and safety of hepatitis A vaccination have not been evaluated in this population of patients.

 We would like to estimate the efficacy and safety of vaccination against hepatitis A in patients with IBD.
