(thirdQuint)HCV Genotype 1a Shows a Better Virological Response to Antiviral Therapy Than HCV Genotype 1b.

 Despite the challenging perspective of the new antiviral drugs directly acting on hepatitis C viral replication such as protease and polymerase inhibitors, nowadays the standard treatment in genotype 1-chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is the combination of peghylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin for 48 weeks.

 It has been extensively shown that patients infected with HCV genotype 1 have a lower rate of viral response than those infected with genotype 2 and 3.

 In large randomized multinational trials, sustained virological response (SVR) of around 50% has been obtained with peginterferon 2a plus ribavirin in the more difficult to treat subgroup of patients infected with HCV genotype 1.

 Furthermore, advanced fibrosis is a predictive factor of non response to antiviral treatment in genotype 1 virus [5-7].

 Very few studies have evaluated SVR difference, if any, between subtypes 1a and 1b.

 We have carried out an observational study on a large cohort of HCV "naive" patients to evaluate the influence of HCV subtypes 1 on the response to treatment with Peg-INF plus ribavirin.

 HCV Genotype 1a Shows a Better Virological Response to Antiviral Therapy Than HCV Genotype 1b@highlight

Sustained virological response (SVR) to antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 according to subtype (1a vs.

1b) has not been extensively investigated.

 This observational study was carried out on a large group of "naive" HCV patients to evaluate difference, if any, between HCV genotype 1 subtype 1a and 1b on the response to treatment with peginterferon (Peg-IFN) plus ribavirin.
