(thirdQuint)Effects of the Breathe Technologies Ventilation System in Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

 Study was a randomized double-blinded crossover design in which subjects completed a series of exercises at a constant work rate while using 1) Test noninvasive ventilation (NIOV) system powered by compressed air, 2) Test NIOV system powered by 100% oxygen, 3) nasal cannula oxygen, 4) nothing (Control).

 Subjects were assessed during constant work rate exercise as reflected by exercise duration, isotime oxygenation (SpO2), and isotime dyspnea score (Borg).

 Exercise sessions took place over 4 visits with each visit lasting approximately 5 hours.

 Effects of the Breathe Technologies Ventilation System in Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease@highlight

Pilot study in 15 stable male subjects with severe-to-very severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) to evaluate the effects of short term use of the Breathe Technologies noninvasive open ventilation (NIOV) system on respiratory mechanics during constant work rate exercise in subjects with severe COPD.
