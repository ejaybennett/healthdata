(thirdQuint)Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies Using Related, HLA-Haploidentical Donors.

 It is important to extend the option of nonmyeloablative, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for potential therapy of hematologic malignancies to patients who do not have an HLA-matched donor.

 Almost all patients would have a related donor identical for one HLA haplotype (haploidentical) and mismatched at HLA-A, B or DR of the unshared haplotype.

 Thus far, nonmyeloablative HSCT from HLA-mismatched donors has been associated with a high rate of graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

 In this protocol, we will use a combination of immunosuppressive agents including cyclophosphamide administered before and after HSCT to facilitate engraftment and to delete highly alloreactive T-cell clones presumably involved in GVHD.

The purpose of this study is to determine if engraftment can be achieved safely in patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies who undergo non-myeloablative transplant with peripheral stem cells from Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) haploidentical donors with pre and post-transplant cyclophosphamide as immunosuppression.
