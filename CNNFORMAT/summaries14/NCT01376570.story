(thirdQuint)Project FIRST - Financial Incentives to Reduce Substance Use and Improve Treatment.

 Using a randomized controlled study design, the investigators will test the efficacy of an abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention compared with a control condition (Performance Feedback) on HIV viral load suppression.

 The investigators will enroll 202 opioid-dependent HIV-infected individuals who are receiving opioid agonist treatment with buprenorphine or methadone, who continue to use opiates, oxycodone or cocaine (drugs that are consistently associated with poor HIV treatment outcomes), and who are prescribed antiretroviral medication, but with suboptimal viral load suppression.

 The contingency management group will have the potential to receive compensation in vouchers over the 16-week intervention based on drug-free urine.

 Participants will be followed for 28 weeks, with research visits occurring twice weekly during the Baseline Period (weeks 1-4) and Intervention Period (weeks 5-20), then every two weeks during the Post-Intervention Period (weeks 21-28).

 Data sources will include blood tests (viral load and CD4 count), urine toxicology tests, questionnaires, pill counts, and medical records.

 The primary outcome will be change in HIV viral load, and secondary outcomes will include CD4 count, antiretroviral adherence, and abstinence.

 Project FIRST - Financial Incentives to Reduce Substance Use and Improve Treatment@highlight

This study will test whether contingency management (monetary vouchers contingent on abstinence from drugs) that reinforces one behavior (achieving abstinence from drugs) leads to improved outcomes in other related behaviors (achieving HIV viral load suppression).

 In a randomized controlled trial, the investigators propose to test whether an abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention improves viral load suppression in HIV-infected drug users.
