(secondQuint)Neighborhoods, Networks, Depression, and HIV Risk.

 This study included implementation and evaluation of a small group, randomized controlled, phase II intervention to reduce depressive symptoms and HIV risk behaviors among inner city drug users.

 The intervention included elements of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression among impoverished individuals, emphasizing depressive cognitions and behaviors theorized to be associated with depression and with HIV risk behaviors among mildly to moderately depressed drug users.

 In addition, the study examined active drug users' social and environmental pathways to depression and subsequent HIV risk behaviors.

 Specifically, we will hypothesized mediating/moderating effects of neighborhood characteristics, social network factors, and individual level factors on depressive symptoms and HIV risk behaviors.
