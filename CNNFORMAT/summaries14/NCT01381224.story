(firstQuint)Do Lower Spine Injections Improve Outcomes for Lower Back Pain Patients.

 The purpose of this project is to determine the effect of lumbar injections on select biomechanics parameters; walking pattern, lumbar flexibility and balance.

 The surveys will help assess the patient's sense of functional ability and feeling of wellness compared with low back pain scores.

 The long terms goals of this project will be to elucidate the mechanism of action of injections and to improve identification of patients that are likely to benefit from injection therapy.
