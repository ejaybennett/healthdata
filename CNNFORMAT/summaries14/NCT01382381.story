(firstQuint)Intravascular Stents Fracture Effects.

 Patients who underwent trans-catheter implantation of balloon expanded stents in the aortic arch and in branch pulmonary arteries will be evaluated by physical examination with blood pressure values measurement of upper and lower limbs.

 Echo-Doppler cardiography will be performed for flow velocity analysis.

 Zoomed fluoroscopy will be performed and recorded in two orthogonal views to evaluate stent integrity or stent fracture.

 It is our intention to include 20 patients in this study from our follow-up clinic.

The goal of the study is to evaluate long term durability and hemodynamic effect of implanted stents in the aortic arch and in pulmonary artery branches.
