(thirdQuint)Pharmacokinetics of Aminocaproic Acid in Scoliosis Surgery.

 Posterior spinal fusion surgery (PSF) can be associated with significant blood loss, and perioperative transfusion is common.

 Various strategies have been employed to decrease intraoperative blood loss and reduce transfusion in children undergoing PSF.

 The intraoperative administration of the antifibrinolytic drug epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) is one such strategy that has been shown to be effective in this regard.

 This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of EACA in children undergoing PSF at CHOP who receive EACA at the standard dose reported in the literature for this population and currently in use at CHOP.
