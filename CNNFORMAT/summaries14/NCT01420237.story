(secondQuint)Restoration Anatomic Dual Mobility (ADM) X3 Acetabular System Study.

 This study is a prospective, open-label, post-market, non-randomized, multi-center, clinical evaluation of the Restoration(R) ADM X3(R) Acetabular System for primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) with a cementless application in a consecutive series of patients who meet the eligibility criteria.

 The total enrollment goal for the study is 350 cases, all of which will receive the Restoration(R) ADM X3(R) Acetabular System.

 A minimum of 100 cases (within the study population) will receive the Accolade(R) II Hip Stem.

 The remaining cases will receive any other compatible Stryker femoral component.

 Data in the literature from other primary hip systems and similar dual mobility cups will be used as historical references.
