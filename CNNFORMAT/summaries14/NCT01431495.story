(thirdQuint)Clinical Assessment of Pidogrel Versus Plavix (CAPP).

 after randomization of patients in both groups (Plavix or Pidogrel), the measure of platelet activity by the VerifyNow assay, 4 to 12 hours after the loading dose of 600mg or after the last dose of clopidogrel for patients on maintenance dose.

 The VerifyNow assay will determine: - The PRU:-P2Y12 Reaction Units- -% Of platelet inhibition It will be considered low responder or clopidogrel resistant patient with PRU> 235 or %inhibition <15%.

 Monitoring of patients included in the study will take place over a period of 12 months, MACE will be notified and dated.

 MACE criteria are: angina, myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft, and stroke.

 Each hemorrhagic event will be notified and classified according to the GUSTO scale.

 Clinical Assessment of Pidogrel Versus Plavix (CAPP)@highlight

This study aims to demonstrate non-inferiority of Pidogrel (R) compared to Plavix (R) in patients with coronary disease: - Primary Outcome Measures: measure of platelet reactivity by VerifyNow assay after 600 mg loading dose or after the last maintenance dose (75 mg).

 - Secondary Outcome Measures: Time to first occurrence of major cardio-vascular events (MACE).

 - Safety Criteria: severe bleeding (GUSTO scale).
