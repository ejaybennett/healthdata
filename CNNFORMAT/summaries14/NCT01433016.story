(thirdQuint)Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) With Octanoate Breath ID Test Compared to MRI.

 The Octanoate Breath Test (OBT) developed by Exalenz is performed by the BreathID System consists of the BreathID device and a test kit containing a nasal cannula, a calibration gas container and a non-radioactive isotope C- Octanoate solution, and measures and computes the ratio between CO2 and 12CO2 in the patient's exhaled breath.

 This study's aim is to provide data on this novel system to dynamically and accurately assess liver function at the bed side.

 It is hoped that the system will provide prognostic information faster than is achieved at present with traditional methods.

 It is hypothesized that in the future the OBT may have an impact on decision making and clinical practice in this group of HCC patients, allowing a greater chance for proper management and hence survival.

The Exalenz clinical investigation is a multicenter, non-randomized, study of the C-Octanoate Breath Test (OBT).

 The present study is a feasibility trial, which aims to evaluate the capability of the OBT measurement to differentiate between presence and absence of HCC determined by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in patients with chronic liver disease.
