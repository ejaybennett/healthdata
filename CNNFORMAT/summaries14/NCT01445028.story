(thirdQuint)Isotretinoin for Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy.

 Small retrospective studies have shown isotretinoin to be effective in reducing the rate of recurrent retinal detachment in patients with or at high risk for developing PVR.

 This is a prospective study to evaluate a low dose of oral isotretinoin in this regard.

 There are two arms to the study: 1) eyes with recurrent retinal detachment due to existing PVR, and 2) eyes with primary detachment and features associated with a high risk of PVR formation.

 Eligible and willing patients will receive a 12-week course of isotretinoin, and will be followed for retinal attachment rate, and PVR and/or ERM (epiretinal membrane) formation.

 Isotretinoin for Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy@highlight

Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), or secondary scarring on and around the retina, is an important cause of retinal re-detachment.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of oral isotretinoin, which inhibits the growth of cells responsible for proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), on recurrent retinal detachment.
