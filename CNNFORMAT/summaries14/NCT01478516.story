(firstQuint)Autologous Plasmin and Fibrinolytic System in Diabetic Retinopathy.

 Autologous plasmin enzyme has been used to liquefy the gel structure of the vitreous body and to decrease the adherence of the posterior vitreous cortex to the inner limiting membrane in clinical studies.

 The investigators performed intravitreal autologous plasmin enzyme for macular edema.

 in addition, the investigators collected vitreous body in macular edema and analyzed fibrinolytic system.
