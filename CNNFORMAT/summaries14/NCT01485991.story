(secondQuint)TMC435HPC3001 - An Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability Study for TMC435 vs Telaprevir in Combination With PegINF-2a and Ribavirin in Chronic Hepatitis C Patients Who Were Null or Partial Responders to Prior PegINF-2a and Ribavirin Therapy.

 This study is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance like flipping a coin), double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned drug), double-dummy (patients receive both active and inactive pills also called placebo), 2-arm, multicenter Phase III clinical study in adult treatment experienced Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) genotype-1 infected patients who failed to respond during at least 1 previous course of PegINF-2a/ RBV therapy.

 The purpose of the trial is to study the efficacy of TMC435 in combination with PegINF-2a and RBV for 48 weeks of treatment compared to the approved regimen of telaprevir in combination with PegINF-2a and RBV for 48 weeks of treatment.

 The study will consist of a screening period (maximum 6 weeks), treatment period (48 weeks) and post-treatment period (until 72 weeks after the start of treatment).

 For the first 12 weeks one group of patients will take TMC435 and TVR placebo, plus PegINF-2a and RBV.

 The other group will take TMC435 placebo and TVR, plus PegINF-2a and RBV.

 After 12 weeks, patients in both arms will only take PegINF-2a and RBV up to week 48.

 After patients stop taking study medication, they will continue to go to the doctor's office for study visits until a total of 72 weeks after they start study treatment.

 Patients will be monitored for safety throughout the study.

 Study assessments at each study visit may include, but are not limited to: blood and urine collection for testing, electrocardiogram (ECG) assessments (a measurement of the electrical activity of your heart), patient questionnaires, and physical examinations.

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of TMC435 in combination with peginterferon (PegIFN) + ribavirin (RBV) by means of establishing its non- inferiority compared to an approved regimen of telaprevir + PegIFN + RBV in patients who have previously failed PegIFN.
