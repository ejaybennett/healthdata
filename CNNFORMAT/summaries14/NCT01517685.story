(thirdQuint)Hallelujah Acres Omega 3 Fat Study.

 This study is being conducted to compare the response of individuals to flax seed oil or fish oil, measured by blood lipids.

 Especially the amount of the long chain omega 3 polyunsaturated fats EPA and DHA will be tested.

 An omega 3 score for whole blood will be measured.

 The omega 3 score is the percent sum of omega 3 fats in the blood.

 The hypothesis is that 5 grams of fish oil will increase the amount of EPA and DHA in a person's blood to a protective level, and that 30 grams (2 tablespoons) of flax oil will not change the blood levels of EPA significantly and not change the blood concentrations of DHA at all, even for a person consuming a low omega 6 oil diet and following a vegan diet high in fruits and vegetables.

 Most of the testing of flax and fish oil has not been done in vegans.

 This trial will extend this testing to this subpopulation.
