(thirdQuint)Comparison of Two Naloxone Infusion Rates on the Postoperative Recovery of Patients Undergoing Spine Fusion Surgery.

 Currently, patients undergoing spinal fusion for scoliosis are routinely given patient controlled analgesia (PCA) for pain control postoperatively.

 PCA therapy is typically combined with an ultra low dose naloxone infusion because of the established benefit of reduced pruritis and nausea.

 The investigators hypothesize that using a higher dose naloxone infusion may lead to further improvement in pruritis and nausea and may improve GI function.

 Improvement in bowel function could lead to faster initiation of oral intake as well as transition to oral pain medication and even decreased length of stay.

There will be two groups in this study: one group will be given the standard infusion of naloxone, a drug which helps reduce side effects from opioids needed after surgery, and the other group will receive a higher dose.

 The trial is designed to determine if a higher dose of naloxone infusion will reduce side effects from opioid therapy in patients who have undergone spine fusion for scoliosis.
