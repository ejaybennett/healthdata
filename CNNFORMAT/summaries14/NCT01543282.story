 1.

 Objectives PRIMARY To compare diagnostic yield of stylet-free, solid lesion EUS-FNA using the 22 G FNA vs the 25 G FNA needle, in consecutive patients referred to EUS-FNA.

 SECONDARY To investigate: 1.

 specimen adequacy, 2.

 number of FNA passes, 3.

 ease of puncture, 4.

 failure of the FNA needle and 5.

 complications 3.

 Methods 3.

 The diagnostic yield of 15 G and 22 G needle will be evaluated by four criteria: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value.

 Sample size An expected rate of diagnostic yield from EUS guided FNA by using 22G needle of 85% will be considered.

 Endoscopic Ultrasonography (EUS) Guided Fine Needle Aspiration Using Free Stylet 22g and 25 g Needles@highlight

This is a randomized controlled study comparing EUS-FNA with 22 gauge and 25 gauge needles in consecutive patients.

 Summary Background: three needle sizes for endoscopic ultrasonography guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) are currently available: 22 Gauge (G), 25 G and 19 G.

 However, well design studies comparing them regarding efficacy and feasibility are lacking.

 Aims: to investigate diagnostic yield, specimen adequacy, feasibility and complications of the conventional 22 G compared with the 25 G needle.

 Methods: patients 18 years, referred to EUS-FNA for a solid lesion will be considered for inclusion.

 Patients with suspected diagnosis of lymphoma, GIST, sarcoidosis, significant coagulopathy (APT s t test.

 A two-tailed P values of less than 0.

05 will be considered statistically significant.

 The diagnostic yield of 25 G and 22 G needle will be evaluated by four criteria: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value.

 An expected rate of 85% diagnostic yield from EUS guided FNA by using 22G needle will be considered.

 By using a power of 80% and an value of 0.

05 would be necessary 120 patients per group to detect a 15% difference in the rate of diagnostic yield.
