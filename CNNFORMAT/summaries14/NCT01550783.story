(secondQuint)Home-Based or Clinic-Based Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Screening.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Compare the sensitivity and specificity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) of two screening approaches: - Novel approach: every 3 years high risk-human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing of (at home) self-collected samples with in-clinic cytology of HR-HPV positive women and referral to colposcopy of women with cytology > atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASCUS); repeat HPV testing of HR-HPV positive but cytology negative women at one year; - Currently recommended approach: for women ASCUS; retesting of those who are positive for other HR-HPV at one year.

 II.

 Compare these two approaches with respect to overall cost-effectiveness and acceptability.

 III.

 Determine the performance and cost-effectiveness of each approach in vaccinated and unvaccinated women < 30.

 OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 GROUP I (home-based HPV screening): Participants collect 2 vaginal specimens using polyester swabs.

 Participants with a positive HPV test result will have a Pap test.

 Participants with an abnormal Pap test will undergo standard of care as in Group II.

 GROUP II (clinic-based standard of care screening): Participants undergo Pap testing.

 Participants with a positive Pap test undergo standard of care, including colposcopy, HPV testing, cervical biopsy and/or endocervical curettage (ECC).

 Participants with cervical biopsies showing precancerous changes requiring treatment may undergo loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) or are referred to appropriate care.

 Home-Based or Clinic-Based Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Screening@highlight

This randomized clinical trial studies home-based HPV or clinic-based Pap screening for cervical cancer.

 It is not yet known whether home-based screening is more effective, cost-effective, and/or acceptable than clinic-based screening for cervical cancer.
