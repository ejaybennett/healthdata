(firstQuint)Using Genetic Polymorphisms to Predict the Efficacy and Toxicity - A Gastric Adenocarcinoma Study.

 There are two primary objectives in different steps.

 In the first step, the primary objective of this study is to investigate the objective response rate in patients receiving sequential capecitabine plus oxaliplatin followed by docetaxel plus capecitabine in patients with unresectable gastric adenocarcinoma.

 In the second step, the primary objective of this study is to screen the predictive biomarkers of three different chemotherapeutic drugs and also investigate the objective response rate in patients receiving sequential capecitabine plus oxaliplatin followed by docetaxel plus capecitabine in patients with unresectable gastric adenocarcinoma.

This is an open-label, non-comparative phase II study of sequential capecitabine plus oxaliplatin followed by docetaxel plus capecitabine in patients with unresectable gastric adenocarcinoma.
