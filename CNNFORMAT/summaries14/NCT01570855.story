(thirdQuint)Chemotherapy Resistance and Sensitivity Testing in Lung Tumors.

 The chemosensitivity assay will be performed on tissue obtained during the diagnostic fine needle aspiration, core biopsy, or excisional biopsy of the lung lesion.

 Cancer cells (Bulk of tumor) and Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) will be isolated and expanded in the laboratory.

 The drug screening assay will be used to evaluate the response of the CSCs and of the cancer cells to the various chemotherapy regimens.

 Chemotherapy Resistance and Sensitivity Testing in Lung Tumors@highlight

The purpose of this study is to screen chemotherapy drugs currently used to treat lung cancer and determine the most effective treatment based on results of chemo sensitivity testing on the patients own cancer cells in the laboratory.

 The results of this screening will not influence the patients treatment.
