(thirdQuint)Aminolevulinic Acid in Visualizing a Tumor During Surgery in Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the volume of residual enhancing tumor after a 5-ALA guided resection of a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

 II.

 Determine the volume of tissue removed compared to the measured enhancing tumor evaluated on a pre-operative MRI.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the time to tumor progression.

 II.

 Evaluate the overall survival.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive aminolevulinic acid orally (PO) 2-4 hours before surgery.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 weeks.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and performance of an investigational agent, known as 5-ALA or Gliolan (aminolevulinic acid), that many be useful to a surgeon for visualizing a tumor during surgery.

 It is also being studied to determine if there are differences in what Gliolan shows a surgeon compared to intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
