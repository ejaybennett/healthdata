(fifthQuint)Reliability and Validation of 3-D Electromagnetic Tracking During Pelvic Floor Muscle (PFM) Activation - a Pilot Study.

 There will be two measurements.

 One measurement of MVIC and quick flicks will be done in a standing and supine position with 3 repetitions.

 The TrakSTARTM, Ultrasound, surface EMG and Accelerometer will measure the PFM movements and activation simultaneously.

 The Ultrasound is measured from one tester (to guaranty a high intratester reliability) (Sherburn et al.

, 2005).

 TrakSTARTM, surface EMG and Accelerometer will measure 3 Trampoline jumps.

 The measurements will be done once during one hour.

 The women will insert the vaginal probe by themselves and stay dressed during the measurement procedure.

 The measurements will be done in a standardized way.

 All the arrangements are made to ensure the hygiene requirements.

 Reliability and Validation of 3-D Electromagnetic Tracking During Pelvic Floor Muscle (PFM) Activation - a Pilot Study@highlight

Now a days the ultrasound is seen as a valid and reliable measurement tool to test the Pelvic Floor Muscle (PFM) movement (Sherburn, Murphy, Carroll, Allen, & Galea, 2005).

 The hypothesis is that the electromagnetic tracking system, TrakSTARTM, can measure the PFM movement in an equal or even more precise way.

 The TrakSTARTM will have the advantage to be used in measuring functional movements.

 In this Master thesis the hypothesis is to show a good reliability by trampoline jumping (physical activity).
