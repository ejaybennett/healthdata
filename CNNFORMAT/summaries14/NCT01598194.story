(secondQuint)Comparison of a Novel 22-gauge Core Biopsy Needle.

 An endoscopic ultrasound-guided needle biopsy or FNA is a special endoscopic procedure used to sample lesions within or next to the digestive tract, including the pancreas.

 The needle is used to collect material for diagnosis.

 A special lighted, flexible tube called an endoscope is inserted through the mouth, into the stomach and small intestine.

 The endoscope also has a ultrasound probe at its tip which can be used to see the pancreas, which is located behind the stomach.

 The doctor will then use the ultrasound to guide the needle biopsy or FNA.

 In this clinic, an average of 4 needle passes (needle sticks) are needed to collect enough tissue for diagnosis.

 However, the number of passes can be higher or lower, depending on the individual lesion and success of the needle passes.

 If you agree to take part in this study, 2 different needles (the standard straight hollow-core needle and the new EchoTip(R) Procore cent needle) will be used to sample the pancreas lesion.

 Two (2) passes will be performed with each needle type and compared.

 If additional passes are needed for diagnosis, they will not be included in this study.

 After the first set of needle passes, the doctor may decide that more passes are needed.

 Final test results will be taken from the diagnostic results from each needle pass.

 The results from both types of needle will be included in your medical record.

 This is an investigational study.

 All needles used in this study are FDA approved and commercially available.

 Comparing the needles is investigational.

 Up to 60 patients will take part in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

 Comparison of a Novel 22-gauge Core Biopsy Needle@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the performance of a newly available needle with reverse bevel design (called the EchoTip(R) Procore cent needle) with standard needles to see which needle gives better diagnostic information for pancreatic lesions.
