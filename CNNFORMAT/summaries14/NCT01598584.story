 The investigators planed to enroll 33 patients for each arm after randomization.

 The inclusion criteria included: 1.

Depression and anxiety accompany with advanced cancer.

 The effect of anti-anxiety depression has not evaluated in special cancers.

 Mirtazapine is a drug anti-anxiety depression and has a high risk increase weight.

 So the investigators assume Mirtazapine would not only improve the anxiety and depression of metastasis pancreas cancer but also would improve the appetite of such patients which would improve dyscrasia of pancreas cancer patients.

 The drug may improve the quality of life in advanced pancreatic cancer which is of short survival.
