(secondQuint)Biomarker Sub Study of the Compression Stockings to Prevent the Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (SOX) Trial.

 The post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a frequent, burdensome and costly condition that occurs in about one third of patients after an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

 Affected patients have chronic leg pain and swelling, and sometimes develop skin ulcers.

 Poor understanding of the pathophysiology and predictors of PTS has hampered progress in its prevention and treatment.

 Biomarkers reflective of inflammation, genetic thrombophilia and coagulation activation may be of value in predicting PTS development in patients with DVT; they may also provide insight into understanding the underlying mechanisms of PTS, which could result in the development and testing of novel therapies to prevent and treat PTS.

 Biomarker Sub Study of the Compression Stockings to Prevent the Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (SOX) Trial@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether biomarkers of inflammation, genetic thrombophilia and coagulation activation influence Post-Thrombotic Syndrome development in patients with symptomatic proximal deep venous thrombosis.
