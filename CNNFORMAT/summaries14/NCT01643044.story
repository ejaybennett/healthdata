(fifthQuint)Computer-delivered Screening and Brief Intervention for Alcohol Use in Pregnancy.

 Infants born to African-American and/or low SES women appear to be at increased risk of adverse effects due to prenatal exposure to alcohol.

 Computer-delivered SBIRT approaches may provide consistent screening and evidence-based brief interventions, at low cost, without requiring substantial investments of time or energy from medical staff.

 However, several Stage I steps are necessary before moving to a Stage II clinical trial.

 This R34 application will therefore lay the groundwork for a fully powered clinical trial of a computer-delivered SBIRT for alcohol use during pregnancy.

 It will do so through the conduct of five key preliminary studies, including: (1) evaluation of the utility of handheld mobile devices and an anonymous self-interview format in screening for at-risk drinking among patients attending a prenatal clinic; (2) modification of an existing computer-delivered motivational intervention for alcohol use during pregnancy, to previously set standards of acceptability (to experts as well as representative pregnant women); (3) development of an evidence-based tailored messaging supplement to the single-session brief intervention; (4) examining the validity of, and cut scores for, the biomarker Ethyl Glucoronide (EtG) in pregnant women; and (5) collecting data on the acceptability, feasibility, and estimated effect size of the modified computer-delivered intervention through an N = 50 Phase I randomized clinical trial.

 Participants in this trial will be a diverse sample of women at-risk for alcohol use during pregnancy, the majority of whom will be African-American and/or low SES.

 These key preparatory steps will greatly facilitate the subsequent development of an R01 application to conduct a Stage II clinical trial for alcohol use during pregnancy.

 These steps will also provide important preliminary data on (a) a novel method for risk factor screening in primary care; (b) the potential utility of EtG as a biomarker for alcohol use during pregnancy and in the perinatal period; and (c) the effect size estimate for a fully computer-delivered, combined brief interactive/tailored messaging intervention requiring only a single contact.

 If successful, this line of research could lead to a highly cost-effective, high-reach intervention for alcohol use during pregnancy; these reductions in alcohol use could in turn have a meaningful population impact on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.

 Computer-delivered Screening and Brief Intervention for Alcohol Use in Pregnancy@highlight

The purpose of this study is to lay the ground work for a fully powered clinical trial of a computer-delivered screener and intervention for alcohol use during pregnancy.

 The pilot study will include: 1.

 Evaluation of the usefulness of handheld devices and anonymous screening for self report of at-risk alcohol use among pregnant women.

 2.

 Assessing the validity of an alcohol biomarker, Ethyl Glucoronide (EtG), for the detection of at-risk drinking in pregnant women.

 3.

 Evaluation of the efficacy of a computer-delivered brief intervention and use of tailored handouts to supplement the computer-based brief intervention focusing on alcohol use during pregnancy.
