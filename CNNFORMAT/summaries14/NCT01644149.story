(secondQuint)Clinical Trial Assessing the Immunologic Response to a Influenza Vaccine Delivered Using an Jet Injection Device or a Needle Syringe.

 Needle-free jet injection devices create a fine stream of pressurized liquid that is able to deliver vaccines and other pharmaceutical products beneath the skin.

 Design aspects such as quality, pressure, orifice size, angle of injection relative to skin and injection stream coherence control the depth to which the product is delivered.

 This technology provides a safer delivery option for patients and healthcare staff by removing the need for needles for the administration of vaccines.

 In addition to improved safety, additional benefits of using jet injectors include more consistent and reliable dose volume delivery, reduced vaccine waste, diminished need to transport large quantities of sharps, reduced risk of needle sticks, syringe reuse, and costs associated with sharps waste.

 Jet injectors offer a needle-free procedure to those individuals who are adverse to needles.

 This study compared the efficacy of a disposable syringe jet injection device (Stratis) with traditional needle and syringe (NS) administration for the delivery of a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine.

 Efficacy was evaluated by comparing measures of hemagglutination inhibition (HI); specifically GMTs, seroconversion and seroprotection.

 Safety of the two administration devices was evaluated by comparison of incidence of solicited local and systemic adverse events.

 Clinical Trial Assessing the Immunologic Response to a Influenza Vaccine Delivered Using an Jet Injection Device or a Needle Syringe@highlight

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate if administration of a seasonal flu vaccine using a jet injector device is comparable to traditional needle and syringe delivery for eliciting an immune response.

 A secondary objective was to compare the safety of the two delivery methods.
