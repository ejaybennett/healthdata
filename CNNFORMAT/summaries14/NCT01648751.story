(thirdQuint)Vaginal Estrogen and Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy in Women With Symptomatic Mild Prolapse.

 The pathogenesis of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is unknown.

 Few studies have correlated patient symptoms and amount of prolapse with biomarkers.

 POP has traditionally been managed with a pessary or surgery.

 Recent studies suggest a reduction in POP symptoms following Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy (PFPT).

 Vaginally delivered hormones are also commonly used to treat prolapse symptoms, with little evidence supporting a clinical benefit.

 The investigators hypothesize that the optimal approach to improving prolapse symptoms in the patient with mild prolapse requires re-alignment and strengthening of levator muscles via PFPT, and optimization of tissue integrity via local estrogen therapy.

 The investigators propose to test this hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial in which women with symptomatic mild prolapse opting for PFPT, receive treatment with PFPT in combination with vaginal estrogen versus placebo.

 The investigators predict that the combined approach will lead to decreased symptoms and improved anatomical support corroborated by biomarker data.

This is a randomized controlled trial in which women with symptomatic mild pelvic organ prolapse undergoing Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy (PFPT) receive vaginal estrogen versus placebo to see if a combined approach to treatment leads to improvement in clinical outcomes.

 The investigators predict that PFPT in combination with vaginal estrogen will lead to decreased pelvic floor symptoms and improved anatomical support corroborated by biomarker data.
