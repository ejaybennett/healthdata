(fifthQuint)A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of MK-8457 in Participants With Rheumatoid Arthritis (MK-8457-010).

 In the Base Study, participants were to receive blinded MK-8457 100 mg + MTX or matched placebo + MTX for up to 24 weeks.

 At Week 12 and 18, efficacy evaluation was conducted to assess eligibility for early escape, defined as therapies or was intolerant to anti-TNF- therapy prior to Screening.

 For participants who failed therapy, the treatment with anti-TNF- therapies must have been for at least 3 months.

 A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of MK-8457 in Participants With Rheumatoid Arthritis (MK-8457-010)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of MK-8457 + Methotrexate (MTX) in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and an inadequate response or intolerance to anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF-) therapy.

 The primary hypothesis of this study is that among participants with active RA, MK-8457 100 mg twice daily (BID) + MTX will be superior to placebo + MTX as measured by the change in Disease Activity Score 28 C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) after 12 weeks of treatment.
