(fifthQuint)Pulsed Radiofrequency vs.

 Steroid Injections for Occipital Neuralgia.

 Up to 76 patients referred to one of the participating pain clinic with occipital neuralgia, or migraines with occipital nerve tenderness (dual diagnoses) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio by a computer generated randomization table to receive one of two treatments.

 Treatments will be randomized at each institution.

 Within each group, those patients with plain occipital neuralgia, and those with occipital neuralgia with migraines, will be sub-randomized in the same 1:1 ratio.

 Diagnosis of ON will be made by low-volume ( 50% pain relief lasting at least 3 hours.

 Those individuals who have symptoms in the distribution of both the greater and lesser occipital nerves will receive treatment of both nerves.

 The greater occipital nerve is more frequently affected than the lesser nerve.

 Half (n=38) of the patients will be allocated to receive local anesthetic & corticosteroid injections at each nerve (group I), with an equal number allocated to receive local anesthetic & PRF at each (group II).

 In those patients who request sedation, an intravenous will be inserted and light sedation administered with low doses of midazolam and fentanyl, in accordance with our standard clinic practice.

 Treatment in all patients will be accomplished using 20-gauge radiofrequency needles with 10 mm active tips.

 Prior to treating, electrical stimulation will be performed to ensure ample proximity to the targeted nerve(s), with our target threshold being concordant stimulation at 50% decrease in headache coupled with a positive satisfaction rating (> 3 on a 0-5 scale).

 Subjects who obtain a positive outcome at their initial 6-week follow-up visit will remain in the study and return for their 3-month follow-up visit.

 Those with a negative outcome will exit the study "per protocol" to receive standard care.

 Subjects who obtain a positive outcome at 1-month but experience a recurrence before their 3-month follow-up visit will also exit the study per protocol, with their final outcome measures recorded before they receive standard care.

 Those who obtain a positive outcome at 3-months will remain in the study for their final 6-month follow-up, while those who obtain a negative outcome will exit the study.

 Unblinding for both patients and the treating physician will be after the patient exits the study or after their final follow-up visit for those with continued benefit.

 Pulsed Radiofrequency vs.

 Steroid Injections for Occipital Neuralgia@highlight

The aim of this study is to determine whether pulsed radiofrequency or steroids are better for occipital neuralgia.

 Seventy-six patients with ON or migraine with tenderness over the occipital nerve who respond to occipital nerve blocks (hereafter included under the broad category "ON") will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either corticosteroid and local anesthetic injections (n=38) or local anesthetic and PRF of the occipital nerve(s) (n=38) for occipital neuralgia.

 Both patients and the treating & evaluating physicians will be blinded.

 The first follow-up visit will be at 6 weeks.

 Patients who obtain significant pain relief will remain in the study.

 Those patients who fail to obtain any benefit will exit the study and be allowed to crossover to the other treatments or receive alternative care.

 The second follow-up will be at 3 months and the final follow-up will be at 6-months post-procedure.
