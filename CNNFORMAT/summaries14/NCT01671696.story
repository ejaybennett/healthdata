(thirdQuint)Defining Late Onset Occult Asymptomatic Cardiotoxicity in Childhood Cancer Survivors Exposed to Anthracycline Therapy.

 Part A: Patients who received a high dose of anthracyclines and who completed chemotherapy for a minimum of 2 year and are still in remission we gathered information about their previous heart disease, radiation dose to the heart, bone marrow transplant, age at treatment, gender, elevation of serum cardiac troponin-T or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide measurements during anthracycline therapy, systolic dysfunction and congestive heart failure during anthracycline therapy.

 Participants had a Cardiac MRI (CMRI), echo and collection of serum for the the measurement of biomarkers of inflammation (C Reactive Protein (CRP), TNF-, myocyte injury (Cardiac troponin (cTn), extracellular matrix remodeling, (Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP), Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), C terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP), C terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (CITP), Bone Alkaline Phosphatase, apoptosis (Caspase-3 P17 peptide), and ventricular derived B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) once during the study.

 Part A has been completed.

 Part B: For those patients enrolled in part A they had another CMRI to validate CMRI findings and to study progression of cardiomyopathy overtime by comparing all CMRI derived imaging parameters between the first and second subject visits.

 Results of their standard of care echo will be post-processed to include the same parameters as the subjects' previous research echo that took place 2 years ago for comparison.

 Subjects had a blood draw (3mL) for for DNA and RNA analysis.

 Part B has been completed.

 Part C: Will include an additional 60 patients who received low dose anthracycline therapy (, interleukins, interferon gamma (IFNG), TGF 2, TGF II)), cytokine receptors (sTNF RI, sTNF RII, sSt2, sgp130, siL1RII/sCD121b, siL-2R/CD25, siL-4R, siL- 6R, Endoglin), acute phase proteins: CRP; Signaling pathway: growth factors(GDP-15, GCSF, VEGF, sVEGFR2 TGF1, IGF-1; Cell viability/growth domain: Indices of myocyte death and apoptosis(Caspase-3 P17 peptide), myocyte injury (cardiac troponin T (cTnT); Neuro-hormones: NTproBNP;.

 All measurements will be done in duplicate using an internally validated and calibrated multiplex suspension array.

 Results of the standard of care echo will be post-processed to include the same parameters as the original 60 subjects' previous research echocardiogram for comparison purposes.

 All subjects recruited will serve either as a "case" (because they have cardiotoxicity) or as a control, if they are free of cardiotoxicity.

 Currently enrolling for part C patients who received low dose anthracyclines.

 Cardiotoxicity for the overall group will be defined as global systolic dysfunction (indicated by an ejection fraction 240 mg/m2) subjects.

 Frequencies and percents of the patients who exhibit the phenotype of cardiotoxicity as measured by cMRI will be calculated for each study visit.

 If the frequencies/percents are the same or greater in the second visit as compared to the first, then the use of cMRI to indicate anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity can be validated.

 Specific Aim 2: All CMR imaging parameters of athracycline induced cardiomyopathy will be compared between the first and second study visits among high dose (240 mg/m2) subjects.

 All CMR volumetric parameters including volumes, mass, and measurements of end systolic fiber stress as well as measurements of global and regional myocardial function, T1 maps and ECV will be compared between the two study visits using paired t-tests, p<0.

05 will be used to indicate a statistically significant difference.

 Part C: Specific Aim 1: The objective of this aim is to test the hypothesis that CMR imaging biomarkers of AIC will be less frequent among subjects exposed to low dose anthracyclines.

 The proportion of subjects that possess the anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity phenotype in both the high and low dose groups will be compared using Fisher's exact test.

 P< 0.

05 will be used to indicate a statistically significant difference.

 Specific Aim 2: This aim will tell the hypothesis that elevation of biomarkers of inflammation, myocyte injury, extracellular matrix remodeling and apoptosis will be less prevalent in survivors of childhood cancer exposed to low-dose anthracyclines, as reflected by lower levels of serum CRP, high sensitivity troponin, MMPs and Caspase-3 P17 levels.

 The objective is to characterize changes in serum levels of markers for extracellular matrix remodeling and apoptosis in patients at various intervals after anthracycline chemotherapy.

 Serum levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-1/TIMP ratio, PICP, CITP, Bone Alkaline Phosphatase and that of Caspase-3 P17 peptide will be measured as indicators of extracellular matrix remodeling and apoptosis, respectively and compared to CMRI and echocardiographic parameters of systolic and diastolic function.

 Serum level of a cleaved p17 fragment (p17) of Caspase-3, the end effector caspase for apoptosis, will be compared to published normative data from a group of 167 healthy subjects.

 Circulating levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 will be compared to normal controls.

 Serum biomarkers N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) and Cardiac troponin will also be obtained given their known association with cardiac dysfunction.

 DNA and RNA analysis will be collected for future analysis by the Jackson Lab bioinformatics core unit, to be analyzed based on the results of a parallel murine model of cardiotoxicity.

 Defining Late Onset Occult Asymptomatic Cardiotoxicity in Childhood Cancer Survivors Exposed to Anthracycline Therapy@highlight

The main hypothesis being tested is that imaging and serologic biomarkers of apoptosis and progressive extracellular matrix remodeling will precede echocardiographic indices of systolic and diastolic function among childhood cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines thus allowing evaluation of new therapies to prevent and manage heart failure in these patients.
