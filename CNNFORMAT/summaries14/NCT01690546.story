(thirdQuint)Low Dose Naltrexone-buprenorphine Transfer to Vivitrol Injection in Opioid Dependence.

 Thirty-five opioid dependent (OD) volunteers seeking treatment will be enrolled in an open-label, flexible-dosing, outpatient trial at Duke Addictions Program.

 On days 1-3, participants will receive buprenorphine/naloxone daily at a starting dose of 4mg, progressively decreasing to 2 mg on days 2- 3.

 Participants will also receive very low dose naltrexone (VLNTX) at a dose of 0.

25 mg to 1mg on Days 1-3, 2 to 6 mg on Day 4 and between 10 and 50 mg on Days 5-7.

 Then a VIVITROL injection, 380 mg, will be administered on Day 8.

 Evaluations will occur daily for up to 6 hours until 1 day after VIVITROL injection and then weekly for 4 weeks.

 Patients will receive ancillary medications as needed and weekly psychosocial intervention.

 At the end of the study, participants will be offered outpatient treatment of OD at the study site, or will be referred to other treatment programs.

 Low Dose Naltrexone-buprenorphine Transfer to Vivitrol Injection in Opioid Dependence@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate a very low dose naltrexone-buprenorphine treatment to transfer opioid dependent individuals to extended release naltrexone injection (Vivitrol).

 The hypothesis is that patients will complete the transfer to Vivitrol successfully, finding the treatment acceptable and showing minimal withdrawal discomfort.
