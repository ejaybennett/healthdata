(secondQuint)Role of the Isomerase Pin-1 in the Development and Treatment of Asthma.

 The investigators will test their hypothesis that Pin1 regulates TLR/IL-1R signaling pathways in asthma by examining Pin1 and related pathway activation in BAL-derived eosinophils after house dust mite allergen challenge.

 The investigators will perform segmental allergen challenge.

 BAL and lung biopsy of the allergen-challenged segments will be performed 48 hr later and activation of Pin1 and related pathways will be examined.

 Role of the Isomerase Pin-1 in the Development and Treatment of Asthma@highlight

Pin1 is activated in asthmatic airways, increasing cytokine mRNA stability and eosinophil survival.

 This study is designed to test whether the Pin1 enzyme regulates TLR/IL-1R signal pathways in multiple cells in asthma.
