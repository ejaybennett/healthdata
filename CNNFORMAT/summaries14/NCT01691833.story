(thirdQuint)The Effect of Hypovitaminosis D and Vitamin D Supplementation on Fracture Nonunion Rates.

 Vitamin D plays an important role in maintaining calcium and phosphate balance in the body and is important for maintenance of bone formation, remodeling, and healing.

 An extensive literature search indicates that although there is evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with fracture risk, there is no evidence of the role of vitamin D deficiency in subsequent failure to heal.

 This study aims to determine whether the relationship of vitamin D deficiency to nonunion is clinically relevant by showing whether its treatment can decrease the risk of nonunion.

 We will determine the incidence of nonunion in patients with untreated hypovitaminosis D and calculate the relative and absolute risk reductions for nonunion with normal vitamin D levels compared to untreated hypovitaminosis D.

 We will also calculate the relative and absolute risk reductions for nonunion with hypovitaminosis D treated with vitamin D supplementation compared to placebo.

 The Effect of Hypovitaminosis D and Vitamin D Supplementation on Fracture Nonunion Rates@highlight

The purpose of the study is to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in patients with hypovitaminosis D can decrease nonunion (failure to heal) incidence in patients with fractures of the humerus, femur, or tibia.

 The central hypothesis of the study is that vitamin D supplementation in patients with fractures and hypovitaminosis D will decrease the risk of nonunion compared to placebo treatment.
