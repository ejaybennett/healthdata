(firstQuint)Fluid Resuscitation for Pediatric Diabetic Ketoacidosis.

 A randomized trial of two initial volumes of IVF and subsequent administration rates.

 Group I received 10 mL/kg of NS intravenous bolus over the first hour followed by 3/4 NS with potassium replacement at 1.

25 times maintenance and Group II received 20 mL/kg of NS intravenous bolus over the first hour followed by 3/4 NS with potassium replacement at 1.

5 times maintenance.

 The specific variables measured included demographics (age, gender, and race/ethnicity) and routine laboratory values (pH, pCO2, plasma glucose, electrolytes, bicarbonate, sodium, chloride, BUN.

 Length of treatment was defined as a time of the hospital stay after the start of IVF infusion.
