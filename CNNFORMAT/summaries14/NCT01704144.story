(fifthQuint)Rifampin and Efavirenz Interactions in Older Children.

 Efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the preferred regimen in children older than 3 years on rifampin-containing anti-TB therapy.

 Efavirenz trough plasma concentrations below 1000 ng/mL have been associated with increased risk of virologic failure among HIV-infected adults, while concentrations above 4000 ng/mL have been associated with risk of central nervous system side effects.

 Efavirenz is primarily metabolized by hepatic CYP2B6, with secondary contributions from CYP2A6.

 On average, rifampin co-administration causes a 26% reduction in efavirenz plasma exposure but some individuals have paradoxically elevated efavirenz concentrations with co-administration in adult pharmacokinetic studies.

 The inter-individual variability in the drug-to-drug interactions suggest that efavirenz dose adjustment with concomitant anti-TB therapy may not be necessary in some patients.

 In children, there is very limited data on the pharmacokinetic interactions between rifampin-containing TB treatment and efavirenz.

 To our knowledge, there is only one published study in children to date.

 Among 15 TB/HIV co-infected children treated with standard efavirenz-based active antiretroviral therapy and rifampin-containing TB treatment, a wide inter-patient variability in efavirenz concentration as well as a bimodal distribution of efavirenz trough concentrations were observed.

 Overall, rifampin-containing anti-TB treatment had no significant influence on the mean change in efavirenz concentration in the study population as a whole, but 60% and 53% of children had efavirenz trough concentration 40Kg - 600 mg), plus ZDV 180 - 240 mg/m2 and 3TC 4 mg/kg twice daily.

 Tenofovir may be used in place of ZDV.

 Standard anti-TB therapy will be prescribed to the co-infected patients and will start immediately upon TB diagnosis.

 A complete medical history, physical examination, and staging of HIV disease will be performed before initiation of ART.

 Baseline measurements prior to initiation of ART will include CBC, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, LFTs, CD4 cell count determination and plasma HIV-1 RNA level.

 Weeks 12 and 24 CD4 cell count and plasma HIV-1 RNA will obtained at scheduled follow-up.

 Pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed at week 4 of ART in both arms and at 4 weeks after anti-TB treatment in the co-infected group.

 At each sampling time, 3 mL of blood will be collected into an EDTA tube.

 Blood samples will be collected at times 0 2, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose for determination of efavirenz concentrations.

 Efavirenz concentrations in plasma will be measured using a HPLC-MS.

 After sample analysis, a data set will be constructed.

 Anticipated covariates included in this data set to be explored will include age, sex, weight, relevant drug-metabolizing enzyme genotype, TB therapy status (on/off), and CD4 cell count.

 Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (using NONMEM, version VI) will be used to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters (CL/F, V/F, AUC, Cmin, Cmax, elimination rate constant), inter-individual error, and residual error.

 Results of this population analysis may be used to simulate alternative efavirenz dosing strategies in this TB/HIV co-infected population, or in relevant sub-populations with variant PK/pharmacogenetics.

 Rifampin and Efavirenz Interactions in Older Children@highlight

Efavirenz is an essential component of HIV treatment in children aged 3 years or older on anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) treatment.

 However, the appropriate efavirenz dose during anti-TB treatment remains unclear.

 Rifampin (an anti-TB drug) increases the activity of the drug metabolizing enzymes that breakdown efavirenz, which may lead to low blood levels of efavirenz and treatment failure during cotreatment.

 The drug-to-drug interactions between the HIV and anti-TB drugs also vary between individuals based on genetic factors.

 This study will investigate the effects of anti-TB treatment, as well as drug-gene interactions on the blood concentrations of efavirenz in children with HIV and TB infections.

 Such data could enhance optimization of efavirenz dosage or selection of alternate regimens in some children.
