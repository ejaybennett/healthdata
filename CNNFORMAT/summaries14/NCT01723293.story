(firstQuint)Fetal Cardiovascular Response to Maternal Exercise During Third Trimester.

 Fetal heart rate is considered an important index of fetal well-being, especially during the third trimester of pregnancy (Rodney JR, Huntley BJ, Rodney WM, 2012).

 An increase in the FHR of 5-25 beats per min (bpm) in response to maternal exercise has been established as a normal reaction(Riemann,Kanstrup Hansen, 2000)however the normal FHR response to maternal exercise has remained unclear for several reasons Most of the studies are focused on obtain data in order to examine the fetal heart rate response to maternal exercise using cardiotocography measurements prior to and following maternal exercise.

The purpose of this study was to examine the behavior of the fetal heart rate in response to different intensities of acute maternal exercise in training and non-training pregnant women
