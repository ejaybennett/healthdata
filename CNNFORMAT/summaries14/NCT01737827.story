(firstQuint)Study Efficacy and Safety of INC280 in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

.

 This study is designed as a Phase II, single arm, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of INC280 as first-line treatment in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are not eligible for or had disease progression after surgical or locoregional therapies, with c- MET dysregulation.

 The study includes a Dose-Determining Part and a Dose Expansion Part.

 Pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of INC280 in the setting of liver dysfunction will be determined in the Dose-Determining Part.

 The Dose Expansion Part will start when the appropriate dose for patients with liver dysfunction is determined based on pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety data from the Dose-Determining Part and other INC280 ongoing clinical studies.
