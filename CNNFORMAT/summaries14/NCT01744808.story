(firstQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerance, and Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Profile Of 1 SR Formulation of EB-1020.

 - To investigate the safety and tolerance of single doses of EB-1020 immediate release (IR) versus three sustained release (SR) formulations.

 - To investigate the safety and tolerance of a single oral dose of a SR formulation of EB-1020 in the fed and fasted state.

 - To investigate the safety, tolerance, and cognitive effects of multiple oral rising doses of a SR formulation of EB-1020.

 Secondary Objectives - To characterize the single dose and steady state pharmacokinetic profiles of EB-1020 SR formulations.

 - To investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic profile of EB-1020 SR following single oral doses.
