(thirdQuint)A Study of Vitamin C in the Treatment of Liver Cancer to Determine if it is Safe and Effective.

 Intravenous Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is a widely used alternative cancer treatment.

 This trial will study an intravenous Vitamin C treatment for persons with liver cancer that has spread, who are also receiving Sorafenib (a standard cancer drug), to see whether the combination of Vitamin C and Sorafenib is safe and well tolerated.

 Phase I will involve 6 persons who will receive the Vitamin C for 8 weeks to more specifically assess the safety of getting Vitamin C in combination with Sorafenib.

 Phase II will be randomized to receive either Vitamin C plus Sorafenib or Sorafenib alone for 16 weeks.

 If Vitamin C has a beneficial effect on tumour cells, patients may experience a regression of tumor or tumor markers.

 Additional benefits include scans at no charge to the patient.

 A Study of Vitamin C in the Treatment of Liver Cancer to Determine if it is Safe and Effective@highlight

This protocol is a phase I/II, study of ascorbic acid (AA) infusions combined with treatment with sorafenib versus treatment with sorafenib alone in subjects with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

 The phase I aspect will assess the safety and efficacy of the concurrent treatments and the phase II aspect will utilize CT (computer-tomography) scans to assess overall tumor response rate and evaluate disease progression
