(fifthQuint)A Phase I Dose Escalation Study of CGM097 in Adult Patients With Selected Advanced Solid Tumors.

 This is a multi-center, open-label, dose finding, phase I study of single agent CGM097, administered in patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed despite standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists.

 Patients' tumors must be characterized by p53wt status.

 The study consists of a dose escalation part, where cohorts of three to six newly enrolled patients will receive escalating doses of CGM097, and a dose expansion part, in which patients are given CGM097 the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).

 Novartis and the site investigators will jointly decide on each dose escalation step based on the recommendation from an adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM).

 If safety data should indicate a lower increment than suggested by the BLRM, the next dose level (DL) will be adjusted accordingly.

This is a first in human phase I study of single agent CGM097 in patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed despite standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists.

 The tumor must be characterized by p53wt status.

 The study consists of a dose escalation part where patients will receive escalating doses of CGM097, and a dose expansion part in which patients are given CGM097 at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).

 Each dose escalation step will be decided based on the recommendation from an adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM).
