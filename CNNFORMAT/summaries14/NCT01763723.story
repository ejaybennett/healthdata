 Twenty-one healthy subjects will be exposed to UV-exposures 8 times over 3 weeks on a test-area (4 x 6cm) on one buttock to induce pigmentation.

 This will be followed by 3 weekly IPL (intense pulsed light) exposures.

The skin will be evaluated after IPL exposure for: skin reactions, pain and mRNA expression of two pigment markers.
