(fifthQuint)Modifiers of Disease Severity in Cerebral Cavernous Malformations.

 This study is one of three projects participating in the Brain Vascular Malformation Consortium (BVMC) funded by the Office of Rare Diseases Research, which is part of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

 The CCM project is a cross-sectional and longitudinal study of familial CCM patients.

 The study is currently in the second 5-year cycle.

 During the first 5 year cycle, the CCM project was focused on recruiting CCM1 cases with the common Hispanic mutation (CHM).

 For the second 5-year cycle, we are expanding recruitment to include not only CCM1-CHM cases, but also other CCM familial patients and mutation carriers.

 We will collect clinical, genetic, imaging, treatment, and outcome data in participants, and follow the cohort over time to understand the natural history of this disease.

 For new study participants, you will be asked to: - Give permission for study staff to access your medical records to collect clinical information and to obtain copies of MRI scans and reports - Fill out a questionnaire about your quality of life, family history, and medical/surgical history - Give a blood sample and/or saliva sample - Give permission to store and use your CCM resected tissue for research (if undergoing surgery) - Participate in annual follow-ups to update medical, surgical, and neurological information.

 Modifiers of Disease Severity in Cerebral Cavernous Malformations@highlight

Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are clusters of abnormal blood vessels in the brain and spine.

 CCMs can bleed and cause strokes, seizures, and headaches.

 CCMs are often caused by an inherited gene mutation (alteration) called CCM1.

 There is a wide range of disease severity even among family members with this disease, though the natural history has not been clearly described for this particular population.

 This study will examine factors that influence disease severity through the collection of blood samples, detailed medical histories, physical and neurological exam, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in medical records.

 The specific goals of this study are to: 1.

 establish a registry/database of familial CCM cases with detailed clinical data, 2.

 perform genetic testing on participant blood samples to identify other genes that may influence the development and hemorrhage of CCM lesions, and 3.

 determine lesion growth during the study.
