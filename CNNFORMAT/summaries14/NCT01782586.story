(secondQuint)Validation of Gene Expression Markers of Renal Allograft Functional Decline.

 Gene expression profiling is used to study the activity of genes.

 Each gene has an "on/off" switch that controls how they are expressed in a cell, as well as a "volume control" that increases or decreases the level of expression of a particular gene as necessary.

 Researchers want to see if the presence and abundance of certain transcripts in a kidney biopsy at one year after transplant can predict which kidneys will have reduced function over time.

The purpose of this study is to determine if certain genes found in a kidney biopsy performed at one-year post transplant can predict which transplanted kidneys will have decreased kidney function within five years post-transplant.
