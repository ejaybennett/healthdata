(firstQuint)Vilazodone for Corticosteroid-Induced Memory Impairment.

 In animals and humans, stress and corticosteroid excess are associated with changes in hippocampal structure and functioning.

 These findings have important implications to the millions of patients taking prescription corticosteroids and to patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder who have elevated cortisol levels and memory impairment.

 The investigators believe that vilazodone may be a medication that can block the effects of hydrocortisone on the human hippocampus.

 The investigators propose to examine whether vilazodone attenuates the effects of corticosteroids in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study using a within-subject crossover design.
