(fifthQuint)Effectiveness of a Parental Training Programme to Enhance Parent-child Relationship and Reduce Harsh Parenting Practices and Parental Stress in the Preparation of Children for Transition to Primary School.

 Introduction Transition creates a time of vulnerability for the child, the parents and their relationship.

 Failure to adjust to the transition, on the part of either parents or children, might place the family in a psychological devastating position.

 There is an imperative need to develop and evaluate appropriate interventions for parents so that they can contribute to helping their children enjoy a smooth passage to a pleasurable learning life in primary school.

 Aim The aims of this study were to test the effectiveness of a parental training programme to enhance parent-child relationship and reduce harsh parenting practices and parental stress in the preparation of children for transition to primary school.

 Methods A randomized controlled trial, two-group pre-test and repeated post-test, between-subjects design was employed.

 The method of simple complete randomization was adopted.

 Recruitment and data collection were conducted during the summer in 2009.

 Participants were recruited through referrals from the Hong Kong Sheung Kung Hui Welfare Council in Tung Chung.

 Written consent was obtained from parents after they were told the purposes of the study and agreed to participate.

 Parents were told that they were under no obligation to participate, could withdraw from the study with impunity at any time and were assured of the confidentiality of the data to be collected.

 After they had signed consent forms, a research assistant collected demographic and baseline data from parents.

 Data collection was divided into three phases: at the time of recruitment (pre-intervention), at six weeks and three months after the intervention.

 Parents were asked to respond to the Chinese version of the parental acceptance-rejection scale, parental stress scale, and self-report scale on parent-child relationship in respect of the transition from kindergarten to primary school.

 Effectiveness of a Parental Training Programme to Enhance Parent-child Relationship and Reduce Harsh Parenting Practices and Parental Stress in the Preparation of Children for Transition to Primary School@highlight

This study tested the effectiveness of a parental training programme to enhance parent-child relationship and reduce harsh parenting practices and parental stress in the preparation of children for transition to primary school.

 A randomized controlled trial was employed and 142 parents were recruited.

 Parents in the experimental group engaged in less harsh parenting practices and reported better parent-child relationships than parents in the control group.

 Findings from this study provide empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the parental training programme and highlight the significance of parental involvement in promoting a smooth transition for children from kindergarten to primary one.
