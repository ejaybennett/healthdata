(thirdQuint)Switching Undetectables to Selzentry.

 The objective of the study is to determine if regimen tolerability/toxicity can be maintained or improved while maintaining virologic suppression following a switch to once-daily Selzentry(R).

 The study duration is 48 weeks.

 Patients must have an HIV-1 RNA 3 months on their first HIV treatment regimen.

 Prior regimen modifications for reasons other than virologic failure are acceptable if any previously achieved virologic suppression has been maintained.

 A Trofile(R) DNA will be used to document exclusive CCR5 tropism.

 Patients with history of dual/mixed or CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 are excluded from participation.

 Patients with prior exposure to Selzentry(R) are also excluded.

 Patients that qualify for participation will discontinue the PI, NNRTI, or Integrase inhibitor portion of their regimen and begin Selzentry(R) 600mg QD.

 Patients will continue the two (2) NRTIs from the previous treatment regimen.

 The primary endpoints is: the percentage of HIV positive patients with undetectable viral load (HIV-1 RNA <100 copies/mL) at Week 24.

 Secondary endpoints are: the safety and tolerability of once-daily Selzentry(R) through Weeks 24 and 48(as measured by clinical and laboratory adverse events and regimen satisfaction questionnaire), the percentage of HIV positive patients with undetectable viral load (HIV-1 RNA < 100 copies/mL) at Week 48, the change from baseline in CD4+ T-cell counts at Weeks 24 and 48, the change from baseline in inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein) at Weeks 24 and 48, and assessment of resistance-associated mutations or viral tropism changes from baseline, if any, emerging at virologic failure.

 Switching Undetectables to Selzentry@highlight

This pilot single arm, single site, open-labeled switch study seeks to enroll thirty (30) HIV positive patients infected with CCR5 tropic virus that have achieved an undetectable viral load on a non-Selzentry(R)-containing regimen [Protease Inhibitor (PI)/Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI)/Integrase Inhibitor plus 2 Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI)] and switch them to once-daily Selzentry(R) (600mg qd) plus the same 2 NRTIs.
