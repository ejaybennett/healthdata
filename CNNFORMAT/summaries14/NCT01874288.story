(fifthQuint)Phase I/II Study of De-immunized DI-Leu16-IL2 Immunocytokine Administered Subcutaneously in Patients With B-cell NHL.

 An open-label, dose-escalation trial of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), biological, and clinical activity of DI-Leu16-IL2 administered to patients with CD20 (B-lymphocyte antigen CD20) positive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) that have failed standard rituximab-containing therapy.

 Following peripheral blood B cell depletion with rituximab (if needed) each patient will receive DI-Leu16-IL2 administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection for three consecutive days every three weeks (21 day cycle).

 Three to six (3-6) patients will be enrolled in each cohort.

 Patients may receive 6 cycles of DI-Leu16-IL2 approximately thrice weekly for 3 weeks for a total of 18 doses.

 Approximately 66 patients will be enrolled in this study at approximately 6 investigational centers in the U.

S.

 Forty-two (42) patients will be enrolled during dose escalation (Phase 1) and 2 expansion cohorts of 12 patients each (Phase 2).

 Following completion of the Phase I portion of the trial and review of the safety, response and correlative immune data it has been elected to have 2 expansion cohorts of 12 patients each at 2 mg/m2.

 - Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) that is relapsed or refractory to standard therapy - All other CD20-expressing B-cell NHL that is relapsed or refractory to standard therapy.

 As mentioned above Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) with peripheral blood leukemia/lymphoma cells and high-grade lymphomas (i.

e.

 Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Burkitt's Lymphoma) are excluded At the end of the study, patients may be enrolled into an open-label extension study (Study AO-101-EXT), at the discretion of the investigator.

 Study Primary Endpoints 1.

 To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DI-Leu16-IL2 administered SC following peripheral blood B cell depletion with rituximab in patients with B-cell NHL.

 2.

 To investigate the optimal biologic dose (OBD) of DI-Leu16-IL2 following peripheral blood B cell depletion with rituximab in patients with B-cell NHL, which may differ from the MTD.

 3.

 To describe the toxicities associated with the proposed DI-Leu16-IL2 regimen.

 Study Secondary Endpoints 1.

 To evaluate the immunogenicity as measured by the induction of DI-Leu16-IL2-specific antibodies.

 2.

 To evaluate the PK of DI-Leu16-IL2 (achieved in the primary portion of the study).

 3.

 To measure the response rate at the MTD (and/or OBD) associated with the proposed therapy and survival endpoints of the enrolled patients.
