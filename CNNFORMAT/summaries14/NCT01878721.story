(thirdQuint)Positron Emission Tomography of Infection and Vasculitis.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the value of PET/CT in various inflammatory conditions caused by bacterial infection or vasculitis.

 Our aim is to: 1.

 investigate whether FDG (18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose) PET/CT and 68Ga-(Gallium-68) citrate PET/CT enable the early and accurate detection of metastatic infection foci in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.

 2.

 study the usefulness of FDG PET/CT in detection of endovascular infection in bacteremia caused by Salmonella spp.

 3.

 find an optimal FDG PET/CT protocol for detection of infectious endocarditis and metastatic infection foci related to endocarditis.

 4.

 study the value of FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis of infection of pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator.

 5.

 investigate the usefulness of FDG PET/CT, 68Ga-citrate PET/CT, and 11C- (carbon-11) translocator protein ligand (PK11195) PET/CT in diagnosis of vasculitis and in imaging of the magnitude of the vascular changes.

 Positron Emission Tomography of Infection and Vasculitis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the value of positron emission tomography/computed tomography in various inflammatory conditions caused by bacterial infection or vasculitis.

 Glucose analog FDG is sensitive to detect inflammation foci but we hypothesize that other imaging agents such as PK11195 and Ga-citrate may have added value in certain applications.
