(fifthQuint)Mechanical Ventilation in Brain-injured Patients.

 A before/after study design will be used.

 The before period (control phase) will consisted of all consecutive patients with severe brain-injury who were admitted to the participating ICUs.

 During the interphase, all physicians, residents, physiotherapists and nurses will receive a formal training for the processes and procedures related to the 2 point bundle: protective ventilation and systematic approach to extubation (according to recommendation for the use of tidal volume < 7 ml/kg and of a positive expiratory pressure = 6 to 8 cmH20 (centimeter of water) and extubation as soon as ventilatory weaning is associated with a glasgow coma scale equal or above 10 and cought).

 The after period consisted of all consecutive severe brain-injured patients admitted to the participating ICUs after the formal training.

 Mechanical Ventilation in Brain-injured Patients@highlight

Protective ventilation (association of a tidal volume < 8 ml/kg with a positive end expiratory pressure) is poorly used in severe brain-injured patients.

 Moreover, a systematic approach to extubation may decrease the rate of extubation failure and enhance outcomes of brain-injured patients.

 We hypothesized that medical education and implementation of an evidence-base care bundle associating protective ventilation and systemic approach to extubation can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in brain-injured patients.
