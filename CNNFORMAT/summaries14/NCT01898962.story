(thirdQuint)Definitive Therapy for Oligometastatic Solid Malignancies.

 Up to recently it has been assumed that in the setting of metastatic solid tumors, locoregional control of clinically apparent metastases does not substantially impact survival due to undetectable micrometastic (clinically not visualized) disease that ultimately lead to treatment failure/progression.

 However, as more advanced systemic therapy continue to improve control of micrometastatic disease, failures at the original sites of disease remain common.

 Furthermore, some studies have shown locoregional treatment of limited clinical metastases to actually improve survival.

 Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that aggressive treatment to clinically active sites of disease (alone or in addition to systemic therapy) may improve survival or alter the course of the disease in some patients with limited metastatic disease.

 Definitive Therapy for Oligometastatic Solid Malignancies@highlight

Patients with metastatic cancer are usually treated with systemic therapy (treating the entire body) with the assumption that any localized treatment of clinically apparent metastases would not impact survival.

 In the setting of increasingly effective systemic therapy and limited metastatic disease, aggressive treatment to clinically active sites of disease (alone or in addition to systemic therapy) may improve survival.
