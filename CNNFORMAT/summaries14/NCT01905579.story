(firstQuint)Correlation Between Aqueous Protein Level and Clinical Grading of Flare and Flaremetry.

.

 A total of 20 patients will be included.

 10 patients with uveitis and 10 control patients scheduled for phacoemulsification.

 Each patient will undego complete ophthalmic examination and clinical biomicroscopic grading of the anterior chamber flare applying the SUN working group grading system.

 Aqueous specimens will be obtained by anterior chamber paracentesis for protein analysis.

 Each Patient will undego paracentesis and 0.

2 ml of aqueous will be obtained.

 The aqueous sample will be stored at -70C until the time of analysis for protein content.

 Objective assessment of flare will be done.

 Correlation Between Aqueous Protein Level and Clinical Grading of Flare and Flaremetry.

@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare flaremetry readings with the protein content of the aqueous humor and the clinical grading of flare.
