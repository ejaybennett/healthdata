(firstQuint)Sublingual Administration of PPI.

 Intragastric pH and therapeutic effectiveness of PPI was compared among patients given PPI with different administration methods.

 24 hour intragastric pH catheter was inserted in stomach of patients with peptic ulcer an hour prior to PPI administration in order to observe the initial change in pH.

 Three groups of patients were given PPI through per oral, intravenous, and sublingual administration methods.

 The hypothesis of this study is that sublingual administration will be faster than oral or IV administration in PPI dosing with respect to intragastric pH change and re-bleeding rate.
