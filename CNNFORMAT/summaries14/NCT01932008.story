(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Bone Mineral Density and Muscle Mass in Patients Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery With Chronic Kidney Disease.

 It has been reported that cardiac disease and renal disease frequently coexisted.

 Recently, the term cardiorenal syndrome was used to describe the interaction between heart and kidney.

 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease, and the cardiovascular disease is one of most severe complication in patients with CKD.

 Previous studies have showed the changes in body composition, physical inactivity, decreased physical function, and poor quality of life existed in patients with either cardiovascular disease or CKD.

 Patients concomitant with cardiovascular disease and kidney insufficiency were expected to significantly increase physical dysfunction.

 However, few studies addressed on these alterations in patients after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with CKD were reported.

The purposes of this study are: (1) to compare the body composition, physical activity, physical function, and quality of life between patients with and without CKD after CABG; and (2) to analyze the relationships among body composition, physical activity, and physical function in this population.

 It is expected that patients after CABG with CKD have the worse body composition, physical function, and quality of life than patients after CABG without CKD; and patients with higher physical activity levels have the better body composition, physical function, and quality of life.
