(fifthQuint)Redesigned Process in the Operating Room.

 The study aims to examine whether operating room efficiency will be improved by decreasing non operative time while ensuring patient safety.

 Patients will be randomized into one of two groups: In group A (new process): patients will be inducted in the induction room.

 At the end of surgery and after placement of the surgical dressing, the registered nurse will call in the house keeper to start cleaning of the OR (parallel processing) before the patient exits the room.

 The patient will be reversed with sugammadex 4mg/kg IV, and then extubated before being moved out of the OR.

 In group B (the current practice at AUBMC), patients will be treated as follows: patients will be induced in the operating room and at the end of surgery will be reversed with neostigmine 50 mu g/kg and glycopyrrolate 10 mu g/kg.

 Once extubated and rolled out of the room, the house keeper team will start cleaning the operating room.

 Induction time (IT), emergence time (ET), and turn over time (TOT) will be recorded for both groups.

 We expect to show that OR efficiency will be improved by significantly decreasing non operative time while ensuring patient safety.

 Redesigned Process in the Operating Room@highlight

The main purpose of the study is to examine whether operating room (OR) efficiency will be improved by significantly decreasing non operative time.

 This study also aims: 1) to evaluate whether a decrease in non-operative time will result in increased surgeon and staff satisfaction, 2) to determine whether there is an increase in the complication rate during the redesigned process perioperatively and until discharge from the post anesthesia care unit, and 3) to rate patient satisfaction.
