(secondQuint)Warming up to Sensors: Does Site Warming Improve Continuous Glucose Monitor Performance?.

 Hypotheses: 1.

 Warming of the skin and subcutaneous tissue with the InsuPatch device will improve the accuracy of a CGM as compared to a CGM used alone when both are calibrated with a standard laboratory quality glucose measuring reference standard.

 2.

 Warming of the skin and subcutaneous tissue with the InsuPatch device will reduce the lag time of the CGM, as compared to a CGM used alone when both are calibrated with a standard laboratory quality glucose measuring reference standard.

 3.

 The combination of the InsuPatch device and a CGM will be well-tolerated and not cause skin irritation.

 Warming up to Sensors: Does Site Warming Improve Continuous Glucose Monitor Performance?@highlight

This study will investigate the effect of wearing a small warming patch, the InsuPatch, at the site of the continuous glucose monitor (CGM), also called a sensor.

 Specifically, we will be looking to see if using the InsuPatch (IP) improves the accuracy of the continuous glucose monitor.
