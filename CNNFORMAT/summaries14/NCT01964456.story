(secondQuint)"Self-consciousness and the Inter-subjective Body".

 Anorexia nervosa is a severe psychiatric disorder, with high level of mortality.

 Anorexic patients often experience a serious disturbance in body and their own shape perception.

 We hypothesize that bodily self-consciousness is co-constituted by four subjective dimensions which are all inter-subjectively open: in encountering others, one's body is experienced as 1.

 objectified, 2.

 the bearer of inter-subjective feelings, 3.

 an inter-subjective agent and 4.

 the anchor of an inter-subjectively negotiated perspective.

 Across several experiments, we sought to determine which dimension of bodily self-consciousness is altered in Anorexia Nervosa compared to healthy subjects.
