(thirdQuint)TACE as an Adjuvant Therapy After Hepatectomy for HCC.

 Liver resection is the mainstay of curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

 However, recurrence is common after surgery and most occurs in the liver, especially for the patients with high risk factors for residual tumor, such as tumors with a diameter more than 5 cm, multiple nodules, and microvascular invasion.

 Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is an effective palliative treatment for HCC.

 It involves the infusion of chemotherapeutic agent admixed with iodised oil followed by embolisation of the hepatic arterial flow using small particles.

 This procedures allows application of smaller dose of chemotherapy concentrated to the liver and thus is well tolerated with minimal side effects.

 The main complications of TACE are liver function damage, mild feverish symptoms, vomit , etc.

 But most of them are reversible.

 We conduct a randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of using TACE after hepatectomy in HCC patients with high risk factors for residual tumor (tumors with a diameter more than 5 cm, multiple nodules, or microvascular invasion).

 TACE as an Adjuvant Therapy After Hepatectomy for HCC@highlight

Investigators hypothesise that the use of transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) after liver resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma can eradicate residual cancer cells in the liver and thus improve survival of patients with high risk factors for residual tumor.

 The aim of this study is to compare the survival of patients with high risk factors for residual tumor undergoing liver resection plus post-operative TACE versus liver resection alone.
