 The comfort and tolerance of Parkinson Disease (PD) patients to surface neuro muscular electrical stimulation (NMES) will be investigated.

 Six muscle sites will be tested sensory, motor and pain thresholds recorded.

 Furthermore pain tolerance will be recorded as the level at which the stimulus is unbearable.
