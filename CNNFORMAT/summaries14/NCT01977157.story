(secondQuint)Alcohol Detection Via Bioimpedance Mesurements.

 In this clinical trail it will be analyzed, if it is possible to assess the blood alcohol content (BAC) with the bioimpedance devices (SFB7, ImpediMed; Nicomo).

 This technology is non-invasive an can be measured by using conductive electrodes, capacitive electrodes or inductive measurement systems.

 The BIS-values will be compared with an official breathanalyzer (Alcotest 7110 Evidential MK III, Drager, Lubeck, Germany).

 Furthermore one blood sample will be taken and analyzed with the ADH method as the current gold standard at the end of the trail.

Examination if the bioimpendanz measurement can be used for the determination of the alcohol content in human blood.

 Furthermore the blood alcohol content (BAC) will be estimated by an official breathalyzer and one blood test.
