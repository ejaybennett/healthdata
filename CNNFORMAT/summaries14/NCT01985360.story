(fifthQuint)ISCHEMIA-Chronic Kidney Disease Trial.

 BACKGROUND: Among patients with advanced CKD, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death,15-30 times higher than the age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality rate in the general population.

 The projected 4-year mortality is >50% in patients with advanced CKD and is worse than that for patients in the general population who have cancers, heart failure, stroke or MI.

 Participants with advanced CKD are 5-10 times more likely to die than to reach end stage renal disease (ESRD).

 Despite this, ~80% of contemporary coronary artery disease (CAD) trials exclude participants with advanced CKD.

 Most of the treatments aimed at reducing cardiovascular events in advanced CKD are therefore extrapolated from cohorts without advanced CKD.

 Participants with advanced CKD and cardiovascular disease are undertreated with less frequent use of statins and revascularization therapies, and the optimal management approach to these patients is unknown.

 Participants with advanced CKD are notably underrepresented in contemporary trials comparing revascularization with medical therapy in SIHD patients, such as the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) trial or the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial,making any assessment about the efficacy of revascularization plus medical therapy vs.

 initial medical therapy alone in this cohort problematic.

 Participants with advanced CKD are at increased risk for complications of the assigned invasive procedure, specifically contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), dialysis, major bleeding and short-term risk of death.

 However, there is controversy in the medical literature regarding the incidence (30%), effective treatment (saline hydration, N-acetyl cysteine, or sodium bicarbonate) and prognosis of contrast induced AKI (5% requiring dialysis).

 In addition although contrast induced AKI have been associated with increase in short-term mortality residual confounding in these studies makes interpretation difficulty.

 Moreover it is unknown if these short-term increased risks are offset by long-term benefits.

 Limited observational study in the CKD cohort suggests a survival benefit of revascularization when compared with medical therapy alone long-term, despite increase in short-term risks.

 However, the medical therapy in these trials was not optimized, drug eluting stents were rarely used and there is undoubtedly inherent selection and ascertainment bias with observational studies.

 The above has resulted in substantial clinical equipoise in the management of these patients with the rates of revascularization of only around 10-45%.

 The results of ISCHEMIA-CKD will have profound implications for guidelines, health policy, and clinical practice.

 ISCHEMIA-Chronic Kidney Disease Trial@highlight

The purpose of the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial is to determine the best management strategy for patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), at least moderate ischemia and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 or on dialysis).

 This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 777 randomized participants with advanced CKD.

 Participants were assigned at random to a routine invasive strategy (INV) with cardiac catheterization (cath) followed by revascularization (if suitable) plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) or to a conservative strategy (CON) of OMT, with cath and revascularization reserved for those who fail OMT.

 The trial is designed to run seamlessly in parallel to the main ISCHEMIA trial as a companion trial.

 SPECIFIC AIMS A.

 Primary Aim.

 The primary aim of the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial is to determine whether an invasive strategy of cardiac catheterization followed by optimal revascularization, in addition to OMT, will reduce the primary composite endpoint of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction in participants with SIHD and advanced CKD over an average follow-up of approximately 2.

8 years compared with an initial conservative strategy of OMT alone with catheterization reserved for those who fail OMT.

 The primary endpoint is time to centrally adjudicated death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI).

 B.

 Secondary Aims.

 Major: To compare the incident of the composite of death, nonfatal MI, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure; angina control per SAQ Angina Frequency Scale; disease specific quality of life per SAQ Quality of Life Scale between the INV and CON strategies.

 Other secondary aims include: comparing the incidence of the composite of death, nonfatal MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or stroke; composite of death, nonfatal MI, or stroke; composite endpoints incorporating cardiovascular death; composite endpoints incorporating other definitions of MI as defined in the clinical event charter; individual components of the primary and major secondary endpoints; stroke and health resource utilization, costs, and cost effectiveness.
