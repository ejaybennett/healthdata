(fifthQuint)A Sequenced Behavioral and Medication Intervention for Cocaine Dependence.

 Cocaine Dependence is associated with substantial social, physical, and neurobiological problems.

 Psychosocial treatments can be helpful for many individuals.

 However, a significant proportion of individuals do not benefit from counseling alone.

 Our research group has demonstrated that deficient dopamine transmission, predicts poor response to a behavioral treatment and that a regiment that included an agonist replacement strategy with stimulants maybe effective for promoting abstinence in severe cocaine dependent patients.

 In this 15-week study 155 treatment-seeking cocaine dependent participants will receive a computer-assisted behavioral intervention based on the community reinforcement approach with contingency management (CRA + CM).

 The counseling approach will include both computer-assisted life skills training via and counseling.

 Individuals who fail to achieve abstinence will continue the behavioral treatment (CRA + CM) and will be randomly assigned to a behavioral therapy enhancement strategy that will include either Mixed Amphetamine Salts-Extended Release (80mg) or placebo.

 A Sequenced Behavioral and Medication Intervention for Cocaine Dependence@highlight

This study will investigate a treatment strategy in which a computer-assisted behavioral intervention will be used to help individuals stop their use of cocaine.

 A medication will be combined with the behavioral treatment among those individuals who do not respond to the behavioral intervention alone.

 The primary hypothesis of the study is that among cocaine dependent individuals who fail to respond to an initial trial of behavioral therapy, a greater proportion of individuals will benefit from the combined treatment (behavior therapy plus medication) compared to individuals in the comparison group.
