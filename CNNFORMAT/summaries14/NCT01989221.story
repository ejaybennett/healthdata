 Sancuso for Gastroparesis: An Open Label Study.

@highlight

The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of Sancuso(R) (granisetron transdermal system) 3.

1 mg/24 hours in improving symptoms of nausea and vomiting in patients with gastroparesis.

 This will be a prospective open-label study using Sancuso(R) to treat symptoms of nausea and/or vomiting in patients diagnosed with gastroparesis.

 Symptomatic patients with diabetic or idiopathic gastroparesis with nausea and/or vomiting will be enrolled.

 The Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary (GCSI-DD) will be used to capture the severity of symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, at baseline for one week.

 Patients will then be treated with Sancuso(R).

 Patients will continue to fill out the GCSI-DD on a daily basis while undergoing treatment with Sancuso(R) for two weeks.

 To determine if Sancuso(R) treatment helps improve symptoms of nausea and vomiting, the symptoms at baseline will be compared to symptoms after the first week and the second week of treatment.

 Thirty patients diagnosed with gastroparesis (approximately 15 with diabetic and 15 with idiopathic gastroparesis) will be treated on an open label basis with Sancuso(R).

 The goal of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of Sancuso(R) in treating nausea and/or vomiting in gastroparesis patients.

 Safety information will also be collected regarding any adverse effects.

 If the results are encouraging, as we expect them to be based on personal experience, a larger double blind study would be appropriate.
