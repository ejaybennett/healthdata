(thirdQuint)Bevacizumab Plus Paclitaxel Optimization Study With Interventional Aintenance Endocrine Therapy in Breast Cancer.

 This multicenter, randomized Phase II study of patients with advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive human epidermal receptor type 2-negative breast cancer aims to compare two treatment strategies following induction therapy with 4-6 cycles of the combined use of weekly paclitaxel (wPTX) and bevacizumab (BV).

 In arm A, wPTX+BV is continued, while in arm B, wPTX is switched to maintenance endocrine therapy (hormone+BV) until disease progression, followed by wPTX+BV re-induction.

 The primary endpoint is time to failure of strategy, which is the time from randomization to a qualifying event (addition of a new agent not in the primary regimen, progressive disease during or after planned therapy, or death).

To evaluate optimal usage of bevacizumab to compare which is better, continuing bevacizumab and paclitaxel or switching to hormonal maintenance therapy followed by bevacizumab+paclitaxel after induction therapy of bevacizumab+paclitaxel.

 To examine biomarkers such as monitoring markers of study treatment as exploratory analysis.
