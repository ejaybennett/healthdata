(thirdQuint)The Effects of Prazosin on Dopamine in Healthy Humans: A PET Pilot Study.

 The purpose of this study is to find out whether short term treatment with a antihypertensive medication prazosin, can influence the levels of dopamine in the brain.

 We will examine the levels of dopamine in the the brain using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

 The study will involve three PET scans and one MRI.

 One PET scan will be performed before the participants take prazosin for approximately three weeks, and the last two PET scans will be performed after the prazosin medication phase.

 We hypothesize that there will be no significant changes in dopamine levels in healthy individuals taking prazosin.
