(fifthQuint)Markers of Pubertal Suppression During Therapy for Precocious Puberty.

 During clinical trials of Supprelin LA(R), leuprolide stimulation tests were performed to determine adequacy of suppression.

 However, the use of this stimulation test to monitor suppression requires an expensive medication and collection of multiple blood samples.

 Alternative methods of monitoring pubertal suppression during gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor agonist (GnRHa) therapy have included both random and trough levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH), estradiol or inhibin B.

 Recently, the free alpha subunit of pituitary glycoprotein (FASPG) has also been shown to be a potentially useful marker of hormonal suppression (Hirsch HJ, et al, JCEM 95:2841, 2010) as it undergoes a paradoxical rise following initiation of therapy, and reverts to baseline upon completion.

 In this investigator-initiated pilot study we will evaluate novel markers of pubertal suppression in children receiving standard of care gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor agonist therapy for the treatment of central precocious puberty.

 Children with central precocious puberty who have selected treatment with Supprelin LA will undergo hormonal testing of markers of pubertal activity before and after placement of the Supprelin LA insert.

The best way to measure whether treatment of children with central precocious puberty is working is to do a hormone stimulation test (leuprolide stimulation test) that requires injection of a medication and multiple blood draws to see if the hormonal response is suppressed (blocked).

 The hypothesis of this study is that random measurement of the free alpha subunit of pituitary glycoprotein, a protein related to the pituitary hormones that stimulate puberty, will provide an adequate alternative to the leuprolide stimulation testfor monitoring efficacy of pubertal suppression with Supprelin LA(R).
