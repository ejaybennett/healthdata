(secondQuint)Does a Transabdominal Plane Block Decrease Patient Pain After Ventral Hernia Repair?.

 Patients coming in for a laparoscopic ventral (ventral, umbilical, incisional) hernia repair with mesh are randomized to either receive a Transabdominal Plane Block injection or a placebo saline injection.

 The injection will be performed by surgeons under direct visualization during laparoscopic surgery prior to mesh placement.

 Patients will be followed up post-operatively and after hospital discharge to assess for opioid usage and pain score.

 Patients in both arms are medically cleared by the surgeon.

 Currently there are no studies that look at the use of Transabdominal Plane Block in ventral hernia repairs.
