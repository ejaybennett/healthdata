(thirdQuint)Investigation of Plasma Mitochondrial DNA Level in Septic Patients.

 Clinical protocol: Patients were enrolled into one of three cohorts: (i) sepsis defined as suspected infection and systemic inflammatory response, (ii) septic shock defined as sepsis plus hypotension, and (iii) control defined as non-infected patients without systemic inflammatory response.

 Methods: Plasma levels of mtDNAs were measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

 Levels of mtDNAs were compared among each group, and linear regression was used to assess the association between mtDNAs, IL-6, TNF a and IL-1b in patients with sepsis.

 The correlation between plasma mtDNA and severity, systemic inflammation and outcomes will be analyzed.

 Investigation of Plasma Mitochondrial DNA Level in Septic Patients@highlight

To determine the plasma levels of mtDNA in ICU department patients with and without sepsis and evaluate their association with severity, systemic inflammation and outcomes.

 Plasma from control, septic and severe septic patients will be collected.

 The level of mtDNA and systemic cytokine will be measured.
