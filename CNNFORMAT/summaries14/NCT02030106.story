 Motherhood and Microbiome@highlight

This is a prospective cohort, enriched with women with a prior term birth, of singleton pregnancies who will be followed for the outcome of preterm birth.

 The main exposure of interest is the characterization of the cervico-vaginal microbiota.

 Women will be recruited from a population seeking routine obstetrical care at obstetrical practices at Penn.

 They will have three research visits during pregnancy to complete questionnaires and collect samples of cervico-vaginal fluid and cervical cells.

 Outcome data will be collected about the prenatal events and timing of delivery.
