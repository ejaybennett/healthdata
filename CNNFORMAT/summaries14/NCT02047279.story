(secondQuint)Ablation and Left Atrium Reduction During Mitral Valve Surgery for Atrial Fibrillation.

 The Cox-Maze procedure has been a gold standard for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

 Success of the modified maze procedure after valvular operation with an enlarged left atria and persistent and longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation remains suboptimal.

 The question addressed was: In adults undergoing a maze procedure for atrial fibrillation does left atrial size reduction compared to maze surgery alone improve maze surgery success?.

The purpose of this study is to estimate left atrial volume reduction surgery concomitant with the maze procedure and mitral valve repair/replacement in patients with atrial fibrillation with an enlarged left atria.
