(thirdQuint)Interstitial Photodynamic Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Demonstrate that our image-guided interstitial photodynamic therapy (I-PDT) dosimetry system can be used to tailor this therapy to individual patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive porfimer sodium intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes on day 0.

 Patients then undergo image-guided I-PDT on day 2.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, and then every 2 months for up to 12 months.

 Interstitial Photodynamic Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer@highlight

This phase II trial studies the effects of interstitial photodynamic therapy in patients with head and neck cancer that has come back.

 Interstitial photodynamic therapy uses a combination of laser light and a light-sensitive drug called porfimer sodium to destroy tumors.

 During treatment a laser light is used to activate the drug.

 Interstitial photodynamic therapy may be an effective treatment for head and neck cancer.
