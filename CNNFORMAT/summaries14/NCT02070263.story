(secondQuint)Mixed Tree Nut Food Challenges.

 To evaluate the absence of tree nuts (TN) allergy, referred patients from one of the Arkansas Children's Hospital (ACH) Allergy Clinic physicians with current serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) to TNs that meet eligibility criteria will be invited to undergo a series of open mixed TN food challenges.

 A questionnaire pertaining to their TN allergy will be administered A brief physical exam will be performed.

 Skin prick tests using selected nut allergen extracts along with a positive (histamine) and a negative (salt-water) control will be performed at the first oral food challenge visit.

 Each food challenges will be performed to 1 to 3 TNs.

 Two telephone follow-up phone calls will evaluate inclusion/exclusion of tree nuts in the diet post food challenge.

The purpose of this prospective study is twofold: 1) to establish oral tolerance to selected tree nuts and to examine potential predictors of oral tolerance and 2) to determine the usefulness of mixed tree nut allergen food challenges in more efficiently defining tree nut allergy and oral tolerance.
