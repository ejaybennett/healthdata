(fifthQuint)Effects of Rifaximin in Patients With Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis.

 Design: Open multicenter comparative study.

 A cohort (n = 66) will receive rifaximin (1200 mg / d) for 90 days.

 Results will be compared with those of a cohort of AAH prospectively included in an observational study.

 Both groups with a uniform treatment protocol (which includes the administration of corticosteroids and standardized treatment for complications of liver failure).

 Patients will be monitorized until hospital discharge and a follow-up visit at 7, 30, 45, 60 and 90 days will be performed.

 Endpoints: 1.

 Primary endpoint: Bacterial infections after 90 days.

 2.

 Secondary endpoints: : 2.

1.

 Liver function tests 2.

2.

 Levels of endotoxemia 2.

3.

 Complications of liver cirrhosis.

4.

 Survival.

 Effects of Rifaximin in Patients With Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis@highlight

Acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) is a serious condition and one of the most frequent causes of Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure.

 The current standard therapy (corticosteroids) is theme of debate and unsatisfactory in many patients (year mortality: 30%).

 One of the main causes of death is bacterial infections, which affect 40-50% of patients at 90 days.

 Intestinal decontamination with rifaximin (a nonabsorbable antibiotic) reduces endotoxemia, improves liver function and reduces the complications of decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis.

 The Hypothesis/Objective: To assess whether oral decontamination with rifaximin prevents the development of infections associated with AAH and analyze its consequences.
