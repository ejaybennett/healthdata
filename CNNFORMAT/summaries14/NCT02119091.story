(fifthQuint)Race Difference Moxifloxacin-induced QT Prolongation Between Healthy Chinese and Caucasian Volunteers.

 A total 80 healthy subjects will be enrolled in both sites, both male and female, age 18-45 years old.

 Half of them will be healthy Chinese volunteers, both male and female; will be recruited to obtain at least 36 evaluable volunteers in Chinese site of CTC, PUTH.

 The other half will be healthy Caucasian volunteers, both male and female; will be recruited to obtain at least 36 evaluable volunteers in the U.

S.

 site of Spaulding Clinical Research LLC.

 An evaluable subject is defined as a volunteer completing all study procedures from the screening period to the final ECG nominal time-point for QTc interval measurement and final blood sampling for plasma levels of Moxifloxacin on the last study day (Day 2 of the second period).

 Study Objective:Primary Objective:To compare the difference of QTcF (Baseline-adjusted, placebo-corrected effect on QTcF) between Chinese group and Caucasian group under the same exposure (Cmax) of Moxifloxacin.

Secondary Objectives:1)To compare the difference of QTcF, heart rate, PR, RR, QRS and Moxifloxacin plasma concentration between Chinese group and Caucasian group.

2)To compare slopes of Moxifloxacin plasma Concentration/QTcF value between healthy Chinese volunteers and Caucasian Volunteers.
