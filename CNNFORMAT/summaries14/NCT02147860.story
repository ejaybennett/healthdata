(fifthQuint)Full Day and Night Closed-Loop With DiAs Platform.

 This study is an early feasibility study that will test the efficacy of DiAs - a smart-phone-based system compared to sensor augmented therapy in an outpatient setting.

 Twelve study subjects with type 1 diabetes, six each at UVa and Stanford University, who have experience with insulin pump use at two clinical sites will be recruited.

 The first six subjects recruited will be aged 15-18 years and this will follow with recruitment of six subjects aged 10-14 years.

 This study is designed to mimic the protocol at camp and will include a period of light exercise after breakfast and moderate intensity physical activity after lunch, with group activities such as soccer and volleyball.

 The duration of the Outpatient in Residence Study will be 72 hours.

 The data will be reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) before proceeding to camp studies.

 The camp study will recruit 48 subjects, with type 1 diabetes who have experience with insulin pump therapy.

 Initial studies will be conducted at a camp with older participants aged 15-35 years, with at least 5 of the campers between 15-18 years old.

 These studies will be reviewed by the DSMB and, if safe, we will recruit additional children aged 10-14 years of age.

 The duration of the Diabetes Camp Studies will be up to 7 days/6 nights.

The overall aim of this proposed research is to determine the safety, feasibility and efficacy of the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) controller in day and night closed-loop control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes over multiple days in a diabetes camp setting.

 This will be addressed in two parts: 1) An in residence, outpatient study to determine safety and feasibility of the DiAs during 72 continuous hours of day and night glucose control; and 2) Camp studies planned for the summer of 2014 with randomization to either full closed-loop or sensor-augmented pump therapy over the duration of 6-7 day diabetes camps.
