(thirdQuint)Safety Study of MGD006 in Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Intermediate-2/High Risk MDS.

 Open-label, multi-dose, single-arm, multi-center, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to define a maximum tolerated dose and schedule (MTDS), describe preliminarily safety, and to assess PK, immunogenicity, immunomodulatory activity, and potential anti-tumor activity of MGD006 in patients with AML or MDS whose disease is not expected to benefit from cytotoxic chemotherapy.

 This study is designed in three segments: the Single Patient Dose Escalation Segment, followed by the Multi-Patient Dose Escalation Segment and the MTDS Expansion Cohort Segment.

 The Multi-Patient Dose Escalation Segment will employ a classical 3+3 scheme to examine a series of increasing dose escalations in cohorts of patients with either AML or MDS.

 Patients will be enrolled in one of the two available dosing schedules.

 Once the MTDS is established, the cohort of patients treated at that dose/schedule or a lower dose, will be expanded with the addition of 2 cohorts of 24 patients each (1 cohort for AML and 1 cohort for MDS) to increase the safety experience and more fully evaluate the PK, pharmacodynamics, and activity of MGD006.

 In all segments of the study, patients who benefit from MGD006 treatment, and continue to meet eligibility, may continue treatment in Cycles 2 and beyond.

The primary goal of this Phase 1, dose-escalation study, is to determine the maximum tolerated dose level of MGD006 in patients with AML and MDS whose disease is not expected to benefit from cytotoxic chemotherapy.

 Studies will also be done to see how the drug acts in the body (pharmacokinetics [PK], pharmacodynamics) and to evaluate potential anti-tumor activity of MGD006.
