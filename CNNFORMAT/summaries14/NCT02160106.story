(firstQuint)First in Human Dose Escalation Study of Vactosertib (TEW-7197) in Subjects With Advanced Stage Solid Tumors.

 This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, phase I study of TEW-7197 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

 The study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of TEW-7197, and will define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TEW-7197 using a 3 + 3 design.

 An expansion phase at the MTD will identify the recommended phase 2 dose, with an emphasis on subjects with melanoma, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate cancer.

 TEW-7197 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits protein serine/threonine kinase of activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) and blocks intracellular signaling of TGF- by inhibiting the phosphorylation of ALK5 substrates.
