(firstQuint)Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation in Patients With Chronic Renal Failure Due to Polycystic Kidney Disease.

 The investigators will assess the 18-month safety and potential efficacy of autologous MSCs as therapy for ADPKD.

 A total of 6 patients with ADPKD IV injection of high doses 2*106 of autologous mesenchymal stem cells / kg their weight, which will be derived from biopsies of their bone marrow.

 Assessments will be made at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after cell injection.

 Changes in GFR rate were evaluated by scan isotope.
