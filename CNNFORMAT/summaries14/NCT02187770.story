(secondQuint)Precision of IMED-4 Lung Fluid Measurements.

 The study will evaluate if the IMED-4 system has the precision to detect a clinically significant change in lung fluid status for patients with confirmed acute heart failure syndrome with pulmonary congestion.

 Changes in lung fluid in acute heart failure syndrome are difficult to diagnose and evaluate.
