(secondQuint)An Open Study of ASP8273 in Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Who Have Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutations.

 This study consists of Phase I and Phase II.

 The objectives of Phase I are to determine the following in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR activating mutations.

 - safety and tolerability of ASP8273.

 - the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of ASP8273 based on the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) profile.

 - pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASP8273.

 - antitumor activity of ASP8273.

 The objectives of Phase II are to determine the following at the RP2D of ASP8273 in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation.

 - efficacy of ASP8273 - safety of ASP8273 - PK of ASP8273.
