(firstQuint)Effect of MLN0128 on the QTc Interval in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 The drug being tested in this study is called MLN0128.

 MLN0128 is being tested to determine the effect of a single 40 mg dose on the electrocardiographic measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the electrical cycle of the heart (QT)/rate corrected QT (QTc) interval in patients with advanced solid tumors.

 This study will look at electrocardiogram (ECG) results before and after a single dose of MLN0128.

 The study will enroll approximately 30 patients.

 All participants will receive a single 40 mg dose of MLN0128 capsules on Day 1.

 To avoid nausea and vomiting, participants will also be administered 0.

25 mg palonosetron on Day 1 as an antiemetic agent.

 Participants may continue to receive MLN0128 for up to 1 year at a dose of up to 30 mg once weekly if a clinical benefit is being derived.

 This multi-centre trial will be conducted in the United States.

 The overall time to participate in this study is up to 14 months.

 Participants will make 6 visits to the clinic including and end of study visit 30 to 40 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

 Participants that continue treatment with MLN0128 will continue to make additional visits to the clinic once or twice every 4 weeks and the end of study visit 30 to 40 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
