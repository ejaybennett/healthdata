(firstQuint)Cold Snare Polypectomy Vs.

 Cold Forceps Polypectomy Using Narrow-band Imaging Endoscopy for Removal of Diminutive Colorectal Polyps.

 Previous study found Cold snare polypectomy a preferable technique in comparison to cold biopsy for diminutive polyps when assessed for completeness of resection.

 However, it is expected that cold biopsy polypectomy with advanced endoscopy, such as chromoendoscopy or narrow-band imaging endoscopy, increase completeness of resection.

 One study showed 90% of the diminutive polyps were completely resected using cold biopsy polypectomy with chromoendoscopy.

 However, no study compared cold snare polypectomy and cold biopsy polypectomy using Narrow-band Imaging endoscopy for Removal of Diminutive Colorectal Polyps.

 The aim of this study is to compare cold snare polypectomy and Cold biopsy Polypectomy Using Narrow-band Imaging Endoscopy for Removal of Diminutive Colorectal Polyps.
