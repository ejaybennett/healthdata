(thirdQuint)Study Of Costs Realized After Percutaneous Coronary intervenTion Employing Same Day Discharge.

 This is a prospective randomized clinical trial of same day discharge versus overnight stay for patients undergoing uncomplicated elective or low-risk urgent PCI with uncomplicated post-PCI recovery.

 The outcome is total cost accrued by patients from the time of index hospital presentation through 30-day post-PCI follow-up.

 Conduct of PCI procedures and provision of post-PCI care will be in accordance with routine institutional practices and will not be protocol-driven.

 Consented patients will be assigned to SDD or ON stay using a block randomization schedule.

 Randomization will occur once the patient has completed an uncomplicated 6-hour post PCI observation period.
