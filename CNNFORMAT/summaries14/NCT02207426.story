(secondQuint)Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacoscintigraphic Comparison of TobrAir 6.

0 With TOBI and TOBI Podhaler.

 This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, cross-over study in healthy subjects.

 Each subject receives tobramycin with 3 different inhalation devices: - 75 mg tobramycin delivered to the airways via TobrAir(R) 6.

0.

 - 300 mg tobramycin (TOBI(R)) delivered to the airways via the PARI LC(R) PLUS/PARI TurboBoy(R) SX.

 - 112 mg tobramycin (4x28mg dry powder capsules) delivered to the airways via the TOBI(R) Podhaler cent .

 Each dose is separated by a minimum washout of at least 68 h.

 Blood samples for PK analysis of tobramycin will be collected at regular time intervals until 24 h post-dose.

 For TobrAir 6.

0 and TOBI/PARI only, all dosed subjects will undergo scintigraphic assessments.
