(fifthQuint)Electronic Medical Record Review in Monitoring the Effects of Adherence on Myelosuppression and Morbidity in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Brain Tumors Receiving Temozolomide and Radiation Therapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Retrospectively measure the frequency of nonadherence with established monitoring guidelines in the target patient population.

 II.

 Retrospectively assess the impact of nonadherence events on myelosuppression severity and patient morbidity.

 III.

 Prospectively measure the effect of an automated notification program on adherence rates.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Quantify any time savings realized by patient care staff through the use of such a program.

 II.

 Quantify the number of patient care interventions that directly result from this automated monitoring and notification program.

 OUTLINE: Patients' electronic medical records are reviewed for adherence, severe myelosuppression, and patient morbidity retrospectively and prospectively.

 Electronic Medical Record Review in Monitoring the Effects of Adherence on Myelosuppression and Morbidity in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Brain Tumors Receiving Temozolomide and Radiation Therapy@highlight

This research trial studies electronic medical record review in monitoring the effects of adherence on myelosuppression and morbidity in patients with newly diagnosed brain tumors receiving temozolomide and radiation therapy.

 Myelosuppression is a condition in which bone marrow activity is decreased, resulting in fewer red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets and is a side effect of some cancer treatments.

 Morbidity is a term that refers to having a symptom of disease or medical problems caused by a treatment.

 Monitoring patients' electronic medical records to compare side effects, such as myelosuppression and morbidity, with treatment adherence may be a way to enhance patient care by organizing data for medical staff.
