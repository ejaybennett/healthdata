(secondQuint)"EASE" Epicardial Access With the EpiAccess System.

 Prior to enrolment, patients will be evaluated on the basis of the latest available data to establish eligibility.

 Eligible patients will be enrolled in the study by the local principal investigator after informed consent is obtained.

 As EpiAccess is only used for the access portion of electrophysiology procedures, the safety, performance and effectiveness endpoints are acute from the time of needle insertion to pericardial space access (guidewire insertion into the pericardial sac).

 Patients will be followed until hospital discharge.

 Follow-up clinical examinations will be performed in accordance with institutions' standard of care.

 No special tests are required for this device.

 Patients' completion of study will occur at the time of their hospital discharge, or earlier if patient did not complete the study.

 The stop criterion for this study is: greater than 25% Serious Adverse Device Effect, as defined in this protocol, after enrolment of 10 or more patients, compared to existing data from the literature presenting epicardial access procedure results during sub-xyphoid (minimally invasive) surgical procedures.
