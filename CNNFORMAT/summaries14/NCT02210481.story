(secondQuint)The Role of Intravitreal Glucose in Macular Thinning Following Surgery for Retinal Detachment or Epimacular Membrane.

 Comparison between intravitreous glucose rate and macular thinning measured by OCT at 3 months post vitrectomy for retinal detachment or epimacular membrane.

 The cohort is divided in 2 groups, one with the thinnest macular measurement under 190 mu m, and the others above 190 mu m.

 We are looking for a correlation between increasing glucose rates and decreased macular thickness.

 The Role of Intravitreal Glucose in Macular Thinning Following Surgery for Retinal Detachment or Epimacular Membrane@highlight

Comparison between intravitreous glucose rate and macular thinning measured by Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT) at 3 months post vitrectomy for retinal detachment or epimacular membrane.

 Hypothesis : Association between post-operative macular thickness and intravitreous glucose rate
