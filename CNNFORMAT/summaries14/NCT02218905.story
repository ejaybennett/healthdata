(thirdQuint)Normative Values and Forming Regression Equations for One Minute Sit to Stand Test in Healthy Normal Indian Population.

 Sit to stand is gaining importance as a functional capacity measurement tool in modern chronic diseases arena.

 Bu the reference values for normative population is not available.

 Hence the present study aimed at finding relation between the anthropometric variables (age, height, weight) and number of sit to stand repetitions.

 The volunteers will be asked to sit to stand in an arm less chair of 40 inches height.

 The number of repetition will be correlated and regression equations will be sought out relating number of repetitions and anthropometric variables through best fit regression equations.

This study is to find relation between number of repetitions the volunteer able to sit and stand in an armless chair and their age, height, weight and gender.

 The investigators hypothesis there is a moderate relation between anthropometric characteristics and number of situps.

 This may partially define the ability of functional capacity and quadriceps ability.
