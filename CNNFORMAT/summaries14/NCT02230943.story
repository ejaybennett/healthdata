(fifthQuint)Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness.

 RISE helps providers benchmark performances on key rheumatology clinical quality measures and align with best practice standards.

 The RISE benchmarking tool allows providers to view the details of their patient population against established rheumatology quality metrics.

 RISE allows access to aggregate data from other participating sites so providers can view their patient population in comparison to other RISE participants.

 RISE is integrated into an electronic health records (EHR) system, bringing a single point of entry into one solution for filing for quality-based incentive payments, avoiding penalties, complying with reporting requirements and tracking caseloads for quality monitoring and improvement initiatives.

 RISE collects the data needed to meet current federal reporting requirements.

 Participating in RISE helps push the field of rheumatology practice forward.

 RISE provides a source of information on patient outcomes and quality care for rheumatology leading to new discoveries, better understanding and a source of comparative effectiveness research.

The RISE Registry is an enhanced version of the ACR's Rheumatology Clinical Registry (RCR) and allows for a simplified entry process, while establishing a best-in-class resource to manage your patient population and improve patient care.

 RISE provides participants with an infrastructure for robust quality improvement activities leading to improved patient outcomes, patient population management and quality reporting related to rheumatic diseases and drug safety.

 RISE gives physicians and researchers the information they need to optimize patient outcomes, meet reporting requirements, and make discoveries that advance rheumatology.
