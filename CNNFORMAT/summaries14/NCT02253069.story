(thirdQuint)PHMB-based Antiseptic Use in Full-thickness Surgical Wounds.

 40 patients with suspected skin cancer in the face planned for full-thickness surgery will be randomised into two groups: One will receive a traditional tie-over dressing saturated with NaCl and the other group will receive a tie-over dressing saturated with a PHMB-based antiseptic.

 A quantitative and qualitative bacterial analysis of wounds by using a modified Levine's swabbing technique will be carried out pre-,intra-,and postoperatively.

 The effect of nasal colonisation with S.

aureus on the development of surgical site infections will be investigated.

 All wounds will be followed a week after surgery to assess development of infections.

 PHMB-based Antiseptic Use in Full-thickness Surgical Wounds@highlight

To study the effect of applying a PHMB-based antiseptic solution to tie-over dressings in full-thickness surgical wounds in dermatologic surgery in order to minimise the development of surgical site infections.

 The bacterial dynamics in wounds pre-,intra-, and postoperatively will be examined in order to understand the pathogenesis of surgical site infections better.
