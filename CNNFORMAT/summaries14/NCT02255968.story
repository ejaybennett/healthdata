(secondQuint)Evaluation of the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Oral Doses of EDP-788.

 Three cohorts of subjects will be enrolled to receive either EDP-788 or placebo.

 The dose of EDP-788 will be increased with each successive cohort.

 In addition, a 4th cohort may be enrolled, depending on clinical findings (tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics) observed in the first 3 cohorts.

 In each cohort, 8 subjects will receive a q12h oral dose regimen of EDP-788 (6 subjects) or placebo (2 subjects).

 All subjects receive multiple doses of study drug (EDP-788 or placebo).

 Evaluation of the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Oral Doses of EDP-788@highlight

The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of orally administered EDP-788.

 Secondary objectives of the study are to describe the pharmacokinetics of EDP-788 (and its metabolite EDP-322) after multiple doses of orally administered drug.
