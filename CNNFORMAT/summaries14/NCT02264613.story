(firstQuint)ALRN-6924 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas.

 Open label, multi-center dose escalation (DEP) and dose expansion (EXP) study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK (pharmacokinetics), PD (pharmacodynamics) and anti-tumor effects of ALRN-6924 in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas with wild-type (WT) TP53.

 ALRN-6924 is a stapled peptide designed to disrupt integration between the p53 tumor suppression protein and inhibition by murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and murine double minute X (MDMX).

 The DEP portion of the study will enroll adults with histologically- or cytologically-confirmed malignancies that are metastatic or unresectable and for which standard treatment(s) are not available or are no longer effective can be enrolled.

The EXP portion of the study will enroll distinct groups of patients with specific solid tumors and/or lymphomas to further investigate the clinical safety profile and potential efficacy of ALRN 6924 at the MTD or OBD.

 PTCL has been selected as one of the EXP groups to be further studied.

 Treatment of patients in the DEP and EXP phases will continue in the study until documentation of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient or physician decision to discontinue study participation is made.
