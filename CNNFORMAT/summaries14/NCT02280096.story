5 mg/kg to a limit of 50 mg.

 These capsules will be taken for a period of 4 months.

 A battery of neuropsychological tests will be administered at baseline, after 4 months, and after an additional four months of follow-up to assess cognitive performance and motor function.

 Emotional state will be assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory at each of the three aforementioned points.
