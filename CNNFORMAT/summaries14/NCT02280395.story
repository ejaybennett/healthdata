(secondQuint)A Phase I/II Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of RUT058-60.

 Post-surgical site infections account for approximately 20% of total healthcare-associated infections (HAI), making surgical site infections the most common HAI in US hospitals.

 Despite the routine use of prophylactic systemic antibiotics and improvements in surgical techniques, surgical site infections continue to be associated with significant morbidity, reduction in quality of life and overall cost following abdominal surgery.

 Ruthigen is conducting this Phase I/II clinical study to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of RUT058-60 in preventing surgical deep incisional and organ space infection in subjects undergoing abdominal surgery as an adjunctive therapy to prophylactic systemic antibiotics.
