(secondQuint)Calcium Dobesilate Versus Coasting for Prevention of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome.

 Two hundred and twenty women at risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome during ICSI cycles will be randomly scheduled into two equal groups.

 In group A, (Calcium Dobesilate group), 1 cap / 8 hs Doxium ( 500mg) will be given at day of HCG injection and for 3 weeks ; while in group B (Coasting group), coasting (withholding gonadotrophins while maintaining pituitary suppression) follow up every day by measuring E2 for 3 days then either giving triggering or cycle cancellation is done.
