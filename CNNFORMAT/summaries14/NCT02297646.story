(firstQuint)Influencing Factors on Training Efficacy in Healthy Adults.

 Carbohydrate availability in endurance exercise seems to attenuate exercise-induced perturbations of cellular homeostasis and consequently diminishes the stimulus for training adaptation.

 Therefore, a negative relationship with exercise efficacy seems plausible.

 However, experimental evidence is rare and far from conclusive.

 Therefore, the present study aims to test the influence of carbohydrate intake on the efficacy of a typical preventive training program.
