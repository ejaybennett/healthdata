(secondQuint)RSA Study of Sirius Stem and Exceed Cup.

 This is a comparative, prospective randomized Radiostereometry (RSA) study, lead on 48 patients in a single site.

 All 48 patients will be pooled in a single group for the evaluation of the primary criterion for evaluation, but randomized into four groups for the evaluation of the secondary criteria for evaluation The objectives of the study are to: 1.

 Demonstrate a comparable migration pattern as is described in published literature on other double tapered polished cemented stems 2.

 Measure wear pattern in the cup made of vitamin-E doped polyethylene or conventional Arcom polyethylene 2)Demonstrate non-inferiority of Optipac vs.

 Optivac cement mixing systems on the stem side 3)Evaluate the clinical outcome and survivorship of the implant.

 RSA Study of Sirius Stem and Exceed Cup@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Sirius Cemented Stem used in conjunction with the Exceed ABT Cemented Acetabular Cup, either with E1 or Arcom polyethylene, and OptiPac/OptiVac bone cement mixing systems.
