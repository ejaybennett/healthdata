(firstQuint)An Open-label Study to Evaluate the Long-term Safety and Tolerability of LUM001 in Patients With Primary Biliary Cirrhosis.

 This is an open-label study in subjects with PBC who previously completed the LUM001 201 (CLARITY) study.

 The study is designed to investigate the long-term safety and tolerability of LUM001 treatment, with daily dosing for up to 2 years.

 Changes over time, compared to baseline, in liver enzymes, other biochemical markers associated with PBC, pruritus, and other quality of life measures will also be assessed.
