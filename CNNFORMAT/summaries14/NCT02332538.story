 Greenlight 532nm-laser PVEP vs.

 Bipolar TURP in Management of Moderate/ Large BPH.

 With a growing body of knowledge on the promising advancements and recent clinical data of the third generations of the Greenlight XPS, it seems to be a real contender in the world of MIS.

 Contenders of Greenlight laser technology includes bipolar as well as Holmium laser technology.

 In this study the investigators planned to test the Greenlight (532-nm) laser Photoselective Vapo-Enucleation of the Prostate (PVEP) using (XPS) 180W system compared to bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURis) and Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HOLEP) in reduction of LUTS secondary to BPH in a prospective randomized trial.

 Furthermore, all peri-operative parameters, urinary flow parameters, prostate size changes and complications associated with the procedures were compared.

 The prostate size limitations will be assessed in relation to the outcome measures.

 Moderate to large size prostate (80-120 ml TRUS estimated volume) will be randomized to PVEP vs.

Most guidelines are not strict for recommending single treatment approach for Moderate to large prostate.

 In this study the investigators planned to test the Greenlight (532-nm) laser Photoselective Vapo-Enucleation of the Prostate (PVEP) using (XPS) 180W system compared to bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURis) and Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HOLEP) in reduction of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to BPH in a prospective randomized trial.
