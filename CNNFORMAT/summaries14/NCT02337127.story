(fifthQuint)Lamivudine Extending Therapy in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients After 3-year of Oral Antiviral Agents.

 The purposes of this study are: 1.

 To evaluate the long-term efficacy of Lamivudine extending therapy in CHB patients who received at least 3-year of oral antiviral agents.

 2.

 To evaluate the long-term outcomes and predictive factors of Lamivudine extending therapy in CHB patients who received at least 3-year of oral antiviral agents.

 A prospective, open-label, multicenter study will enroll 500 treatment-naive CHB patients who received at least 3-year of oral antiviral agents.

 With their voluntary decision after consultation, 250 patients will receive Lamivudine extending therapy for 5 years and the other 250 patients will receive follow-up and serve as controls.

 The primary outcome measurement is HBV DNA recurrence, whilst the secondary outcome measurement is liver-related outcomes and associated predictive factors.

Current treatment guidelines indicate that oral antiviral agents for HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB) can be stopped if the patient has undergone HBeAg seroconversion with HBV-DNA loss measured at two consecutive occasions at least 6 months apart (primary treatment endpoint).

 Stopping treatment can be considered if undetectable HBV-DNA has been documented on three separate occasions 6 months apart in HBeAg-negative patients.

 However, oral antiviral drugs currently approved for the treatment of CHB have relatively limited sustained long-term efficacy and a large proportion of patients will suffer from HBV recurrence after stopping treatment.
