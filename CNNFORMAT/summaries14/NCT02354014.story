(thirdQuint)Pharmacokinetic Study to Evaluate Anti-mycobacterial Activity of TMC207 in Combination With Background Regimen (BR) of Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Medications for Treatment of Children/Adolescents Pulmonary MDR-TB.

 This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) and Phase 2 study.

 The study will consist of a screening phase, a 24-week open-label treatment phase during which all participants will receive bedaquiline (TMC207) in combination with a BR of MDR-TB medications, and a 96-week follow-up phase.

 Upon completion of the 24-week treatment with bedaquiline, all participants will continue to receive their BR under the care of the investigator.

 The total study duration will be 120 weeks for each participant.

 There will be 4 age based cohorts in this study.

 Cohort 1: greater than or equal to (>=) 12 to less than (=5 to =2 to <5 years of age; Cohort 4: 0 months to <2 years of age.

 Participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 will be enrolled concurrently followed by sequential enrollment of Cohorts 3 and 4.

 An internal safety monitoring group will review safety and pharmacokinetic data from each cohort to determine subsequent cohort enrollment and dose.

 Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

 Pharmacokinetic Study to Evaluate Anti-mycobacterial Activity of TMC207 in Combination With Background Regimen (BR) of Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Medications for Treatment of Children/Adolescents Pulmonary MDR-TB@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (explores what the body does to the drug), and anti-mycobacterial activity of bedaquiline (TMC207) in children and adolescents (0 months to less than [<] 18 years of age) diagnosed with confirmed or probable pulmonary multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), in combination With a Background Regimen (BR) of MDR-TB Medications.
