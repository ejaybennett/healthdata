(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy of a Novel Topical Formulation Containing Erythropoietin.

 Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to play a major role in wound healing.

 EPO is a safe molecule, and commercially available biomolecule which is the basis of an FDA approved drug for treating anemia.

 EPO has a known mechanism of action on chronic wounds that affects all phases of the wound healing process and has shown promising results in experimental animal wound models [Hamed et al.

, 2010, 2011].

 In humans, topically applied EPO considerably enhanced wound healing and improved wound conditions of acute and chronic wounds [Bader et al.

, 2011].

 Our study seeks to extend these findings, to investigate the efficacy of EPO for treatment of diabetic chronic wounds in humans.

 The investigative product, developed by Remedor, is a unique gel formulation that optimizes the administration of EPO to the wound bed.

 This novel formulation has been shown to stabilize EPO in the gel and to maintain its activity over long periods.

 The Remedor formulation used in the clinical trials will be prepared either by a compounding pharmacy which is approved by the Israeli Ministry of Health, or by an Israeli GMP certified pharmaceutical plant.
