(firstQuint)Effect of Long-term Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on Appetite Control Related Brain Regions.

 Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is emerging tool for brain modulation in a variety of clinical conditions.

 In addition, recent neuroimaging studies suggest that modifying the activity of brain circuits involved in eating behavior could provide therapeutic benefits in obesity.

 The investigators aim to assess whether long-term modulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) using tDCS, modifies behavioral response and brain activity while watching visually presented food cues and taste cues in obese subjects.

 Subjects will be randomly divided into sham and real tDCS arms.

 Subjects will receive sham or real tDCS ten times.

 Subjects will be investigated before and after sham or real tDCS interventions.

 Subjects will perform functional MRI experiments with visual and taste food cues.

 Questionnaire with behavior measures, body compositions, blood tests will be performed.
