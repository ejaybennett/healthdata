(fifthQuint)Antithrombotic Strategy Variability In ATrial Fibrillation and Obstructive Coronary Disease Revascularized With PCI - The AVIATOR 2 Registry.

 The current AHA guidelines on AF for patients undergoing PCI are non-specific as they recommend "low-dose aspirin (less than 100 mg per d) and/or clopidogrel (75 mg per d), which may be given concurrently with anticoagulation to prevent myocardial ischemic events, but these strategies have not been thoroughly evaluated and are associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

 Finding the right balance that minimizes bleeding risk and maintains anti-ischemic efficacy remains a complex and controversial clinical dilemma in these unique patients.

 The arrival of novel antiplatelet agents and antithrombotics on the scene has led to an exponential increase in the combinations that may be employed by clinicians in real-life situations.

 The sheer number of combinations means that the best APT and OAC combination based on RCT data will not be known for many years.

 It has therefore become imperative that the investigators strive to create better methods to gauge the comparative safety and efficacy for various antiplatelet and antithrombotic combination strategies in AF patients undergoing PCI.

 To the best of the investigators knowledge, no contemporary prospective registry of real-life patients with AF undergoing PCI exists or has been initiated to date.

 Additionally, the factors influencing physician choice of treatment strategy as well as factors predicting patient adherence in this population is largely unknown.

 This is a multi-center, multinational, observational prospective registry prospective analysis of 2500 patients with non-valvular AF undergoing all-comer PCI with stenting at up to 50 Northern American and European centers.

 Patients will be followed for 12 months following implantation of stent.

 Data will be collected prospectively.

 All-antiplatelet and anti-thrombotic treatment regimen will be at the physicians' discretion.

 The investigators will study various combinations of antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapies, characterize the bleeding and ischemic risk in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI and to determine physician and patient centered factors influencing prescription patterns and patient adherence.

 Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who have undergone successful PCI will be enrolled as soon as possible post procedure and no later than before discharge of the index admission.

 The treating physician (interventional or non-interventional cardiologist) that prescribes the anti-platelet or/and anticoagulant therapy must complete the physician questionnaire.

 A different, patient centered questionnaire will be completed by the patient.

 The Principal Investigator or designee will provide instructions to enrolled subjects and physicians on how to use the hand held electronic device or how to complete the paper questionnaire and clarify any questions about the questionnaires.

 The enrolled subjects and physicians will themselves enter the responses to the questionnaire on the electronic hand held device or the paper questionnaire.

 Only patients with completed questionnaires will be considered enrolled.

 Treatment will be according to physician.

 Antithrombotic Strategy Variability In ATrial Fibrillation and Obstructive Coronary Disease Revascularized With PCI - The AVIATOR 2 Registry@highlight

The purpose of this observational registry is to compare the safety and efficacy of an antithrombotic regimen comprising one single antiplatelet agent plus an oral anti-thrombotic versus those consisting of DAPT alone or DAPT plus oral antithrombotic therapy.

 This registry will assess whether the antithrombotic therapy intensity will vary positively with physician perceived ischemic risk at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and whether an inverse association will be observed with perceived bleeding risk.

 This study will also evaluate the physician use of objective benefit-risk assessment scores and their influence on prescription of antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients undergoing PCI.

 Additionally the study will investigate whether patient perceived relevance and accessibility of anti-platelet and anticoagulant treatment regiments will predict treatment adherence and whether non-adherence will independently influence outcome.

 Approximately 2500 subjects with non-valvular AF undergoing all-comer PCI with stenting will be enrolled in North America and Europe, sites to be determined.

 Follow-up will be done via telephone by trained research coordinators at each participating site at 30 days, 6 months and 12 months.
