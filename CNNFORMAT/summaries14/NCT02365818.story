(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy of CG0070 Oncolytic Virus Regimen for High Grade NMIBC After BCG Failure.

 The plan is to study the safety and efficacy of CG0070 in high-grade NMIBC patients who failed BCG therapy.

 Most patients with NMIBCis (Cis, Cis with Ta and/or T1, high grade Ta or T1 with frequent or uncontrolled recurrences) who have failed BCG intravesical therapy (standard of care) usually have no other choice but to proceed to cystectomy.

 Cystectomy is a surgery associated with major morbidity, mortality and quality of life issues.

 Morbidity and long term tedious medical care will be for the rest of the patient's life span.

 Most patients at this stage do not show signs of disease progression into the muscle layer or of metastasis, making surgery a very difficult decision.

 CG0070, if successful in this trial, will serve to provide a therapeutic alternative for this patient population in need.
