(fifthQuint)Alcohol Related Impairment and Reinforcement: Pre to Post Roux en Y Gastric Bypass Surgery.

 The three major objectives of this NIH sponsored application are: 1) to characterize the severity of cognitive impairment and driving performance changes following alcohol consumption in a group of patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) bariatric surgery and 2) to investigate differential reinforcing properties of alcohol in patients before and after they undergo RYGB.

 Both of these objectives stem from observations from the investigators work and previous empirical studies suggesting that the pharmacokinetics (PK) of alcohol are substantially altered following bariatric surgery.

 This may lead to alterations in the time-course and severity of alcohol-related cognitive and driving impairment, as well as alter the reinforcing effects of drinking alcohol.

 Particularly relevant to these objectives, PK data have shown higher peak alcohol concentrations and a shorter time to achieve them in bariatric surgery patients.

 Therefore the third objective of this application is to better characterize the PK profile of alcohol following RYGB.

 Finally, investigators will explore whether changes in impairment, reinforcement, and PKs are moderated by gender, age, smoking, and alcohol use.

 In this study investigators propose to prospectively investigate approximately 50-60 RYGB patients.

 Participants will be assessed at baseline (pre-surgery) and one year after surgery (to approximate their weight nadir) in an acute alcohol dosing laboratory paradigm.

The proposed project will help to understand the changes in reinforcement and impairment experienced by Roux en Y bariatric surgery (RYGB) patients who consume alcohol.

 In this study the investigators propose to investigate RYGB patients with a prospective, longitudinal design.

 Investigators will examine driving impairment before and after surgery as well as study cognitive changes and reinforcement changes that may occur in RYGB patients while consuming alcohol.

 Finally, investigators aim to better characterize the changes that occur in the pharmacokinetics of alcohol following bariatric surgery and examine key variables which may play a role in the development in alcohol use disorders.
