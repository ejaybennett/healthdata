(secondQuint)Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Two Dentifrices for Dentine Hypersensitivity.

 A single centre, multi-site, randomised, examiner blind, two treatment, parallel group, non-inferiority design clinical study conducted in healthy subjects with self-reported and clinically diagnosed dentine hypersensitivity (DH).

 This study will compare the effectiveness of a test dentifrice containing 5% w/w calcium sodium phosphosilicate and fluoride as sodium fluoride to a commercially available dentifrice containing 5% w/w calcium sodium phosphosilicate and fluoride as sodium monofluorophosphate, in providing relief from DH after 4 and 8 weeks twice daily treatment.
