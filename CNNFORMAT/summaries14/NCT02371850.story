(secondQuint)Transdermal Patch CVD 1000: The Effect of Heat on Nicotine Release From Nicotine Patches in Adult Smokers.

 This research study is intended to determine the effect of heat on FDA-approved nicotine transdermal patches and whether the heat applied will result in more nicotine being absorbed through the skin than without applying heat.

 This is important given that little is known about how the release of nicotine is affected by heat, particularly for generic products that are also available over the counter.

 This study will use nicotine patches (brand name and generic patches) that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are already sold over the counter to customers in the United States, and will not include any placebos.
