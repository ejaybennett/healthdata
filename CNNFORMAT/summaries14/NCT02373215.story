(secondQuint)Phase 1 Study of Nalbuphine HCl ER Tablets in Hemodialysis Patients With Uremic Pruritus.

 The PK of nalbuphine hemodialysis (HD) patients is unknown and will be investigated under controlled dialysis conditions in the proposed clinical PK study.

 Nalbuphine is a small molecular weight, water-soluble molecule with low protein binding (approximately 50%) and a large volume of distribution.

 In addition, its disposition is perfusion-rate limited.

 In the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on HD, nalbuphine plasma clearance may be impacted, although it is predominantly hepatically cleared in the feces.

 A dose-escalation design was selected to mimic nalbuphine use in uremic pruritus (UP) patients in subsequent clinical efficacy studies whereby patients will start at a low dose to minimize the AEs such as nausea and vomiting and allow the patients to develop some tolerance to these particular AEs.

 Phase 1 Study of Nalbuphine HCl ER Tablets in Hemodialysis Patients With Uremic Pruritus@highlight

This is a single-center clinical research study with the purpose to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of nalbuphine HCl ER (extended release) tablets in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) therapy and reporting pruritus.
