(firstQuint)Reha Drive: Capacitive Electrocardiography in Car Seat in Cardiological Patients.

 Increasing number of elderly people with cardiovascular diseases and the wish to drive a car need recommendations corresponding to their fitness of driving during cardiac rehabilitation.

 Little trial data are known, only a position paper of the German Cardiac Society (DGK) of 2010 discusses the aptitude of driving a car of cardiovascular patients on experience.

 For judgement and recommendations automotive monitoring via contactless sensors might be helpful.

 Therefore while "driving" in a simulator distinct heart circulation situations will be created.

 Vital signs will be measured via long term electrocardiography (ECG) in comparison to contactless capacitive ECG (cECG) measurements via embedded sensors in the car seat as well as heart rate and breathing rate measurements via camera.

In this trial contactless heart rate, electrocardiography and breathing rate measurements are elevated during car simulation in cardiac rehabilitation via automotive sensors and camera.
