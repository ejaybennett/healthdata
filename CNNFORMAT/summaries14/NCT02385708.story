(secondQuint)Use of 2% Chlorhexidine Cloths Reduce Surgical Site Infections.

 Patients undergoing colorectal surgery will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion into two groups.

 One will be standard of care using 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate wipes night before surgery and morning if surgery.

 The second group will be randomized into the study arm using 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate clothes from jaw line to toes night before surgery, morning of surgery and daily post operative.

 Skin cultures will be obtained at time of consent, prior to surgical procedure before surgical scrub and draping, post operative day 4 and at 30 day follow up visit.

 Incision lines will be assessed daily by study staff for signs of surgical site infection utilizing the CDC's 3 definitions of surgical site infections, superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, and organ space SSI.
