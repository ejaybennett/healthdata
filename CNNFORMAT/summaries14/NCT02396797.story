(thirdQuint)Effect Evaluation of a Workplace Intervention Targeting Subjective Health Complaints.

 The atWork intervention was established in 2007 as a new stepped-care approach to musculoskeletal complaints.

 The intervention consisted of workplace information meetings about musculoskeletal complaint to all employees and peer support.

 The atWork intervention targeting musculoskeletal complaints reduced sick leave and improved health in a randomized controlled trial.

 The atWork intervention has now been further developed with the aim to increase effect on sick leave and health.

 The intervention is now extended to include information about mental health complaints, in addition to a management course.

 The major societal costs and the negative consequences common mental health complaints induce underline the importance of testing if atWork is an effective way of reducing these consequences.

 Effect Evaluation of a Workplace Intervention Targeting Subjective Health Complaints@highlight

Mental disorders is one of the most frequent causes of long-term sick leave and disability pensions in Norway, and there is a need for a comprehensive, coordinated response from health and social sectors at the country level to address the burden of mental disorders.

 The aim of this project is to investigate if a workplace intervention with the aim to increase coping of common mental health complaints and social support can reduce sick leave and improve health.
