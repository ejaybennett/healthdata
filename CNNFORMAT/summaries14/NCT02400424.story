(fifthQuint)Study of the Efficacy of SBRT on Unresectable Peripheral Primary Tumor.

 Stereotactic radiotherapy or SBRT (Body Stereotactic Radiation Therapy) allows to irradiate with high dose limited lesions size with a local control surrounding of 80-98% and with a low level of toxicity.

 We propose to realize a classic concomitant RT-CT for mediastinal irradiation and combine this treatment with stereotactic RT for peripheral primary tumor.

 The estimated inclusion period is approximately 3 years.

 Follow-up duration for each patient is 2 years.

 The duration of the research is 5 years.

 Study of the Efficacy of SBRT on Unresectable Peripheral Primary Tumor@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic lung radiation therapy after concomitant radiochemotherapy for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with peripheral primary tumor.

 Evaluate in terms of local control rate at 6 months the addition of stereotactic radiotherapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of mediastinal non-resectable stage III NSCLC having a peripheral primary tumor.

 The number of patients required in this multicenter prospective study is 70.

 This is a prospective, multicenter, non comparative and non randomized study.
