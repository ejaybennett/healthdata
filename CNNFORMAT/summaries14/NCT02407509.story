(fifthQuint)Phase I Trial of RO5126766.

 This is a single centre Phase I trial evaluating two intermittent dosing schedules.

 Part I: A total of six patients will be enrolled to each dosing schedule and based on assessment of toxicity, PK and PD data the optimal schedule will be taken forward into Part II (see below).

 Patients will be treated on a 4-weekly cycle with a single daily dose of 4 mg of RO5126766 on either the twice weekly (Monday & Thursday) or three times weekly (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) schedule.

 Six patients will be enrolled per arm and after all patients have received at least one cycle of treatment, safety data and available PK/PD data will be reviewed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC).

 On the basis of the previous Phase I trial, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are not expected at a dose of 4 mg but in the event of 2 DLT's occurring in (a) the 2 x weekly arm, then no further patients will recruited into that arm and the schedule will not be taken forward to Part II, or (b) the 3 x weekly arm, a single dose reduction to 3.

2mg on the same dosing schedule will be implemented and 6 patients enrolled at the reduced dose.

 If 4 mg given 3 x weekly is considered non-tolerable then the SRC may decide to enrol patients to the 3.

2 mg dose level in the absence of dose limiting toxicity.

 Selection of the optimum schedule from Part I will be made by the Safety Review Committee and will be the schedule that delivers the highest, tolerable, cumulative weekly dose.

 Therefore selection will be as follows: - If both the 2 x weekly (Mon & Thurs) and 3 x weekly (Mon, Wed & Fri) schedule are tolerated at 4 mg i.

e.

 2 DLT's occur out of 6 patients in both schedules (despite the 3 x weekly arm being dose reduced), Part II will not be initiated and the study will be terminated.

 Part II: Once the optimal dosing schedule has been established 20 patients with either solid tumours or multiple myeloma with documented KRAS, NRAS or BRAF mutations will be enrolled.

 Phase I Trial of RO5126766@highlight

RO5126766 will be administered initially as a single daily dose of 4mg using either a twice weekly dosing schedule (Monday-Thursday) or a 3 times per week dosing schedule (Monday-Wednesday-Friday).

 The daily dose will be given orally according to the dosing schedule.

 A cycle of treatment will comprise 28 days.

 In Part I of the study both the twice weekly and the three times per week schedules will be assessed.

 In the absence of dose limiting toxicities 6 patients will be recruited to each dosing schedule cohort.

 In the event of a DLT being observed in Part I of the study, a single dose reduction to 3.

2 mg will then be instigated and up to 6 patients will be recruited to that dosing schedule at the lower dose.

 The optimal dosing schedule determined in Part I will be taken forward to Part II and 20 patients with tumours harbouring BRAF, KRAS and NRAS mutations will be enrolled.
