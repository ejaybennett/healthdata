(firstQuint)Effect of Trophectoderm Biopsy for Sex Selection on the Pregnancy and Miscarriage Rates of Women Undergoing IVF/ICSI.

 Records of women who had trophectoderm biopsy for sex selection over the last 3 years will be reviewed.

 Women will be divided into 3 groups: group 1 will comprise fertile women who had embryo biopsy for sex selection/family balancing, group 2 will comprise infertile women who had trophectoderm biopsy and group 3 will comprise infertile women who had IVF/ICSI without embryo biopsy.

 The pregnancy and miscarriage rates of the groups will be compared.

 Before starting the embryo biopsy process couples were seen by a geneticist to assess the feasibility of the procedure for each couple.

 Couples were then counselled by a gynaecologist specialised in IVF to assess their fertility status and explain the whole procedure including the expected success rates and risks of IVF.

 Women had standard pituitary down-regulation with GnRHa (Triptorelin 0.

1mg, Decapeptyl(R) Ferring, Germany) day 7 after ovulation of previous cycle or on day 21 of the oral contraceptive cycles.

 GnRHa was continued for 2 weeks.

 Human menopausal gonadotrophin(HMG) (Merional (R)IBSA) 150-300 IU/day was administered until the day of HCG administration, Transvaginal oocyte retrieval will be performed 34-36 h after the administration of HCG.

 Day 5 embryos were incubated in calcium/Magnesium free culture.

 A laser beam was used to produce a hole in the zona pellucida.

 Trophectoderm cells were collected by gentle suction using the biopsy pipette.

 Florescent in situ hybridization of the trophectoderm nuclei with probes specific to the X- and Y-chromosomes was performed.

 the embryos were frozen and the cycles deferred.

The embryos were thawed in the following cycle and if possible 2 embryos of the desired sex were transferred.

Records of women who had trophectoderm biopsy for sex selection over the last 3 years will be reviewed and its outcome will be compared to other records of women who had IVF/ICSI without embryo biopsy.
