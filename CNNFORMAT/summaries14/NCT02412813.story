(firstQuint)LEGION Revision Metal Hypersensitivity Study.

 A total of 230 subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive either an OXINIUM or cobalt chrome femoral components as part of their LEGION revision procedure.

 The objective of this study is to assess a lower serum metal ion concentration level in at least one of the three major mLTTs (Co, Cr or Ni) over 5 years in subjects receiving OXINIUM versus Cobalt Chrome femoral components as part of the LEGION Revision Total Knee System.
