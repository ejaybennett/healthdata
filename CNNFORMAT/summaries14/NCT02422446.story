(secondQuint)Effects of Eicosapentaenoic Acid on Endothelial Function in Diabetic Subjects.

 Thirty adults aged 30-75 y will be randomized to either 4 g/d of eicosapentaenoic acid or no drug for 12 weeks.

 Endothelial function will be measured at baseline and after 12 weeks.

 in a secondary aims, we will evaluate effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on plasma levels of c-reactive protein, oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and endothelin-1.
