(fifthQuint)Early Range of Motion in 5th Metacarpal Fracture.

 Fractures of the fifth metacarpal neck ("boxer's fractures"), are the most common injury to the upper extremity.

 They are the result of axial force on a flexed metacarpalphalangeal (MCP) joint.

 Typically, they are caused by striking a hard object with a closed fist, breaking the knuckle on the "little" finger.

 Restoring hand function quickly and reliably for return to work and/or activity is of utmost importance.

 These patients are a significant labour force demographic.

 Since the injury is not characteristically sustained at work, "return-to-work"is an important patient consideration for lost wages.

 Treatment for fractures of the fifth metacarpal neck is typically non-operative.

 In the absence of urgent operative indications (ie.

 "open fractures" or contamination), non-operative management is initiated.

 Closed reduction is performed with local anaesthesia and manual manipulation.

 A splint is then applied.

 Repeat x-rays are obtained to determine positioning.

 If anatomic alignment is stable, no surgery is indicated and the patient remains splinted for 3-4 weeks.

 "Early active range of motion" (EAROM) refers to actively moving the fractured digit once fracture callus has begun formation at 3 days.

 In practice, EAROM begins at 3-14 days.

It involves controlled, active tendon glide exercises where the patient attempts to move joints in the injured hand.

 This motion is perpendicular to the fractures pattern, applying a compressive force to the fracture.

 From basic science models, compressive forces of EAROM improve rate of bone callus differentiation,early healing,fracture angulation and load bearing.

This study aims to translate these basic science concepts to practice.

 Early Range of Motion in 5th Metacarpal Fracture@highlight

Fractures of the fifth metacarpal neck are the most common injury involving the upper extremity.

 Patients are typically young adult males.

 Restoring function quickly and reliably for return to work and/or activity is important; these patients are a significant labour force demographic.

 Treatment is historically splinting for approximately 3-4 weeks.

 Splinting a fracture is a "trade-off".

 Immobilization allows stabilization and fracture healing, but also causes hand stiffness and weakness leading to impaired function.

 Little prospective research exists; there is no agreement for ideal duration of splinting or therapy, demonstrating clinical equipoise.

 A new concept in hand rehabilitation is "early active range of motion" (EAROM).

 The objective of this trial is to establish if EAROM provides improved early (6 week) hand function when compared to standard immobilization.
