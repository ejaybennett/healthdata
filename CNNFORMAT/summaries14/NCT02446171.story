(fifthQuint)A Bioavailability Study With Alternate Methods of Administration of Naloxegol Tablets, and Solution.

 This is an open-label, randomized, 4-period, 4-treatment, crossover, single-center, single-dose bioavailability study with alternate methods of administration of naloxegol: crushed and suspended in water and administered orally (Treatment A),crushed and suspended in water administered via nasogastric tube (Treatment B), solution administered orally (Treatment C) and tablet swallowed as a whole (Treatment D).

 Alternative ways of administering a tablet may be useful to help patients who, for different reasons, have difficulties with swallowing a whole tablet.

 Administration of dispersed (crushed) tablets suspended in water is a common way of administering drugs to these patients.

 A useful method in patients whose condition prevents swallowing is administration of dispersed tablets through nasogastric tubes.

 Additionally a solution formulation may be an attractive option for some patients including the pediatric population.

 The main aim in this clinical study is to investigate whether the blood concentrations of naloxegol (pharmacokinetic) after each treatment A, B and C is comparable to that after treatment D.

 Additionally, the safety and tolerability shall be assessed.

 A Bioavailability Study With Alternate Methods of Administration of Naloxegol Tablets, and Solution@highlight

This clinical study is an open-label, randomized, 4-period, 4-treatment, crossover, single-center, single-dose bioavailability study with alternate methods of administration of crushed naloxegol tablets, 25 mg and of a naloxegol solution formulation, 25 mg, compared to whole naloxegol tablets, 25 mg, in healthy subjects.

 The main objective of this study is to determine the bioavailability of each of three alternative methods of naloxegol administration compared to whole naloxegol tablets given orally by assessment of the primary pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of naloxegol
