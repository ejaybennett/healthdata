(thirdQuint)TXV13-01 Estradiol Vaginal Softgel Capsules in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Symptoms of Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy.

 This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of the TX-12-004-HR formulation in reducing moderate to severe symptoms of vaginal atrophy associated with menopause and to investigate the systemic exposure to estradiol following once daily intravaginal administrations of TX-12-004-HR for 14 days.

 Postmenopausal subjects who met the study entry criteria were randomized to one of two treatment groups (TX-12-004-HR or Placebo).

 During the Screening period subjects were asked to self-assess the symptoms of vulvar and/or vaginal atrophy, including vaginal dryness, vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching, dysuria, vaginal pain associated with sexual activity and vaginal bleeding associated with sexual activity.

 Subjects with at least one self-assessed moderate to severe symptom of vulvar and/or vaginal atrophy identified by the subject as being most bothersome to her were eligible to participate in the study.
