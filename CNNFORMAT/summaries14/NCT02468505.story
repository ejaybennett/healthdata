(fifthQuint)STEPS: Stepped Transition in Education Program for Students With ASD.

 The investigators propose to refine and then evaluate a novel transition support and intervention program for adolescents and young adults with ASD: STEPS [Stepped Transition in Education Program for Students with ASD].

 By targeting improved self-regulation (SR) and self-determination (SD) in young people with ASD, the investigators assert that this program may have positive outcomes with respective to college adjustment and functional behavior.

 Although the program will be finalized during the first phase of the proposed project, at present STEPS is comprised of two levels (or steps), which match the student's particular needs in relation to transition planning.

 In Step 1, students facing transition (i.

e.

, have identified the college they will attend (either 2-year or 4-year institution) but are still in high school) and their caregivers will receive information to assist in transition planning, undergo readiness self-assessments (to identify degree of preparedness for post-secondary school), and participate in interactive sessions online and in person to promote self-knowledge and determination.

 The goal of Step 1 is to assist families and students with transition planning, specifically ensuring that families and students have the tools needed to make informed choices and take necessary steps (e.

g.

, remediating identified skill deficits) to increase the likelihood of a successful transition out of high school.

 In Step 2, college students with ASD will receive fairly intensive supports and interventions, including individual counseling, structured support services, social integration activities, and coaching to promote academic and social success.

 The following specific aims are proposed.

 STEPS: Stepped Transition in Education Program for Students With ASD@highlight

Young adults who have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) without co-occurring intellectual impairment face a fairly unique set of challenges as they transition out of secondary school.

 These students are often quite capable of succeeding in higher education and many of them have interest in pursuing advanced degrees, but the nature of their disability and associated deficits (e.

g.

, poor time management and poor self-regulation) may impede success.

 Individualized, appropriately timed, and developmentally sensitive transition and support services may promote optimal outcomes for these young people.

 The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive program to promote successful transition of students with ASD from high school to post-secondary education.
