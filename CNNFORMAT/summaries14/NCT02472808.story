(thirdQuint)A Trial to Compare Two Methods of Obtaining Tissue for Diagnosis of Sarcoidosis Namely the Conventional Method or the Ultrasound Guided Method.

 This study is investigator initiated, prospective, unblinded randomized study comparing conventional TBNA with EBUS-TBNA for obtaining tissue samples from mediastinal lymph nodes for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis when combined with transbronchial lung biopsy and endobronchial biopsy.

 It will be conducted on 80 consecutive patients with suspected sarcoidosis presenting to Department of Pulmonary Medicine and Sleep Disorders in AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences), New Delhi.

 This study will help to know whether EBUS (Endobronchial Ultrasound guided) or conventional TBNA is better for obtaining tissue samples from mediastinal lymph nodes for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

 It will also help to know the value of adding rapid onsite evaluation of the cytology smears to both the procedures.

 It will also help to determine the overall yield of different procedures when they are combined for obtaining tissue samples for a diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

 A Trial to Compare Two Methods of Obtaining Tissue for Diagnosis of Sarcoidosis Namely the Conventional Method or the Ultrasound Guided Method@highlight

This trial compares the yield of cTBNA (conventional Transbronchial Needle Aspiration) versus the EBUS-TBNA (Endobronchial Ultrasound guided TBNA) for obtaining cytology when they are combined with endobronchial biopsy and transbronchial lung biopsy and rapid onsite examination (ROSE) of the obtained smears in the diagnosis of suspected sarcoidosis patients visiting our hospital for evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
