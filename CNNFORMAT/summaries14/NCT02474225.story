(fifthQuint)Intraocular Pressure Change Following Intravitreal Injection of Anti-vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Agent.

 Intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents are commonly used to treat a variety of retinal and choroidal neovascular diseases.

 The introduction of additional fluid into the vitreous cavity by intravitreal therapy would be expected to cause an immediate rise in the intraocular pressure.

 Although there is one study showed no significant changes in the intraocular pressure many retrospective studies showed the impacts on the intraocular pressure elevation.

 The investigators aim to prospective evaluate the intraocular pressure change in non-glaucomatous patients receiving an intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

The introduction of additional fluid into the vitreous cavity by intravitreal therapy would be expected to cause an immediate rise in the intraocular pressure.

 This transient, short-term intraocular pressure elevation (lasting up to 30 minutes) after intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy has been well describe.

 The investigators aim to study the prevalence of the sustained intraocular pressure elevation associated with intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents.
