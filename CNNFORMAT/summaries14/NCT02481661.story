(thirdQuint)Comparison of Lobectomy and Segmentectomy for cT1aN0M0 Peripheral NSCLC.

 Objective: To compare the outcomes(including 5 year relapse free survival rate, 5 year overall survival rate, retaining pulmonary function and the rates of loco-regional and systemic recurrence ) of patients with peripheral stage IA ( 2 cm) non-small cell lung cancer undergoing anatomic segmentectomy vs lobectomy.

 And to evaluate whether the anatomic segmentectomy is an optimal type of surgery for the patients with peripheral stage IA ( 2cm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 Outline: This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized open phase III study of anatomic segmentectomy vs lobectomy for the patients with peripheral stage IA ( 2cm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 According to completely random block design, the patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients undergo anatomic segmentectomy by minimal incision thoracotomy or thoracoscopy/VATS.

 - Arm II: Patients undergo lobectomy by minimal incision thoracotomy or thoracoscopy/VATS.

 Patients will be followed up every 3 months for the first year and then every 6 months for the subsequent 2 years and annually for 5 years postoperatively.

 Comparison of Lobectomy and Segmentectomy for cT1aN0M0 Peripheral NSCLC@highlight

Anatomic segmentectomy may be a less invasive type of surgery than lobectomy for cT1aN0M0 peripheral NSCLC and may retain more pulmonary function.

 It is not yet known whether anatomic segmentectomy is non-inferior to lobectomy in treating stage IA non-small cell lung cancer.

 The aim of this study is to investigate whether the outcome of anatomic segmentectomy is similar to lobectomy for peripheral stage IA ( 2cm)non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
