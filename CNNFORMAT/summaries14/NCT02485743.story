(fifthQuint)A Trial Comparing a Diet Including Products Aimed at Targeting Satiety.

 The study is a double blinded parallel randomized multicentre study, with six arms.

 The study will be conducted simultaneously in Denmark, Spain and United Kingdom, at the study sites specified on page 3.

 A total of 300 participants with an initial BMI of 27 to 35 kg/m2 and a fat mass of no less than 23% will be enrolled in the study.

 An initial weight loss of a minimum of 8 % will be needed for inclusion in the randomized part of the study.

 The weight loss will be achieved by administration of a low calorie diet (LCD) for 8 weeks managed by dietician supervised group sessions.

 Failure to reach at least 8% weight reduction during the LCD will result in exclusion from the intervention.

 Participants reaching the pre-defined weight loss of no less than 8% will enter a 7-10 days run-in period for diet stabilization before entering the 12-week randomized part of the study.

 In the randomized part of the study all participants will be advised to follow a general healthy weight loss maintenance diet in accordance with national dietary guidelines.

 In addition, participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following intervention groups; 1) including an active satiety enhancing product (active intervention group) or 2) including a similar control product without satiety enhancing properties (control group).

 For both groups, the participants will be instructed to consume the intervention products daily.

 Primary study visits for the assessment of body weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, sagittal diameter and blood pressure will be performed at the beginning, and at the end of the intervention period.

 At least every four weeks during the intervention, the participants will be requested to pick up the study products, and during these visits bodyweight and waist and hip circumference will be recorded.

 The participants will furthermore meet individually with a dietician three times during the 12 weeks intervention period to enhance compliance with the weight loss maintenance diet and to ensure incorporation of the study specific products into their diet as instructed.

 Adverse events and concomitant medicine will be registered continuously throughout the study.

 For each participant, the total study duration is 24 weeks, and includes 17 visits at the study site in total (14+3 appetite probe days).

 A Trial Comparing a Diet Including Products Aimed at Targeting Satiety@highlight

This multi-centre, randomised controlled trial will be conducted over 24-weeks to evaluate the effect of a healthy diet supplemented with a product specifically developed (SATIN satiety products) to enhance feelings of satiety and reduce food intake after an initial weight loss period to assess weight maintenance.

 Participants will either receive the active SATIN product or a matched control product.

 The products contain ingredients which have been shown to positively affect satiety, satiation and/or body weight and are all accepted food ingredients approved for human consumption in Europe.

 They will be incorporated into different food matrices, e.

g.

 drinks, shakes and cheeses.

 Corresponding control products without the active ingredients will be provided to participants allocated to the control group.

 The participants will be instructed in detail on how and when to consume the test products.

 Participants will be 300 adults (BMI >27kg/m2; Age>18years) who will be tested at three research sites (University of Liverpool, United Kingdom; University of Copenhagen, Denmark and University Rovira I Virgili, Spain).

 Recruitment will be divided between sites.

 Participants will attend assessments at one of the three research sites continually throughout the study period.

 The primary outcome will be weight maintenance after low calorie diet as assessed by weight, waist circumference, body composition (DXA), energy intake and subjective appetite assessments made at study test sessions.

 Secondary outcomes include assessing biomarkers of health outcomes (blood and urine indices), changes in physical activity as well as consumer benefits of the trial (assessed in a range of questionnaires) to determine diet efficacy.
