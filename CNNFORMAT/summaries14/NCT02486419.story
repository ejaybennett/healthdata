(thirdQuint)Human Neck Brown Adipose Tissue mRNA Profile, a Seasonal Variation Study.

.

 The knowledge of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is derived mainly from studies in rodents where cold is an important regulator of BAT development and function.

 Yet, little is known about the regulation of BAT in humans.

 With this study the investigators aim to investigate the effects of seasonal changes in outdoor temperature on genetic markers of BAT in human deep neck adipose tissue.

 Project participants are patients who are admitted to Aarhus University Hospital for elective neck surgery.

 Operations are primarily due to suspected malignancy in the thyroid gland or hyperparathyroidism.

No additional surgery is necessary to obtain the biopsies.

 Human Neck Brown Adipose Tissue mRNA Profile, a Seasonal Variation Study.

@highlight

The primary objective in this study is to examine the seasonal variation in genetic markers in the deep neck adipose tissue in humans.

 Human adipose tissue biopsies are taken from patients admitted for elective surgery in the neck.

 During the surgical procedure a subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy is taken for reference.
