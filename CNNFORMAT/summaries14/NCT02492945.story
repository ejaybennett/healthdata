(fifthQuint)Bundang Rehabilitative Impact Study of the Elbow Epicondylitis.

 Detailed Description: 40 patients that meet the inclusion criteria on screening test are assigned to one of two groups(PDRN group or 15% dextrose active control group) by randomization.

 They take the three times of the ultrasonography-guided injections for four weeks(0,2,4 weeks) under double-blind.

 PDRN group take ultrasonography-guided 3ml PDRN injection for the lesion( tear or tendinosis about extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor digitorum communis, radial collateral ligament ) of lateral epicondylitis for 4 weeks.

 Active control group takes the 15% dextrose solution, 3ml for same procedure.

 The main outcome variables are measured at 0, 6 weeks and 3 months after 1st injection as starting point and compared differences from baseline to 3 month as primary end points within each group or between both group.

 Polydeoxyribonucleotide is verified whether it has the safety and effect on lateral epicondylitis with comparing to prolotherapy.
