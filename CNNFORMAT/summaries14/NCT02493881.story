(secondQuint)Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve's Motor Function: Sometimes Motor Fibers May Also Be Located in The Posterior Branch.

 This study group consisted of consecutive patients, undergoing thyroid and parathyroid surgery with IONM.

 Both anterior and posterior branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerves were assessed separately by both electromyography endotracheal tube for adduction and finger palpation for detection of laryngeal twitch due to posterior cricoarytenoid abduction.

 The recurrent laryngeal nerves having motor function only in the anterior branches were defined as group 1, whereas the nerves having motor function both in the anterior and posterior branches were as group 2.

 Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve's Motor Function: Sometimes Motor Fibers May Also Be Located in The Posterior Branch@highlight

The investigators hypothesized that, sometimes the posterior branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve may also have motor function.

 The investigators aimed to evaluate motor function of the branches in the branching recurrent laryngeal nerves in this study.
