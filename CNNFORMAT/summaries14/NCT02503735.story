(firstQuint)Effect of Harvoni on Proteinuria and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) in Hepatitis C (HCV) Associated Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).

 The investigators hypothesize that patients with early stage (1-3) CKD caused by HCV infection will have significantly improved proteinuria and eGFR after viral eradication with 12 weeks of treatment Harvoni (LDV/SOF).

 This trial data will serve as the basis to support further study of LDV/SOF in patients with early CKD.

 Slowing progression of CKD is a critical goal, as the increasing incidence and prevalence of advanced CKD and ESRD (end stage renal disease) places significant health burden on patients and tremendous costs on our health-care system.

Treatment protocol to see if people with hepatitis C (HCV) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are treated with Harvoni for 12 weeks have improvements in their kidney disease.
