(fifthQuint)Trans-obturator Mid-urethral Sling and the Single-incision Sling in Women With Stress Urinary Incontinence.

 Objective of this study was to compare an inside-out TOT (Gynecare TVT Obturator System, Ethicon) with an innovative fixation SIS (Ophira, Promedon) in randomized controlled trial on patients undergoing their primary surgery for urodynamic SUI.

 A prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) is performed in one tertiary referral urogynecology center from January 2012 thru December 2013.

 Study included women with pure or predominant urodynamic SUI confirmed during cystometry by positive standardized cough stress test (CST) with urinary bladder filling of 250 ml in lithotomy position.

 Study was carried out on a Caucasian Czech (central European) population.

 A study power analysis was calculated with an expected objective cure rate of minimum 80 % for both patient groups, false non-match rate (alpha) of 0.

05, and false match rate (beta) of 0.

10.

 A minimum sample size of 42 patients was required for each group.

 Trans-obturator Mid-urethral Sling and the Single-incision Sling in Women With Stress Urinary Incontinence@highlight

Mid-urethral slings (MUS) now represent a gold standard in the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI).

 Second generation trans-obturator slings (TOT) have proven to be as effective as retropubic tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) with fewer major complications.

 A third generation of the MUS inserted through a single vaginal incision (SIS) has become a means to overcome significant post-operative groin pain.

 Novel types of SIS with a more robust and adjustable anchoring mechanism can assure adequate long-lasting attachment to the obturator membrane (OM).

 Objective of this study was to compare an inside-out TOT with an innovative fixation SIS in randomized controlled trial on patients undergoing their primary surgery for urodynamic SUI.
