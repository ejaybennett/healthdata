(firstQuint)Usefulness of Non-invasive Radiofrequency Therapy for Facial Contouring.

 Recently, Novel radiofrequency (RF) technology was introduced as a promising tool for non-invasive body and face contouring, which can heats subcutaneous fat up to 45 continuously without surface damage and induces adipocytes apoptosis.

 Subjects with an excessive subcutaneous fat on the submental area received twice treatments at 1-month intervals.

 Clinical outcomes including the thickness of the submental fat (measured by ultrasound) and the submental circumference (measured by a tape measure), and clinical photographs were obtained at baseline, and 1-month and 6-month after last treatment.
