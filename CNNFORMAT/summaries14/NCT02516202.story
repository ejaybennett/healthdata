(fifthQuint)The Vaginal Health Trial.

 The Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) Clinical Trials network was established in 2009.

 By the end of 2014, the network completed 4 clinical trials testing 7 interventions in approximately 1000 women ages 40-62 with vasomotor (VMS) and other menopause symptoms.

 The current trial will evaluate a relatively understudied area of menopause - vaginal health and sexual function.

 This is a 3-arm, randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial among postmenopausal women ages 45-70.

 Our primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of ultra-low dose vaginal estradiol (Vagifem 10 mcg), non-hormonal hydrophilic non-prescriptive vaginal gel (Replens) and placebo in reducing the Most Bothersome vaginal Symptom (MBS).

 Secondary aims include an evaluation of a composite score of vaginal symptoms (dryness, itching, irritation or soreness), sexual function, quality of life and genitourinary atrophy.

 We will also create a biorepository of vaginal and blood specimens.

 In a subset of women, we will examine whether treatment response is related to: a) the post-menopausal vaginal microbiome; b) vaginal mucosal inflammation; and c) reproductive hormone profiles.

 The in-depth focus on the mechanisms associated with postmenopausal vaginal symptoms will use state of the art microbiologic techniques on longitudinally collected biologic specimens and will guide future translational studies.

 The Vaginal Health Trial@highlight

This is a new application from the Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) Clinical Trials network.

 Here we propose to conduct a large multicenter trial comparing two common treatments, a vaginal hormone tablet and an over-the-counter gel, with placebo to evaluate their effects on bothersome vaginal symptoms and sexual function, and to create a biorepository of specimens for future translational, mechanistic research on the etiology of vaginal symptoms.
