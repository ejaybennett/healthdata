(secondQuint)Effects of PEEP on Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter During Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy.

 Effects of positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation on intracranial pressure have not been evaluated in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.

 We aim to investigate the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation on intracranial pressure assessed by sonographic optic nerve sheath diameter in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.
