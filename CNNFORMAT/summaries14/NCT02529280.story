(fifthQuint)Choices for Latinas and Clinical Trials.

 This study features a cohort design with random assignment of 112 Latina breast cancer patients from the CTRC to an intervention (56) or usual care control group (56).

 The intervention group will receive three components: 1) a culturally sensitive and individually tailored, 30-minute computer-based BCCT educational video; 2) a bilingual, low literacy booklet that encourages patients to communicate with family and friends; and 3) support from a patient navigator.

 The usual care control group will receive usual care breast cancer clinical trial information materials offered by the CTRC to its eligible patients.

 The intervention is based in two proven theories - Stages of Change and Social Cognitive Theory - and will feature basic components of individual empowerment, including knowledge, attitudes, skills and self-efficacy beliefs and expectations.

 The study has three main phases: Phase 1: Formative Research; Phase 2: Intervention; and Phase 3: Evaluation.

 Purpose: To empower Latinas to make informed decisions about breast cancer clinical trials (BCCTs) by enhancing their knowledge, attitudes, skills and self-efficacy required to support discussion of CT as a treatment option with doctors and family members.

 Specific Objectives: 1.

 Increase patient education and awareness, positive attitudes and self-efficacy to enhance their decision-making skills to participate in BCCTs.

 2.

 Provide decisional support to make an informed decision regarding participation in BCCTs by encouraging discussion of BCCTs as a treatment option with medical team, family and friends.

 3.

 Test the efficacy of a multi-communication intervention to assist Latina breast cancer patients in their decision making process regarding participation in BCCTs.

 Choices for Latinas and Clinical Trials@highlight

"Increasing Access of Latinas into Breast Cancer Clinical Trials" aims to develop and pilot test a multi-communications approach - using a culturally relevant computer video, a tailored booklet and a patient navigator (PN) - to empower Latinas to make informed decisions about breast cancer clinical trials (BCCTs).

 Latinos represent 15% of the U.

S.

 population but only 5.

6% of participants in National Cancer Institute (NCI) treatment clinical trials, resulting in disparities in cancer outcomes and jeopardizing the generalizability of trial findings.

 In response, this study will develop and evaluate communication and health-system-change strategies to facilitate Latinas' access to BCCTs at the Cancer Therapy and Research Center at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (CTRC-UTHSCSA).

 The CTRC-UTHSCSA, an NCI-designated Cancer Center located in South Texas, serves a culturally and ethnically diverse population that historically has low participation in clinical trials, especially among those with breast cancer, the No.

 1 cancer killer of Latinas.
