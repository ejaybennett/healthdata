(fifthQuint)Non Invasive Ventilation Combined to High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen for Preoxygenation of Hypoxemic ICU Patients.

 Patients admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) often need respiratory support.

 Endotracheal intubation procedure in ICU is associated with severe life threatening complications.

 In order to decrease the incidence of complications including hypoxemia during intubation procedure, a preoxygenation is recommended, consisting in the administration of pure oxygen before intubation.

 Recent data suggest that NIV use for preoxygenation of patients with acute respiratory failure is associated with less hypoxemia during intubation procedure than classic preoxygenation with facial mask.

 Indeed, associating Pressure Support (PS) with Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) limits the alveolar collapse and atelectasis formation.

 NIV is now used by a lot of of teams for preoxygenation of patients with acute respiratory failure in ICU.

 However, although NIV is effective to reduce hypoxemia during intubation procedure, NIV mask has to be taken off after preoxygenation in order to allow the passage of the oro tracheal tube through the mouth.

 The hypoxemic patient does not receive oxygen during this period, which participates to the episodes of major hypoxemia during intubation.

 In contrast, HFNC, which delivers high flow heated and humidified oxygen and air via nasal prongs at a prescribed fraction of inspired oxygen and a maximum flow of 60 L/min can be pursued during the intubation procedure.

 Some very recent studies suggest that HNFC could allow apneic oxygenation.

 Although use of HFNC combined to NIV may have potential advantages over conventional NIV for preoxygenation before intubation in hypoxemic ICU patients, this technique of preoxygenation has never been assessed and benefit remains to be established.

 The OPTINIV study aims to compare the effects of preoxygenation with combination of NIV and HFNC versus NIV alone on lowest oxygen saturation during intubation procedure of ICU patients intubated for acute respiratory failure.

 Study design and population The OPTINIV trial is an investigator initiated multicenter randomized controlled two-arm blinded trial.

 Local investigators screen consecutive patients intubated in ICU, with an acute respiratory failure (respiratory rate > 25/min) and hypoxemia.

 Hypoxemia is defined by the need of a fraction inspirated in oxygen (FiO2)>50% to maintain a saturation of arterial blood with oxygen as measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2)>90% and a partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood (PaO2)/FiO2 ratio .

 The statistical analysis will be performed by the medical statistical department of the Montpellier University Hospital with the help of statistical software (SAS, version 9.

 Non Invasive Ventilation Combined to High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen for Preoxygenation of Hypoxemic ICU Patients@highlight

Tracheal intubation is a challenging procedure in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), associated with severe life threatening complications.

 To decrease these complications, preoxygenation is recommended.

 Non invasive ventilation (NIV) increase effectiveness of preoxygenation, applying a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP).

 High-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC) improves oxygenation by increasing end-expiratory lung volume and has a potential of apneic oxygenation.

 The association of NIV and HFNC for preoxygenation in hypoxemic ICU patients has never been evaluated.

 The aim of this study is to determine if HFNC combined to NIV could have therapeutic advantages over NIV alone for preoxygenation in the ICU patients intubated for hypoxemic acute respiratory failure.
