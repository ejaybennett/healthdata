(firstQuint)Bioequivalence Evaluation of a New and Current Tablet of ASP015K.

 This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, 2-way crossover designed study.

 Forty non-elderly healthy male subjects will receive an ASP015K small tablet or an ASP015K current tablet in each period under fasted conditions.

 If the bioequivalence between two tablets cannot be demonstrated because of an insufficient number, an add-on subject study will be conducted as needed.

 The design of the add-on subject study will be the same with that of the initial study.
