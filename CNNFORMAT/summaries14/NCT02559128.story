(fifthQuint)The Role of Insulin Resistance in Patients With Heart Failure and Type 2 Diabetes.

 100 subjects in total, divided into four groups will be included: 40 patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes and chronic HF without previous pharmacological treatment (T2D+HF+), 20 subjects with HF without T2D (HF+T2D-), 20 subjects with T2D alone (HF-T2D+) and 20 healthy control volunteers (HF-T2D-).

 All examinations will be done during a short admission at Diabetes Center (CD) in Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine (IKEM), always under comparable circumstances.

 All participants will undergo standardized selection of metabolic and cardiovascular tests.

 Oxidative stress markers, selected cytokines, peptides and metabolites in blood and subcutaneous adipose tissue will be analyzed.

 Investigators assume that this project will bring new knowledge which will contribute to discovery of the mechanisms implicated in the development of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes.

 The Role of Insulin Resistance in Patients With Heart Failure and Type 2 Diabetes@highlight

The purpose of this cross-sectional comparative 2x2 trial study is to compare the degree of insulin resistance, myocardial function and selected metabolic parameters and to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms by which insulin resistance is implicated in development of chronic heart failure (HF) in patients with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes (T2D).

 Investigators hypothesize that patients with heart failure will be insulin-resistant and will display metabolic abnormalities as patients with diabetes.
