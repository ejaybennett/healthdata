(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Omission of Sentinel Node Biopsy in Patients With Estrogen-Positive Breast Cancer Over Age 65.

 The primary objective of the study is to determine whether omission of sentinel node biopsy in patients who meet eligibility criteria results in an acceptable regional recurrence rate over a 6-year period.

 A regional recurrence is defined as any recurrence in the ipsilateral axillary nodes, supraclavicular nodes or internal mammary nodes.

 Eligible patients will undergo standard of care lumpectomy without sentinel node biopsy followed by radiation and hormonal therapy or have already undergone the procedure prior to enrollment in the study.

 She may also receive chemotherapy as determined by her treating physician.

 A physical examination of the affected breast and regional lymph nodes will be conducted every six months for the first two years of follow up and then yearly for the last 3 years of follow up.

 Imaging of the affected breast will occur every 12 months after surgery per standard of care.

This study will examine the outcomes of lumpectomy, surgery to remove a tumor, without sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for women at least 65 years of age with clinically node-negative breast cancer.

 Clinically node-negative means that during a physical exam your doctor cannot feel or see that any lymph nodes near the breast area are swollen and there is also no imaging evidence, such as from a mammogram, of nodal involvement.
