(firstQuint)Study of EDO-S101, A First-in-Class Alkylating HDACi Fusion Molecule, in Relapsed/Refractory Hematologic Malignancies.

 EDO-S101 is a new chemical entity, a first-in-class fusion molecule of an alkylator, bendamustine and a histone-deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), vorinostat.

 It is anticipated that EDO-S101 may have activity in various hematological malignancies and solid tumors.

 This phase 1 study will enroll patients with various hematological malignancies.

 The study consists of 2 stages: - Stage 1: Dose Escalation to determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) at the optimal infusion time and the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles; is expected to enroll between 21 and 48 patients - Stage 2: Expansion in four Cohorts, in which approximately 12 patients will be enrolled per cohort, for a total of 48 patients.

 In Stage 1, EDO-S101 doses will be escalated following the standard 3+3 design.

 The decision to escalate to the next dose level will occur after all cohort patients have completed 3 weeks (21 days) of observation and have been evaluated for safety and toxicity.

The starting dose is a 1 hour infusion of 20 mg/m2, and the maximum dose level is 150 mg/m2.

 Reduced infusion times of 45 minutes and 30 minutes will also be assessed once the maximum tolerated dose at a 1-hour infusion is determined.

 In Stage 2, four cohorts of patients (with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma or Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia; relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma; relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [except chronic lymphocytic and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma] who have been treated or are refractory to bendamustine); and relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and T-cell Prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) will be enrolled and treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on results of Stage 1.

 Treatment will occur every 21 days.

 Patients in each stage of the study are expected to receive a median of four 3-week Cycles of therapy, and the maximum number of treatment Cycles allowed is 6.
