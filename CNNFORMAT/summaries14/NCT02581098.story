(fifthQuint)Effect of miR-200b on Diabetic Wounds.

 The study is designed as a 14 week prospective observational study where patients with diabetic wounds visiting the Ohio State University Comprehensive Wound Center (CWC) will be enrolled.

 Patients enrolled will be followed for 14 weeks including 4 study visits, initial visit (week 0), study visit 2 (week 2), study visit 3 (week 4) and will return for a final follow-up study visit 4 (week 14).

 Standardized Care Outline will be per physician discretion.

 The initial visit will take place during the patients regularly scheduled CWC visit and the following will take place: Informed consent will be obtained, Baseline demographics, medical history, current labs and medications will be recorded, Wound data will be recorded, Ankle brachial index will be completed for patients with leg wounds if not already completed per Standard of Care (SoC) since onset of the wound, Wound photographs for digital planimetry to measure wound area, Wound fluid will be collected (mir200b arm only): Fluid will be collected from filter paper method or aspiration method.

 Wound fluid collection will take place before debridement and biopsies.

The NPWT sponge will be collected (mir200b and miR-21 arm): Wound macrophages, immune cells (miR-21) and endothelial cells (miR-200b) will be isolated from wound cells obtained from the sponge dressing of the NWPT.

 The NWPT delivers negative pressure to help promote wound healing.

 NWPT is a routinely applied to chronic wounds as therapeutic modality.

 The foam dressing to be collected is discarded as biological waste at the regular CWC visits.

 Two 3 mm punch tissue biopsies will be obtained from the patient's physician.

 One biopsy will be used for LCM (wound-edge endothelial cell capture) and immunohistochemistry studies and the other biopsy will be used to determine if the wound is infected using quantitative bacterial cultures and scanning electron microscopy for biofilm structure detection.

 Patient will return for study visit 2 where the following will happen: Patient data will be collected including: medication review, adverse event review wound data will be recorded, Wound photographs for digital planimetry to measure wound area, Wound fluid (miR-200b arm only) will be collected, NPWT will be collected (miR-200b and miR-21 arms) and two 3 mm punch tissue biopsies will be obtained from the patient's physician.

 Note- These biopsies will be optional.

 At the beginning of enrollment the patient will be asked if they would like these biopsies to be obtained.

 The research personnel will make note of the patients' decision.

 If the wound shows signs of healing and does not show signs of infection (i.

e.

 the wound has not stalled in healing for 2 or more weeks or become larger in size) or the wound has been declared healed by their physician, the biopsies will not be obtained.

 Patients will return for study visit 3.

 The following will take place: Patient data will be collected including: medication review, adverse event review, wound measurements, etiology, location and duration will be recorded, Wound photographs for digital planimetry to measure wound area, Wound fluid will be collected (miR-200b arm only), NPWT will be collected (miR-200b and miR-21 arms), Two 3 mm punch tissue biopsies will be obtained from the patient's physician.

 Note- if the subjects wound has been declared healed by their physician, the biopsies will not be obtained.

 Patients will return for study visit 4 where the following will take place: Medical Chart review to determine final status of the wound as healed, healing or not healed, Wound data will be recorded, Adverse Event review, Wound photographs for digital planimetry to measure wound area.

 The risks associated with this research study are low.

 There are no therapeutic interventions or medications as part of this study to be administered depending on the amount of sensation the subject has at the site of the wound.

 The wound site will be numbed by applying local anesthesia as appropriate to the area being biopsied.

 There may be some discomfort with the tissue biopsy procedure.

 The wound site will be numbed by applying local anesthesia as appropriate to the area being biopsied.

 The amount of pain that occurs with wound biopsy will vary from person to person, but all reasonable efforts will be made to minimize pain.

 The biopsy procedure is done within the boundaries of the existing wound to avoid giving the patient a separate new wound.

 Bleeding is a possible complication, but the risk is low for the small biopsies and is reduced by using local anesthetics with epinephrine, and silver nitrate sticks are available in each room to cauterize biopsy sites as needed.

 Infection is also a potential risk; however, wound tissue biopsies are routinely performed as the standard of care in the CWC to diagnose wound infection.

 The biopsy site will be appropriately monitored for infection by the physician managing the wound during routine wound clinic visits.

 The ABI test may result in temporary discomfort around the ankle or foot when the cuff is inflated, but does not present any further physical or medical risks.

 The wound fluid collection is non-invasive and does not present any risk.

 Study participants will not benefit directly from participation in this study.

 This research information has the potential of providing considerable benefits to wound care by identifying a key player that influences the closure of chronic diabetic wounds.

 Such knowledge should help develop novel biomarker and or miR-directed therapeutic strategies.

 Effect of miR-200b on Diabetic Wounds@highlight

This study aims to determine if elevated wound-edge endothelial miR-200b is a barrier to wound healing in diabetic patients and also to determine if ex vivo supplementation of miR-21 mimic and recombinant MFG-E8 resolve inflammation in wound macrophages isolated from NPWT sponges from diabetic wounds.

 This study will enroll 124 (60 in the miR-200b arm and 64 in the miR21 arm) Diabetic Wound patients who have wound tissue oxygenation adequate to support wound healing and will be in the study for 14 weeks that includes 4 study visits.
