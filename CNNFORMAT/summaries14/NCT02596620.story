(fifthQuint)Levofloxacin-containing Therapies In Second Line Helicobacter Pylori Eradication.

 In this randomized-controlled trial , the investigator recruited participants with H pylori infection after failure of first line standard triple therapy.

 Using a computer-generated randomization sequence, the investigators randomly allocated patients to either 10-day levofloxacin-containing sequential (EALM, esomeprazole 40 mg b.

 The primary outcome was the eradication rate by intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.

Asia Pacific Consensus states that levofloxacin-based triple therapy as an alternative second-line therapy after Helicobacter pylori (H.

 pylori) eradication failure when bismuth salts are not available.

 The investigators compare the efficacies of 10-day levofloxacin-based sequential therapy and 10-day triple therapy in the treatment for patients after failure of standard triple therapy and to determine what clinical and bacterial factors influencing the efficacy of salvage regimens.
