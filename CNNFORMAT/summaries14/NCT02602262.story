(thirdQuint)Observational Study of HIV+ Deceased Donor Transplant for HIV+ Recipients.

 This is an observational study designed to evaluate safety and outcomes of solid organ transplantation in HIV+ recipients of HIV+ deceased donor organs.

 This study will evaluate overall survival and graft survival compared to transplantation with an HIV- organ.

 In addition the study will assess potential complications of organ transplant using HIV+ deceased donors - including but not limited to - HIV superinfection, incidence and severity of graft rejection, recurrence of HIV-associated nephropathy, incidence of bacterial infections, and opportunistic infections.
