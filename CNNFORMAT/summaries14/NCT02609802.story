(firstQuint)The Different Analgesic Potency of Volatile Anesthetics at Equi-MAC.

 Volatile anesthetics vary in their relative hypnotic potencies.

 Recent studies demonstrated that equi-minimum alveolar concentration of various volatile anesthetics produced different EEG-derived indices such as bispectral index.

 However, there was no controlled study that demonstrates the difference of analgesic potency.

 The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the difference of analgesic potency of sevoflurane and desflurane at equi-minimum alveolar concentration using a surgical pleth index.
