(firstQuint)Therapy of Ventilator-associated Tracheobronchitis Caused by Gram Negative Bacteria With Nebulized Colistin.

 Patients diagnosed ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis due to gram negative organism are included to the study.

The patients will be received colistin inhalation 75 mg every 12 hours at least 5 days.

 The primary objective is to evaluate clinical outcome of inhaled colistin.
