(firstQuint)Feasibility Study of the Intravascular Ventricular Assist System (iVAS).

 This is a single-arm, non-randomized study designed to assess the feasibility of the NuPulseCV iVAS in patients eligible for a heart transplant.

 Data obtained from the study will be used to make device modifications, refine the patient population, and design a future clinical trial suitable for assessing longer-term use in heart failure patients.
