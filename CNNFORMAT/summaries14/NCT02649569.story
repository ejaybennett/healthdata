(fifthQuint)Continuous Activity Monitoring During Fractionated Radiotherapy in Patients With Head and Neck, Lung, or Gastrointestinal Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To demonstrate the feasibility of continuous, accelerometer-based evaluation of patient activity levels before, during, and after treatment with fractionated external beam radiotherapy.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To demonstrate the feasibility of performing weekly quality of life assessments during fractionated external beam radiotherapy.

 II.

 To explore how accelerometer-based metrics change throughout patients' treatment courses and if these changes are associated with quality of life assessments, treatment interruptions, hospitalizations, and clinical outcomes.

 OUTLINE: Patients wear an activity monitor throughout and up 4 weeks after completion of radiation therapy.

 Patients who are willing may continue to wear the monitor through routine follow up appointments.

 Patients also complete questionnaires at evaluations, which take place prior to radiotherapy initiation, weekly during radiotherapy, and then 2 and 4 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.

 Continuous Activity Monitoring During Fractionated Radiotherapy in Patients With Head and Neck, Lung, or Gastrointestinal Cancer@highlight

This pilot research trial studies continuous activity monitoring during fractionated radiotherapy in patients with head and neck, lung, or gastrointestinal cancer.

 This study explores the use of fitness trackers to study the activity levels of patients before, during, and after radiation therapy and the use of weekly assessments to measure the patients' quality of life during radiation therapy.

 This may allow doctors to see if there is any relationship between activity levels, quality of life, treatment interruptions, hospitalizations, and clinical outcomes.
