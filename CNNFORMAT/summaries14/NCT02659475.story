(secondQuint)Phentermine/Topiramate Extended Release in Binge Eating Disorder (BED).

 This is an exploratory open-label trial of PHEN/TPM ER (Qsymia(R)) in BED.

 It is hypothesized that PHEN/TPM ER (Qsymia(R)) will be an effective, safe, and well tolerated treatment for BED and propose to conduct a 1-site, 12-week, open-label, flexible dose study of PHEN/TPM ER (Qsymia(R)) in 10 outpatients, ages 18 through 65 years, with BED.

 It is also hypothesized that PHEN/TPM ER (Qsymia(R)) will reduce weight and binge eating behavior, and will be well tolerated.

 The primary objective is to show that PHEN/TPM ER (Qsymia(R)) along with nutritional and lifestyle modification counseling is effective in reducing weight in overweight or obese patients with BED.

 Secondary objectives are to show that PHEN/TPM ER (Qsymia(R)) is effective in reducing frequency of binge eating episodes and associated eating psychopathology and is safe and well tolerated in patients with BED.
