(thirdQuint)InterFuse S and T for the Treatment of Scoliosis, Spondylolisthesis and Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD).

 The primary objective of this prospective, post-market study is to collect data to assess the long term outcome of a broad contact modular interbody device in the form of the InterFuse S cent or InterFuse T cent device in patients undergoing long construct fusion for degenerative disc disease and/or scoliosis.

 While there is no concurrent control population, there is ample historical control data to be used for comparison.

 The study will include up to two hundred (200) patients, up to 10 centers, and provide a prospective evaluation of the InterFuse "T" and/or InterFuse "S" Interbody Fusion System.

 Primary endpoints will be assessed at twelve months post-surgery.

 All patients enrolled in the study will be followed for at least 24 months.
