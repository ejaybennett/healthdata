(thirdQuint)Which Parameters of Short-term Blood Pressure Variability Best Predict Early Outcomes in Acute Ischemic Stroke.

 This is a perspective registered cohort study.

 Patients with acute non-cardiogenic ischemic stroke are included into the study.

 During the first 24 hours after admission, the 24 hours blood pressure monitoring is to be taken and used to calculate various parameters of hour-to-hour blood pressure variability, including standard deviation(SD), coefficient of variation (CV), variation independent of mean(VIM) and average real variability (ARV) of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

 The demographic and clinical data are also recorded.

 This is an observational sturdy, thus the caring physician make clinical decisions according to individual patient's condition.

 The endpoints are defined as early neurological deterioration, functional outcome(modified Rankin scale<3 as good outcome) at discharge and 3 months.

 Which Parameters of Short-term Blood Pressure Variability Best Predict Early Outcomes in Acute Ischemic Stroke@highlight

Previous studies on the association between blood pressure variation (BPV) in acute ischemic stroke and functional outcomes yield conflicting result.

 The obscured definition and measurement of BPV engenders considerable confounding factors, making it difficult to interpret.

 We aim to investigate the predictive role of 24-hour BPV on early outcomes in acute non-cardiogenic ischemic stroke.
