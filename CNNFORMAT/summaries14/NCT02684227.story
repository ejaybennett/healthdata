(fifthQuint)Enzalutamide in Combination With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Endometrial Cancer.

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to either the Safety Lead-in or the Phase 2 portion.

 The study group you are in will depend on when you join the study.

 In the Safety Lead-in, each study cycle is 21 days.

 In Phase 2, the first study cycle (Cycle 0) will be 28 days, and all other study cycles will be 21 days.

 If you are enrolled in the Safety Lead-in phase, you will receive carboplatin and paclitaxel on Day 1 of Cycles 1-9.

 You will also take enzalutamide every day.

 If you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will take enzalutamide every day by itself during the first cycle (called Cycle 0).

 You will then receive paclitaxel and carboplatin by vein on Day 1 of Cycles 1-9.

 You will also continue taking enzalutamide every day during this time.

 In both phases, the study drug doses may be lowered if you have side effects.

 The dose that was found to be appropriate in the safety lead-in will be used in Phase 2.

 Study Drug Administration: Paclitaxel will be given by vein over 3 hours.

 Carboplatin will be given by vein over 1 hour.

 You will take 4 enzalutamide capsules by mouth at the same time every morning with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water.

 You may take your dose with or without food.

 The capsules should be swallowed whole and not crushed or cut.

 If you forget to take a dose, you may take it within 12 hours of the usual dosing time.

 If you vomit within 30 minutes of taking a dose, you should take the dose again.

 If you have side effects, your doctor may decide to lower your dose.

 You will be given a study drug diary to write down when you take each dose of study drug and if you miss any doses.

 You should bring the study drug diary and any unused study drugs with you to each clinic visit.

 Study Visits: Cycle 0 Study Visits (Phase 2 participants only): At Week 1 of Cycle 0: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 At Week 4 of Cycle 0: - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

 If blood was not collected for genetic research during your screening, some of this blood will also be used for genetic research.

 - You will have the same type of biopsy you had at screening.

 Study Visits for All Participants: At Week 1 of Cycles 1-9: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 At Weeks 2 and 3 of Cycles 1-9, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 At Week 1 of Cycle 2, blood (about 1/2 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing before the dose and 8 more times over the next 7 hours after the start of the dose.

 PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.

 At Week 3 of Cycle 3 and then every 9 weeks, you will have an x-ray, CT scan, PET-CT scan, or MRI to check the status of the disease.

 Anytime the doctor thinks it is needed, part of the routine blood sample will be used to check how well your blood clots.

 Length of Treatment: You may continue to receive the study drugs until Cycle 9.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits (described below).

 Follow-Up Visits: After you stop taking the study drugs, you will return to the clinic every 3 months for 1 year, and then as often as the doctor thinks it is needed after that.

 At each visit: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - You will have an x-ray, CT scan, PET-CT scan, or MRI to check the status of the disease.

 Enzalutamide in Combination With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Endometrial Cancer@highlight

This clinical research study has two parts: a safety lead-in and Phase 2.

 The goal of the safety lead-in is to find the highest tolerable dose of enzalutamide in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel that can be given to patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer.

 The goal of Phase 2 of this study is to learn if the study drug combination can help to control recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer.

 The safety of the drug combination will be studied in both parts of the study.

 This is an investigational study.

 Enzalutamide is FDA approved for the treatment of certain types of prostate cancer.

 Paclitaxel and carboplatin are FDA approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

 The use of the combination of these 3 drugs to treat endometrial cancer is investigational.

 Up to 69 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
