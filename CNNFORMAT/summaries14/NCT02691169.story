(fifthQuint)Integrated 18F-labelled PSMA Project.

 This is an exploratory single centre, non-randomized, open-label, study in male subjects with metastatic, castrate-resistant PCa (CRPC) being treated with a second-line anti-androgen therapy (enzalutamide or abiraterone).

 The purpose of the study is to assess if 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT: 1.

 Shows more sites of metastatic, castrate-resistant PCa (CRPC) compared with standard imaging (bone scan and CT) at baseline and follow-up, 2.

 Shows response to therapy that is associated with clinical outcome.

 This study will image male subjects with CRPC undergoing second-line anti-androgen therapy (enzalutamide or abiraterone) using 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT for detection of metastases and therapeutic monitoring, with correlation to standard-of-care imaging (CT and bone scan) and clinical follow-up over a 1-year time period.

 Subjects with CRPC and planned treatment with evidence of metastases on standard-of-care imaging (CT and/or bone scan) will undergo a baseline and mid-therapy 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT.

 The study design consists of three study clinic visits (screening, baseline 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT, and 8-14 week follow-up 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT) and two follow-up safety phone calls.

 In addition, all subjects will be followed clinically as per local standard of care with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood levels and standard of care imaging for up to one year following the baseline 18F-DCFPyL administration.

 Integrated 18F-labelled PSMA Project@highlight

There are several new therapies available to treat men with advanced prostate cancer; however, the decision making tools needed to determine the best treatment for these patients are noticeably absent.

 The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is increasingly being recognized as an important target for prostate cancer imaging and determining the most effective therapy.

 Accordingly, a wide variety of agents are being used to image PSMA.

 One of these agents is 18F-DCFPyL.

 In this study the investigators will image men with advanced prostate cancer using 18F-DCFPyL and a positron emission computed tomography (PET/CT) scanner.

 The investigators will compare the results of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT for the detection of metastases and monitoring the effects of therapy with conventional imaging (CT, bone scan) and clinical follow-up.

 In this way, the investigators will evaluate the benefit of using 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT to decide what is the best treatment strategy for a man with advanced prostate cancer.
