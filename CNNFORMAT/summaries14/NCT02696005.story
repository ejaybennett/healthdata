(fifthQuint)Hormone KLOTHO Level in Heart Failure Patients That Participate in Rehabilitation Programme.

 30 patients, age range older than 18 years old suffering from Heart Failure, Functional capacity II-III and echocardiographic evidence of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction less than 40% beginning Cardiac Rehabilitation Programme.

 Following recruitment of patients to the study each one will undergo serum KLOTHO Hormone level assessment along with kidney functions, N terminal -Pro B-Type Natriuretic Peptide hormone activity and Echo measurements .

 After completion of 3-months Exercise based Rehabilitation Programme set at 70-80% of maximal individual exercise capacity,a second identical set of lab tests and Echo measurements will be performed.

 After than participants will be divided into 2 groups: Group I will comprise patients who wish to continue Rehabilitation programme for additional 3-months period and the Group II those who will stop Exercise Rehabilitation programme following completion of the first 3 months.

 Both groups will undergo additional set of lab tests at this six-months-point.

 Except for the primary and secondary end-points all possible correlations between serum KLOTHO level and age, sex, Ejection Fraction, functional capacity, N terminal -Pro B-Type Natriuretic Peptide hormone activity hormone level and kidney function indices will be evaluated.

 Hormone KLOTHO Level in Heart Failure Patients That Participate in Rehabilitation Programme@highlight

30 patients suffering from Heart Failure with Ejection Fraction less than 40% start Cardiac Rehabilitation Programme, serum KLOTHO Hormone level and other labs and Echo measurements will be taken on the first visit.

 After completion of 3-month Rehabilitation Programme the second set of labs and Echo measurements will be taken.

 Than participants will be divided for 2 groups: the patients who wish to continue Rehabilitation programme for additional 3-month period and the second group that prefer to stop Rehabilitation programme after completion of the first 3 month period.

 For both groups additional set of labs will be taken this time and at the end of the study.

 The Aim of the study: to investigate association between serum KLOTHO level, physical activity and possible correlation with laboratory and echocardiographic parameters in cohort of Heart Failure patients.
