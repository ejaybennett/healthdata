(fifthQuint)Effectiveness of A Health Microinsurance Scheme for Private Primary Care in Malaysia.

 This will be a quasi-experimental study designed to determine the effectiveness of a community health microinsurance scheme (HMI) in private primary care clinics in Malaysia via a pre-post study of an experimental and control clinic.

 A proposed HMI scheme, whose price and benefit package have been defined through the earlier Phases 1 and 2, will be accessible to subscribed households at the experimental clinic, while the control clinic has subscribed patients paying as per normal practise, which is by Out-Of-Pocket payment.

 The HMI scheme enabled subscribers to visit the selected clinic chosen for any form of primary care diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.

 Both the clinics are located in the Jalan Ipoh area, a suburb of Kuala Lumpur, and have common sociodemographic characteristics.

 A pre-intervention questionnaire will aim to capture health seeking behaviour, delay in seeking medical care, monthly health expenditure and improvements in clinical outcome (assessed by clinical test results).

 After six months, a post-intervention questionnaire is administered again to the respondents which then allows assessment of the outcome variables.

 This two-arm, pre-post, quasi-experimental trial consisted of utilizing a HMI scheme (experimental clinic) and normal OOP payments (control clinic) for 6 months.
