(firstQuint)Differences in Radial Artery Occlusion From Two Different Compressive Methods Used in Patients in Order to Achieve Homeostasis After Transradial Catheterization and Their Repercussion in Artery Functionality and Hand Mobility.

 Changes in Allen's test and pulse oximetry will be evaluated at baseline, 1 week and 3 month of catheterization in both groups of patients in order to check the functionality of the communications between the ulnar and radial arteries.

 The repercussion of each compressive method on radial occlusion and artery revascularization will be assessed by eco-Doppler at any time.

 Changes in diameter of arterial lumen of radial and ulnar arteries as a consequence of radial occlusion will be done simultaneously of blood flow Doppler measurements.

 The possible impact of radial occlusion on hand mobility will be done using a dynamometer designed to evaluate strength (Endurance test) and muscular claudication (Rapid exchange test).

 Differences in Radial Artery Occlusion From Two Different Compressive Methods Used in Patients in Order to Achieve Homeostasis After Transradial Catheterization and Their Repercussion in Artery Functionality and Hand Mobility@highlight

The aim of the study is to determine differences on radial artery occlusion from two compressive methods used after transradial catheterization and its functional impact on hand mobility.
