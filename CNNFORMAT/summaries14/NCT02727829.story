(firstQuint)The Assessment of Microcirculation in Brachial Plexus Block Using Perfusion Index and Capillary Filling Time.

 Microcirculation is very crucial to evaluate the organ function those working properly in human body.

 The aim of the present study is to assess the effects of brachial plexus block on microcirculation using pefusion index and capillary filling time.

 A total of 50 patients whose planned to underwent surgery are performed brachial plexus block using ultrasound, and pefusion index, heart rate, blood pressure, capillary filling time are measured at 0, 10th and 20th minutes interval and at postoperative 24th hours.

 All measures will be recorded.
