(fifthQuint)Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety With CAR-T for Recurrent or Refractory Acute Non T Lymphocyte Leukemia.

 This is a single-arm,multicenter Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the CAR-T for recurrent or refractory acute non T lymphocyte leukemia.

The study will be conducted using a phase I/II design.

The study will have the following sequential phases:Part A (screening leukapheresis, cell product preparation, and cytoreductive chemotherapy) and Part B (treatment and follow-up).

 The follow-up period for each participant is approximately 35 months after the final CAR-T infusion.

 The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 3 years.

 A total of 24 patients may be enrolled over a period of 3 years.

 Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety With CAR-T for Recurrent or Refractory Acute Non T Lymphocyte Leukemia@highlight

This single-arm,multicenter Phase 2 trial will treat the patients who have recurrent or refractory acute non T lymphocyte leukemia with an infusion of the patient's own T cells that have been genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that will bind to tumour cells that express the EPCAM protein on the cell surface.

The study will determine if these modified T cells help the body's immune system eliminate tumour cells.

The trial will also study the safety of treatment with CAR-T,how long CAR-T cells stay in the patient's body and the impact of this treatment on survival.
