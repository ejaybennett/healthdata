(thirdQuint)Study to Evaluate Immunogenicity and Safety of GSK Biologicals' Herpes Zoster Subunit (HZ/su) Vaccine at 9 and 10 Years After Vaccine Administration and Assessment of Re-vaccination With 2 Additional Doses at 10 Years After Initial Vaccination, in Healthy Subjects Aged 60 Years of Age(YOA) and Older.

 In this LTFU study (ZOSTER-060), subjects who received 2 doses of HZ/su in the earlier Zoster-003 (NCT00434577) study will be followed up at Month 108/Year 9 and Month 120/Year 10 post first dose of vaccine for safety and immunogenicity (humoral and cellular).

 In order to assess the effect of re-vaccination with 2 additional doses of HZ/su vaccine, all the subjects will receive 2 additional doses of the HZ/su vaccine, on a 0, 2-month schedule at ten years after the initial vaccination course in study Zoster-003 (NCT00434577), and will be followed for reactogenicity, safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity (including persistence).

 In alignment with the previous persistence timepoints, this study has no control group.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of immune response to the HZ vaccine as well as safety up to 10 years after the first dose of initial vaccination course.

 This study will also assess immune responses after re-vaccination with 2 additional doses of the HZ/su administered at ten years after first dose of initial vaccination course from study Zoster-003 (NCT00434577).
