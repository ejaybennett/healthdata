(secondQuint)Transversus Abdominus Plane Catheters for Open Inguinal Hernia Repair.

 This study is a randomized, controlled trial designed to determine whether continuous transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block versus sham block has a substantial impact on pain following open inguinal hernia repair.

 Our primary outcome is to determine whether there will be a difference in opioid consumption within the first two days following surgery.

 Secondary outcomes will include: pain scores and activity assessment score.
