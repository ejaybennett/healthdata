(thirdQuint)A Study of Oral and Intravenous (IV) Tedizolid Phosphate in Hospitalized Participants, Ages 2 to <12 Years, With Confirmed or Suspected Bacterial Infection (MK-1986-013).

 Part A (IV): - Group 1 (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) (6 to <12 years) - Group 2 (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) (2 to <6 years) Part B (Oral Suspension): - Group 3 (6 to <12 years) - Group 4 (2 to <6 years) In Cohort 1 of Group 1 (IV) participants received a single administration of tedizolid phosphate at 5 mg/kg of total body weight.

 After all participants in Cohort 1 of Group 1 received study drug, a preliminary analysis of the safety and PK data was performed and results were used to select 4 mg/kg as the appropriate dose for Cohort 2 of Group 1 and Group 3, and to select 6 mg/kg as the starting dose for the younger participants, Cohort 1 of Group 2.

 After all participants in Cohort 1 of Group 2 receive study drug, another preliminary analysis of the safety and PK data will be performed and results will be used to confirm 6 mg/kg as the appropriate dose for Cohort 2 of Group 2.

 Similarly, the Group 4 dose will be confirmed after data review of Group 3 results.
