(firstQuint)Trial of R-GemOx Versus R-miniCHOP Regimen in First-line Treatment of Elderly Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma.

 Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin(GemOx) shows effective activity in patients with relapsed diffuse large-cell lymphoma and other solid tumors.

 Our Previous study showed that two-weekly regimen of rituximab combined with GemOx regimen acheived comparable response rate to R-miniCHOP.

The investigators therefore design this open-label,phase III and random trial to compared the safety and efficacy of R-Gemox versus R-miniCHOP as first-line treatment of elderly patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

 Primary Outcome Measures: cent 2-year overall survival rate Secondary Outcome Measures: - 2-year progression free survival rate - overall response rate - safety and toxicity Enrollment:258 Study Start Date: June 2016 Primary Completion Date: June 2019.
