(firstQuint)Monitoring Brain Waves in Response to Visual and/or Auditory Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease Patients.

 Patients with Parkinson's disease may have gait disturbances including freezing of gait.

 Visual and auditory stimuli may improve gait.

 Investigators will analyze brain wave during walking while giving the subject different stimuli.

 The voltage fluctuation (in hundreds of microvolts) will be recorded using the EEG cap and amplifier into a computer.
