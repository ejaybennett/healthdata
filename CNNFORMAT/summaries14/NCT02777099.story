(firstQuint)Impact of Remote Ischemic Postconditioning on Autonomic Function in Stroke Patients.

 Remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) has proven effective in reducing the ischemia-reperfusion injury.

 But the defensive mechanism of RIPostC still unclear.

 Stroke is frequently associated with autonomic dysfunction.

 Heart rate variability (HRV) represents the autonomic nervous system activity.

This study aims to investigate whether RIPostC correlates with autonomic function and thus predicts prognosis of stroke.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) initiates autonomic nervous system response and affects the prognosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
