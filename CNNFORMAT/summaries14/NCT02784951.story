(secondQuint)Use of Blood and Plasma in Norwegian Physician-staffed Helicopter Emergency Medical Systems.

 This study evaluates prehospital transfusion therapy in exsanguinating patients treated by physician-staffed emergency medical services in Norway, with the following main questions: I.

 Are out-of-hospital transfusions associated with an increase in adverse transfusion events compared to inhospital transfusions? II.

 Is out-of-hospital physician administration of plasma or blood products in exsanguinating patients feasible? III.

 Are patients in need of blood product transfusion possible to identify and transfuse in the prehospital phase/environment? IV.

 Are out-of-hospital transfusion practices associated with increased waste of blood products? All patients in haemorrhagic shock needing volume replacement and receiving prehospital transfusion of blood products will be included, if they fulfill the listed criteria below: - Patients with mechanism of injury compatible with severe haemorrhage and/or haemorrhagic shock (e.

g.

 penetrating torso injury, visible massive bleeding) - Radial pulse > 100 beats/min or absent/weak radial pulse - Systolic blood pressure (SBP) s Witness) will be excluded.
