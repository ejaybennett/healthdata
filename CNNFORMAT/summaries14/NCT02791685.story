(thirdQuint)Smartphone Delivered In-home Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation.

 This project aims to determine if a smartphone-delivered cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program could show similar clinical outcomes to in-person programs at a low cost in a large population of patients.

 Investigators will also assess the feasibility of tailoring a virtual CR program to a small sample of COPD participants who also stand to benefit in the absence of an established pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program.

 This is a randomized controlled clinical trial of participants at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center with an applicable diagnosis for cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation versus usual care during the study period.

 The study team plans to simultaneously recruit two cohorts of participants referred for CR (Cohort A) and PR (Cohort B) to take part in an in-home, virtual rehabilitation program.

 To compare this intervention to traditional CR, investigators will perform an observational cohort study of patients who are already enrolled through the CHOICE program in conventional CR.

 Furthermore, to better understand the potential impact of this intervention, investigators will perform a retrospective chart review of patients referred for CR over the past 5-years.

 Investigators seek to address the following: 1.

 Determine whether a home-based cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation program delivered through smartphones is feasible and improves functional status.

 2.

 Determine if education and lifestyle counseling lead to increased adherence with prescribed follow-up, pharmacotherapy, quality of life, self-efficacy and lifestyle changes.

 3.

 Determine if a home-based cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation program reduces health system utilization, including ED visits and readmission rates.

 Smartphone Delivered In-home Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation@highlight

The goal of this study is to determine if a remote cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation program delivered via a smartphone application and regular telephone calls will lead to improved patient outcomes as measured by functional capacity, improved patient compliance in monitoring symptoms and medication adherence, improved self-efficacy and knowledge in managing disease and, a decreased rate of hospitalization and re-admissions.
