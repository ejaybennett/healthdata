(secondQuint)Impact of ART Adherence on HIV Persistence and Inflammation.

 Understanding whether the size and dynamics of the HIV reservoir are associated with adherence, measured by an objective biomarker, could have significant clinical and therapeutic implications for ART and HIV cure.

 1.

 First, this aim will quantify levels of CA-RNA, CA-DNA, and plasma residual viremia in suppressed, HIV infected individuals and correlate them with levels of TFV-DP in DBS as a measure of cumulate drug exposure (adherence).

 2.

 Second, this study will evaluate the changes in the HIV reservoir in relation to changes in ART adherence over time.

 Impact of ART Adherence on HIV Persistence and Inflammation@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence with levels of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reservoir and residual viremia in suppressed, HIV-infected individuals on chronic ART.
