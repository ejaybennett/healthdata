(secondQuint)Evaluation of Aortic Aneurysms With Focus on Wall Stress and Wall Rupture Risk.

 In patients with known aortic aneurysm who received clinically indicated CT during a time period from 01/2004-12/2013 the CT data was evaluated with dedicated software, A4clinics, VASCOPS GmbH, Graz, Austria.

 The following parameters will be evaluated: exterior and luminal diameter, intraluminal thrombus (ILT) thickness, vessel-, luminal- and intraluminal thrombus volume, peak wall stress (PWS), peak wall rupture risk (PWRR), von Mises-stress and rupture risk-index in the ILT.

 Evaluation of Aortic Aneurysms With Focus on Wall Stress and Wall Rupture Risk@highlight

Retrospective study to evaluate the impact of computational wall stress analysis based on computed tomography (CT) of ruptured and not-ruptured aortic aneurysms as an additional predictor for rupture with dedicated software.
