(fifthQuint)Monitoring of Cerebral Oxygenation Using Jugular Oximetry in Comatose Patients After Cardiac Arrest.

 The use of protective ventilation (to maintain normoxia and normocapnia), optimise haemodynamics, diagnose/treat seizures, therapeutic hypotermia etc is recommended for ICU management of patients who have had cardiac arrest and remain in coma after return of spontaneous circulation according to the latest International Guidelines.

 These actions essentially aim to limit secondary brain injury but despite all therapeutic effort, the cerebral oxygenation may remain inadequate and there is no validated method to avoid such a state in real time.

 The objective of this study is to assess relationship between jugular venous oximetry and neurological outcome of comatose patients after cardiac arrest, evaluated as per Cerebral Performance Category scale (CPC).

 Further, the aim is to clarify relations between biomarkers protein S100B, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and parameters of jugular oximetry for prognostication.

 An anticipated total of sixty patients will be enrolled in this non-randomised, single-group, double-blind study.
