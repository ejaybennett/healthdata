(fifthQuint)Long-term Outcome in Late-onset Pompe Disease Treated Beyond 36 Months (ATBIG-Pompe-Study).

 The presentation and course of late-onset Pompe disease is much less foreseeable than the classic infantile form.

 Some patients experience a rapid worsening in skeletal muscle function leading to loss of ambulation and respiratory failure, while others progress less rapidly.

 So there is a more inconstant response to treatment in skeletal muscle and lung function in the long-term.

 Therefore, an unmet clinical need is the collection and analysis of long-term data of rhGAA enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in late-onset Pompe disease patient aged 8 years and older.

 The principal goal of our investigator driven study is to gain conclusive insight in long-term outcome data beyond 36 months up to 10 years of ERT treatment.

 In addition we will collect biological samples from all patients for a future biomarker study including gene modifier search by genome and RNA seq (not part of this proposal).

 This study may provide clinicians and researchers with a better understanding of late-onset Pompe disease under long-term treatment, to the benefit of all patients affected with late-onset Pompe disease, as well as, individuals and families with related diseases.

 Long-term Outcome in Late-onset Pompe Disease Treated Beyond 36 Months (ATBIG-Pompe-Study)@highlight

Long-term outcome in late-onset Pompe disease treated beyond 36 months (ATBIG-Pompe-Study), a multicenter, multinational, longitudinal, non-interventional observational study in subjects, at least 8 years old, diagnosed with late-onset Pompe disease retrospectively and prospectively collects data to understand clinical progression in terms of muscle and respiratory function, and clinical symptomology treated with alglucosidase alfa more than 36 months in 100 subjects.
