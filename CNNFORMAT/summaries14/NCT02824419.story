(thirdQuint)Imaging of Active Granulomas With [18F]FDG and Selected Inflammatory PET Tracers in Pulmonary Sarcoidosis.

 The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is difficult since there is no specific noninvasive method available to diagnose sarcoidosis.

 FDG-PET imaging is in use, however, FDG is not a specific tracer for sarcoidosis and other inflammatory diseases may interfere with the imaging findings.

 The aim of the current protocol is to evaluate the potential of other inflammatory PET-tracers in the detection of sarcoidotic lesions.

 The patients with active sarcoidotic lesions in lungs will be recruited.

 First, the patient undergoes PET-FDG scan and then the patient undergoes the PET scan either with C11-methionine or 68Ga-DOTANOC.

 The results with the latter tracers will be compared to the imaging results with FDG.

The goal of the current study is to evaluate the potential of the selected PET tracers to detect sarcoidotic lesions in lungs.

 The tracers are already in clinical use for the detection of certain inflammatory processes or malignant tumors, and their targets present similarities with molecular mechanisms of sarcoidosis.
