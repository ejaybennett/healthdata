(thirdQuint)Chronic Cardiovascular and Gut-bacteria Effects of Phenolic Rich Oats in Adults With Above Average Blood Pressure.

 - To investigate the chronic effects of daily intake of oat products on flow mediated dilatation of the brachial artery (FMD; primary endpoint), microvascular endothelial function (measured by laser Doppler iontophoresis), pulse wave analysis, gut microbiota diversity, 24h blood pressure, activity of the renin angiotensin system, markers related to cellular production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, inflammatory cytokines, and further potentially emerging biochemical markers of CVD risk.

 - To establish if phenolic acids and avenanthramides from oat products exert cardiovascular and microbial effects in a dose dependent manner.

 - To measure urinary and fecal excretion of avenanthramide and phenolic acid metabolites.

 To explore correlations between bacterial population changes and CVD risk markers.

In this proposed human trial, the investigators aim to establish whether 4 weeks of daily consumption of beta-glucan matched meals providing either a high dose or a moderate dose of oat avenanthramides and phenolic acids leads to dose-dependent chronic improvements in markers of CVD risk and gut health relative to an energy matched control intervention in healthy adults with above average blood pressure.
