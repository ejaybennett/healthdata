 Qigong For PPSP In Breast Cancer Pain In Breast Cancer Survivors@highlight

Studies have shown that on-going pain following breast surgery is common and may limit the ability to participate in physical activity, cause tiredness, difficulty in daily chores/activities as well as other problems.

 This study is evaluating whether participating in a 12-week Qigong program (pronounced chee kung), an exercise program that involves gentle movements combined with breathing/relaxation techniques, also known as mind-body exercise, leads to improvement of pain, physical function, and quality of life among breast cancer survivors that have significant pain following surgery.
