(fifthQuint)The Effect of Child Position on the Results of Hyperventilation During Routine Electroencephalography.

 The study will include 30 patients at the age of 4-10 years old of both sexes.

 after signing an informed concent, every child, suspected of having absence seizures, will undergoe an EEG recording including a provocation of hyperventilation.

 The study will include two groups: 1.

 A group of 15 children who will undergoe an EEG recording with 3 minutes of hyperventilation in the prone position, followed by 5 minutes of rest, then after another 5-10 minutes of recording with normal breathing.

 Finally the participants will performed additional 3 minutes of hyperventilation in the sitting position 2.

 A group of 15 children who will undergoe an EEG recording with 3 minutes of hyperventilation in the sitting position, followed by 5 minutes of rest, then after another 5-10 minutes of recording with normal breathing.

 .

 Finally the participants will performed additional 3 minutes of hyperventilation in the prone position.

 Participants who will not be able to perform all the steps of the study will be excluded The analysis of the study results will be performed by a specialist in pediatric neurology and pediatric epilepsy who will confirm whether the EEG recording show epileptic discharge (sharp waves, slow waves, combination of sharp and slow waves, spikes or combination of spikes and slow waves).

 The Effect of Child Position on the Results of Hyperventilation During Routine Electroencephalography@highlight

Electroencephalograhy (EEG) is used as a tool for diagnosing epilepsy/convulsions.

 During the recording, especially for childen who are suspected of having abbcence epilepsy the investigators will perform an EEG recording including a provocation test of hyperventilation in order to induce epileptic discharges.

 There is no clear instruction about the position of the child during performing this hyperventilation provocation.

 Clinical observations showed that this provocation is more effective when it's performed in the siiting position.

 No study was previously performed to investigate this issue
