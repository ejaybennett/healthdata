(fifthQuint)Parents Make the Difference II: Trial of a Parenting Intervention.

 This is a multisite randomized trial of a parenting intervention in Liberia for caregivers of young children.

 The "Parents Make the Difference" program is designed to teach parents (a) skills for decreasing harsh punishments and replacing those with positive ways to manage children's behavior and (b) skills for having more positive interactions with their children.

 As a result of positive changes in parenting, the investigators expect that, over time, children's behavioral and cognitive well-being will improve and that the intervention will prevent future abuse and poor developmental outcomes in the long-term.

 This study will randomize 816 caregivers of children ages 3 or 4 years to 1 of 3 study arms: standard group program, group program plus home visits, waitlist control.
