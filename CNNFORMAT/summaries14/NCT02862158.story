(secondQuint)Frequency Doubling Technology (FDT) Mobile Visual Field Testing.

 Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible and preventable blindness world-wide.

 Insufficient evidence exists to support routine screening for glaucoma in a primary care setting due to the relatively low prevalence of the disease (Guirguis-Blake, 2005 and Moyer, 2013).

 Frequency doubling technology (FDT)-based perimetry is a relatively inexpensive and portable visual field testing device with a short testing time that has shown reasonable efficacy, sensitivity and specificity in screening for glaucoma in clinic- and community-based settings (Mansberger, 2005 and Nomoto 2009).

 The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy and reproducibility of FDT perimetry platforms compared with Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) perimetry (which is the gold clinical standard in clinics and hospitals) in detecting glaucomatous visual field defects.

This is a single center, prospective study to evaluate the efficacy and reproducibility of frequency doubling technology (FDT)-based visual field devices compared to conventional Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) perimetry.

 The investigators plan to enroll 500 patients in this study.
