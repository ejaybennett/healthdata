 This is a two-arm, Phase 1b, open-label, dose escalation study of ME-401 alone and an open-label study of ME-401 in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies.

 The two arms of the study will be conducted in parallel, with subject allocation to ME-401 alone or ME-401 plus rituximab based on disease type and availability of an open enrollment slot.
