(fifthQuint)Effectiveness of Supervised Motor Control Exercises on Rotator Cuff Tendinopathies.

 The importance of our shoulders to everyday movement and activity is often not fully appreciated, until we are limited by injury or pain.

 The shoulder complex allow us to interact with our surroundings while acting as the functional link between our stable trunks and our free moving upper limbs.

 This is no easy task for highly mobile joints such as the shoulders.

 A shoulder injury can be functionally devastating to an individual, and can potentially place unnecessary financial stress on our health care system.

 Shoulder pain is currently among the most common reasons to visit a general practitioner or a physiotherapist today.

 Shoulder pain is third in prevalence, only to back and neck pain, and nearly two-thirds of adults suffer from shoulder pain at some point during their lives.

 Despite being an important focus for rehabilitative care, we have yet to confidently establish efficient and potentially cost effective methods for treating shoulder pathologies and pain.

 Among shoulder disorders, the rotator cuff (RC) muscles are the leading source of shoulder pain.

 Due to the vast mobility of the shoulder complex, it relies greatly on the stability and control provided by its supportive tissues, notably the rotator cuff muscles; often rendering them highly susceptible to injury.

 It has been noted that individuals affected by rotator cuff tendinopathies (RCt) often exhibit motor control and shoulder proprioception deficits.

 As noted by Cools and colleagues, rehabilitative training programs that focus on motor control are greatly needed for rehabilitation as well as to prevent re-injury.

 Accordingly, rehabilitation interventions should focus on motor (re)learning, targeting a better muscle coordination to reduce motor control impairments, optimize movement control, and improve muscle strength.

 Motor control rehabilitation: To address the motor control deficits among individuals affected by an RCt, we have developed a novel, structured, and supervised group exercise-based program focusing on neuromuscular reeducation.

 It is well documented in the scientific literature that motor control and proprioception exercises are crucial for healing among this population.

 However, the effectiveness of a group delivery method remains unknown.

 It is presently unclear how a group exercise program compares to one-on-one physiotherapy care for shoulder dysfunctions.

 The developed group program allows patients to individually progress their exercises based on their symptoms, while being guided and corrected by the supervising physiotherapist.

 This model allows several patients to access physiotherapy services simultaneously, while remaining cost and resource effective for the clinics.

 To appreciate the goal of the proposed exercise program, it is important to understand the physiological and biomechanical factors directly related to shoulder stability.

 Underlying mechanisms for shoulder stability: For its joint stability, the glenohumeral (GH) joint heavily depends on muscle strength, adequate synergistic activity between the neuromuscular structures, as well as a strong joint position sense (a subcategory of proprioception).

 Our ability to detect our limbs in space helps us to interact with our surroundings and contributes to the neuromuscular stability of our joints.

 A RCt is often associated with a subacromial impingement syndrome, where structures under the acromion become pinched during arm elevation.

 Such a compression during arm movements can include abnormal shoulder kinematics, as well as RC and scapular muscles performance deficits.

 This inadequate scapulothoracic muscle control is believed to contribute to a reduction of amplitude in posterior tilting and lateral rotation of the scapula, which causes the acromion to remain in a lower anterolateral position resulting in a dynamic narrowing of the subacromial space.

 Also, the abnormal muscle control is associated with superior migration of humeral head with respect to the glenoid fossa, which again leads to a dynamic narrowing of the subacromial space.

 These deficits contribute to the impingement of subacromial structures and often lead to the symptoms associated with an RCt.

 What makes the investigated approach unique in addressing RC disorders is the resource-effective exercise rehabilitation model the investigators propose; a motor control and strengthening approach well supported in the scientific literature and packaged in a conveniently resource-friendly protocol.

 This approach maximizes patient autonomy while being matched to a suitable level of physiotherapist supervision.

 The investigators believe that the Upper Extremity Neuromuscular Training Program (UpEx-NTP) provides a realistic and financially beneficial solution to a costly health care problem.

 Research Question: How will a 6-week UpEx-NTP improve shoulder function, pain, and joint position sense (JPS) in individuals affected by a rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy compared to usual physiotherapy care? The primary objective of this randomized control trial (RTC) is to compare, in terms of symptoms and functional limitations, a group receiving a supervised rehabilitation program (UpEx-NTP) centered on strength and motor control training to a group receiving usual one-on-one physiotherapy clinical care in individuals affected by a RC tendinopathy of the shoulder.

 A secondary objective is to explore the effects of these interventions on joint position sense (JPS).

 It is hypothesized that both the UpEx-NTP (Exp) and usual physiotherapy care (Ctl) groups will equally demonstrate statistically (p-value < 0.

05) and clinically (all noted changes above their MCID : DASH questionnaire = 11 points, WORC index = 12 points and the Numeric Rating Scale for pain = 2 points) significant changes in shoulder function and pain over a 6-week period in individuals with an RC tendinopathy and will be maintained over time, notably 3 and 6 months after the intervention.

 We further hypothesize that the Exp (UpEx-NTP) group will demonstrate a statistically significant improvement (again a p-value < 0.

05) in JPS through the Shoulder Proprioceptive Reaching Test (SPRET) compared to the Clt group, due to the concentrated motor control and proprioceptive exercises of the UpEx-NTP.

 The Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) has yet to be established for the SPRET evaluation tool.

 Effectiveness of Supervised Motor Control Exercises on Rotator Cuff Tendinopathies@highlight

The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body but still has the responsibility of ensuring a strong stability of our upper limbs during daily activities.

 The shoulder joint therefore requires a significant level of neuromuscular control at all times.

 The shoulder heavily relies on 4 key stabilizing muscles, known as the rotator cuff complex (RC).

 A tendinopathy of the RC may cause pain, significant muscle weakness, and a decrease in motor control of the shoulder during functional activities as well as work tasks.

 Individuals who have an RC tendinopathy often have neuromuscular and proprioceptive deficits.

 The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effectiveness of a brand new strength and motor control exercise program for the upper extremities and to compare the effectiveness of this program to usual physiotherapy care (such as manual therapy, motion exercises, strengthening, manual techniques) in reducing shoulder pain and improving overall function.

 A total of 44 participants suffering from an RC tendinopathy will be recruited; 22 will be assigned to the exercise group (EXP) and 22 participants will be receiving usual physiotherapy care (CTL).

 Participants in the EXP group will partake in the new exercise program 3 times / week for 6 weeks whereas participants in the CTL group will receive usual physiotherapy treatments twice / week with home exercises for 6 weeks.

 The results of this study will provide clinicians with a cost-effective and innovative treatment approach to treating shoulder pain.

 This study will provide active rehabilitation guidelines for reducing shoulder pain and the incidence of recurrence.
