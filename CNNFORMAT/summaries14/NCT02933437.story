(thirdQuint)The Response To Ajmaline Provocation in Healthy Subjects.

 The investigators will recruit healthy subjects without a history of cardiac symptoms or a family history of sudden death or premature arrhythmogenic cardiac disease.

 Participants will undergo electrocardiographic phenotype assessment with standard and high lead electrocardiogram and sodium channel provocation.

 Detailed cardiac structural examination will be performed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to look for any variation in mainly right ventricular outflow tract structure and myocardial architecture.

 Participants will also undergo targeted genomic sequencing to look for variations in genes encoding for cardiac sodium channel.

 The Response To Ajmaline Provocation in Healthy Subjects@highlight

Standard, high lead and sodium channel provoked electrocardiograms of a healthy volunteers will be performed to observe the various ECG changes.

 Participants will the undergo detailed imaging with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and deep genotyping to identify structural or genetic variants which might dictate the electrocardiographic patterns at rest and with sodium channel provocation.
