(thirdQuint)Exploration of Standard Surgical Indication in Gallbladder Benign Disease.

 The incidence of gallbladder benign diseases are increasing today.

 Most patients are accepting cholecystectomy.

 Is it better postoperation for this sort of patients? In other words, there is no specific indication for cholecystectomy in gallbladder benign diseases.

 Investigators want to explore the specific surgical indication for these patients so that surgeons could help patients make the best decision according to our evaluation model.

 This model may be a scale that summarizes and quantizes correlative factors of individual, which will be discussed by statisticians and experts of biliary surgery.

This study evaluates life quality of patients who were diagnosed with gallbladder benign disease through Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) scale.

 Researchers will establish a database including 20,000 patients.

 Through observational followup and statistic analysis,identifing a model or scale to standardized surgical indication, help surgeons and patients determine the best treatment decision.
