(fifthQuint)Gadobutrol Versus Gadopentetate Dimeglumine or Gadobenate Dimeglumine Before DCE-MRI in Diagnosing Patients With Multiple Sclerosis, Grade II-IV Glioma, or Brain Metastases.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine whether Gadavist(R) (gadobutrol) is consistent with Magnevist(R) (gadopentetate dimeglumine) or Multihance (gadobenate dimeglumine) in the preoperative grading of gliomas utilizing DCE MRI.

 II.

 To determine whether Gadavist(R) is consistent with Magnevist(R) or Multihance in identifying the number of cerebral metastases from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body using T1-weighted post contrast MRI.

 III.

 To determine if Gadavist(R) is consistent with Magnevist(R) or Multihance in identifying multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques using T1-weighted post contrast MRI.

 IV.

 To determine if Gadavist(R) produces similar MR perfusion/permeability values of MS lesions as Magnevist(R) or Multihance.

 V.

 Descriptive analysis to present the different rating patterns of Gadavist(R) versus Magnevist(R) or Multihance in differentiating therapeutic necrosis from recurrent tumor in gliomas utilizing DCE MRI.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive standard of care gadopentetate dimeglumine intravenously (IV) twice within 5 minutes or gadobenate dimeglumine IV twice within 5 minutes and then undergo DCE-MRI on day 1.

 Patients also receive gadobutrol IV twice within 5 minutes and then undergo DCE-MRI over approximately 30 minutes on day 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up at 7 days.

 Gadobutrol Versus Gadopentetate Dimeglumine or Gadobenate Dimeglumine Before DCE-MRI in Diagnosing Patients With Multiple Sclerosis, Grade II-IV Glioma, or Brain Metastases@highlight

This pilot clinical trial compares gadobutrol with standard of care contrast agents, gadopentetate dimeglumine or gadobenate dimeglumine, before dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing patients with multiple sclerosis, grade II-IV glioma, or tumors that have spread to the brain.

 Gadobutrol is a type of contrast agent that may increase DCE-MRI sensitivity for the detection of tumors or other diseases of the central nervous system.

 It is not yet known whether gadobutrol is more effective than standard of care contrast agents before DCE-MRI in diagnosing patients with multiple sclerosis, grade II-IV glioma, or tumors that have spread to the brain.
