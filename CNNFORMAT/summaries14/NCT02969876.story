(firstQuint)Pattern Separation, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factors, and Mechanisms of Vortioxetine.

 The U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration approved vortioxetine to treat major depressive disorder in 2013.

 Researchers believe vortioxetine may improve pattern separation and pattern completion (i.

e.

, a neurological function) in people with major depressive disorder; thus, this research study aims to determine how vortioxetine increases a person's ability to think.

 The current study is an open label trial, therefore, all participants will receive vortioxetine.

 Furthermore, participants receive the vortioxetine at no cost.

 It will take participants 6 weeks to complete this study.

 Participants are asked to come to the Mass General Hospital campus for 1 screening visit which includes a full psychiatric evaluation, and 5 additional study visits.

 During study visits, participants will meet with a clinician and then complete computer based cognitive tests.
