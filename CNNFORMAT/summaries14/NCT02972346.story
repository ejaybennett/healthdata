(fifthQuint)Availability Study of ACTH to Treat Children SRNS/SDNS.

 Primary nephrotic syndrome(NS) is a common children renal disease.

About 20% primary nephrotic syndrome are steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant.

Low serum cortisol is one of the main relapse reasons.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH) can stimulates the adrenal cortex and its production of corticosteroids.

ACTH also direct melanocortin receptors(MCRs) mediated protective effect on kidney cells.

 To investigate the efficacy and safety of ACTH to treat NS, total 42 children steroid resistant or steroid dependent NS is enrolling in this multicenter, prospective case series of prescription based treatment with ACTH for NS.

Primary nephrotic syndrome(NS) is a common children renal disease.

About 20% primary nephrotic syndrome are steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant.

Low serum cortisol is one of the main relapse reasons.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH)-induced steroidogenesis improve serum cortisol and also direct melanocortin receptors(MCRs) mediated protective effect on kidney cells.

 To investigate the efficacy and safety of ACTH to treat NS, total 42 children steroid resistant or steroid dependent NS is enrolling in this multicenter, prospective case series of prescription based treatment with ACTH for NS.
