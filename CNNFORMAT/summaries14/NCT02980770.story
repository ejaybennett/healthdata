(fifthQuint)Postoperative Complications in Patients With Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome.

 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Obesity-Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS) are common conditions in obesity, which may influence the prognosis in patients undergoing surgery.

 There is a need for simple screening tools to identify such patients at high risk.

 The current multicenter observational study aims to investigate occurrence of OSA and OHS in obese individuals undergoing elective abdominal surgery by using questionnaires (STOPBANG questionnaire, Berlin Questionnaire, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and arterial blood gases.

 Perioperative and 72-h postoperative complications will be documented.
