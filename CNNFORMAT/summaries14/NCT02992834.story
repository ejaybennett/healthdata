(secondQuint)Anti-CD19:TCR Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T Cells in the Treatment for CD19+ B Cell Lymphoma.

 This is a single-centre, randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells (CD19 CAR T-cells) in patients with chemotherapy-resistant or refractory CD19+ B cell lymphoma.

 Following informed consent and registration to the trial, Patients will receive the allogeneic CD19 CAR T-cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

 The study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of the CD19 CAR T-cells in patients with chemotherapy-resistant or refractory CD19+ B cell lymphoma.
