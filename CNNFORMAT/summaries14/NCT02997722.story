(fifthQuint)Ketamine: Its Effects on Suicidal Ideations and Inpatient Hospital Length of Stay.

 Patients who agree to participate in this study will be enrolled within 24 hours of being admitted to the UMMC inpatient psychiatric service with suicidal ideations.

 After a member of the study team ensures that the patient understands the risks and benefits of participating versus not participating, the patient will be assigned, by chance, to one of the following groups: - Group A: receives ketamine intravenous (IV) infusion over 45 minutes - Group B: receives saline (salt solution) over 45 minutes The infusion will be administered in either the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) or Short Stay Procedure Area (SSPA).

 After receiving the infusion, the patient will be monitored for an additional 30 minutes by medical personnel in either the PACU or SSPA.

 This study will be a randomized, double blind cohort study, so neither the patient nor the study doctor will know which infusion is being administered.

 While receiving the infusion, the patient's vital signs (including heart rate, heart rhythm, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature) will be monitored on an anesthesia paper chart.

 After the patient is discharged from the hospital, the treatment team will analyze the patient's medical record and compare the length of hospital stay between the control and treatment groups.

 The only information about the patient's hospital stay that will be analyzed will be the length of hospital stay.

 If a patient is a woman of childbearing age, a urine pregnancy test will be performed after you agree to enroll in the study.

 The cost of this test will be covered by the University of Mississippi Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychiatry.

 If you are found to be pregnant, you will not be able to participate in the study.

 Patients admitted after suicidal attempt may be enrolled in the study.

 Those who attempted suicide by medication overdose may participate in the study, but must be cleared by a medical toxicology specialist prior to enrollment.

 Due to cardiovascular adverse effects of ketamine, all participants will receive a 12-lead EKG to screen for cardiac arrhythmias.

 Any rhythm other than sinus rhythm will result in exclusion from the study.

 The patient's length of hospital stay will be recorded.

 Patients will be called at three and six months post-discharge to assess for any adverse events or medication reactions.

 Readmission rates will be assessed at six months post-discharge.

 Ketamine: Its Effects on Suicidal Ideations and Inpatient Hospital Length of Stay@highlight

Patients admitted to the University of Mississippi's inpatient psychiatry unit for suicidal ideations will be given the opportunity to participate in the study.

 Within 24 hours of arriving to the inpatient psychiatric floor, patients who choose to participate will be randomized to receive either a placebo saline infusion or a ketamine infusion of 0.

5 mg/kg over the course of 45 minutes.

 Infusions will take place in the University of Mississippi Medical Center's Post Anesthesia Care Unit and/or Short Stay Procedure Area.

 Patients will be monitored for 30 minutes after the completion of their infusion.

 The inpatient psychiatry team will assess all patients' suicidal ideations daily while they are inpatient at UMMC and the primary outcome will be the patient's inpatient hospital course length.
