(fifthQuint)Autologous Cryopreserved CD34+ Hematopoietic Cells Transduced With EFS-ADA Lentivirus for ADA SCID.

 This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-cohort, longitudinal, single-center, clinical study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-101 (autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells transduced ex vivo with EFS LV encoding for the human ADA gene) administered to ADA-SCID subjects between the ages of 30 days and 17 years, who are not eligible for an HLA-matched sibling/family donor and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

 The aim of this study is to assess the success of treatment for overall survival and event free survival.

 Eligible subjects will be hospitalized to undergo the harvesting of autologous CD34+ cells.

 To enable the release of the cell product for infusion, the product must meet various quality control criteria for safety, identity, viability, purity and potency.

 If OTL-101 meets the acceptance criteria and is released, the subjects will be readmitted for conditioning prior to infusion of OTL-101.

 For subjects who have successfully received the OTL-101 product, PEG-ADA ERT will be discontinued at Day+30 (+/-3) after the transplant.

 After their discharge from hospital, the subjects will be seen at regular intervals to review their history, perform examinations and draw blood samples at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24.

 Any medically-indicated interventions will be determined at these visits.

 After Month 24 visit, the subjects will have completed the study and may enter a long term registry.

 Autologous Cryopreserved CD34+ Hematopoietic Cells Transduced With EFS-ADA Lentivirus for ADA SCID@highlight

This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-cohort, longitudinal, single-center, clinical study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-101 (autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells transduced ex vivo with EFS LV encoding for the human ADA gene) administered to ADA-SCID subjects between the ages of 30 days and 17 years of age, who are not eligible for an HLA-matched sibling/family donor and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

 The OTL-101 product will be infused after a minimal interval of at least 24 hours following the completion of reduced intensity conditioning.

 For subjects who have successfully received the OTL-101 product, PEG-ADA ERT will be discontinued at Day+30 (+/-3) after the transplant.

 After their discharge from hospital, the subjects will be seen at regular intervals to review their history, perform examinations and draw blood samples to assess immunity and safety.
