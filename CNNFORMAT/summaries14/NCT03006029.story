(firstQuint)Dose Escalation Study of TAB08 in Patients With Advanced Solid Neoplasms.

 This is an open-label, multi-center, sequential groups, dose escalation study of TAB08 in patients with metastatic or unresectable advanced solid malignancies.

 The study will consist of 2 parts: a dose-escalation part with a standard "3+3" design, followed by a dose-expansion part once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined.

 Patients must have documented recurrent or refractory solid tumors; patients enrolled in the dose-expansion part of the trial must have least one lesion that may qualify as a target lesion based on the RECIST 1.

1 criteria.

 Following the provision of signed informed consent, patients will be screened for entry into the study.
