(thirdQuint)Neural Injury in Adolescents With Concussion.

 Concussion is a highly prevalent condition in adolescence, but it remains a clinical diagnosis that largely relies on subjective patient report with no reliable objective biomarkers for diagnosis.

 Traditional clinical brain imaging has not been found useful for concussion as the pathology is generally not visible on conventional acute MRI or CT.

 The proposed study addresses this gap in concussion diagnosis and management by examining the sensitivity of magnetoencephalography (MEG) for identifying areas of brain injury through detection of abnormal neural activity (slowing) in adolescents with concussion compared to healthy controls.

 Adolescents with a concussion will complete neuroimaging (MEG and MRI) and neuropsychology assessments at two time points within ten days and then again 4 months post-injury.

 Healthy controls will complete neuroimaging and neuropsychology assessments at a single time point.

This study utilizes multimodal brain imaging to obtain quantitative biomarkers of brain injury and to improve understanding of the biological basis of brain pathology in adolescents with concussion.

 Adolescents with a concussion will undergo neuroimaging and neuropsychology assessments acutely and four months after injury.
