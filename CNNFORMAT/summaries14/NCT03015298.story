(firstQuint)Comparing the Diagnostic Role of PET/MRI and of PET/CT Among Patients With Gastric Cancer.

 A prospective comparison of PET/MRI and PET/CT for gastric cancer will be performed,to evaluate the value of PET/MRI in predicting the preoperative staging and resectability of gastric cancer and investigate the role of PET/MRI in gastric cancer diagnosis.

The evaluation parameters are the diagnostic accuracy of gastric cancer staging( including the overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC).
