(thirdQuint)Effect of Intranasal Anti-IgE Antibodies on IgE Production.

 The intranasal challenge study will be performed over 8 weeks outside of the birch pollen season (November to January) as a randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled study.

 During a screening visit, 15 individuals will be recruited according to eligibility criteria.

 They will be randomized into 3 groups (i.

n.

 administration of anti-IgE antibodies, Bet v 1 or placebo).

 Intranasal administration will take place on three consecutive days and serum samples will be taken 3, 5, and 8 weeks (+/- 4 days) after the treatment for analysis of total and specific IgE levels.
