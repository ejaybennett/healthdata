(secondQuint)Kinetics of B-Cell Responses to Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) in Young Children Two Years of Age.

 This is an exploratory study to determine the peripheral antibody secreting cell response during Days 5-13 after immunization with live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV).

 Investigators hoped to enroll 27 healthy children, 2 years of age who had not had any prior LAIV or trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) within the past 2 years.

 Due to low enrollment, the study was halted.

 Due to the limited number of samples, no analysis was performed.

This pilot study will investigate B-cell responses following vaccination with live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in healthy children 2 years of age from blood samples taken at designated time points before and after vaccination.
