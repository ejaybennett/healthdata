(fifthQuint)Atezolizumab in Combination With Entinostat and Bevacizumab in Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.

 This is a Phase l/II, open-label, safety, pharmacodynamics and efficacy study of atezolizumab in combination with entinostat and bevacizumab in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.

 This clinical study will be composed of a Dose Finding Phase (Phase I) and a two-stage Dose Expansion Phase (Phase II) (i.

e.

 Phase II Stage I & Phase II Stage II).

 In Phase 1, patients will be treated with oral entinostat every 7 days, with bevacizumab at the fixed dose of 15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks and with atezolizumab at the fixed dose of 1200 mg IV every 3 weeks.

 Each cycle length is 21 days.

 Three dose levels of entinostat will be tested in 3-patient cohorts according to the 3 + 3 standard design (level 1 = 1 mg, level 2 = 3 mg and level 3 = 5 mg).

 The 5 mg dose represents 50% of the recommended entinostat dose as a single agent.

 For Phase I, the starting dose level of entinostat will be 1 mg PO every 7 days.

 The first dose level will have a minimum of 3 patients treated (unless the first 2 patients experience dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) before the 3rd patient is enrolled.

 DLTs are defined as grade 3 hematological/non hematological toxicities attributable to entinostat and/or bevacizumab and atezolizumab during the first 21 days of the combination treatment.

 If DLTs occur in 1 patient treated at the starting dose level, a minimum of 3 additional patients will be treated at this dose level.

 If DLTs occur in more than 1 patient in the first 6 patients, the study will be terminated.

 If a DLT occurs in 1/6 patient, dose level 1 will be considered the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D).

 If no DLTs occur at the starting dose level 1, 3 additional patients will be treated at the next dose level (level 2).

 If no DLTs occur at the dose level 2, 3 additional patients will be treated at the next dose level (level 3).

 If no DLTs occur at dose level 3, this dose level will be recommended for the Phase II portion of the study.

 Patients who experience grade 3 toxicity and recover to grade 1 (or to pretreatment baseline level toxicity) may continue treatment at the next lower level.

 The Phase II dose will be RP2D of entinostat (i.

e.

, the highest tested dose that is declared safe and tolerable by the Investigators and Sponsor).

 Once the RP2D is identified, the Phase II portion (Simon's two stage design) will be opened.

 During Phase II, the study will have a run-in period with entinostat for one cycle followed by atezolizumab and bevacizumab for the second cycle, and then the combination phase (i.

e.

, atezolizumab + bevacizumab + entinostat for all cycles thereafter).

 The reason for the run-in period during the Phase II is to obtain data on the immunomodulatory effects of entinostat separately from bevacizumab and atezolizumab.

 In Phase II Stage I, 32 patients with prior treatments will be enrolled in two - Phase II cohorts: 18 treatment naive (anti-PD1 naive) patients (Cohort A) and 14 anti-PD1 resistant (defined as patients who have been on PD1 inhibitors for at least 6 months and have progressed by either clinical or radiographic assessment) patients (Cohort B).

 If 5 responses are observed in Cohort A, Stage II will be conducted with 15 additional patients.

 Cohort B is a pilot arm which aims to test atezolizumab in anti-PD1 resistant patients.

 If there is no response to atezolizumab, then the RP2D dose of entinostat will be added to the standard dose of atezolizumab.

 If there is a response to atezolizumab, patients will continue to be treated with atezolizumab alone.

 The RP2D is the dose of entinostat, atezolizumab, and bevacizumab in combination chosen for further clinical development.

 Further experience in Phase II may result in a RP2D dose lower than the maximum tolerated dose.

 Objectives: 1.

 Primary Phase I: To assess the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab in combination with entinostat and bevacizumab in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.

 2.

 Primary Phase II: To assess the objective response rate of atezolizumab in combination with entinostat and bevacizumab in anti-PD 1 naive patients and atezolizumab in combination with entinostat in anti-PD 1 resistant patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.

 3.

 Secondary: To assess the objective response rate (Phase I only), progression-free survival and overall survival.

 4.

 Correlative: To characterize PD-L1/2, immune cell subsets, and miRs in tumor and/or blood in correlation with response.

 Atezolizumab in Combination With Entinostat and Bevacizumab in Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma@highlight

This study will assess the immunomodulatory activity of entinostat in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma receiving the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab.

 The overall hypothesis is that entinostat will increase the immune response and anti-tumor effect induced by the PD-L1 inhibition by suppressing Treg function.

 We have chosen renal cell carcinoma that has been reported to respond to PD1/PD-L 1 inhibition.

 The schedule of entinostat is based on our previous experience with this agent.

 Based on our working hypothesis that low dose HDAC inhibitors will have a suppressive function on Tregs but not on T effector cells, the starting dose of entinostat will be 1 mg and will be escalated up to 5 mg rather than the 10 mg dose.

 The combination also with bevacizumab will provide an effective VEGF inhibition that may potentiate the immune response and anti-tumor effect induced by atezolizumab.

 The proposed dose and schedule for atezolizumab and bevacizumab has been shown to be well tolerated in prior Phase/I/II studies and is currently tested in a Phase III randomized study in patients with renal cell carcinoma with sunitinib as a control arm.

 The highest proposed dose level for entinostat (5 mg) represents 50% of the recommended Phase II dose for this compound as a single agent.
