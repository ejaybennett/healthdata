(fifthQuint)A Study of Definitive Therapy to Treat Prostate Cancer After Prostatectomy.

 Adjuvant treatment (month 1 through ~6): All patients will be treated with up to 6 months of androgen deprivation, plus up to 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy.

 Following docetaxel therapy, patients with a PSA response of at least a 50% decrease from baseline, will proceed to maximum consolidative therapy.

 Local consolidation (month 7 though ~11): After completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, the men will be treated with definitive local therapy with adjuvant radiation therapy (RT).

 After definitive local therapy, patients will be treated with consolidative stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the metastatic sites (if present).

 Systemic consolidation: Patients will continue on androgen deprivation for a total of 2 years.

 They will be followed clinically and monitored with serum testosterone and PSA until 2-years after completion of systemic consolidation.

 Androgen blockade will be the same throughout the course of treatment.

 A Study of Definitive Therapy to Treat Prostate Cancer After Prostatectomy@highlight

To assess the safety of treating men with oligometastatic prostate cancer with the following therapy: (1st) Systemic chemo-hormonal therapy with up to 6-months (~24 weeks) of adjuvant androgen deprivation and up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy, (2nd) definitive local tumor control with adjuvant radiation therapy, and (3rd) consolidative stereotactic radiation to oligometastatic lesions.

 The men will receive a total of 2 years of androgen deprivation.

 Androgen blockade will be the same throughout the course of treatment.
