(thirdQuint)Personalized Nutrition Prediction for Metabolic Syndrome Patients, an Open Single-center Study.

 Pre-diabetic and pre-metabolic syndrome patients will be recruited to the study for a period of one year.

 After measurement of individual's parameters changes as blood tests, gut microbiome, urine tests, blood pressure, heart performance, body circumferences, mood and mental status as well as monitoring each individual's food intake - a model to predict individual's body reaction according to lifestyle, eating and activity habits will be built.
