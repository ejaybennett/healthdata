(thirdQuint)Expanded Access Study of Gilteritinib (ASP2215) in Patients With FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase 3 (FLT3) Mutated Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or FLT3-Mutated AML in Complete Remission (CR) With Minimal Residual Disease (MRD).

 This treatment protocol is being conducted while phase 3 ASP2215 studies are ongoing in FLT3-mutated AML subjects.

 Subjects will complete visits on cycle 1 - days 1, 4, 8, 15; cycle 2 - days 1, 15; cycles 3 to 6 - day 1; and day 1 of every 2 cycles thereafter (i.

e.

, cycle 8 day 1, cycle 10 day 1, etc.

) until discontinued from the study.

 Subjects will be provided with study medication until the investigator determines the subject is no longer receiving clinical benefit.

 An end of treatment visit will be performed within 7 days after last dose of investigational product (ASP2215), or prior to initiation of another anticancer therapy, whichever occurs earlier, followed by a 30-day follow-up.

 [Specific to investigational sites in Japan: Study population does not include subjects with FLT3-mutated AML in CRc (CR, CRi, CRp) with MRD.

 Hence, efficacy (MRD response rate and duration of response) data will not be collected for subjects enrolled in Japan.

The purpose of this study is to provide expanded access to ASP2215 for subjects with FLT3-mutated relapsed or refractory AML or FLT3-mutated AML in composite complete remission (CRc) (complete remission [CR], complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi], complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) with MRD without access to comparable or alternative therapy.
