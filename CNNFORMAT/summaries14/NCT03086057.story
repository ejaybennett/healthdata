(secondQuint)Optimizing PrEP Uptake & Adherence Among Male Sex Workers (MSW) Using a 2-stage Randomization Design.

 The "PrEPare for Work" package includes two behavioral intervention components: 1.

 Strengths-based case management for PrEP initiation, and 2.

 Counseling and problem-solving PrEP adherence intervention that addresses individualized barriers to optimal use.

 Stage 1: MSW will be equally randomized to receive either the strengths-based case management or standard of care referral to PrEP clinic.

 Stage 2: Those from stage 1 who initiate PrEP , regardless of stage 1 randomization condition, will then be equally randomized to either the "PrEPare for Work" adherence intervention or standard of care comparison condition.
