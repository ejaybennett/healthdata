(thirdQuint)Study of myMS in Participants With a Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.

 This is a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of a mobile application "myMS cent " to collect active clinical tasks (questionnaires, 6Mapp cent , COGapp cent , VISapp cent ), magnetic resonance imaging information and conduct genome-wide association studies in subjects with multiple sclerosis.

 Participants will be self-referred to this study from different sources; patient advocacy groups, social media tools, clinicaltrials.

gov, and flyers.

 Specific aims of this pilot study are: 1.

 To determine the feasibility and work flow in prospectively collecting surveys, clinical tasks, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) information for up to 200 self-referred adult MS participants, using mobile app myMS cent .

 2.

 To determine the feasibility of using interface between myMS cent and 23andMe(R) DNA Kits and 23andme password protected mobile app platform (GSR Dashboard) in collecting one biological (saliva) sample and distributing the genetic result (using commercially available results only, distributed by 23andme(R)), for up to 200 self-referred adult MS participants.

 This aim is for testing the system interface only.

 23andme(R) has their own independent consent form and IRB coverage for their commercial product.

 3.

 To estimate the percentage of registered participants that will meet eligibility criteria for MS.

 4.

 To estimate the percentage of participants that a) complete all clinical tasks; b) complete all surveys; c) provide genetic information; and d) provide MRI scans.
