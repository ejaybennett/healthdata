(fifthQuint)Phase II Venetoclax, Obinutuzumab and Bendamustine in High Tumor Burden Follicular Lymphoma as Front Line Therapy.

 Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common low grade lymphoma comprising 70% of low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 22% of all cases of NHL.

 The survival rates for patients with indolent NHL remained unchanged from the 1950s through the early 1990s, but recent evidence suggests that outcomes continue to improve.

 High-risk patients with FL, defined as having advanced stage and high tumor burden have significantly shorter progression free survival despite significant advances.

 This is an open-label phase II study of venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab and bendamustine.

 Patients will receive induction therapy with venetoclax, obinutuzumab and bendamustine for six cycles (1 cycle = 28 days).

 There will be a formal, detailed toxicity evaluation after 28 patients complete 3 cycles of treatment.

 Patients who achieve partial response or stable disease will receive therapy with obinutuzumab every 2 months for 12 cycles and venetoclax every month for 24 cycles.

 Patients who achieve a complete response will receive obinutuzumab every 2 months for 12 cycles.

 Patients with progressive disease will not continue onto the maintenance arm.

 Tumor assessments will be performed approximately every 12 weeks during induction and every 6 months during maintenance therapy.

 Mandatory pre-treatment tumor tissue sample (i.

e.

, obtained during a previous procedure or biopsy) will be required for research (if sufficient tissue is available).

 Optional tumor biopsy samples obtained during treatment or post-treatment will also be requested for research.

 Phase II Venetoclax, Obinutuzumab and Bendamustine in High Tumor Burden Follicular Lymphoma as Front Line Therapy@highlight

Patients with high tumor burden, low grade follicular lymphoma that has never been treated, will receive venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab and bendamustine.

 Venetoclax is an oral Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor.

 It targets the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) protein, which supports cancer cell growth and is overexpressed in many patients with follicular lymphoma.

 Venetoclax may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die.

 The purpose of this study is to see whether adding venetoclax to obinutuzumab and bendamustine improves the response (the tumor shrinks or disappears) in patients with follicular lymphoma.
