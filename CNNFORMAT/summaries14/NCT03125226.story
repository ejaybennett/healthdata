(thirdQuint)TracelT Hydrogel in Localizing Bladder Tumors in Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Bladder Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To utilize the TraceIT hydrogel tissue marker in localizing bladder tumors during transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT).

 II.

 To improve identification of gross tumor or tumor bed location in patients receiving chemoradiation treatment for bladder cancers.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To report adverse events surrounding the placement of the TraceIT tissue marker.

 II.

 To calculate the actual dose received by the bladder tumor bed, as delineated by the hydrogel.

 III.

 To compare the dosimetric impact to the tumor bed of daily patient alignment to the pelvic bones, versus alignment to the whole bladder, versus alignment to the hydrogel markers.

 IV.

 To calculate the amount of normal tissue radiation dose decrease achievable without losing tumor coverage, with better tumor targeting with hydrogel placement.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo transurethral resection of bladder tumors and receive TracelT hydrogel via injection.

 Patients undergo standard of care radiation therapy within 8 weeks of TracelT hydrogel placement.

 TracelT Hydrogel in Localizing Bladder Tumors in Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Bladder Cancer@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies how well TracelT hydrogel works in localizing bladder tumors in patients undergoing radiation therapy for bladder cancer.

 TracelT hydrogel marks the location of a bladder tumor and makes it more visible during imaging tests.

 Using TracelT hydrogel tissue marker may help doctors learn more about tumor location and altering radiation dosage for bladder cancer.
