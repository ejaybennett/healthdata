(thirdQuint)Evaluate the Shedding and Immunogencity of Different Formulations of FluMist in Children 24 to <48 Months of Age.

 This randomized, double-blind, multi-center study will enroll approximately 200 children 24 to < 48 months of age.

 Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive two doses of either FluMist quadrivalent 2017-2018, FluMist quadrivalent 2015-2016 formulation, or FluMist trivalent 2015-2016 formulation.

 Subjects will be screened within 30 days prior to randomization.

 Randomization will be stratified according to whether the subject ever received prior influenza vaccination.

 Approximately 50% of the subjects will not have been previously vaccinated.

 All subjects will receive two doses of investigational product on Study Days 1 and 28, and followed for a 28-day follow-up period after each dose.

 Blood and nasal samples will be collected and safety evaluations perfomed.

 The duration of subject participation is approximately 2 to 3 months.

 The study will be conducted during the influenza "off-season" in the US.

 After completion of the study all subjects will be offered and strongly encouraged to receive an inactivated influenza vaccine approved for use in the US for the 2017-2018 influenza season.

 Evaluate the Shedding and Immunogencity of Different Formulations of FluMist in Children 24 to <48 Months of Age@highlight

This study is being conducted to compare the immunogenicity, safety, and viral shedding of a new A/H1N1 strain that will be incorporated into the FluMist quadrivalent formulation for the 2017-2018 influenza season with the previous A/H1N1 strain that was included in the vaccine in the 2015-2016 influenza season.
