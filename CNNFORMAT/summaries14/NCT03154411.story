(fifthQuint)A Microdose Evaluation Study of ABY-029 in Primary Sarcoma.

 The investigators plan to enroll a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 18 adult patients with a diagnosis of primary soft-tissue sarcoma in this open label, single center, clinical trial of ABY-029.

 Two cohorts will be enrolled with a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 12 subjects in Cohort 1 and 6 patients in Cohort 2.

 Cohort 1 will include patients with an EGFR pathology score 1; Cohort 2 will include patients with an EGFR pathology score of 1 and compared to those with EGFR pathology score < 1.

 Quantitative mapping of fluorophore concentration will be correlated with local EGFR concentration and blood vessel density.

 Upon specimen analysis, fluorophore measurements will be taken from normal, marginal tissues (e.

g.

 skeletal muscle, adipose) in addition to the tumor.

 Average EGFR concentration and blood vessel density will be determined for each tumor through histological analysis of sections by routine sarcoma protocol and analysis guided by regional variations in ABY-029 concentration based upon near-infrared scan results.

 The protocol is not a safety study since no physiological effects are expected at microdose levels of ABY-029.

 No diagnostic or therapeutic intent is proposed, and administration of the study drug is not intended to alter the extent of planned tumor resection during the surgical procedure.

 A Microdose Evaluation Study of ABY-029 in Primary Sarcoma@highlight

The primary study objective is to determine if microdoses of ABY-029 (up to 6X) lead to detectable signals (defined as signal-to-noise ratio, SNR 10, with the Odyssey NIR scanner in sampled tissues with an EGFR pathology score 1 based on histological staining and compare SNR to tissues with an EGFR pathology score < 1).

 The secondary study objective is to assess if the spatial patterns of EGFR expression correlate with the tumor targeting of ABY-029 detection by NIR scanner relative to histopathology diagnosis, and other indicators (e.

g.

 proliferation, infiltration, etc.

) as the gold standard, and to measure the molecular uptake and concentration of ABY-029 in resected specimens.
