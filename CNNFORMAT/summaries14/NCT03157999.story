(fifthQuint)Community Assets Supporting Transitions (CAST).

 Implementing transitional care interventions for older adults with depressive symptoms and multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is a pressing concern since older adults with depression face persistent health disparities.

 The Community Assets Supporting Transitions (CAST) research team seeks to address these health inequities, and improve health outcomes in this vulnerable and under-served population by developing and implementing an intervention that will improve patients' self-management ability, support their families and caregivers, and build capacity for primary care and other health and non-health providers to collaborate in delivering home and community services.

 The proposed study builds on our pilot study that evaluated a nurse-led intervention for older adult home care clients with MCC and depressive symptoms and demonstrated that the intervention was feasible and effective in reducing depressive symptoms.

 The overall aim of the study is to improve care transitions in older adults with MCC and depressive symptoms.

 The project will address three research questions: 1.

 What is the effect of a new, nurse-led hospital-to-home transitional care intervention compared to usual care on health outcomes and costs for older adults with MCC and depressive symptoms? 2.

 How is a care transition intervention adapted and implemented in diverse settings? 3.

 What is required to sustain and scale up the intervention? We hypothesize that the intervention will improve health outcomes and reduce use of expensive health services compared to usual care at no additional cost, from a societal perspective.

 Community Assets Supporting Transitions (CAST)@highlight

The aim of this study is to test a support program for older adults with symptoms of depression and other chronic health problems after they are discharged home from hospital.

 The study will be conducted in three communities in Ontario (Sudbury, Burlington, and Hamilton) and the program will be implemented with input from community members.

 The program will be delivered by a Registered Nurse, who will provide support to patients via home visits and telephone calls.

 The nurse's role will involve linking patients and their caregivers with needed services and supports, reviewing medications that the patients are taking, assessing patients' health, building the skills of patients in problem-solving and managing their care, and providing education to patients and their caregivers.
