(thirdQuint)To Test the Effectiveness of a Trained Nurse Led, M-health Enabled Intervention to Control Blood Pressure in India.

 The burden of hypertension is very high in India but the control rates of hypertension are very low.

 One of the important reasons for this is the lack of awareness and the inability of the doctors working in busy out patient settings of public health facilities to care adequately for the patients.

 Hence there is a need for task shifting.

 In this trial a trained nurse care coordinator will be placed in the Community Health Centres (CHCs) and she will be provided with an Electronic Decision Support System (EDSS), in the form of an android application installed on a tablet, to treat hypertension.

 The trial will be carried out in twelve CHCs of Visakhapatnam district in southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.
