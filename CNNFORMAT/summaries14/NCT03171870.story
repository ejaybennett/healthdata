(fifthQuint)Characteristics and Health Related Quality of Life in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.

 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis should be considered in all adult patients with unexplained chronic exertional dyspnea, and commonly presents with cough, bibasilar inspiratory crackles, and finger clubbing.

 High resolution chest computed tomography is an essential component of the diagnostic pathway in Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

 usual interstitial pneumonia is characterized on high resolution chest computed tomography by the presence of reticular opacities, often associated with traction bronchiectasis.

 Patients with interstitial lung disease have poor health-related quality of life.

 However, whether health-related quality of life differs among different subtypes of interstitial lung disease is unclear.

 There is limited research on the health-related quality of life of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients.

 Health-related quality of life deficits should be monitored in clinical practice with Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and considered when investigating new therapies.

 Characteristics and Health Related Quality of Life in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis@highlight

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is defined as a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause, occurring primarily in older adults, limited to the lungs, and associated with the histopathologic and/or radiologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia.

 The definition of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis requires the exclusion of other forms of interstitial pneumonia including other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias and Interstitial lung disease associated with environmental exposure, medication, or systemic disease.

 Prevalence estimates for Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have varied from 2 to 29 cases per 100,000 in the general population IPF should be considered in all adult patients with unexplained chronic exertional dyspnea, and commonly presents with cough, bibasilar inspiratory crackles, and finger clubbing.
