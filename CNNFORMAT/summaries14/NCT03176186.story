(thirdQuint)Xenon for Neuroprotection During Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome in Comatose Survivors of an Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest.

 XePOHCAS: Primary Objective: To evaluate whether there is a difference in functional outcome with xenon 50% and oxygen during targeted temperature management (TTM) compared with similar oxygen content in air during TTM in comatose subjects with sustained restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) within 30 minutes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

 Secondary Objective: To evaluate whether there is a difference in survival with xenon 50% and oxygen during targeted temperature management (TTM) compared with similar oxygen content in air during TTM in comatose subjects with sustained restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) within 30 minutes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

XePOHCAS: Prospective, randomized, multicenter interventional trial in adult subjects with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest comparing treatment with standard-of-care post-cardiac arrest intensive care (which is targeted temperature management [TTM]) to xenon by inhalation plus standard-of-care post-cardiac arrest intensive care (including TTM).
