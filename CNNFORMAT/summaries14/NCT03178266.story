(thirdQuint)Zip Arthroplasty Patient Satisfaction Evaluation.

 Sutures and metal staples are considered standard of care methods for surgical skin closure.

 The Zip(R) Surgical Skin Closure device from ZipLine Medical, Inc.

 (Campbell, CA USA) is a more recent method of skin closure that utilizes skin adhesive and adjustable ratcheting straps to achieve and maintain tension necessary for wound closure and healing.

 The Zip device was designated Class I, 510(k) Exempt by the US FDA in 2010, and the CE Mark was affixed in 2014.

 Limited patient-reported satisfaction data exists for the Zip device as compared to staples and sutures, so this study will attempt to address this need.

 The purpose of the study is to evaluate patient satisfaction of closure method used after knee joint arthroplasty.

 Metal staples and the Zip(R) Surgical Skin Closure device are approved methods in regular use.

 Selection of method is generally based on physician preference.

 This study is to determine what, if any, differences exist in patient satisfaction amongst the two methods.
