(fifthQuint)PolyvasculaR Evaluation for Cognitive Impairment and vaScular Events.

 Atherosclerosis is the most common cardiovascular disease and accounts for the greatest number of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and death.

 Polyvascular lesions with coexistent lesions (especially atherosclerosis) in multiple arterial territories (at least 2 of coronary, cerebral, lower extremity arteries), could be associated with higher risk of future cardio-/cerebrovascular diseases.

 However, previous studies either roughly defined polyvascular diseases according to established clinically recognized arterial diseases in multiple arterial territories, or tested multiterritorial subclinical atherosclerosis without tests of intracranial and peripheral arteries.

 Furthermore, recent research also showed that cardiometabolic diseases and cardiovascular risk factors are associated with worse cognitive abilities.

 A thorough evaluation of multiterritorial lesions in whole body used advanced vascular imaging techniques is required to precisely assess the association of polyvascular lesions with future cardio-/cerebrovascular events and cognitive impairment.

 Additionally, Asian population might have higher prevalence of intracranial atherosclerosis than the Caucasian, and intracranial atherosclerosis is the most common cause of ischemic stroke in Asia population.

 However, there are limited data about the prevalence and progression of intracranial atherosclerosis in Chinese population.

 More and more studies have shown that presence and progression of atherosclerotic plaque is not only related to the degree of stenosis, but also with plaque characteristics such as rich lipid core, plaque hemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltration.

 High-resolution magnetic resonance (HR-MRI) can not only show the degree of arterial stenosis, the size of atherosclerotic plaque, but also can analyze the composition of the plaque to assess the stability of the plaque.

 HR-MRI techniques enable early detection of atherosclerosis, characterization of the atherosclerotic composition and burden.

 It is important to estimate the prevalence and progression rate of intracranial atherosclerotic plaque based on HR-MRI and to estimate its traditional and emerging determinants in Chinese population.

 In this study, a total of 2000 subjects aged 50 to 75 years from 2 villages and 1 community in Lishui city, Zhejiang province, China, will be enrolled.

 All the eligible subjects in the selected villages/community will be enrolled based on non-probability cluster sampling.

 All the participants will be interviewed at baseline and follow up for 4 years.

 Data collection at baseline will be performed through face-to-face interviews by trained interviewers (neurologists from participating hospitals) with a standardized protocol.

 Baseline data include demographics, medical history, cardiovascular risk factors, dietary habits, physical activity, lifestyle, medication use, electrocardiogram, vascular imaging tests and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).

 Blood and urine samples will also be collected at baseline to test genetic and metabolomic markers.

 Cardio-/cerebrovascular events, death and medicine use will be collected each year after enrollment.

 A further face-to-face interview will be performed after 4 years to collect plaque progression in intracranial and carotidal arteries using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI), and cognitive impairment using MoCA.

 Baseline vascular imaging tests include high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) sequences in intracranial and carotidal arteries, computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in coronary, aorta, renal, hepatic, pancreatic and iliofemoral arteries, and fundus fluorescein photography (retinal photography) in retinal vessel.

 All MRI scans were performed on 3.

0 T Philips scanners.

 CTA scans were performed on third-generation dual-source Siemens system (SOMATOM Force).

 HR-MRI sequences were performed both at baseline and after 4 years to identify intracranial and carotidal atherosclerotic stenosis and plaque and measure the intracranial and carotidal vessel wall, lumen area, and plaque when present.

 Additionally, heart function will be tested using color Doppler echocardiography, and ankle-brachial index will be tested using Doppler ultrasound.

 These imaging techniques enable early detection of intracranial and extracranial vascular lesions, characterization of the atherosclerotic composition and burden, and monitoring of plaque progression in intracranial and carotidal arteries.

 The protocol of this study was approved by the ethics committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital and Lishui Hospital of Zhejiang University.

 All participants provided written informed consents before entering the study.

 PolyvasculaR Evaluation for Cognitive Impairment and vaScular Events@highlight

The objective of this study is to characterize the prevalence of clinical or subclinical polyvascular lesions and 4-year progression rate of plaque in intracranial and carotidal arteries in a Chinese community population using vascular imaging techniques; to investigate the both traditional and emerging genetic, metabolomic, and environmental risk factors of presence and progression of intracranial and carotidal plaque; and to investigate the association between polyvascular lesions and future risk of cognitive impairment, cardio-/cerebrovascular events and death.
