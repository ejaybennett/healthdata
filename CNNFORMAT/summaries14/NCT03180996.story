 Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a life threatening disease.

 Endovascular repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR) has replaced open surgical repair as the standard of care treatment for most patients.

 Endovascular repair offers several benefits over open surgical repair, including: less invasive procedure, faster recovery, lower morbidity and lower early post-operative mortality.

 The configuration of vascular anatomy is important to the successful placement and subsequent performance of infrarenal EVAR devices.

 In particular aortic neck angulation and length are important for the success of EVAR.

 Challenging necks with an aortic diameter 28 mm, angulation 60, length cent device (Vascutek Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland, UK) has been commercially available since 2010.

 The Fenestrated Anaconda cent device has potential advantages over other FEVAR devices, since it can be repositioned after deployment, has a magnet-assisted limb cannulation, and the device contains less metal, allowing a better view of the radiological markers on the device during intra-operative imaging.

 Additionally, the potential to position fenestrations anywhere in the main body is unrestricted due to the absence of other stent structures.

 This prospective, real world study of the Fenestrated Anaconda cent device will provide insight into both the short and long term clinical outcomes of the device.

 An attempt will be made to identify predictors of success or failure, and this study will help to identify patients that are likely to benefit from repair and improve results.

 The effect of FEVAR on post-operative patient reported quality of life will be assessed.

 In addition, the study will provide insight into the potential decline in renal function after FEVAR, a well-known concern after both EVAR and FEVAR.

This study is a prospective non-interventional, multi-centre study of the Vascutek Fenestrated Anaconda cent system, and is essentially a post-market study.

 The Vascutek Fenestrated Anaconda cent system is a custom made device used for the treatment of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.
