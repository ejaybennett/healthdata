(fifthQuint)Sedation Administration Timing: Intermittent Dosing Reduces Time to Extubation.

 Background: Sedation is a significant component in the comprehensive treatment of a critically ill patient.

 The presence of anxiety and pain can often be left unexpressed, particularly in patients on mechanical ventilation.

 Opioids are primarily used for the treatment of acute pain and sedative agents (i.

e.

 benzodiazepines, propofol) are used to achieve sedation.

 Sedation is required in mechanically ventilated patients, yet the optimal strategy for its management is unclear.

 Daily interruptions of continuous intravenous (IV) sedation (i.

e.

 sedation holiday) have shown to result in a shorter duration of time on mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) stay.

 However, sedative agents have the potential to accumulate despite daily interruptions, leading to drug redistribution from the tissues into the circulation.

 This may delay mental status recovery and cause abrupt agitation despite decreased or discontinued sedatives.

 Therefore, daily sedation holidays do not always result in awakened and communicative patients.

 Optimal management for sedation is necessary to avoid accumulation of drug and prevent sedation-induced delirium.

 According to the guidelines on the sustained use of sedatives and analgesics in the critically ill adult, published by the Society of Critical Care Medicine, maintenance of sedation with intermittent or "as needed" doses of diazepam, lorazepam, or midazolam may be adequate to accomplish the goal of sedation.

 Continuous infusions must be used cautiously due to accumulation of the parent drug and inadvertent over-sedation.

 There are two main clinical trials that studied the use of continuous sedation compared to intermittent sedation in the critical care setting.

 In one study, a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-labeled trial compared intermittent IV lorazepam with continuous infusion midazolam.

 The investigators concluded that intermittent lorazepam and continuous midazolam had similar levels of sedation and anxiolysis as measured by objective hemodynamic and laboratory data, along with patient and nurse scoring systems.

 However, it was determined that higher doses of continuous infusion midazolam were required to obtain adequate sedation and anxiolysis.

 In another prospective, cohort study, mechanically ventilated patients received either continuous or intermittent doses of sedation using a targeted Ramsay Scale of 3.

 Patients in the intermittent group required less hours on mechanical ventilation compared to the continuous IV sedation group, p and that are 0.

05 and 0.

20, respectively.

) Continued Inclusion: Each patient will be assessed on a daily basis by a surgical critical care attending, resident, and pharmacist to determine appropriateness of his/her sedation regimen.

 If a patient continues to require significant additional sedative or narcotic outside the pre-established protocol, the patient may be withdrawn from the study and switched to a continuous infusion at the discretion of the attending physician in conjunction with the clinical pharmacist.

 In addition, a 24-hour on-call support for nurses and residents will be available to provide optimal, intermittent doses.

 At any time the attending critical care physician may remove a patient from the study at their discretion for any reason should it be required.

 Sedation Administration Timing: Intermittent Dosing Reduces Time to Extubation@highlight

SATIRE is a prospective, randomized control trial assessing two methods of administration of intravenous sedation and narcotics in surgical patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

 Many hospitals use a continuous infusion method of administering these medications.

 The investigators hypothesize that intermittent, bolus/sliding-scale based administration will lead to less medication being given and subsequently decrease the amount of time on mechanical ventilation without compromising patient comfort or level of sedation.

 Patients are randomized into a control arm (continuous infusion) and a trial arm (sliding scale hourly bolus) using versed for sedation and fentanyl for pain medication.

 Inclusion criteria are surgical patients requiring mechanical ventilation, including trauma patients, post operative patients, etc.

 Primary end point is total time of mechanical ventilation in each arm.

 Secondary end points are amount of medication given, time in ICU, time to discharge.

 Mortality and adverse events in both arms are recorded and reported to the Institutional Review Board for monitoring.
