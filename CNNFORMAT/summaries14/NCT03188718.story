(firstQuint)WatchPAT Device Validation Study Compared to Polysomnography.

 This is an investigator-initiated validation study for the WatchPAT 200 device compared to the gold standard polysomnography procedure (sleep study).

 To evaluate the accuracy of the WatchPAT device compared to an in-laboratory Polysomnogram (PSG), measurements including obstructive apnea hypopnea index (OAHI), apnea hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and other relevant sleep parameteres and indices will be compared.

 Ultimately, the diagnostic agreement of the WatchPAT device in detecting between normal sleep and mild sleep apnea architecture will be assessed.
