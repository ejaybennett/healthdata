 Educational Intervention in Increasing Knowledge About Prostate Cancer in High-Risk Neighborhoods@highlight

This clinical trial studies how well an educational intervention works in increasing knowledge about prostate cancer in high-risk neighborhoods.

 Learning about prostate cancer and the pros and cons of screening for prostate cancer may increase knowledge about prostate cancer while decreasing anxiety and concerns about prostate cancer screening.
