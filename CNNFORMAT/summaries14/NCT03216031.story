(fifthQuint)Project Grow: Establishing an Intergenerational Falls Prevention Gardening Programme.

 The key purpose of the study is to provide and test an intergenerational gardening project as a choice for about 30 IF & BHS patients who would otherwise decline exercise interventions.

 Patients previously assessed by Wandsworth Integrated Falls & Bone Health Services have identified gardening as an enjoyable alternative to exercise classes.

 Gardening sessions will take place weekly (aiming for 3 groups with 10 patients and 2-4 students and/or staff members of the University of Roehampton).

 Through engaging patients in gardening activities the study seeks to achieve 4 main aims: 1.

 Increase physical activity levels; 2.

 improve mental and physical health outcomes; 3.

 foster self-efficacy and social connectedness; 4.

 reduce the risk of falls.

 The at falls risk population will benefit by engaging in a meaningful activity (designed and supported by clinicians and aided by students and staff members) which delivers on the core principles of strength, power, balance and coordination.

 Project Grow: Establishing an Intergenerational Falls Prevention Gardening Programme@highlight

Wandsworth Integrated Falls and Bone Health Service (IF & BHS) provides an evidence-based falls prevention exercise programme, but yearly about 500 of 1800 patients decline participation or do not continue to exercise.

 Our study seeks to address this efficiency gap by developing a gardening programme as an alternative to traditional exercise.

 In a preparation period (4/17-5/17) we will explore the special needs of the target population through interviews and create an age appropriate gardening site at "Growhampton", a gardening project run by the University of Roehampton; from 5/17 to 9/17 a falls prevention gardening group will be implemented and evaluated.
