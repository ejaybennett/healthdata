(thirdQuint)Use of Adenosine to Determine the Electrophysiological Mechanism of Premature Ventricular Contractions.

 The cellular mechanism of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) is unknown.

 The investigators have previously observed that 5% of patients in the investigators electrophysiology laboratory with ventricular outflow tract PVCs have inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia that behaves in a manner similar to patients who present clinically with sustained ventricular tachycardia, i.

e.

, sensitive to adenosine and triggered activity.

 This suggests that outflow arrhythmias may be a continuum of a single mechanism.

 To further determine the mechanism of frequent PVCs, the investigators will determine the effects of pharmacologic agents administered prior to catheter ablation.

 The investigators hypothesize that study subjects with ambient PVCs will have the participants PVCs suppressed with exogenous adenosine.

 The information from this study will elucidate the underlying cellular mechanism of this common arrhythmia.

 Such knowledge could potentially lead to developing therapeutic targets.

Unblinded, controlled, non-randomized, mechanistic study to determine whether physiological mechanisms underlying PVC are sensitive to adenosine.

 Twenty subjects undergoing clinically-indicated, standard-of-care cardiac electrophysiology study (EPS) procedure for PVCs will receive adenosine to learn if their arrhythmias are inducible similarly to sustained ventricular tachycardia.
