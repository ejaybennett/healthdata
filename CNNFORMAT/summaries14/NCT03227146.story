(firstQuint)Study With an Autologous Dermo-epidermal Skin Substitute for the Treatment of Burns in Adults.

 This multicentre phase IIb clinical trial will target adult patients with severe burns to elucidate the benefit of a tissue-engineered autologous skin substitute for the patient group with the highest mortality rates.

 Particular emphasis, apart from safety, will be placed on efficacy, including the ratio of covered surface area to harvested surface area and scar quality, in comparison to meshed STSG.
