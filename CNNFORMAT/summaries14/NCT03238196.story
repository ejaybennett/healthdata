(secondQuint)Fulvestrant, Palbociclib and Erdafitinib in ER+/HER2-/FGFR-amplified Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 Primary Objectives cent To determine the safety and tolerability of fulvestrant, palbociclib and erdafitinib in patients with ER+/HER2-/FGFR-amplified MBC.

 Secondary Objectives - To determine the anti-tumor effect of fulvestrant, palbociclib and erdafitinib in patients with ER+/HER2-/FGFR-amplified MBC.

 - Pharmacokinetic assessments of erdafitinib Correlative Objectives - To determine the therapeutic predictive role of FGFR1-4, CCND1-2, CDK4 and CDK6 amplifications, and RB1 and ESR1 mutations on clinical outcome - To determine if the FGFR1 amplification levels is an early surrogate of response - To determine if the cfDNA results at disease progression show new genomic alterations potentially associated with resistance to CDK4/6 and FGFR inhibition - To determine pharmacodynamic biomarkers of FGFR inhibition.

 Fulvestrant, Palbociclib and Erdafitinib in ER+/HER2-/FGFR-amplified Metastatic Breast Cancer@highlight

This is an open-label, multi-institution, phase Ib trial that evaluates the safety and tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity of fulvestrant, palbociclib and erdafitinib in patients with ER+/HER2-/FGFR-amplified metastatic breast cancer.
