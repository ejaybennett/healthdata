(firstQuint)Comparing the Cost Savings Potential of Orogastric Tubes in Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy.

 In this study we are comparing the cost/savings of using a bougie with a one-step suction callibrated system in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.

 We will be looking at OR time and staple usage.

 This study is not affecting the treatment of the patients in any way.

 The surgeons would be using the devices regardless of the study.

 We are simply looking at procedure information after the fact.
