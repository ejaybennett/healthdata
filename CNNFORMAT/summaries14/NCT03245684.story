(fifthQuint)Assisted or Controlled Ventilation in Ards (Ascovent).

 All patients will be treated according to the sedation protocols and standards of care.

 Sedation will be guaranteed by continuous infusion of Propofol 2-4 ml / Kg / h, Remifentanil 0.

 followed by a continuous infusion of 37.

5 mg / h of besylated Cisatracury, will be reserved for patients with P/F 7.

5, the respiratory rate will be progressively reduced to the target pH range.

 FiO2 and The PEEP will be set according to the ARDSnet table (33) After 48 hours, the patient will be randomized through one of the following two groups: Control Mechanical ventilation (CMV): patient's spontaneous activity will be shut done by sedation and/or respiratory muscles paralysis.

 Volume (during volume control) or pressure (during pressure control), PEEP, FiO2 and respiratory rate will be regulated according the ARDSnet protocol (33).

 Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV): patient's spontaneous activity will maintained and sedation will be maintained at a level of Richmond Assessment Sedation Scale (RASS) between -2 and -3.

 The level of pressure support (including PEEP) will be limited to 30 cmH2O; the pressure support level will ensure a tidal volume of 6 ml / Kg ideal body weight.

 PEEP, FiO2 and respiratory rate will be regulated according the ARDSnet protocol (33).

 Assisted or Controlled Ventilation in Ards (Ascovent)@highlight

The present pilot randomized controlled clinical trial will test the hypothesis that in patients with ARDS, fixing ventilator settings to the conventional protective ventilatory strategy (VT 6 ml/kg ideal body weight and Pplat 30 cmH2O, PEEP according the PEEP/FiO2 table), control modes of mechanical ventilation will be associated to a concentration of pulmonary and systemic inflammatory mediators lower than the concentration of inflammatory mediators observed during assisted modes of mechanical ventilation.
