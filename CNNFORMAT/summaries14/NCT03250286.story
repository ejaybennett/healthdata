(fifthQuint)Role of EUS in High Risk of Choledocholithiasis.

 Several studies have shown that EUS testing prior to ERCP may reduce ERCP complications in patients with intermediate-risk choledocholithiasis.

 In other words, this results obtained by not performing ERCP in patients without choledocholith in the EUS examination.

 However, to the best of our knowledge, no prospective study has been conducted on the role of EUS in patients with high risk of choledocholithiasis.

 Therefore, we investigate the role of EUS screening in patients with high risk of choledocholithiasis.

 We compare the negative outcomes (including false negative and procedure-related complications of EUS and ERCP) of the 'EUS-ERCP group' in which ERCP is performed when necessary after the EUS examination and the 'ERCP group' in which ERCP is performed in all patients.

 Role of EUS in High Risk of Choledocholithiasis@highlight

The aim of this study is to demonstrate that patients with high risk of choledocholithiasis who undergo ERCP only for patients with choledocholith in the EUS examination[EUS-ERCP group] have less negative outcomes (including false-negative results and procedure-related complications) than patients who undergo ERCP in all patients with high risk of choledocholithiasis[ERCP group].

 The primary outcome is the incidence of negative outcomes (including false-negative results and procedure-related complications) in both groups.

 The secondary outcomes included days of hospitalization and diagnostic yield of EUS in the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis.
