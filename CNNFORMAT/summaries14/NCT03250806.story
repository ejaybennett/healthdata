(thirdQuint)Early Detection of Aortic Stenosis in the Community During Flu Vaccination.

 The design plans for two study phases: 1.

 Feasibility study: screening by auscultation and target echocardiography during flu vaccination in a single practice in Birmingham; 2.

 Screening study: multi-centre screening by auscultation or target echocardiography in geographically diverse general practices across the United Kingdom.

 In each phase, the patient will be identified by auscultation and target echocardiography.

 Management and onward referral will be at the clinical discretion of the GP.

 Results of clinical review, investigation, follow-up and management will be recorded at 3 months from that date.

 Early Detection of Aortic Stenosis in the Community During Flu Vaccination@highlight

Prospective cohort study to test the hypothesis that patients identified with severe aortic stenosis are under-diagnosed and under-treated.

 Such patients shall be identified by auscultation or target echocardiography during flu vaccination.

 The hypothesis is that this will increase detection of aortic stenosis in the community.
