(fifthQuint)REVERSE-AKI Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial.

 Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in the critically ill and associates with adverse outcomes.

 Patients with AKI are frequently have low urine output and are at high risk of developing fluid overload.

 Fluid overload has been associated with an increased risk for mortality in such patients.

 Previous trials in critically ill patients found that a 'restrictive fluid therapy' after resuscitation was safe.

 Implementing a restrictive fluid therapy approach in patients with AKI may also be of benefit.

 To date, however, no randomized trial has been performed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of implementing a 'restrictive fluid therapy' approach compared to standard fluid therapy in patients with AKI.

 In this pilot randomized controlled trial we will evaluate the implementation of a fluid restrictive approach, compared to standard therapy, in adult critically ill patients with acute kidney injury.

 REVERSE-AKI Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial@highlight

Observational studies among patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) have shown an association with fluid accumulation and increased mortality.

 Trials among other subgroups of critically ill patients have demonstrated that restricting fluid input after the initial resuscitation appears safe.

 The objective if this study is to determine whether a fluid restrictive treatment regimen will lead to a lower cumulative fluid balance at 72 hours from randomization in critically ill patients with AKI and whether this approach is safe and feasible.
