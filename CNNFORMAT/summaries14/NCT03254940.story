(thirdQuint)Charge: A Text Messaging-based Weight Loss Intervention.

 Standalone text messaging-based weight loss treatments are scalable and can achieve population reach.

 However, these interventions are also modular; they can be delivered independently to maximize cost-effectiveness or combined with other approaches (e.

g.

 provider counseling) to maximize outcomes.

 This study is a 12-month experimental trial among 448 adults with obesity.

 All participants will receive a core 6-month weight loss texting intervention that includes tailored behavior change goals, interactive self-monitoring, automated feedback, and skills training.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 32 different experimental conditions.

 This study will place participants to 1 of 32 experimental conditions that reflect different texting components and levels.

 Participants will be randomized to a condition.

 The investigators will recruit 448 adults into a 6-month weight loss program, with an additional follow-up 6-months after the intervention ends.
