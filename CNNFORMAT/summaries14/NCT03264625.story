(fifthQuint)The Effects of Oral Vitamin D Supplementation on the Prevention of Peritoneal Dialysis-related Peritonitis.

 Patients will be screened for eligibility one month after the onset of PD-related peritonitis, those who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in this study.

 All consenting participants will be randomized into the vitamin D treatment group or the control group, general information and baseline biochemistry data would be collected.

 Patients in the treatment group will be treated with oral Cholecalciferol (2000IU/day) apart from routine treatment for PD.

 Those in the control group will receive routine treatment for PD.

 Both groups will be followed for 24 months.

 During the observational period, any onset of subsequent peritonitis will be recorded, serum 25(OH)D, biochemical indices will be measured every 3 months.

 Follow up would take place frequently, any outcome events would be recorded.

 Aims and hypotheses: Aim 1: To examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk for peritonitis among patients on peritoneal dialysis.

 Hypothesis 1: Exposure to oral administration of vitamin D3 will reduce the risk of subsequent peritoneal dialysis.

 Aim 2: To explore the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prognosis of peritonitis Hypothesis 2: Exposure to oral administration of vitamin D3 will improve the prognosis of subsequent PD related peritonitis.

 The Effects of Oral Vitamin D Supplementation on the Prevention of Peritoneal Dialysis-related Peritonitis@highlight

This is a pilot randomized, controlled trial of Vitamin D supplementation in patients on peritoneal dialysis and to explore if oral administration of vitamin D3 could reduce the risk of subsequent Peritoneal dialysis-related (PD-related) peritonitis and improve the prognosis of peritonitis Aims of the study are to: 1.

 To examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk for peritonitis among patients on peritoneal dialysis.

 2.

 To explore the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prognosis of peritonitis.
