(thirdQuint)Photodynamic Therapy in Treating Patients With Refractory Mycosis Fungoides.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in refractory tumors and plaques of mycosis fungoides (MF).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the effects of sequential PDT and radiation therapy (RT).

 II.

 To determine the side effect profile of PDT in MF.

 EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the quality of life during and after treatment.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride topically and undergo photodynamic therapy on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Beginning at week 24, patients undergo radiation therapy daily for 4 weeks.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 8 weeks.

 Photodynamic Therapy in Treating Patients With Refractory Mycosis Fungoides@highlight

This pilot phase II trial studies how well photodynamic therapy works in treating patients with mycosis fungoides that does not respond to treatment.

 Photodynamic therapy uses a drug, such as aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, that becomes active when it is exposed to light.

 The activated drug may kill cancer cells.
