(firstQuint)Functional Resistance Training to Improve Knee Function After ACL Reconstruction.

 Profound quadriceps weakness is ubiquitous after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, and current rehabilitation approaches are not successful in optimizing quadriceps strength and knee function even years after the surgery.

 We hypothesize that suboptimal strength and functional outcomes after ACL surgery are due to the lack of task-specific exercise elements during strength training.

 This application seeks to assess whether progressive functional resistance training during gait will significantly improve quadriceps function, neural excitability, and knee mechanics during gait.

 The proposed studies will not only lay the foundation for a novel training paradigm, but will also improve our understanding of the mechanisms mediating neuromuscular and biomechanical changes after functional resistance training.

The purpose of this study is to examine if thigh muscle weakness and the lack of muscle activation that accompanies ACL injury and reconstruction can be improved with functional resistance training.
