(thirdQuint)Biomarkers of Broccoli Intake: A Pilot Study.

 Consumption of Brassica vegetables is inversely associated with incidence of several cancers, including cancer of the lung, stomach, liver, colon, rectum, breast, endometrium, and ovaries.

 Brassicas are a good source of many nutrients, but the unique characteristic of Brassicas is their rich content of glucosinolates.

 Breakdown products of indole glucosinolates in Brassica vegetables show promise for reducing the risk of cancer, but have received comparatively less research attention than those of aliphatic glucosinolates.

 The aim of this study is to investigate plasma and urinary metabolites of indole glucosinolates from broccoli and to identify novel metabolites that may have roles in reducing cancer risk.

The objectives of the study are 1) to characterize plasma and urinary metabolites that originate from glucobrassicin, 1-methoxyglucobrassicin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin, and 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, which are the major indole glucosinolates found in broccoli, and 2) to identify novel plasma and urinary metabolites following broccoli consumption that may have roles in reducing the risk of cancer.
