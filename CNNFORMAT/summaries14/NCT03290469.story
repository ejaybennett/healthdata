(thirdQuint)NICUSeq: A Trial to Evaluate the Clinical Utility of Human Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Compared to Standard of Care in Acute Care Neonates and Infants.

 This is a prospective, multi-site, randomized study to evaluate the clinical utility of cWGS in each proband.

 Throughout this study, each proband will receive SOC testing as determined by the site clinical team.

 Upon enrollment in the study, each proband will be randomly assigned to the 15 day cWGS group or the SOC group.

 SOC is defined as the management of the proband's care under the same or similar conditions as if the proband was not enrolled in this study.

 A blood sample from each enrolled proband will be collected and shipped to the Illumina Clinical Services Laboratory ("ICSL"), which is Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified and College of American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited.

 ICSL will conduct cWGS testing with the TruGenome Undiagnosed Disease Test ("TruGenome Test").

 The TruGenome Test cWGS results will be provided to the Principal Investigator (PI) or designee who will evaluate each proband test outcome based on the aggregate medical information, informed by the cWGS or SOC results.

Prospective, multi-site, study to evaluate the clinical utility of cWGS in a proband.

 One group will receive cWGS and a clinical report approximately 15 days after blood samples are received, while the other group will continue to receive standard of care until Day 60.

 The standard of care group will receive cWGS and a clinical report at Day 60 as part of secondary and tertiary analyses.

 Both groups will be followed for a total of 90 days.
