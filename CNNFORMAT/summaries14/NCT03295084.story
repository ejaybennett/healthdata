(thirdQuint)Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Oral Tablet of Irinotecan in Adult Patients With Solid Tumors.

 The study is a phase I, open-label, dose escalation single center study in patients with solid tumors.

 The study will investigate safety, tolerability and Maximal Tolerated Dose as primary end-points of an irinotecan tablet given as single agent or in combination with oral capecitabine.

 Secondary end-points are pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor response.

 Cohorts of 3 patients will be treated on selected dose level with oral irinotecan in order to identify Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD).

 Totally 12 subjects will be treated at the MTD level.

 Patients will receive irinotecan tablets once daily in the morning for 14 consecutive days within 3 week treatment cycles.

 As an extension trial totally 12 subjects will be treated with oral irinotecan in combination with oral capecitabine.

 Patients treated in combination therapy will receive irinotecan tablets once daily in the morning for 14 consecutive days in combination with capecitabine dosed twice daily for 14 consecutive days within 3 week treatment cycles.

 Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Oral Tablet of Irinotecan in Adult Patients With Solid Tumors@highlight

This study evaluates the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral administration of irinotecan in adult patients.

 Oral irinotecan will be administered as monotherapy in a dose escalation trial to establish the Maximal Tolerated Dose.

 Totally 25 patients will be treated with irinotecan tablets as mono-therapy.

 As an extension trial 12 patients will be treated with oral irinotecan in combination with oral capecitabine
