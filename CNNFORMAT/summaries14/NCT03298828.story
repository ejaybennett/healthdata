(secondQuint)CD19 CAR and PD-1 Knockout Engineered T Cells for CD19 Positive Malignant B-cell Derived Leukemia and Lymphoma.

 This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product named CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells (CD19 CAR and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells) in children and adults (age <70 years) with high risk, relapsed CD19+ haematological malignancies (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Burkitt's lymphoma).

 Following informed consent and registration to the trial, patients will undergo an unstimulated leukapheresis for the generation of the CD19 CAR T-cells.

 Patients will receive the CD19 CAR and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

 The study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of the CD19 CAR and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells in children with high risk relapsed CD19+ malignancies.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and blood kinetics of autologous T cells genetically modified to express CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor and PD-1 knockout engineered T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Leukaemia.
