(firstQuint)Feasibility Study of ExAblate Thalamotomy for Treatment of Chronic Trigeminal Neuropathic Pain.

 This study is to show that for patients with treatment-refractory chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain, ExAblate Neuro focused ultrasound (FUS) can safely create lesions bilaterally in the thalamic nuclei to reduce pain and provide functional benefits in daily activities.

 After informed consent and screening, eligible subjects will be randomized to either an ExAblate treatment or a Sham Control procedure.

 Subjects who are randomized to Sham Control will undergo the same procedure and follow-up visits through their Month 3 visit.

 After the Month 3 assessments are complete, all subjects will be un-blinded and those in the Sham treated group will have the option for an actual ExAblate treatment in an un-blinded fashion, as long as they still qualify for ExAblate treatment.
