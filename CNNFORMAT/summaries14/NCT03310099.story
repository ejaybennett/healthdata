(thirdQuint)Unsaturated Fatty Acids Enriched-diet to Improve Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Metabolic Flexibility and Glucose Tolerance in Obese Patients.

 Twelve obese HFpEF subjects with exercise intolerance (reduce cardiorespiratory fitness measured at maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test [CPX]) will be assigned to a single-arm open-label dietary intervention in which subjects are encouraged and financially supported to increase daily UFA consumption.

 The investigators will measure dietary compliance with a validated 24-hour dietary recall and with objective operator-independent biomarkers of UFA consumption.

 The investigators will also measure the effects of UFA supplementation on: metabolic flexibility, glucose tolerance and body composition.

 Participants will have the option to participate in overnight session in the whole indirect calorimeter room (WIC) at baseline and at the end of the study.

 Unsaturated Fatty Acids Enriched-diet to Improve Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Metabolic Flexibility and Glucose Tolerance in Obese Patients@highlight

The investigators hypothesize that a dietary intervention aimed at increasing unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) consumption is feasible and has the potential to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, metabolic flexibility and glucose tolerance in symptomatic obese heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) patients.
