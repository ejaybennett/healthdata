(thirdQuint)Correlation of Genetic Polymorphisms and Clinical Parameters With the Complexity of Coronary Artery Disease.

 This study focus on the prediction of future risk of cardiovascular events, assessing the severity and complexity of coronary artery disease by incorporating genetic information into the SYNTAX score and providing personalized therapeutic guidance to patients.

 The ultimate goal of the study would be to identify, design and develop a panel of genetic markers that in combination with clinical and angiographic information will be a reliable tool for predicting cardiovascular risk for future adverse events.

 Clinical and genetic patient information are systematically collected in a fashion that will enable also retrospective evaluation.

 Correlation of Genetic Polymorphisms and Clinical Parameters With the Complexity of Coronary Artery Disease@highlight

The purpose of the research project is to investigate the potential association of 6 genetic polymorphisms with the complexity and the severity of coronary artery disease (SYNTAX score).

 The aim of the study is to combine genetic, clinical and laboratory data in order to create a prognostic tool that will enable an individualized therapeutic patient approach.
