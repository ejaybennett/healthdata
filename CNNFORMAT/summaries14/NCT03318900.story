(fifthQuint)T Cell Immunotherapy for Advanced Ovarian Cancer.

 Treatment Part 1, All cohorts have leukapheresis.

 Treatment Part 2, Cohort 1 Study Drug Administration: If found to be eligible to take part in this study, participants will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 30-60 minutes on Day -2 (2 days before they receive the CD8+ T cells).

 If the doctor thinks it is needed, they will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects.

 They may ask the study staff for information about how the drug is given and its risks.

 On Day 0, they will receive the CD8+T cells by vein over about 30-60 minutes.

 They will stay in the hospital overnight after the dose to monitor their condition.

 Starting within 6 hours after the CD8+T cell infusion and then 2 times a day after that for 14 days, they will give aldesleukin as an injection into their skin around abdomen.

 They will be taught how to give themselves these injections.

 In order to reduce possible side effects they will take naproxen sodium twice daily beginning the day before their injections and continuing for the 14 days.

 All participants will receive the same dose level of cyclophosphamide, aldesleukin, and CD8+T cells.

 Participants in this cohort will not receive utomilumab.

 Study Visits: On Day -2: - They will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

 This routine blood draw will include a pregnancy test if they can become pregnant.

 To take part in this study, they must not be pregnant.

 On Day 0: - They will have an EKG to check their heart function.

 - They will a have physical exam before the infusion.

 On Days 1, 7, 14, 22, 28, 35, 43, 49, 57, 64, 70, 77, 85, 113, and 141: - They will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 5 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in their body.

 - Between Day 35 and 42 and again between Day 77 and 84, they will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease.

 Treatment Part 2, Cohorts 2-3: Study Drug Administration: If found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to a dose level of utomilumab based on when they join study.

 Up to 3 dose levels of utomilumab will be tested.

 The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level.

 Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.

 This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of utomilumab is found.

 All participants will receive the same dose level of cyclophosphamide, aldesleukin, and CD8+T cells.

 Because they are enrolled in Cohorts 2 and 3, they will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 30-60 minutes on Day -2 (2 days before you receive the CD8+T cells).

 On Day 0, they will receive the CD8+T cells by vein over about 30-60 minutes.

 They will stay in the hospital overnight after the dose to monitor your condition.

 Starting within 6 hours after the CD8+T cell infusion and then 2 times a day after that for 14 days, they will give aldesleukin as an injection into their skin around their abdomen.

 They will be taught how to give themselves these injections.

 On Days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, and 141, they will receive utomilumab by vein over about 90 minutes.

 Study Visits On Day -2: - They will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

 This routine blood draw will include a pregnancy test if they can become pregnant.

 To take part in this study, they must not be pregnant.

 On Day 0: - They will have an EKG to check their heart function.

 - They will have a physical exam before the infusion.

 On Days 1, 7, 14, 22, 28, 35, 43, 49, 57, 64, 70, 77, 85, 113, and 141: - They will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 5 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in their body.

 - Between Day 35 and 42 and again between Day 77 and 84, they will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease.

 On Day 3, blood (about 5 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in their body.

 T Cell Immunotherapy for Advanced Ovarian Cancer@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of anti-CD137 (utomilumab) that can be given in combination with CD8+T cells, IL-2 (aldesleukin), and cyclophosphamide in patients with ovarian cancer.

 The effect of this combination treatment will also be studied.

 This study is divided into 2 parts: leukapheresis and treatment.

 In the leukapheresis part, blood cells will be collected from you to be made into modified CD8+T cells and then they will be given back to you in the treatment part.
