(firstQuint)Histological Analysis of Bellafill Injected Tissue at Various Time Points.

 Visit 1 (day 0): Subjects with pre-planned surgical treatment (mini-abdominoplasty or redundant abdominal tissue removal) will be enrolled and will receive a Bellafill Skin Test.

 Visit 2 (Day 28): Each subject receives treatment with Bellafill into 2 identified rectangular treatment areas within the pre-planned surgical area (0.

1cc injected in the upper dermis and 0.

1cc injected in the deep dermis at the subcutaneous junction).

 Visit 3 (1 Week, 1 Month, or 2 Months; or, 3 Months or 6 Months): The timing of Visit 3 (the final study visit) is dependent on the subject's type of pre-planned surgery.

 Subjects who will undergo abdominoplasty will attend Visit 3 at 1 Week, 1 Month or 2 Months after Visit 2.

 Subjects who will undergo removal of redundant skin (i.

e.

, dog ear) will attend Visit 3 at 3 Months or 6 Months after Visit 2.

 Following surgical removal of Bellafill injection sites, histopathologic analyses will be conducted.
