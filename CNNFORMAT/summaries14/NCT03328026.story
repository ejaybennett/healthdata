(fifthQuint)Rollover Study of SV-BR-1-GM in Combination With Ipilimumab or Pembrolizumab.

 This is an open-label, single arm roll-over study of Study WRI-GEV-007, "A Phase I/IIa Study of SV-BR-1-GM in Metastatic or Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer Patients".

 Those patients who have exhibited disease progression according to iRECIST criteria will be eligible to roll over into this study, at the Investigator's discretion.

 Following discussion with the Sponsor, the Investigator can have the patient treated with one of the following regimens: 1.

 Combination therapy with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA(R), anti-PD-1) - for patients with PD-L1 or PD-L2 positive tumors (defined as at least 1% of tumor cells on biopsy or archival material, or 1% of circulating tumor cells, staining positive for PD-L1 or PD-L2).

 2.

 Combination therapy with ipilimumab (YERVOY(R), anti-CTLA-4) - for patients with PD-L1 and PD-L2 negative tumors (defined as at less than 1% of tumor cells on biopsy or archival material, or 1% of circulating tumor cells, staining positive for PD-L1 or PD-L2).

 The SV-BR-1-GM regimen will be tailored to accommodate the dosing regimen of the immunotherapy, but cannot be more frequent than every 2 weeks, except when approved by the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor.

 After the first year of therapy, consideration should be given to decreasing the frequency of therapy (monthly, every 6 weeks, etc.

) by the PI in consultation with the Sponsor.

 Note that hormonal therapy (e.

g.

, aromatase inhibitors) is permitted if ongoing, but may be added while the patient is on this study only with the Sponsor's approval.

 Patients rolling over from Study WRI-GEV-007 will be screened to assure they fulfill the enrollment criteria.

 Screening must be performed within 30 days of initiating therapy, and imaging studies must be performed within 2 weeks of initiating therapy.

 Patients will be evaluated every 3 weeks during the study, including all safety assessments.

 Imaging studies will be performed every 2-3 months (8 - 12 weeks) during study participation.

 Pharmacodynamic assessments, including evaluation of the immune response to SV-BR-1-GM will also be performed every 3 months.

 Patients who develop progressive disease may remain on the study if the Investigator feels they are deriving clinical benefit.

 For patients who come off the study, a final assessment will be carried out 2-4 weeks following the final treatment, including all safety assessments.

 Subjects will continue to be followed for survival analysis by phone call every 6 months.

 Rollover Study of SV-BR-1-GM in Combination With Ipilimumab or Pembrolizumab@highlight

This is an open-label rollover study of Study WRI-GEV-007, which evaluates SV-BR-1-GM in metastatic or locally recurrent breast cancer patients.

 Patients who demonstrate progressive disease on Study WRI-GEV-007 will be eligible to enroll in this study, which will evaluate SV-BR-1-GM in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) if their tumors express PD-L1 or PD-L2, or in combination with ipilimumab (Yervoy) if their tumors do not express PD-L1 or PD-L2.

 Treatment cycles will be every 3 weeks with evaluations for tumor progression or response every 8-12 weeks.
