(fifthQuint)To Assess Safety and Efficacy of Agents Targeting DNA Damage Repair With Olaparib Versus Olaparib Monotherapy.

.

 This is a prospective, open label, randomised, multi-centre Phase 2 study that will assess the efficacy and safety of olaparib monotherapy versus olaparib in combination with an inhibitor of ATR (AZD6738) and olaparib monotherapy versus olaparib in combination with an inhibitor of WEE1 (AZD1775) in second or third line setting in patients with TNBC prospectively stratified by presence/absence of qualifying tumour mutation in genes involved in the HRR pathway.

 Eligible patients will be randomised by a ratio 1:1:1 to olaparib monotherapy, AZD6738&olaparib or AZD1775&olaparib combinations.

 The actual treatment given to individual patients will be determined by a randomisation scheme that has been loaded into the Interactive Voice Response System/Interactive Web Response System (IVRS/IWRS) database.

 Treatment arms included: Arm 1: olaparib continuous in a 28-day cycle.

 Arm 2: AZD6738 Days 1-7 with olaparib continuous in a 28-day cycle.

 Arm 3: AZD1775 Days 1-3 and 8-10 with olaparib continuous in a 21-day cycle.

 The study subject population will be divided into Stratum A (patients with tumour mutations in, BRCA1 or BRCA2 (Breast cancer susceptible gene mutation (BRCAm)), Stratum B (patients with tumour mutations in any of the other genes involved in the HRR pathway and no mutation in BRCA1 and no mutation in BRCA2), and Stratum C (patients with no detected tumour mutations in any of the HRR genes).

 Within each stratum A, B and C, there will be further stratification by whether the patient received prior platinum-based therapy (yes/no).

 In the olaparib monotherapy treatment arm as well as in the AZD6738+olaparib treatment arm, patients will be administered olaparib bd at 300 mg continually.

 Two (2) 150 mg olaparib tablets will be taken at the same time each day, approximately 12 hours apart with one glass of water (approximately 250 mL).

 In the AZD1775+olaparib treatment arm, patients will be given olaparib 200 mg bd (2 x 100 mg tablets twice a day).

 AZD6738 will be supplied as 20 mg, 80 mg, or 100 mg film coated tablets.

 Patients will be administered AZD6738 od at 160 mg from Day 1 to Day 7 (inclusive) of every 28-day cycle.

 A total of 160 mg of AZD6738 tablets will be taken at the same time on each day of dosing with approximately 250 mL of water.

 AZD1775 will be supplied as capsules containing 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg of drug substance.

 AZD1775 will be taken with approximately 250 mL of water approximately 2 hours before or 2 hours after food.

 Olaparib, AZD6738 and AZD1775 will be provided by AstraZeneca.

 Primary outcome measures (progression free survival [PFS]) will be analysed for the 3 patient populations BRCAm, Non BRCAm HRRm (Homologous Recombination Repair gene mutation) and Non HRRm.

 Secondary outcome measures will be analysed in 2 patient populations HRRm and All for PFS, Objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) will be analysed in all 5 patient populations.

 DoR, and tumour change will be analysed in BRCAm, Non BRCAm HRRm, and Non HRRm patient populations.

 Tumour and germline mutation status, which will be analysed only for the All patient population.

 PK outcome measures, which will be analysed only for the all patient population.

 Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) of radiological imaging data will be carried out using RECIST version 1.

1 and Investigator assessments will also be analysed for sensitivity purposes.

 To Assess Safety and Efficacy of Agents Targeting DNA Damage Repair With Olaparib Versus Olaparib Monotherapy.

@highlight

This study is to assess the efficacy and safety of olaparib monotherapy versus olaparib in combination with an inhibitor of ATR (Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and Rad3-related protein kinase (AZD6738) and olaparib monotherapy versus olaparib in combination with an inhibitor of WEE1 (AZD1775) in second or third line setting in patients with Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) prospectively stratified by presence/absence of qualifying tumour mutation in genes involved in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway.

 Treatment arms are olaparib monotherapy, olaparib+AZD6738 and olaparib+AZD1775.

 The study subject population will be divided into Stratum A, Stratum B, and Stratum C.

 Due to the different schedules of administration of each of the treatment options as well as their different toxicity profiles, the study is not blinded.

 Study has two stage consent process- stage 1 consent (molecular screening for HRR defects) and stage 2 consent (main study).

 Patients with TNBC and with known qualifying BRCAm, non BRCAm HRRm and non HRRm status will be offered the option of consenting to the main part of the study within the 28-day screening period.

 Approximately 450 patients will be randomised (using randomisation ratio 1:1:1) to 3 treatment arms.
