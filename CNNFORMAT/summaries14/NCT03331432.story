(firstQuint)Effects of Dietary Supplement Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid on Vascular Function.

 The notion that cellular stress lowers insulin-induced vasodilation is largely founded on ex vivo studies and experiments in rodents.

 However, it remains unknown if maintenance of cellular function with the use of dietary supplement tauroursodeoxycholic acid enhances vascular function in humans.

 The investigators test the hypothesis that daily administration of this dietary supplement enhances vascular function, particularly, insulin-stimulated leg blood flow and glucose disposal.
