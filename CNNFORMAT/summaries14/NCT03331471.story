(thirdQuint)Alveolar Recruitment Maneuver During Pneumoperitoneum.

 Peumopritoneum might increase the pulmonary dead space and deteriorate the pulmonary mechanics.

 Especially in the eldery, decreased pulmonary function might aggravate negative response to pneumoperitoneum.

 Alveolar recruitment maneuver had been reported of improving arterial oxygenation and pulmonary mechanics.

 Investigator designed this study for comparision of the incidences of pulmonary complications after applying alveolar recruitment maneuver or not during peumoperitoenum for laparoscopic surgery in the elderly patients.
