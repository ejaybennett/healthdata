(secondQuint)Avelumab With Laser Interstitial Therapy for Recurrent Glioblastoma.

 This is an open label, non-randomized Phase I study of intravenous avelumab every 2 weeks to be administered after real-time MRI-guided LITT therapy for patients with a first recurrence of a glioblastoma.

 The primary objective of the study is to characterize the tolerability and safety profile of avelumab in combination with MRI guided LITT administered to patients diagnosed with recurrent GBM.

 Part A, the initial cohort of patients will be treated with intravenous avelumab alone.

 Part B, patients will receive avelumab in combination with MRI-guided LITT to characterize the tolerability and safety of the combined treatment.
