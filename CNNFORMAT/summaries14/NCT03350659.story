 Efficacy and Safety of Midodrine and Atomoxetine for Neurogenic OH@highlight

This was a randomized, open-label clinical trial.

 We will enroll patients with symptomatic neurogenic OH and randomize them to 1 of 2 treatments: (1) midodrine only, (2) atomoxetine only.

 We will follow up patients at 1 and 3 months after treatment.

 If the patients meet BP criteria for OH at 1 month, they will receive combination treatment with both midodrine and atomoxetin.

 The primary outcome measure is amelioration of questionnaire score evaluating OH-associated symptoms at 3 months.

 Secondary end-points were improvement in orthostatic blood pressure (BP) drop at 1 and 3 months.
