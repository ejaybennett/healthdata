(firstQuint)Research of Exenatide for Overweight/Obese PCOS Patients With IGR.

 The investigators designed a randomized control trial to compare the therapeutic effects of exenatide, metformin and their combination for 3 months on reproductive and metabolic improvements of overweight/obese PCOS patients with impaired glucose regulation.

 The investigators plan to enroll 183 patients.

 Overweight and obese PCOS patients with newly diagnosed IGT; PCOS diagnosis is based on 2003 Rotterdam criteria.

 Overweight / obesity diagnostic criteria is based on WHO-WPR.

 IGR diagnostic criteria is based on 1998 WHO diagnostic criteria.

 Serious complications (cardiovascular events and recent significant liver, kidney or lung disease within 3 months); high blood pressure (>160/100mmHg); active infection; secondary diabetes; pregnancy; alcohol abuse; allergic to GLP-1 receptor agonist are excluded.

 Then the investigators plan to randomly divide the 183 patients into 3 groups: exenatide group, metformin group, and combination group, with 61 samples for each group.

 Each group use specific treatment (showed as the group name) for 3 months.

 Before and after the intervention, the blood samples would be collected to glucose, insulin, lipid profile, sex hormones, blood chemistry for liver and kidney function etc.

, as well as the anthropometric measurement and image examinations.

 The investigators will compare the data and finally identify the treatment effect of exenatide on PCOS patients.
