(secondQuint)(RIGHT HEART III Study - Right Ventricular Hemodynamic Evaluation and Response to Treatment).

 In this multi-center, randomized, open pilot study the therapeutic effect of two prarallel groups treated with either Riciguat or Macitentan shall be determined by evaluating the change in systolic and diastolic RV function within 12 weeks after first drug intake in order to plan a larger Phase II study.

The method used to determine the RV function will be the "Conductance Method".
