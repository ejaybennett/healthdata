(fifthQuint)IIaprazole for the Treatment and Prevention of Peptic Ulcer Bleeding in Chinese Patients.

 Patients with endoscopically diagnosed gastric and duodenal ulcer bleeding were randomly assigned into two groups, ilaprazole and omeprazole.

 120 patients were administrated 10 mg ilaprazole daily (at day 1-3) through intravenous infusion within 30min with first dose doubling.

 Since 4th day, those patients were changed to oral administration.

 Other 60 patients were administrated 40 mg omeprazole twice daily (at day 1-3) through intravenous infusion within 30min.

 Since 4th day, those patients were changed to oral administration.

 The efficacy of ilaprazole and omeprazole was evaluated by the primary endpoint including the hemostasis rate (hemostatic groups with endoscopy check ) and re-bleeding rate (bleeding groups with endoscopy check) within 72 hours and secondary end points including effective rate of hemostasis, average blood transfusion, the need to switch to other treatments (endoscopic treatment or surgery, etc.

), hospital stay and re-bleeding rate at day 7, 14 and 30.

 Safety assessments based mainly on the occurrence, frequency, and severity of adverse events, which were monitored throughout the duration of the study, and also based on comprehensive indexes,including physical examination, electrocardiography, and routine laboratory investigations, which were performed at baseline and repeated at the end of the treatment period.

 For all adverse events, where necessary, patients were withdrawn from the study.

This phase II clinical trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of ilaprazole and omeprazole in the treatment and prevention of peptic ulcer bleeding.

 IIaprazole for the Treatment and Prevention of Peptic Ulcer Bleeding in Chinese Patients@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of ilaprazole and omeprazole in the treatment and prevention of peptic ulcer bleeding.

 Patients with endoscopically diagnosed peptic ulcer bleeding were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, parallel and positive-controlled trial.

 They were randomly assigned into two groups, ilaprazole and omeprazole, to be treated for up to 30 days and be seen at day 3, 4, 7, 14 and 30.

 The primary endpoint was the hemostasis rate (hemostatic groups with endoscopy check ) and re-bleeding rate ( bleeding groups with endoscopy check) within 72 hours.

 Secondary end points include effective rate of hemostasis, mean volume of blood transfusion, the length of stay and re-bleeding rate, etc.
