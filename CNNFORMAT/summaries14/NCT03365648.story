(firstQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Lertal as an add-on to Standard Therapy for Allergic Rhinoconjunctivitis in Pediatrics.

 Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (AR) is a common chronic disorder in children, especially in developed countries.

 It is not characterized by nasal symptoms only (such as congestion and sneezing), but may also cause general complaints such as fatigue and cough.

 AR can also have detrimental effects on mood, sleep, social activities and scholastic performance.

 Lertal(R) is a novel nutraceutical containing seed extracts from Perilla Frutescens, Quercetin extracted from Sophora japonica and Vitamin D3, all compounds that have demonstrated their ability to reduce allergy symptoms and the use of anti-allergy drugs in adults.

 The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lertal(R) as an add-on treatment for children affected by allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.
