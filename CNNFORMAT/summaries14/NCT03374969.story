(secondQuint)Differential DNA Methylation as a Function of a Parenting Intervention.

 This study assesses whether a 10-session intervention for maltreating parents effects the epigenome of young children who have experienced early maltreatment.

 Families are randomly assigned to the experimental condition (Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-Up) or a treatment control (Developmental Education for Families).

 Biological samples and behavioral observations of parenting will be collected pre- and post- intervention.

 Biological samples will be used to conduct whole genome analyses of differential DNA methylation that occur as a result of the intervention.

 Behavioral observations of parent-child interactions will be used to assess the efficacy of the intervention in altering parenting behaviors.

 Differential DNA Methylation as a Function of a Parenting Intervention@highlight

The aim of this study is to experimentally assess whether an early parenting intervention for maltreating parents results in differential epigenetic marking of children's genome, particularly of DNA associated with immune system functioning, obesity, and mental health.
