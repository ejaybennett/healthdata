(secondQuint)METIMMOX: Colorectal Cancer METastasis - Shaping Anti-tumor IMMunity by OXaliplatin.

 Hypothesis: Most patients with mCRC harbor tumor that can be transformed into an immunogenic disease by oxaliplatin, and may thereby benefit from the addition of immune-modulating therapy to improve outcome of the current oxaliplatin-based standard-of-care.

 Primary objective: To determine progression-free survival (PFS), in terms of failure of treatment strategy, of sequential treatment with the Nordic FLOX regimen and nivolumab compared with the standard-of-care Nordic FLOX regimen in previously untreated MSS mCRC.

 Secondary objectives: To determine safety and tolerability of sequential treatment with the Nordic FLOX regimen and nivolumab compared with the standard-of-care Nordic FLOX regimen.

 To monitor and compare quality-of-life (QoL) alterations during therapy courses.

 METIMMOX: Colorectal Cancer METastasis - Shaping Anti-tumor IMMunity by OXaliplatin@highlight

This study aims to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the sequential addition of immune-modulating therapy to standard-of-care therapy of microsatellite-stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
