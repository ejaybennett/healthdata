(thirdQuint)Tabelecleucel for Solid Organ Transplant Subjects With EBV+ PTLD After Failure of Rituximab or Rituximab and Chemotherapy.

 This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of tabelecleucel for the treatment of EBV+ PTLD in the setting of SOT after failure of rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy.

 Tabelecleucel cell products will be selected for the subject from a bank of available tabelecleucel cell products based on matching 2 HLA alleles, at least one of which is a restricting HLA allele, shared between the tabelecleucel donor and the subject's EBV+ PTLD.

 Subjects will be enrolled into one of two cohorts based on therapy prior to enrollment: Cohort A, for those who have failed rituximab alone; and Cohort B, for those who have failed rituximab and have also received chemotherapy for the treatment of PTLD.

 Study procedures and product administration will be the same for each cohort.

 Tabelecleucel will be administered in cycles lasting 5 weeks (35 days).

 During each cycle, subjects will receive IV tabelecleucel at a dose of 2*10^6 cells/kg on Days 1, 8, and 15, followed by observation through Day 35.

This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of tabelecleucel for the treatment of Epstein-Barr Virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) in the setting of solid organ transplant (SOT) after failure of rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy.
