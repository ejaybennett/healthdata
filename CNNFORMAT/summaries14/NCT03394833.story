(secondQuint)Hemodynamic Stability During Induction of Anaesthesia.

 40 individuals are enrolled to TCI and RSI groups respectively.

 The randomization process for preoperative fluid bolus prior to induction of anaesthesia is conducted in respective group at the day of surgery.

 Preoperative colloid fluid therapy (6 ml/kg LBW, Gelofusine cent , Fresenius Kabi Ab, Sweden) is infused rapidly before non-invasive baseline blood pressure (NIBP) measurements in twenty individuals in each group.

 No other intravenous fluids before induction of anaesthesia.

 NIBPs, pulse frequency, peripheral saturation (SpO2) are registered and collected 20 minutes post induction.

 Hemodynamic Stability During Induction of Anaesthesia@highlight

The study aim is to investigate if preoperative volume bolus based on lean body weight could preserve mean arterial pressure during target controlled infusion of anaesthesia (TCI) or rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia (RSI) in non-cardiac, non-morbidly obese surgery.
