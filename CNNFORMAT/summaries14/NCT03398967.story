(fifthQuint)A Feasibility and Safety Study of Universal Dual Specificity CD19 and CD20 or CD22 CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy for Relapsed or Refractory Leukemia and Lymphoma.

 1.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: 1.

 To evaluate the feasibility and safety of universal dual specificity CD19 and CD20 or CD22 CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia and lymphoma.

 2.

 To evaluate the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred T cells, and the phenotype of persisting T cells.

 Real Time polymerase chain receptor (RT-PCR) and Flow cytometry(FCM) analysis of PB,BM and lymph node will be used to detect and quantify survival of universal dual specificity CD19 and CD20 or CD22 CAR-T cells over time.

 2.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: 1.

 For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to universal dual specificity CD19 and CD20 or CD22 CAR-T cell infusions.

 2.

 Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD19, and assess correlation with loss of detectable universal dual specificity CD19 and CD20 or CD22 CAR-T cells (loss of engraftment).

 The CAR-T cells will be administered by i.

v.

 injection over 20-30 minutes as a using a "split dose" approach to dosing: 10% on day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on day 2.

 A Feasibility and Safety Study of Universal Dual Specificity CD19 and CD20 or CD22 CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy for Relapsed or Refractory Leukemia and Lymphoma@highlight

CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy has shown promising results for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies; however, a subset of patients relapse due to the loss of CD19 in tumor cells.

 Dual Specificity CD19 and CD20 or CD22 CAR-T cells can recognize and kill the CD19 negative malignant cells through recognition of CD20 or CD22.

 This is a phase 1/2 study designed to determine the safety of the allogenic gene-edited dual specificity CD19 and CD20 or CD22 CAR-T cells and the feasibility of making enough to treat patients with relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies.
