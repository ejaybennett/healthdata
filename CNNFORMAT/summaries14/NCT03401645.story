(secondQuint)Home-based Arm and Hand Exercise to Improve Upper Limb Function After Traumatic Brain Injury.

 Arm and hand dysfunction, although not widely recognized, is a common and devastating consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI).

 Recommendations have been published that encourage clinicians to include upper extremity retraining within the TBI population; however, very little research exists that will help inform treatments for this population.

 There is urgency to broaden the scientific evidence critical to informing upper limb rehabilitation for TBI survivors.

 The proposed study will do just that by using a task-specific visuomotor exercise protocol that emphasizes upper limb movements which can be practiced by patients in their homes.

 This new home-based arm and hand exercise (HAHE) protocol is expected to improve functional recovery and quality of life among individuals with chronic upper limb impairment after moderate-to-severe TBI.

The purpose of this study is to find out whether the Home-based Arm and Hand Exercise (HAHE) program improves functions of the upper limb that is affected after traumatic brain injury.

 HAHE is made up of exercises that simulate real-life tasks.
