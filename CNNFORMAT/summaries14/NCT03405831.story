(thirdQuint)Effect of Ivabradine on Exercise Capacity After Heart Transplantation.

 Elevated resting heart rate (HR) is a normal finding after successful heart transplantation (HTx) due to parasympathetic denervation at the operation.

 Elevated resting HR is generally acknowledged as a negative predictor of outcome in heart disease.

 The impact in heart transplant recipients is not fully understood, however, it has been associated with increased risk of developing cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) or death.

 Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is a diffuse vascular disease affecting the entire coronary tree.

 It is the leading cause of death in patients more than 5 years after HTx and it is well known that patients with CAV have markedly reduced exercise capacity.

 The association between elevated HR and CAV raises the question whether an intervention to specifically lower HR could improve symptoms and prognosis in heart transplant recipients with CAV and elevated resting HR.

 Small studies have shown that HR reduction using the If channel blocker ivabradine after HTx is safe.

 However, none of these studies were randomized or blinded, and as such proof of any efficacy (beyond HR reduction) after HTx is non-existing.

 Clearly, there is a need to determine if such treatment could improve exercise capacity, graft function and prognosis after HTx.

 Effect of Ivabradine on Exercise Capacity After Heart Transplantation@highlight

This study evaluates whether treatment with ivabradine compared to placebo can improve exercise capacity in long-term heart transplant recipients with cardiac allograft vasculopathy and elevated heart rate at rest.

 Patients will receive treatment with either ivabradin or placebo for a period of 12 weeks.
