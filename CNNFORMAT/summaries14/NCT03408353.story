(thirdQuint)Early Detection of Breast Cancer in a Mammography Screening.

 This project aims to enroll 10,000 women presenting for breast cancer screening to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (UT MDACC) Breast Imaging Center to establish a resource composed of biological specimens and a database of clinical and risk factor information that will be used to identify early detection biomarkers in breast cancer.

 Investigators propose the following primary specific aims: 1.

 To establish a longitudinal cohort (n=10,000) of women who undergo mammography screening at the MDACC with follow-up for at least five years for each study participant or until breast cancer diagnosis.

 2.

 To create a repository of blood specimens from the cohort to use for biomarker discovery and validation.

 3.

 To create a comprehensive integrated database of imaging, clinical data, health measurements, and questionnaire data on the study participants.

The goal of this research study is to create a bank of research samples and a database of clinical and risk information from women undergoing routine screening mammograms, for use in future research related to breast cancer, other cancers, and women's health.

 This research study will collect mammogram images, blood samples, and clinical information.
