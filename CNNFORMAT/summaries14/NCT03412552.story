(fifthQuint)Risk Analysis of Intensive Care Mangement on Maternal and Fetal Outcome of Severe Preeclampsia and Eclampsia.

 Laboratory monitoring of patients included serial measurement of complete blood cell count, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and renal function tests.

 ICU management included the following: Control of convulsions by Loading dose of magensium sulphate (4-6g I.

V), given over 20 minutes in 100 ml of dextrose then Maintenance dose (4-6g) magensium sulphate in 500 cc dextrose given over 8 hours using continuous IV drip.

Control of blood pressure if Diastolic blood pressure above 110 mmHg, nifedipine was administered.

 Delivery was performed immediately after hemodynamic stabilization and clinical control of general condition .

Termination of gestation decision was based on the the presence of maternal complications, fetal distress.

After delivery the patient is retrurned to ICU under clinical and careful observation of the following:Heart rate, blood pressure,every 15 min,Temperature and respiratory rate ,evey 4 hours.

 Duration of admission in the ICU was assessed.
