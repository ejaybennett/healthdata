(fifthQuint)Development of Postnatal Mobile Support Application.

 The postnatal period is a different life-cycle that requires compliance with the other members of the the family and mother.

 It requires new role adaptation such as newborn care and motherhood.

 Adapting to this period may not be equally challenging for every mother.

 This term is difficult to cope with for most mothers and causes social and psychological problems.

 The lack of information about the postpartum period makes them feel insecure, while the feeling of insecurity can turn into anxiety and depression afterwards.

 Feeling safe and having adequate knowledge and skills in the postpartum period is very important for maternal and infant health.

 The progress of the technology and the fact that the internet takes place at every stage of our life also causes to confusion in the postnatal period.

 Mothers apply for the information needs of the postpartum period, but the differences and inconsistencies of these sources of information create a sense of insecurity for the mothers.

 It is not easy for them to conduct research in the remaining times of the baby's first month after birth.

 Pre-natal training programs are forgotten or not effective until the end of the birth.

 Even postpartum period can bring new questions together.

 For all these reasons, it has been decided to develop a program to increase the motivation and reach of mothers with accurate and reliable information.

 This study will develop a mobile support application that will support mothers in the postpartum period and will test the effects of application on anxiety and depression symptoms.

 The study will consist of two phases.

 The first phase of the action research (participant design method) method will be developed to provide postpartum mobile support.

 In the second stage, postpartum mobile support will be evaluated for the anxiety and depression symptoms in the mothers after six weeks of use.

 In the first stage, postpartum mobile support application will be designed with the involvement of mothers by the action research method.

 First of all, postnatal adjustment of the information that mothers need will be made based on the literature and the first trial version of mobile support application will be created.

 This pre-created version will be reviewed for use, and deficiencies in terms of content, shape, and ease with a group of mothers.

 Proposals of the participants will be evaluated and updated.

 The postpartum mobile support application will be designed with a feature that allows ask questions directly to the researcher, aiming at being able to be with her anytime.

 The final mobile application will be evaluated in the experiment and control group during the testing phase, which is the second phase of the study.

 Mothers who are in postpartum period will be given detailed information about how to use the application that will be installed on the phones of the mobile support application to those in the experimental group before they leave the hospital and their security feelings, anxiety and depression levels will be evaluated as preliminary tests.

 For this purpose, anxiety and depression scales at postnatal period will be used.

 The mothers in the control group will continue to receive routine maintenance services that will not install applications on their phones.

 Discharged mothers will receive instant information, motivational messages, and ask the investigator if they have any questions with mobile support application for six weeks.

 At the end of six weeks, the mothers will be interviewed again and their anxiety and depression levels will be reevaluated.

 The pre-test post-test results will be analyzed in the experimental and control groups and the effectiveness of the mobile support application will be tested.

 With this study, it was aimed to access of the right information in the early postpartum period at their houses, feel sense of security, prevent the emergence of symptoms of anxiety and depression.

 Since it is not possible for nurses to be with postpartum mothers after birth at any moment in our country so this study will make the follow-up of the mothers easier.

 If the effectiveness of the application is tested, it will be updated later and will be released and published.

 Thus, while the births, infants and mothers's follow-up are provided directly, health problems that may arise in the postnatal period will be detected early and an important result will be obtained in terms of community health.
