(thirdQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Ixazomib in Combination With Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma Initially Treated With an Injection of Proteasome Inhibitor-Based Therapy.

 The drug being tested in this study is called Ixazomib.

 Ixazomib is being tested to treat people who have RRMM.

 This study will look at the effectiveness and safety of IRd in participants with RRMM previously receiving an injectable proteasome inhibitor-based therapy.

 This study consists of two treatment periods, Treatment Period I and Treatment Period II.

 The study will enroll 47 patients.

 All participants will receive following treatment: - Combination therapy with Bortezomib + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone (VRd) or combination therapy with Carfilzomib + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone (KRd), standard recommended dose according to the package insert of each drug, as Treatment Period I, followed by Combination therapy with Ixazomib 4.

0 mg + Lenalidomide 25 mg + Dexamethasone 40 mg (IRd) as Treatment Period II At start of this study, combination therapy of VRd or KRd will be decided by investigator as Treatment Period I after the baseline evaluations.

 After the start of Treatment Period I, a participant's eligibility for Treatment Period II is then determined 3 cycles.

 Participants who meet these eligibility criteria II subsequently continue into Treatment Period II and receive IRd.

 This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan.

 It is anticipated that the treatment phase of this study will last up to 39 months, including 12 months for enrollment, and a 27-month treatment period for the last participant enrolled.

 Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic in treatment period, and follow-up period including a follow-up assessment after last dose of study drug.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of long-term administration of the oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib as part of ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRd) therapy in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) treated initially with an injectable proteasome inhibitor-based therapy.
