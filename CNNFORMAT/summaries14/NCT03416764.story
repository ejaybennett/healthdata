(fifthQuint)Estradiol-mediated Neural Plasticity as Potential Mediator of Neurofeedback Treatment Change for Traumatized Women.

 Women are twice as likely as men to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following trauma.

 Particularly, women with a history of sexual abuse have shown sustained impairment, including difficulties in emotional regulation and poor response to existing treatments.

 Novel, neuroscience-informed treatment such as amygdala-focused, electrical fingerprint based neurofeedback, has shown promise in deficits associated with PTSD, as it trains patients to control activation of amygdala, a major neural system involved in emotional regulation and response, in real time and in a non-invasive manner.

 This treatment has shown results including sustained modulation of limbic circuits and improvement in emotional regulation, suggesting particular promise for women with a history of sexual abuse.

 In recent years, female-specific mechanisms of response to trauma, and particularly the role of estrogens, began receiving research attention.

 Particularly, estrogen-related effects on fear processing have been explored, delineating different processing depending on time in cycle among women with PTSD.

 However, the neural substrates of these patterns, likely to involve limbic circuits, have yet to be tested, and relevance to treatment planning has not been investigated.

The current study aims to explore the relationship between estrogen-related plasticity in limbic circuits and response to amygdala-electrical-fingerprint focused neurofeedback (EFP-NF) among women with a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA).

 Treatment groups will differ by phase of cycle where treatment is given, and effects are expected to differ based on estrogen levels during treatment.

 Greater effects are expected in the high-estrogen phase treated group on both symptoms and neural changes.
