(fifthQuint)GRN-1201 With Pembrolizumab in Subjects With Metastatic PD-L1+ NSCLC.

 This is a non-randomized, Phase 2, 2-cohort, 2-stage, open-label, multi-center study of GRN-1201/sargramostim + pembrolizumab in subjects with metastatic PD-L1+ NSCLC.

 Both first and second line subjects will be enrolled including: - Cohort 1: Subjects with newly diagnosed, metastatic PD-L1+ (TPS 50%) NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, or - Cohort 2: Subjects with metastatic PD-L1+ (TPS 1%) NSCLC with progression on or after first-line platinum-based regimen.

 Subjects with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations with progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations are eligible.

 Each cohort will follow a Simon two-stage design [1] with up to 43 subjects in Cohort 1 and 47 subjects in Cohort 2 for a total of 90 subjects enrolled if both cohorts enroll both stages.

 All subjects will receive GRN-1201 at 3.

0 mg in combination with 75 mu g sargramostim and 200 mg pembrolizumab.

 GRN-1201 is to be administered once weekly for 4 weeks followed by every 3-week dosing for an additional 12 doses (16 total doses of GRN-1201).

 Each dose of GRN-1201 will be given as 1 mL divided into 4 separate 0.

25 mL intradermal injections on each day of treatment.

 Pembrolizumab is to be given every 3 weeks for up to a total of 35 doses.

 This study will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days; a treatment period consisting of GRN-1201/sargramostim administered weekly for 4 weeks (4 doses) followed by administration every 3 weeks for 12 additional doses .

 Pembrolizumab is to be given every 3 weeks for up to a total of 35 doses.
