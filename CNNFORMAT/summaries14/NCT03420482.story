(fifthQuint)Fecal Microbiota Transplant as Treatment of Hepatic Encephalopathy.

 Decades of investigation demonstrate that hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a common complication of cirrhosis characterized by impaired cognition, develops as a consequence of intestinal microbial products reaching the brain.

 Recent investigation has found that cirrhotic patients, especially those who have developed HE, have intestinal dysbiosis compared to normal controls.

 Several plausible mechanisms explain how intestinal dysbiosis could lead to HE.

 There is limited prior literature on the efficacy of FMT in cirrhosis.

 The largest documented study of 10 cirrhotic patients receiving a single FMT enema found no significant change in microbiome diversity as assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing.

 The investigators hypothesize that aggressive manipulation of the microbial composition with fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) will improve neurological function in patients with a history of cirrhosis and HE.

 The investigators additionally hypothesize that five oral FMT capsule administrations from a previously efficacious stool donor will significantly change the intestinal microbiome composition of a cirrhotic patient.

 The study will consist of a 10-patient open-label pilot study to identify efficacious stool donors, defined as donors who precipitate the largest improvement in recipient neurological function and microbiome composition.

 The two most efficacious pilot study stool donors will be selected to donate stool for the randomized controlled trial (RCT).

 The 20-patient RCT will investigate the effect of FMT on neurological outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and a history of HE.

 Subjects will be randomized to receive 5 doses of oral FMT capsules or placebo capsules over 21 days.

 Cognitive testing and stool collections will occur at 4 time points, to assess for changes in neurological function and microbiome composition.

 The primary outcome is change in neurological function after FMT.

 The main secondary outcome is change in microbiome composition after FMT.

 This study could provide valuable information about the ability of FMT to improve intestinal dysbiosis in cirrhosis and treat HE.

 Fecal Microbiota Transplant as Treatment of Hepatic Encephalopathy@highlight

A common complication of advanced liver disease is a condition called hepatic encephalopathy, which leads to confusion.

 The current treatment options cause side effects, are costly, and do not always work.

 An abnormal population of bacteria in the intestines may be causing this condition, and transplanting bacteria from the colon of a healthy person may treat it.

 In this research study, the investigators will first find two healthy stool donors whose stool donation improves the gut bacteria of patients with advanced liver disease and helps them think more clearly.

 Then, in a randomized controlled trial, the investigators will compare the ability of stool donation from these two best donors versus a placebo to improve the neurological function of patients with advanced liver disease.

 If the investigators find the expected results, there will be a new effective therapy for patients with advanced liver disease and the very troublesome complication of hepatic encephalopathy.
