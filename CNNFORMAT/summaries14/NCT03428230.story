(fifthQuint)Intrathecal Paracetamol Before Spinal Anaesthesia With Chloroprocaine HCl 1% for Short Knee Procedures.

 Eligible patients undergoing elective short-duration knee procedures up to 40 min duration will be randomised into 4 treatment groups (15 patients per group) to receive either one of the 3 single doses of Paracetamol 3% (D1: 30 mg, D2: 60 mg, D3: 90 mg) or the placebo solution (P: 0.

9% saline solution) by intrathecal injection (IT), according to the randomised, parallel-group design.

 Immediately after IT paracetamol or placebo administration, all patients will receive a single IT dose of Chloroprocaine HCl 1% (Non-investigational medicinal product, NIMP) according to the Summary of Product Characteristics indications.

 The time interval between paracetamol IT and chloroprocaine IT injections should not exceed 2 min.
