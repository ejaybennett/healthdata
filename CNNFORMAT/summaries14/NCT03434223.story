(firstQuint)Prospective Follow-up of Elderly Patients Undergoing Instrumented Lumbar Arthrodesis Supplemented by the Implanet Jazz System(TM).

 To collect and organize data into a repository from the Principal Investigator's and other Site Investigators' elderly patients (aged 60 years) who are undergoing single, two-level, or three-level lumbar instrumented arthrodesis procedures supplemented by the Implanet Jazz SystemTM at participating centers.

 This device is designed to provide a stable interface between spinal constructs and the rods; it can be secured around vertebral structures (such as the lamina, transverse or spinous processes) from T1 to L5 and is intended to provide temporary stabilization as a bone anchor during the development of a solid body fusion.

 Clinical data will be collected as indicated at 6 weeks, as well as 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post-operatively in the database.
