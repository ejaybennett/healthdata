(fifthQuint)Safety Tolerability DDI Short Course Treatment of LTBI Infection With High-dose Rifapentine Isoniazid in HIV+ Patients.

 Single-arm, single-center, Phase I/II clinical trial, in two Groups.

 Individuals with HIV infection taking EFV and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) who have undetectable HIV viral load and an indication for treatment of LTBI, will be switched to DTG with tenofovir/emtricitabine for at least two months and will receive weekly HP for 12 total doses.

 Individuals who are on an existing DTG-based plus two NRTI ART regimen for at least eight weeks (and have not received efavirenz or nevirapine for at least two months) who have an undetectable HIV viral load may also participate.

 Group 1 (n=30): The first 12 participants (Group 1A) will take dolutegravir 50 mg once daily (with tenofovir/emtricitabine) from Days 1-57.

 Semi-intensive PK sampling for dolutegravir will be performed on Day 57.

 Participants will continue once-daily dolutegravir and will receive once-weekly HP for 12 total doses beginning on Day 58.

 Semi-intensive PK sampling for dolutegravir will be performed on Day 72 (with the 3rd dose of HP) and Day 108 (following the 8th dose of HP).

 Trough concentrations (CT) will be measured on Days 59, 74, and 78.

 VL will be measured at baseline and weeks 11 and 24.

 Safety labs (CBC, U&E and creatinine and liver function tests) will be obtained at baseline, and weeks 9, 11, 13, 16, 20 and 24.

 PK assessments will be performed at weeks 9 and 11 for rifapentine and at week 11 for isoniazid.

 After the 12 Group 1A participants have completed the second semi-intensive PK visit, an interim PK, safety, and VL assessment will be performed to ensure that the 50 mg once daily dose is safe and meets PK targets.

 The subsequent 18 participants in Group 1 (Group 1B) will receive either dolutegravir 50 mg or a higher dose of dolutegravir, if dose adjustment is required (e.

g.

 dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily just on HP dosing days, dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily seven days a week, etc.

) Group 2 (n=30): These participants will receive dolutegravir and HP at the same doses and dose schedule as the participants in Group 1B.

 They will undergo safety assessments at baseline and weeks 9, 11, 13, 16, 20 and 24; HIV VL assessments at baseline and weeks 11 and 24.

 Sparse (trough) PK samples for dolutegravir will be collected on two occasions.

 Safety Tolerability DDI Short Course Treatment of LTBI Infection With High-dose Rifapentine Isoniazid in HIV+ Patients@highlight

Single-arm, two-center, Phase I/II clinical trial assessing the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of once-weekly rifapentine and isoniazid (3HP) for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection among individuals with HIV infection taking dolutegravir-based (DTG) antiretroviral treatment.

 The study population will be individuals with HIV taking DTG and 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors for 4 weeks, who have a suppressed HIV-1 viral load (VL), and are candidates to receive TB preventive therapy.

 Sample size is 60 participants divided into two main groups Group 1 (1A (n=12) and B (n=18)) and Group 2(n=30).

 The first 12 participants (Group 1A) will undergo semi-intensive PK sampling and will be key to determining whether an increased dosing of DTG is required in groups 1B and Group 2 due to accelerated DTG clearance due to 3HP induced drug-drug-interactions.

 Group 1B will receive dolutegravir at the new dose (if applicable) and will also undergo semi-intensive PK sampling.

 The subsequent 30 (Group 2) will receive DTG at the new dose and will only have sparse PK sampling.
