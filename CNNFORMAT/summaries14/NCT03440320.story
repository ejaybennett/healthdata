(fifthQuint)Merging Yoga and Self-Management to Develop Skills.

 The long-term goal of this study is to advance best practices in complementary and integrative health (CIH) to improve health for caregivers and individuals with chronic disabilities.

 This proposal is focused on merging exercise and education to improve pain for individuals in a caregiving dyad.

 The objective of this study is to develop and test the MY-Skills intervention, thus, addressing the critical need for innovative pain interventions focusing on the caregiving dyad.

 To achieve this objective and support a future randomized controlled trial (RCT), the researchers will conduct a mixed-methods study, including a small RCT.

 Aim 1: Develop and manualize the MY-Skills intervention.

 Using focus groups, clinical reasoning, literature, and findings from previously tested interventions of yoga and self-management, the researchers will develop, refine, and standardize the MY-Skills intervention for chronic pain.

 In parallel, the researchers will develop a control group that includes exercise and health and wellness education.

 The expected outcomes include MY-Skills intervention workbooks for participants and training and teaching manuals for interventionists leading the MY-Skills intervention group and control group.

 Aim 2: Assess feasibility and acceptability of MY-Skills and research procedures including planned assessments.

 In this small RCT, the researchers will examine feasibility and acceptability of the 8-week MY-Skills procedures and intervention compared to an exercise and health and wellness education control group.

 Participants will include 30 caregiving dyads randomly assigned to the two groups (15 dyads for My-Skills and 15 dyads for control group; N = 30 dyads/60 participants).

 The primary hypothesis is that MY-Skills will be feasible and acceptable to caregiving dyads, as measured by benchmarks for recruitment, screening, attendance, and completion of assessments and intervention.

 Surveys will be administered and focus groups will be conducted to understand participant satisfaction and experiences with MY-Skills.

 After each intervention session, interventionists, caregivers, and care recipients will rate their satisfaction with the session content and activities.

 To assess change on the primary outcome (pain-related disability) and secondary outcome measures, members of the caregiving dyad will complete pre and post-assessments guided by the Biopsychosocial model.
