(secondQuint)An Efficacy and Safety Study of Palovarotene for the Treatment of MO.

 Multiple osteochondromas is a rare condition where children develop multiple benign cartilage-capped bony tumors called osteochondromas on bones throughout the body, resulting in pain, deformity, limb length discrepancy, disability, and eventually arthritis and possible malignancy.

 The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of two dosage regimens of palovarotene with placebo to prevent the formation of new osteochondromas in pediatric MO subjects with exostosin 1 or exostosin 2 gene mutations.

 Osteochondroma formation will be assessed by whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

 Secondary efficacy objectives are to compare the effect of palovarotene on the volume of osteochondromas as assessed by MRI; and on the annualized rate of new or worsening deformities and MO-related surgeries.

 The overall safety of palovarotene and the effects of palovarotene on linear growth, bone growth plates, bone mineral density, quality of life, and pain due to osteochondromas will also be studied.
