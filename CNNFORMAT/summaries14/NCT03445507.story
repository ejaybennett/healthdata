(fifthQuint)Effectiveness of a Chat Bot for Smoking Cessation: a Pragmatic Trial in Primary Care.

.

 An array of interventions have been shown to be both cost-effective and efficacious in helping patients quit smoking and so are included in usual care given by general practitioners and nurses.

 However, in the primary care setting, this sort of interventions are less common than they should be, due to many circunstances, and solutions must be found due to the huge dimensions of tobacco use challenge.

 On the other hand,new kinds of information tecnology give a chance to intervene with less costs and more specific tools.

 Actually, there are a lot of mobile apps and other devices designed to help people to improve their health in many ways, but without scientific evidence of their effects.

 This is a pragmatic, randomised, controled and multicentric clinical trial that tries to evaluate in general population the effectiveness of a chat bot that incorporates evidence based interventions and interacts by a text application instaled in patients mobile phone (intervention group).

 Investigators have decided to compare with usual care delivered by the usual general practisioners and nurses of Spanish Public Health Centres, because this interventions have shown their effectiveness (control group).

 Efficiency and impact on quality of life will also be compared on both groups.
