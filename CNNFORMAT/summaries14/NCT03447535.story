 Child-to-parent violence was kept secret for a long time.

 Searchers don't know much about this type of domestic violence, however they recently tried to investigate more on the subject.

 Bousquet et al.

 carried out a review of literature on the subject, and grouped the articles that they found.

 There was only one study concerned with children with Intrafamilial Oppositional Defiant Disorder (IODD) which is called in the study Oppositional Defiant Disorder with family tyranny (Delaunay et al.

, 2008).

 IODD is described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM) as a mild form of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD).

 This term characterizes children that meet the criteria for ODD ("a pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness") but their symptoms are confined to only one setting: the home.

 Therefore, the aim of this study is to characterize Intrafamilial ODD children and the particularities of their families.

 Nowadays, new treatment strategies exist in Montpellier, designed to be used as group therapies.

 In these groups, non-violent resistance methods are taught to the parents.

 The efficiency of this therapy is currently being studied.

 To improve this therapy and to offer appropriate therapies to the children themselves, it is important to improve the acknowledgement of these "tyrannical children".

 This is the aim of this study.

 To reach this goal, the investigators will compare the medical records of the children with IODD to those of the children with classic ODD.

 On one hand, they expect children with IODD to be more anxious and smarter than children with "classic" ODD.

 On the other hand, they expect they will have had diseases that changed interactions with their parents.

 They also assume they will come from small families: i.

e.

 they may be an only child, educated by a single parent, or they may have wealthy parents.

 Finally, they hypothesize that clinicians won't treat the children with IODD the same way as those with "classic" ODD.

 Better Understand Children and Adolescents' Intrafamilial Oppositional Defiant Disorder@highlight

Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM 5) as: "A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting at least 6 months exhibited during interaction with at least one individual who is not a sibling.

" "The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in the individual or others in his or her immediate social context (e.

g.

, family, peer group, work colleagues), or it impacts negatively on social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

" Children with "classic" oppositional defiant disorder, except for mild forms, show symptoms in several settings (at home, at school, with peers).

 In this study, the investigators will consider the specifics of children presenting "intrafamilial" oppositional defiant disorder (IODD).

 These children's symptoms are confined to only one setting: the home.

 Therefore, the aim of this study will be to characterize children with intrafamilial oppositional defiant disorder.

 The investigators want to understand the differences between IODD and classical forms of ODD in terms of psychiatric comorbidities, medical histories and cognitive abilities.

 They also investigate what clinicians currently do to help these families.
