(secondQuint)Diet-Induced Variability in Appetite (DIVA).

 This is a proof of concept randomized controlled trial in which overweight/obese females will be randomised to a dietary weight loss intervention (ADF or CR) to achieve 5% WL.

 Behavioural measures of appetite control including ad libitum intake after a fixed meal, body composition, resting metabolic rate, measured physical activity and daily energy expenditure, sleep quality, energy balance regulating hormones, hedonic food reward and eating behaviour traits will be assessed before, during and after the WL intervention in those who reach the target weight loss within 12 weeks.

 After weight loss phase, participants will be given standard healthy eating and physical activity advice for weight maintenance and body weight will be followed up after weight loss at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.

The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that dietary weight loss (WL) through alternate day fasting (ADF) will enhance appetite control, health markers and wellbeing following WL compared to standard daily calorie restriction (CR).
