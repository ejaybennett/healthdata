(fifthQuint)Evaluating a Novel Web-based Intervention for Breast Cancer Survivors.

 Depression and fatigue is common in breast cancer survivors and its presence is associated with personal suffering, increased inflammatory activity, and worse prognosis.

 While in the phase of acute treatment many women receive short-term psychological support to better cope with the situation, this is not standard of care in the years following.

 Web-based psychological interventions are easily accessible and preliminary evidence suggests that such interventions can be effective.

 However, no trial has yet examined whether a CBT-based internet intervention designed to meet the needs of breast cancer survivors can achieve effects on immune status, inflammation and psychometric outcomes, when offered as adjunct to care as usual.

 In this study, the investigators will study treatment effects of the novel web-based program Optimune when added to treatment as usual.

 Beyond established CBT techniques targeting depression, anxiety, and fatigue, this intervention specifically includes elements that have shown effects on markers of immune status and inflammation, including sleep and stress management (e.

g.

, mindfulness-based techniques) and lifestyle optimization (dietary and physical activity advice).

 The delivery and training of content is continuously individualized to match users' preferences and needs, based on responses within the program.

 The intervention is delivered via the internet and protected by individually assigned passwords.

 The program can be accessed for 365 days after registration.

 This randomized controlled trial will include 150 women with breast cancer who are past the active eradication phase and free from disease recurrence.

 Participants will be recruited from various settings, including web-based advertisement and internet forums/groups.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to either (1) a control group, in which they receive care as usual (CAU) and are given access to the web-based intervention (Optimune) after a delay of 6 months (i.

e.

, CAU/wait list control group), or (2) a treatment group that may also use CAU and in addition immediately receives 12-month access to the web-based intervention (Optimune).

 Measurements are collected at pre-treatment (T0) three months (T1), six months (T2), nine months (T3) and twelve months (T4).

 Evaluating a Novel Web-based Intervention for Breast Cancer Survivors@highlight

The trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel web-based intervention (Optimune), which was designed to introduce relevant cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to women with breast cancer who are past the active eradication phase and free from disease recurrence.

 The present study will test the hypothesis that Optimune has an impact on immune status, markers of inflammation and psychometric outcomes.

 Therefore, 150 woman with breast cancer will be recruited and randomized to two groups: (1) a control group, in which they may engage with any treatment (Care-as-Usual, CAU) and receive access to Optimune after a delay of 6 months (i.

e.

, CAU/wait list control group), or (2) to a treatment group that immediately receives 12-month access to Optimune and may also use CAU.

 The primary outcome measure is the effect on inflammatory parameters six month post-baseline.
