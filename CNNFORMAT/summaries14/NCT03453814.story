(secondQuint)Music Intervention for Agitation Reduction in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.

 This study is a prospective randomized controlled study to observe patients who have been admitted to the PICU with an altered state of agitation according to the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS).

 These patients will be administered music therapy during a controlled setting in the day to observe whether the introduction of music therapy helps reduce the patient's level of agitation, improving their vital signs and overall recovery in the unit.

 Once patients are enrolled and have signed consents, patients will receive a headset with music or dead air.

 Therapy times will be selected so that there are minimal disruptions.

 Total time will be 2 hours daily, once in the morning and once in the evening.

 The treatments for session 1 and session 2 of the day will be the same (i.

e.

 Music/ Music, No music/No Music).

 The investigators hypothesize that applying music therapy in the PICU will decrease agitation, length of stay, and narcotic administration, and normalize heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure.
