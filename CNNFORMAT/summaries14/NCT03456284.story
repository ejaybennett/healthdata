(fifthQuint)Safety and Feasibility of Normothermic Machine Perfusion to Rescue Orphan Livers.

 This will be a single center prospective cohort pilot study.

 19 livers that have been declined for clinical use by all centers due to their marginality will be preserved with NMP in 2-18 hours after cross clamp and cold flush.

 The liver grafts at NMP will be at Physiological temperature and have oxygen and nutrient supply with continuous perfusion.

Once the liver grafts have been evaluated and determined to be transplantable ,the transplantation and post-transplant care will follow the standard of care.

 The follow-up period is 12 months after transplantation.

 The primary end point will be the rate of post-transplant Early Allograft Dysfunction (EAD), while the secondary end points will be: primary non function (PNF) rate, 1 and 6 months patient and graft survival, peak liver function tests in the first 7 days after transplantation, intraoperative hepatic arterial and portal flow measurement, rate and magnitude of post-reperfusion syndrome, surgical outcomes (operative time, transfusion requirement etc.

), rate of post-transplant kidney failure, assessment of histological ischemia reperfusion (liver and bile duct), rate of vascular complications, rate of biliary complications, hospital and ICU length of stay, rejection rate, infection rate, the ability to predict function based on "on-pump" viability markers, and the incidence of adverse effect (AE).

 The outcome will be compared to a control group of 38 historical patients (matched with a 1:2 ratio) transplanted in our program in the past 10 years (liver preserved using CS).

 Control subjects will be matched using donor and recipient age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, cold ischemia time, donor risk index and presence of steatosis.

 Safety and Feasibility of Normothermic Machine Perfusion to Rescue Orphan Livers@highlight

Orphan livers are organs that have been declined for clinical use by all centers due to their marginality.

 The current standard of care of liver preservation before transplant is cold storage.

 NMP may allow these livers to be evaluated before transplantation.

 NMP has already been used in a clinical setting with promising results.

The advantage to utilizing NMP is that it would attenuate the incidence and clinical impact of classical preservation injury, reduce EAD and other complications, allow liver function assessment before implantation and thus improve outcomes for high risk ECD liver transplants performed at our center.
