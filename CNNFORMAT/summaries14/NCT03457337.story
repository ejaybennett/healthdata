(secondQuint)S-1 Plus Gefitinib Versus Gefitinib Monotherapy in Patients With EGFR-sensitive Mutation Advanced Non-squamous NSCLC.

 This is a randomized, controlled, open-plan, prospective clinical study.

 According to the available evidence, we selected patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with stage III-C-IV confirmed by cytology or histology and positive EGFR-sensitive mutation, then patients accept first-line treatment with S-1 plus gefitinib or gefitinib.

 This study will collect FFS during treatment until the patient dies and will follow the survival of the subject after the disease progresses.
