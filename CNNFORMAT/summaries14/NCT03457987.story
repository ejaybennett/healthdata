(secondQuint)Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery.

 Although acute kidney injury (AKI) frequently complicates cardiac surgery, methods to determine AKI risk in patients without underlying kidney disease are lacking.

 Renal functional reserve (RFR) can be used to measure the capacity of the kidney to increase glomerular filtration rate under conditions of physiological stress and may serve as a functional marker that assesses susceptibility to injury.

 The investigators seek to determine whether preoperative RFR predicts postoperative AKI in patients with normal resting glomerular filtration rates undergoing elective cardiac surgery.
