(fifthQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of Mesenchymal Stem Cell in Treating Liver Fibrosis.

 Fibrosis of the liver is excessive accumulation of scar tissue that results from ongoing inflammation and liver cell death that occurs in most types of chronic liver diseases.

 Nodules, abnormal spherical areas of cells, form as dying liver cells are replaced by regenerating cells.

 This regeneration of cells causes the liver to become hard.

 Fibrosis refers to the accumulation of tough, fibrous scar tissue in the liver.

 The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed.

 In particular, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases such as graft-vesus-host disease (GVHD), liver injury and displayed good tolerance and efficiency.

 The purpose of this study is to learn whether and how MSCs can improve the disease conditions in patients with liver cirrhosis.

 This study will also look at its safety in liver fibrosis patients.

 The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed.

 Particularly, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) has been demonstrated to decrease model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and increase serum albumin in liver injury patients.

 Therefore, the investigators propose a hypothesis that MSCs can also improve the disease conditions of liver fibrosis patients, particularly reducing the decompensated conditions in these patients.
