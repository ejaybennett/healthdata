(firstQuint)Body Compartment Pharmacokinetics of Anti- Retroviral Agents That May be Used for Future HIV Post- Exposure Prophylaxis.

.

 Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV.

 The majority of MSM acquire HIV after exposure to the rectal mucosa through unprotected receptive anal intercourse.

 Post-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP) is an intervention that is used to prevent HIV infection soon (72 hours) after a potential exposure.

 HIV-negative people with a possible exposure to HIV are instructed to take 28 days of a combination anti-HIV medication regimen, Truvada(R) + Raltegravir.

 This study is being conducted to determine if the uptake of other anti-HIV medications called Genvoya(R) and darunavir is different at several body sites, including mucosal tissues.

 These other medications might be considered for PEP regimens in the future.
