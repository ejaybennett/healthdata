(fifthQuint)Clinical and Biological Activity of an Anti-PD-L1 (Atezolizumab) in Operable Localised Soft Tissue Sarcomas Patients to be Treated With Radiotherapy.

 This trial is a European, multicenter, open-label, randomized, Phase II trial using a pick-the-winner design aiming to the clinical and biological activity of anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab) in a population of operable localised soft tissue sarcomas (STS) patients to be treated with radiotherapy.

 Following inform consent signature and validation of eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized (1:1:1) into one of the 3 study arms: - Arm A: Pre-operative radiotherapy followed by 2 cycles of atezolizumab then surgery - Arm B: 2 cycles of atezolizumab followed by surgery then post-operative radiotherapy - Arm C: Pre-operative radiotherapy followed by surgery then 2 cycles of atezolizumab.

 The sequence of treatment is different between the study arms, but the regimen of study treatments are the same.

 All randomized patients will received: - The conventionally fractionated radiotherapy regimen of 2 Gy, 5 days a week up to a total dose of 50 Gy over 5 weeks.

 Radiotherapy will be either pre-(Arms A and C) or post-(Arm B) operative.

 - Two cycles of atezolizumab (1200mg, IV, Q3W) - Surgery will be performed as per institutional practice.

 Randomisation will be stratified according to histological subtypes as follows - Group 1: Leiomyosarcoma [LMS], Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma [UPS], Liposarcoma [LPS], myxofibrosarcoma, angiosarcoma versus - Group 2: all translocation sarcoma except Ewing, rhabdomyosarcoma RMS and myxoid LPS.

 Following this sequence of treatment, all patients will be followed-up at W12, W18, W24 (=M6), then M9 and M12.

 The minimal follow-up will be 1 year for the last randomized patient.

 During the study period, the following tumor samples will be also collected for all randomized patients: - A de novo tumor biopsy before study treatment start (pre-treatment tumor sample) - A fragment of the surgery specimen.

 Clinical and Biological Activity of an Anti-PD-L1 (Atezolizumab) in Operable Localised Soft Tissue Sarcomas Patients to be Treated With Radiotherapy@highlight

This multicentric, randomised, Phase II trial will use a pick-the-winner design in order to evaluate the clinical and biological activity of atezolizumab when combined with pre-operative or post-operative radiotherapy in STS patients.

 Following Inform Consent Form (ICF) signature, eligible patients will be randomised (1:1:1) to receive: - Arm A: Radiotherapy followed by atezolizumab then surgery.

 - Arm B: Atezolizumab followed by surgery then radiotherapy.

 - Arm C: Radiotherapy then surgery followed by atezolizumab.

 The sequence of the study treatments is different among the 3 study arms.

 However, the dose regimens will be the same: - Atezolizumab will be administered to all patients at the dose of 1200mg, by IV injection, for 2 cycles (Q3W).

 - Radiotherapy will be administered to all patients at the dose of 2Gy/day, 5 days per week, for a total of 5 weeks and 50Gy.

 - Surgery will be performed as per institutional practice.

 Randomisation will be stratified according to histological subtypes as follows: Group 1: Liposarcoma (LPS), Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma (UPS), Leiomyosarcoma (LMS), myxofibrosarcoma, angiosarcoma versus Group 2: all translocation sarcoma except Ewing, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and myxoid LPS.
