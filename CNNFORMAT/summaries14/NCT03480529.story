(thirdQuint)Monitoring the IMmUological TOXicity of Drugs.

 Several drugs and chemotherapies seem to have an impact on the immunological system and are responsible of a wide range of rare immunological side effects.

 Those are poorly described, due to the modification of the pharmacopeia, and the recent recognition of several of these adverse events.

 This study investigates the main characteristics of patients affected by rare immunological side effects (of which systemic lupus, immune arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, capillary leak syndrome) imputed to drugs.

 A causality assessment according to the WHO-UMC (World Health Organization - Uppsala Monitoring Center) is systematically applied.

Several drugs and chemotherapies seem to have an impact on the immunological system.

 This study investigates reports of immunological toxicities, including the International classification of disease ICD-10 codes M05, M32, I78 for treatments in the World Health Organization (WHO) global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database (VigiBase).
