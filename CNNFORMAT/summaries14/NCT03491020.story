(fifthQuint)Emission Patterns of Respiratory Pathogens.

 Airborne transmission represents one of the most rapidly spreading and dangerous dissemination mechanisms for pathogens.

 The study team have been investigating bacterial and viral transmission routes and barrier precautions.

 In a recent clinical study, it was observed that Measles virus RNA was detected from a patient for at least up to 10 feet.

 In addition, the group has been studying barrier precautions (facemasks) for their ability to prevent the spread of aerosolized viruses.

 Finally, in a controlled lab setting the investigators have assessed the impact of environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) on pathogen transmission and the effect of UV-C light to prevent the spread of influenza.

 The purpose of this observational study is to describe the human aerosolization patterns of respiratory pathogens.

 The study team hypothesizes that the emission patterns of specific airborne pathogens varies between individual patients.

 Emission Patterns of Respiratory Pathogens@highlight

Airborne transmission represents one of the most rapidly spreading and dangerous dissemination mechanisms for pathogens.

 Public health strategies to prevent and control the often explosive outbreaks associated with such pathogens are: 1) vaccination and treatment, if available, 2) isolation and barrier precautions such as face masks, and 3) decontamination of the exposed areas and surfaces.

 A lack of understanding how these pathogens are transmitted hampers the ability to develop effective prevention measures.

 This study will be used to collect preliminary data of the emission patterns of respiratory pathogens.
