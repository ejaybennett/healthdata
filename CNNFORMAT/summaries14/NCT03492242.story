(thirdQuint)Immune CHeckpoint Inhibitors Monitoring of Adverse Drug ReAction.

 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically improved clinical outcomes in multiple cancer types and are increasingly being tested in earlier disease settings and used in combination.

 However, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can occur.

 Here the investigators use VigiBase (http://www.

vigiaccess.

org/), the World Health Organization (WHO) database of individual safety case reports, and in the Base Nationale de PharmacoVigilance (BNPV) which is the french pharmacovigilance database, to identify cases of adverse drug reaction including arthiritis, auto-immune induced diseases, cardiac diseases, endocrinologic diseases, following treatment with ICIs.

 Immune CHeckpoint Inhibitors Monitoring of Adverse Drug ReAction@highlight

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) might have high grade immune-related adverse events (irAEs) from rhumatologic, endocrinologic, cardiac or other system origin.

 This study investigates reports of drug induced irAEs with treatment including anti-PD1, Anti-PDL-1, and Anti-CTLA4 classes using the World Health Organization (WHO) database VigiBase and the french database Base Nationale de PharmacoVigilance (BNPV).
