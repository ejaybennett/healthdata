(firstQuint)The Role of Nicotine Dose and Route of Delivery in Affecting Adoption of E-cigarettes and Reducing Exposure to Toxic Combustion Products.

 This study proposes to assess the relative role of nicotine dose and route of delivery in affecting successful switching from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes, as well as concomitant reductions in ad libitum cigarette smoking and exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents of combustion.

 The strategy will be to assess adoption of e-cigarette use and concomitant reduction in ad libitum smoking of subjects' usual brands of cigarettes over an 8-week period, during which they will receive nicotine or non-nicotine e-cigarettes, and nicotine or non-nicotine skin patches.

 The nicotine patches will not be used as a therapeutic treatment in this study, but rather as a way to manipulate the nicotine dose, while varying the rate and route of nicotine delivery.

 Behavioral or "habit" aspects of e-cigarette use will be controlled for by the groups receiving non-nicotine e-cigarettes.

This study plans to investigate whether using electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or skin patches containing nicotine affects switching from smoking conventional combustible (burning) cigarettes.
