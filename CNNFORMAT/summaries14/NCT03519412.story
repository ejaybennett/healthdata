(fifthQuint)Pembrolizumab in MMR-Proficient Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Pharmacologically Primed to Trigger Hypermutation Status.

 Arethusa consists of three different phases - SCREENING Phase, PRIMING phase, and TRIAL Phase.

 - SCREENING PHASE: RAS-mutated metastatic CRC patients who have failed standard therapies are tested for MMR status.

 MMR-Deficient (MMR-D) patients proceed directly to TRIAL Phase and are treated with pembrolizumab.

 MMR-Proficient (MMR-P) patients are further tested for O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression by immunohistochemistry and promoter methylation analysis.

 MGMT negative patients proceed to PRIMING phase.

 MGMT positive patients go off-study.

 - PRIMING PHASE: MMR-P MGMT-negative patients receive TMZ therapy until progression.

 At PD (disease progression) patients are biopsied to determine the tumor mutational burden (TMB).

 Patients with TMB 20 mutations/megabase, proceed to trial phase.

 - TRIAL PHASE: Eligible patients are treated with pembrolizumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.

 Pembrolizumab in MMR-Proficient Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Pharmacologically Primed to Trigger Hypermutation Status@highlight

In this study, metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with RAS-extended mutations who failed standard therapies will be tested for MMR-deficiency.

 MMRd patients will undergo treatment with pembrolizumab while MMR-proficient patients will be tested for o6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) expression (IHC) and then for MGMT promoter methylation.

 MGMT IHC-negative, promoter methylation positive patients will be treated with temozolomide (TMZ).

 Patients progressing under temozolomide will be tested for tumor mutational burden (TMB) and proceed to pembrolizumab if TMB is > 20 mutations/Mb.

 The primary study hypothesis is that tumors with acquired resistance to temozolomide become hypermutated and are sensitive to pembrolizumab.
