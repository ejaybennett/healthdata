(fifthQuint)Ex-vivo Performance Evaluation of the Histolog Scanner for Human Breast Carcinoma Detection on Fresh Breast Core Biopsies.

 During clinical breast assessments physicians may detect diagnostic findings suspicious for breast cancer.

 In such situations a biopsy has to be taken to confirm the diagnosis histologically.

 Once informed consent will be obtained, the physician will collect a biopsy sample using the standard procedure with US- or MG-guided Biospy.

 Immediately prior to gold standard pathology workflow (formalin fixation), HistologTM Scanner will be used to image the fresh biopsy specimens.

 The HistologTM Scanner (v1.

0, SamanTree Medical SA, Lausanne, Switzerland, CE marking) is based on confocal fluorescence and displays microscopic histology images of superficial layers of fresh tissue after nuclear staining with Acridine Orange (30 seconds) and rinsing in saline solution.

 Finally, the specimen will be processed following the gold standard workflow (H&E-stained images).

 Two independent pathologists will assess the HistologTM Scanner- and H&E-stained images subsequently according to the B-classification (categories B1-B5; "0" was defined as "no diagnosis possible") and determine the correspondence of the results.

 Ex-vivo Performance Evaluation of the Histolog Scanner for Human Breast Carcinoma Detection on Fresh Breast Core Biopsies@highlight

Fresh breast core biopsies suspicious for breast cancer that are usually taken during clinical breast assessments will be imaged via confocal microscopy.

 The device so called HistologTM Scanner is based on confocal fluorescence and displays microscopic histology images superficial layers of fresh tissue.

 After the imaging procedure the fresh breast tissue specimen will be followed according to the gold standard workflow (H&E-stained images).

 Subsequently, two pathologists will analyze the HistologTM Scanner obtained-images and H&E-stained images for potential breast cancer structures.

 A comparison of both analyses for cancer visualization will be performed to evaluate the feasibility of using confocal microscopy for breast cancer detection.
