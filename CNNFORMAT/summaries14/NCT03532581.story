(secondQuint)Indocyanine Green Lymphangiography in Identifying Thoracic Duct During Neck Surgery.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Feasibility and optimization of thoracic duct identification using indocyanine green (ICG) lymphangiography.

 II.

 To explore specifically how identifying the thoracic duct (TD) will prevent injury intra-operatively.

 III.

 To understand if a TD injury can be recognized by leakage of fluorescent chyle into the operating field.

 OUTLINE: Participants receive indocyanine green solution subcutaneously (SC) and undergo near-infrared imaging over 1-2 minutes during their standard of care neck surgery.

 After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for up to 1 year.

 Indocyanine Green Lymphangiography in Identifying Thoracic Duct During Neck Surgery@highlight

This phase I trial studies how well indocyanine green lymphangiography works in identifying thoracic duct during neck surgery.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as near infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green may help recognize and prevent injury to thoracic duct during neck surgery.
