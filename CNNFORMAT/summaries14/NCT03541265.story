(fifthQuint)Liposomal Bupivacaine in Total Knee Arthroplasty.

 Multimodal pain approach is now an accepted standard of care to improve pain, enable earlier mobilization and faster recovery, decreased length of stay, and reduce opioid consumption and related side effects.

 The multimodal approach includes peri-operative oral and IV analgesics, local periarticular injections (PAI), and/or regional blocks such as femoral nerve blocks nerve or subsartorial saphenous nerve (adductor canal) blocks.

 Extended release bupivacaine (Exparel - Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Parsippany, NJ, USA) in liposomal form was developed for longer lasting post-operative analgesia.

 There are limited studies analyzing its efficacy of single injection liposomal bupivacaine in adductor canal block in total knee arthroplasty.

 The investigators hypothesized that a single adductor canal regional block injection would provide similar pain relief as peri-articular infiltration of Exparel.

 Liposomal Bupivacaine in Total Knee Arthroplasty@highlight

Pain management after total knee arthroplasty is essential for optimized clinical outcomes and higher satisfaction.

 Exparel (Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Parsippany, New Jersey, USA) is a long-acting Bupivacaine extended release liposome compound that is injected peri-articularly or as regional block.

 The purpose of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of single administration of Exparel for local peri-articular infiltration versus adductor canal regional block.
