(thirdQuint)64 Cu-DOTA-alendronate PET Imaging in Localizing and Characterizing Breast Calcifications in Participants Before Undergoing Mastectomy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the uptake (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax]) of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate in female patients with biopsy-proven malignant breast calcifications.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To compare uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate on PET -computed tomography (CT) with histology after mastectomy.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate.

 Participants receive 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT imaging 60 minutes after injection.

 Participants with sufficient levels of residual radioactivity may undergo repeat imaging on day 1 as determined by the study team.

 After completion of study , participants are followed up for 7 days.

 64 Cu-DOTA-alendronate PET Imaging in Localizing and Characterizing Breast Calcifications in Participants Before Undergoing Mastectomy@highlight

This early phase I pilot trial studies how well 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate positron emission tomography (PET) imaging work in localizing and characterizing breast calcifications (small calcium deposits) in participants before undergoing mastectomy.

 Diagnostic procedures, such 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate PET, may detect calcification and help doctors predict cancer associated calcification within breast tissue.
