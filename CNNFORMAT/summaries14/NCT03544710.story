(thirdQuint)Impact of Preoperative Bathing on Post Caesarean Section Surgical Site Infection.

 Caesarean delivery is the single-most important risk factor for postpartum pregnancy associated infections carrying a 5 to 20-fold increase in the risk of developing sepsis.

 Research done in MRRH showed a post-surgery wound sepsis prevalence of 82% on all surgical wards in the hospital and the prevalence of post caesarean section wound infection at MRRH is 15.

5%.

 At MRRH, surgical site infections remain a substantial cause of morbidity, prolonged hospitalization and mortality.

 SSI is associated with a mortality rate of 3%, and 75% of SSI associated deaths are directly attributable to the SSIs.

 Universal practices like preoperative bathing of patients are currently not being practiced at MRRH and thus their impact on reducing the burden can only be speculated upon.

 The aim of this study was to assess the impact of preoperative bathing with chloroxylenol antiseptic on the incidence of post caesarean section surgical site infection.

 Impact of Preoperative Bathing on Post Caesarean Section Surgical Site Infection@highlight

Surgical site infection (SSI) is the commonest hospital-acquired infection globally, and prevalence is much higher in the low-income countries.

 Caesarean delivery carries a 5-20 fold risk for developing postpartum sepsis.

 SSIs cause significant morbidity, prolonged hospitalization and mortality.

 Simple and inexpensive interventions like preoperative bathing need to be studied, to assess their impact on surgical site infection rates.
