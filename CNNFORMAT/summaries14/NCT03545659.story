(fifthQuint)Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia: Follow-Up.

 Investigators have identified a cohort of children with B-precursor ALL and T-ALL enrolled in the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL-92, ALL-2000 and ALL-2008 trials and experienced a relapse as the first event after cessation of maintenance therapy (360 patients).

 From medical charts and blood test results it will be decided whether the relapse was diagnosed at a routine visit (including routine blood tests) or if the relapse was diagnosed because of symptoms at a non-scheduled visit or blood test.

 As the NOPHO database probably is one of the most complete databases globally, it is an advantage to perform this study as a NOPHO study.

 Results of this population based relapse study will provide an evidence-based background for planning optimal and relevant follow-up programs for children after therapy of ALL treated according to contemporary Nordic ALL protocols.

 The study is important and relevant in the light of today's high ALL cure rates and a need for optimal follow-up programs after cessation of ALL treatment and possible prediction of relapse.

 The timing of the project is an increased focus on the clinical relevance of routine clinical follow-up of patients treated for cancer.

 Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia: Follow-Up@highlight

Over the past decades, advances in treatment have led to an increasing number of children who survive cancer, resulting in a growing population of childhood cancer survivors.

 After end of cancer treatment on common protocols survivors are enrolled in non-harmonized follow-up programs with frequent visits and blood samples.

 However, the evidence for the value of these follow-up programs with respect to the effect on detecting relapse and the effects on overall survival is scarce.

 The aim of the study is to give a comprehensive description of the detection mode of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), including symptoms and blood test results.

 Further, we aim to evaluate if the mode of detection affects survival.
