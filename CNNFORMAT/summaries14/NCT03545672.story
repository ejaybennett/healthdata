(fifthQuint)Identification of Cardiac Impairment in PBC Patients.

 Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a progressive and uncommon inflammatory autoimmune cholesteric liver disease,which will contribute to biliary cirrhosis.

 Symptoms and course of primary biliary cholangitis can be diverse, wherefore the targets of the current treatment are focused on the prevention of end-stage liver disease.

 Researches reported patients with PBC may involve abnormalities on skeleton, thyroid and exocrine glands.

 However, whether this autoimmune disease would cause cardiac impairment is scarcely investigated.

 From our clinical practice, the cardiac structural abnormal can be found in certain patients with PBC detected by cardiovascular magnet resonance (CMR).

 CMR is the primary and emerging imaging modality for myocardial tissue characterisation, and it is recommended as a gold standard for functional imaging and assessment.

 This single-center, prospective observational study plans to identify the type and the severity of cardiac changes in PBC.

 Identification of Cardiac Impairment in PBC Patients@highlight

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic inflammatory liver disease leading to cirrhosis.

 Researches reported patients with PBC may involve abnormalities on skeleton, thyroid and exocrine glands.

 However, whether this autoimmune disease would cause cardiac impairment is scarcely investigated.

 Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance(CMR) is recently developed as a reliable modality to evaluate the cardiac tissue characteristics and functions.

 This study aims to investigate the cardiac status in PBC patients based on CMR.
