(fifthQuint)The Effects of Plantar Flexion Training in People With Chronic Stroke.

 Description of Arms: This study has three phases.

 The first phase is performed in a cross-over fashion.

 Participants will stand on two different incline angles on the paretic LE and simultaneously move a small skateboard forward with the non-paretic LE.

 The testing order for the two different incline angles will be randomized, and all participants will be required to complete both incline angle conditions within a single test session.

 The second phase will also be performed in a cross-over fashion.

 Participants will stand with three different percentages of body weight on their paretic LE while moving the skateboard forward with the non-paretic LE.

 The testing order for the three body weight percentages will be randomized.

 All participants will be required to complete all three body weight conditions within a single test session.

 In the third phase, participants will be randomized to either a control 4-week exercise intervention (conventional physical therapy) or a 4-week experimental exercise intervention (plantar flexion training).

 Both the control and exerimental arms will complete over-ground multi-directional gait training and home exercise.

 The Effects of Plantar Flexion Training in People With Chronic Stroke@highlight

This study consists of three phases that aim to develop an exercise intervention to promote maximal activation of ankle plantar flexors in the paretic lower extrimty (LE) in order to restore a more normalized gait pattern in chronic stroke survivors.

 The aim of the first phase is to determine if there are differences between standing on different levels of inclination on plantar flexion activation during forward movement of the contralateral LE in adults with chronic with stroke.

 The aim of second phase is to determine if there are differences between different percentages of weight bearing on the paretic LE on plantar flexion activation during forward movement of the contralateral LE in adults with chronic stroke.

 The aim of the third phase is to determine if there are differences between a 4-week plantar flexion training intervention and conventional physical therapy.
