(fifthQuint)CEUS Evaluation of Hypoxic Ischemic Injury.

 There is already good evidence in the literature that CEUS may be very valuable in children, and that is why it is routinely performed off-label for this purpose in the USA.

 However, there are ways in which it could be improved, and more studies are needed to definitively establish its diagnostic performance.

 Hence, this is why we wish to perform this study.

 All participants in this research study will have already scheduled standard of care brain ultrasound exam.

 The CEUS portion will immediately follow the standard of care brain ultrasound exam.

 The results of the CEUS will be reported as usual in the radiology report.

 The patient will be billed as per their standard clinical care (i.

e.

 no additional costs associated with the research procedure).

 A consent form signed by the patient's parents and/or legal guardian will be required to indicate agreement to participate in the study.

 Each parent and/or legal guardian of participant who agrees to participate will be asked to extend his/her already scheduled brain ultrasound exam by approximately 40 minutes, 10 minutes for the contrast ultrasound examination and 30 minutes for post examination monitoring of potential adverse events.

 Note that all CEUS exams will be performed at bedside in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units.

 No transport will be needed for the post scanning monitoring period.

 All the rapid response equipment and resuscitation staff are readily available 24/7 in the intensive care unit setting.

 All participants will have an existing IV line as they are in the intensive care unit setting.

 For each patient subject, the clinically indicated portion of the ultrasound examination will always be performed prior to the research portion of examination.

 For neonates/infants undergoing hypothermia therapy, CEUS scan will be performed initially after the rewarming period and again one week following the first CEUS scan.

 It is part of standard of care to obtain initial and follow up brain US for screening and monitoring of suspected hypoxic ischemic injury.

 For neonates/infants not undergoing hypothermia therapy, first CEUS scan will be performed at the time of injury and one week following injury.

 Patient charts will be reviewed for history and diagnosis.

 CEUS Evaluation of Hypoxic Ischemic Injury@highlight

The goal of the study is to perform off-label application of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for diagnosis and monitoring of brain injury in neonates and infants.

 This study will recruit patients between 0-1 year in the neonatal intensive care unit or pediatric intensive care unit at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who are already scheduled to receive a standard of care grayscale brain ultrasound scan.

 Lumason will be administered intravenously.

 The CEUS portion will immediately follow the standard of care brain ultrasound exam.
