 Evaluation of Depression and Anxiety in Chemotherapy Patients@highlight

This study will examine the existence and severity of depression and anxiety in patients undergoing chemotherapy at RUMC.

 Patients currently undergoing initial chemotherapy cycle will be compared to patients undergoing a subsequent chemotherapy cycle.

 Data will then be collected using standardized depression and anxiety scales to assess if these comorbidities exist and to what severity level.

 Data already collected for depression and anxiety in patients with chronic, but not cancer, illness will be used as a control.

 The participants will be screened for signs of psychological distress using three self administered questionnaires: the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 item Scale (GAD7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9).

 Demographic information about the participants, including medical and psychiatric history, will also be gathered from their medical records.
