(secondQuint)Efficacy of Daromun Neoadjuvant Intratumoral Treatment in Clinical Stage IIIB/C Melanoma Patients.

 The present study is an open-label, randomized, controlled, two-arm multi-center study of the efficacy of Daromun neoadjuvant intratumoral treatment followed by surgery versus surgery alone in clinical stage III B/C melanoma patients.

 248 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Daromun treatment followed by surgery (Arm 1) or surgery alone (Arm 2).

 In both arms, follow-up for assessing RFS will be performed up to five years after randomization.

 Survival information will also be collected in the following year (up to six years in total after randomization).

 This is an open-label study and there is no blinding.

 Patients who successfully complete the screening evaluations and are eligible for participation in the study will be enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to two parallel treatment arms: Daromun and surgery (Arm 1) or surgery alone (Arm 2).

 To ensure a balance across treatment groups, stratified randomisation with permuted block will be used and separate randomization list for each subgroup (stratum) will be produced.

 Patients will be stratified on the basis of the following prognostic factors: - Stage of disease (2 levels): Stage IIIB vs.

 Stage IIIC - Planned post-surgical adjuvant therapy (4 levels): high-dose interferon-2b, Ipilimumab, anti-PD-1and other adjuvant therapies.

 The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that a neoadjuvant Daromun treatment followed by surgery improves in a statistically significant manner the recurrence-free survival (RFS) of Stage IIIB/C melanoma patients with respect to the standard of care (surgery alone).

 Primary endpoint of the study is RFS in a time-to-event analysis in the Daromun plus surgery treatment group (Arm 1) versus the surgery alone control group (Arm 2).

 Analysis will be based on the "Intention To Treat" population.

 The key secondary objective of the study is to demonstrate that a neoadjuvant Daromun treatment followed by surgery improves in a statistically significant manner the overall survival (OS) of patients with resectable Stage IIIB/ or C melanoma patients with respect to the standard of care (surgery alone).
