(thirdQuint)Effect of Metabolaid on AMPK Activation for Weight Loss.

 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been postulated as a molecular target in the amelioration of obesity-related diseases, where most therapeutic approaches have failed.

 Plant-polyphenols have shown the capacity to ameliorate obesity-induced metabolic disturbances.

 A combination of polyphenols (LC-HS) derived from Hibiscus sabdariffa L.

 (HS) and Lippia citriodora L.

 (LC) (lemon verbena) (Metabolaid(R)) was assessed for triglyceride accumulation and AMPK activation in the hypertrophied adipocyte model 3T3-L1.

 A dietary supplement containing 500 mg of LC-HS was evaluated in a double blind, placebo-controlled and randomized trial in 56 overweight subjects for two months.

 Anthropometric and circulating biochemical parameters were determined.

 Effect of Metabolaid on AMPK Activation for Weight Loss@highlight

The objective of this study was to establish a formulation, containing both Hibiscus sabdariffa L.

 (HS) and Lippia citriodora L.

 (LC) extracts (Metabolaid(R)) that had significant capacity to activate the AMPK-enzyme and to reduce triglyceride accumulation in the hypertrophied adipocyte model.

 Then, we assessed the efficacy of this combination in light-to-moderate-overweight subjects under risk of developing metabolic syndrome.
