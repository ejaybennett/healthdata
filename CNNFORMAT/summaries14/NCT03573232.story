(thirdQuint)Prevalence of Abnormal Postures in Parkinson's Disease.

 Postural abnormalities represent disabling and painful complications in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

 The first postural trunk deviation in PD was first described by James Parkinson himself and recognized as stooped simian appearance, with flexion of the hips and knees, and rounding of the shoulders.

 Although the stooped posture is a typical feature, more severe spinal misalignment (and deformities) can affect people with PD.

 These postural deformities include Pisa syndrome (PS), camptocormia (CP), antecollis (AC), scoliosis (S) and striatal deformities related to hand (striatal hand) and/or toes (striatal toes).

 The prevalence of these postural deformities is variable because several diagnostic criteria have been used to characterize each deformity.

 Recently, a consensus of diagnostic criteria has been reached in literature permitting us to better mapping the presence of these deformities in people with PD.

 Prevalence of Abnormal Postures in Parkinson's Disease@highlight

Postural abnormalities represent disabling and painful complications in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

 The stooped posture is a typical feature of PD but with advancing of disease more severe body abnormalities can affect people with PD.

 These deformities include Pisa syndrome, camptocormia, antecollis, scoliosis and striatal deformities related to hand (striatal hand) and/or toes (striatal toes).
