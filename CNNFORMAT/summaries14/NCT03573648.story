(thirdQuint)Neoadjuvant Tamoxifen, Palbociclib, Avelumab in Estrogen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer.

 Patients will be treated with tamoxifen (20mg PO daily) +/- palbociclib (125mg PO daily for 21 days, 7 days off ) for 1 cycle (1 cycle =28 days) and undergo a repeat biopsy, MRI, and blood draw at Cycle 2, Day 1.

 Afterwards avelumab will be added to both arms.

 Avelumab will be administered 10mg/kg IV every 14 days (1 cycle = 2 doses = 28 days).

 Patients will be treated for 3 cycles of avelumab with tamoxifen +/- palbociclib (thus 4 cycles total, including run-in without avelumab).

 Patients will be treated so long as there is no clinical evidence of progression and therapy is tolerated.

 Patients who experience progressive disease (25% increase) of their tumor will cease study treatment and undergo end-of-study assessment (including repeat MRI) and surgery.

 Otherwise, patients completing all 4 cycles of therapy will undergo MRI and surgery.

 Neoadjuvant Tamoxifen, Palbociclib, Avelumab in Estrogen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer@highlight

Eligible patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer will undergo a biopsy and be randomized to receive tamoxifen (T) versus tamoxifen with palbociclib (PT) in a 1:1 ratio.

 After 1 cycle (28 days) another biopsy will be obtained, and both arms will receive avelumab (A) for 3 additional cycles.

 Patients will then undergo breast surgery.
