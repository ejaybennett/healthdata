(fifthQuint)A Study of Psychosocial and Behavioral Determinants of Differential Rates of Participant Compliance in CPCRA Protocols.

 Patient noncompliance can influence the statistical findings of a clinical study, possibly resulting in an incorrect assessment of the effects of the investigational therapeutic agent.

 Since the special populations targeted by the CPCRA for inclusion in HIV-related clinical research do not typify those traditionally included in clinical trials or compliance research, it is necessary to elucidate and examine the special needs of these populations and to determine the extent to which these needs manifest themselves as potential barriers to protocol compliance.

 Patients who are enrolled on protocols CPCRA 006 and/or 007 are given a baseline questionnaire to complete during the enrollment visit for the qualifying treatment protocol.

 The survey concerns the patient's work, primary language, support systems, residence status, perception of disease and treatments, and substance use.

 At 4-month follow-up visits, patients are asked to complete a self-report questionnaire, which assesses the patient's perceptions of difficulties in protocol compliance requirements, clinic/office visits, and health beliefs.

 The duration of patients on this study will be defined by the qualifying protocol requirements.

 A Study of Psychosocial and Behavioral Determinants of Differential Rates of Participant Compliance in CPCRA Protocols@highlight

To examine, in patients enrolled in protocols CPCRA 006 and/or 007, the relationship between patient compliance and demographic, psychosocial, and lifestyle characteristics and Health Belief Model premises (i.

, patient's perception of susceptibility to and severity of disease and perception of benefits and barriers to a particular treatment) in order to design more effective intervention protocols.
