(fifthQuint)Phase I Study of Alpha-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone in Patients With Acute Renal Failure.

 PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.

 Group 1: Patients are infused with alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) or placebo over 5 minutes.

 A cohort of 5 patients is infused at each dose level of alpha-MSH until the minimum effective dose (MED) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) are determined.

 Group 2: Patients receive a single dose of the MED of alpha-MSH IV over 5 minutes at the time anastomoses are complete.

 Other patients receive alpha-MSH at the MTD.

 Cohorts of 5 patients each are treated at the MED and the MTD.

 Group 3: Patients receive alpha-MSH as in group 2.

 Additional dose levels are also tested.

 Completion date provided represents the completion date of the grant per OOPD records.

 Phase I Study of Alpha-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone in Patients With Acute Renal Failure@highlight

OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in patients with acute renal failure.

 II.

 Determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of alpha-MSH in patients at high risk of acute renal failure after renal transplantation.

 III.

 Determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of alpha-MSH in patients with established ischemic acute renal failure.

 IV.

 Determine the effect of alpha-MSH on interleukin-10 pharmacokinetics.
