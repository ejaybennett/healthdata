(secondQuint)R115777 in Treating Patients With Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the objective response rate (complete or partial) and duration of response of patients with small cell lung cancer who have had at least a partial response to one prior chemotherapy regimen for at least 3 months when treated with R115777.

 II.

 Determine the time to disease progression, survival, and quality of life in this patient population treated with this drug.

 III.

 Assess the safety of R115777 in this patient population.

 IV.

 Assess the presence of ras mutations in relapsed patients with available paraffin blocks.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral R115777 every 12 hours for 14 consecutive days followed by 7 days of rest.

 Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 15 of each course, and at the end of the study.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-40 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of R115777 in treating patients who have relapsed small cell lung cancer.
