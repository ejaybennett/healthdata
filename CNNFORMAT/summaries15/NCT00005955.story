(thirdQuint)Temozolomide Followed by Radiation Therapy in Treating Children With Newly Diagnosed Malignant CNS Tumors.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate to treatment with temozolomide in children with newly diagnosed malignant central nervous system tumors.

 - Determine the toxicity of this treatment in these patients.

 - Determine the overall survival in these patients for 18 months following the study after receiving this treatment.

 OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of disease (ependymoma vs brain stem glioma vs malignant glioma vs other).

 Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients with a partial or complete response may receive an additional 8 courses of temozolomide following radiotherapy.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 100 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study over 24-36 months.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.

 Chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide followed by radiation therapy in treating children who have newly diagnosed malignant central nervous system tumors.
