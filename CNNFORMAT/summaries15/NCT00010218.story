(secondQuint)Karenitecin in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients with relapsed or refractory non-small cell lung cancer treated with karenitecin as salvage chemotherapy.

 - Determine the effect of prior response to chemotherapy on response to this drug in these patients.

 - Determine survival and failure-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to response to prior chemotherapy (relapsed vs refractory).

 Patients receive karenitecin IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients with responding disease after 6 courses may receive 2 additional courses beyond best response.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 45 patients (25 for stratum I and 20 for stratum II) will be accrued for this study within 12 months.

 Karenitecin in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of karenitecin in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-small cell lung cancer
