(thirdQuint)Arsenic Trioxide and Dexamethasone in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Stage II or Stage III Multiple Myeloma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with recurrent or refractory stage II or III multiple myeloma treated with arsenic trioxide and dexamethasone.

 - Determine the rates of overall and relapse-free survival in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the safety profile of this treatment regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV daily for 5 days during the first week only and then 2 days a week thereafter.

 Patients also receive IV or oral dexamethasone on days 1-4 every 4 weeks.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Disease assessments are conducted every 4 weeks.

 Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of therapy after initial determination of CR.

 Final assessments are conducted 4 weeks after the last study treatment and then annually thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining arsenic trioxide and dexamethasone in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory stage II or stage III multiple myeloma.
