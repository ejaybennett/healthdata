(fifthQuint)Study of gp75 Vaccine in Patients With Stage III and IV Melanoma.

 This study is designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of intramuscular vaccination with gp75 DNA in patients with stage III or IV melanoma.

 Secondary objectives are to observe the patient for any evidence of anti-tumor response and to establish the optimal biologically effective dose.

 Up to 24 evaluable patients with stage III or IV metastatic melanoma or with stage III melanoma, currently disease-free, but at high risk for recurrence will be enrolled.

 Patients will be be enrolled into an assigned dose group and will receive five vaccinations of gp75.

 In order for dose escalation to proceed, only one patient in the current dose group may have demonstrated a dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

 If a second patient experiences such toxicity then both patients will move down to the previous dose level, and the previous dose level will be considered to be the MTD.

 If no DLTs are encountered, patients will continue on study at the assigned dose level.

 Any patient experiencing a DLT will not receive further vaccination until the toxicity has resolved.

 Patients exhibiting both serological and stable/clinical response after receiving the fifth vaccination will be eligible to receive booster vaccinations.

 An additional patient will be accrued to the dose level for every patient that progresses prior to the fifth vaccination.

 Study of gp75 Vaccine in Patients With Stage III and IV Melanoma@highlight

Up to 24 patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma will be enrolled.

 Patients who are currently disease-free but at high risk for relapse are also eligible.

 Patients will receive vaccinations of gp75 at assigned dose levels.

 Patients who exhibit serologic and stable/clinical response are eligible to receive booster vaccinations.

 Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy throughout the duration of the study.

 In this study, the optimal biologically effective dose is defined as the lowest dose of gp75 that results in the production of anti-gp75 antibodies.
