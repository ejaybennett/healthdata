(fifthQuint)Total-Body Irradiation, Cyclophosphamide, and Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine a safe and reproducible method of adjusting the dose of cyclophosphamide based on its metabolism when given in combination with total body irradiation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancy.

 OUTLINE: - Preparative regimen: Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days -6 to -4.

 Patients then receive dose-adjusted (based on metabolism) cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -3 and -2.

 - Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) infusion: Patients undergo allogeneic HSC transplantation on day 0.

 Patients receive graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, CNS prophylaxis, and testicular irradiation as per institutional standard practices.

 Patients are followed daily until day 80 after transplantation and then regularly thereafter for survival.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Total-Body Irradiation, Cyclophosphamide, and Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Adjusting the dose of drugs used in chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide may decrease side effects while stopping cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells.

 Stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy used to kill cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effect on the body of dose-adjusted cyclophosphamide combined with total-body irradiation and donor stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have hematologic cancer.
