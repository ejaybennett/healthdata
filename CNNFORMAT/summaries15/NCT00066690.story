(fifthQuint)Suppression of Ovarian Function With Either Tamoxifen or Exemestane Compared With Tamoxifen Alone in Treating Premenopausal Women With Hormone-Responsive Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Compare the disease-free survival, breast cancer-free interval, distant recurrence-free interval and overall survival of premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer when treated with tamoxifen + ovarian function suppression (by triptorelin, oophorectomy, or ovarian irradiation) or exemestane + ovarian function suppression vs.

 tamoxifen alone.

 The primary comparison is ovarian function suppression with either tamoxifen or exemestane vs.

 tamoxifen alone.

 - Compare the quality of life, including late side effects of early menopause, of patients treated with these regimens.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to participating center, prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no), and number of positive axillary and/or internal mammary lymph nodes (0 vs 1 or more) and intended initial method of ovarian function suppression (triptorelin vs oophorectomy vs ovarian irradiation).

 Treatment duration is 5 years.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter.

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 4 years.

 Suppression of Ovarian Function With Either Tamoxifen or Exemestane Compared With Tamoxifen Alone in Treating Premenopausal Women With Hormone-Responsive Breast Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast tumor cells.

 Ovarian function suppression combined with hormone therapy using tamoxifen or exemestane may fight breast cancer by reducing the production of estrogen.

 It is not yet known whether suppression of ovarian function plus either tamoxifen or exemestane is more effective than tamoxifen alone in preventing the recurrence of hormone-responsive breast cancer.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial studies ovarian suppression with either tamoxifen or exemestane to see how well they work compared to tamoxifen alone in treating premenopausal women who have undergone surgery for hormone-responsive breast cancer.
