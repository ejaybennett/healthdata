(thirdQuint)Homoharringtonine With Oral Gleevec in Chronic, Accelerated and Blast Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML).

 Every 4 weeks, the study medicine Homoharringtonine will be given by vein daily for 5 days along with continuing daily doses of the approved medicine Gleevec taken by mouth.

 The safety and effectiveness of this combined treatment in CML patients will be studied.

 Patients who do not achieve a meaningful hematologic or cytogenetic response after 4 cycles or less will be discontinued.

 Otherwise, patients may continue additional cycles of this combined treatment for a maximum of 12 cycles.

 Homoharringtonine With Oral Gleevec in Chronic, Accelerated and Blast Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)@highlight

This will be an open label, multi-center study of up to 77 patients with CML in chronic, accelerated or blast phase who have developed resistance to or have failed previous treatment with Gleevec (imatinib mesylate).

 Because these patients may still be sensitive to Gleevec, adding Homoharringtonine may restore a response to Gleevec or the combined treatment may promote a better response than using Gleevec alone.
