(fifthQuint)Prevention of Severe Anaemia in Gambian Children.

 Objectives 1.

 To assess the effectiveness of monthly prophylaxis with S/P on haematological recovery in children who have been treated for severe anaemia.

 2.

 To measure compliance with the intervention 3.

 To investigate whether or not infection with chloroquine and S/P resistant strains contributes to the pathogenesis of severe anaemia Study design and methods Study site: The study was based at the 75-bed paediatric unit of The Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH), which is located in the capital, Banjul.

 This is the main referral hospital for the country.

 The paediatric unit admits about 7000 children a year, of whom about 800 are anaemic (PCV 37.

5C) or history of fever within the previous 48 hours is present.

 In addition, a thick blood smear for malaria parasites was collected for subsequent confirmation of the diagnosis.

 Filter paper sample to test for S/P resistance were collected from all malaria cases detected during morbidity surveillance.

 Study subjects with documented fever (axillary temperature of > 37.

5C) or history of recent fever and malaria parasitaemia were treated with S/P and chloroquine.

 The treatment of study subjects seen at the health centres was the carried out by health centre staff in accordance with national guidelines.

 Study patients who needed admission were referred to RVH paediatric unit or the MRC ward.

 End of malaria transmission season cross-sectional survey: Children enrolled in the study were seen at the OPD clinic at the end of malaria transmission season for examination by a study physician and a finger-prick blood sample was obtained for preparation of thick blood smear and determination of haematocrit.

 A standardized questionnaire was administered to the parents/guardians of the study subject, to collect information regarding illness that had occurred since the last visit, symptoms experienced, use of healthcare facilities and use of medicines.

 Information on the use of bednets was collected again at this visit.

 Dry season follow-up: At the end of the dry season study subjects visited once.

 During this visit, a questionnaire was administered to document morbidity and mortality.

 Sample size calculations: Assuming an attack rate of 0.

1 episodes of clinical malaria (as defined for the primary end-point) per month in children in the control group (a figure based on previous surveys from The Gambia) and a drop out rate during follow up of 15%, 131 episodes was expected in children in the control group followed until the end of one malaria transmission season.

 Thus, with a total of 1200 children recruited to the trial, the study will have an 80% power to detect at 5% level of significance a 32% reduction in incidence of clinical attacks of malaria in children who receive chemoprophylaxis.

 Previous studies in The Gambia indicate that about 20% of children under 5 years of age have a PCV of < 20% at the end of the malaria transmission season.

 With 1200 children enrolled, this trial will have a 80% power to detect a 34% reduction in the prevalence of anaemia of this degree of severity.

 Prevention of Severe Anaemia in Gambian Children@highlight

Severe anaemia is a frequent cause of admission to hospitals in tropical Africa and about 10% of such children die.

 In endemic countries, anaemia has multiple causes such as nutritional deficiencies, infections and haemoglobinopathies.

 However, Plasmodium falciparum infection is believed to be the major contributory factor to the aetiology of severe anaemia.

 Severe anaemia is usually treated by blood transfusion although transfusion carries the attendant risk of transmission of HIV and other blood-borne infections.

 Thus, there is a need to explore novel strategies to reduce the incidence of severe anaemia in high-risk groups such as children with suboptimal haemoglobin levels because these children are at increased risk of developing severe anaemia if they develop a malaria infection before their haemoglobin level has normalized.

 Therefore, it is proposed to study whether monthly chemoprophylaxis with sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (S/P) given during malaria transmission season can protect Gambian children from developing severe anaemia.

 After receiving treatment from the hospital, 1200 children admitted to the hospital with a haematocrit of less than 21% were randomised to receive either monthly S/P or placebo during the rest of the malaria transmission season.

 Morbidity was monitored throughout the rainy season.

 Study subjects were seen at the end of the dry season to document morbidity and mortality.
