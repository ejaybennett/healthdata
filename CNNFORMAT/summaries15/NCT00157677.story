(firstQuint)Selective D-Dimer Testing Compared With Uniform D-Dimer Testing in the Diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (SELECT).

 - Limiting use of D-dimer testing to outpatients with a Low or Moderate clinical pretest probability (C-PTP)for deep vein thrombosis AND using a D-dimer level of mu g FEU/mL to exclude deep vein thrombosis in those with a Low C-PTP, and a D-dimer level of mu g FEU/mL to exclude deep vein thrombosis in those with a Moderate C-PTP, is as safe and a more efficient way to diagnose DVT than: - Performing D-dimer testing in all patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis with use of a single D-dimer value of mu g FEU/mL to exclude thrombosis (current practice).

 All randomized patients, including those who are treated for deep vein thrombosis after initial testing, will be followed for a period of 3 months to monitor for signs and symptoms suggestive of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeds and death.

 Selective D-Dimer Testing Compared With Uniform D-Dimer Testing in the Diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (SELECT)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare two diagnostic interventions to improve the way D-dimer blood testing (MDA D-dimer) is used to diagnose first time symptomatic deep vein thrombosis.
