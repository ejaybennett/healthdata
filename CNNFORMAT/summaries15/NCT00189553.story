(secondQuint)Caelyx Plus Carboplatin Versus Paclitaxel Plus Carboplatin in Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer in Late Relapse.

 The main purpose of this research study is to find out if treatment of late relapse of ovarian or fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer with liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx) combined with carboplatin will control the tumor growth at least as well as standard treatment of paclitaxel and carboplatin.

 And it is hoped that substituting paclitaxel with Caelyx in combination with carboplatin will improve the tolerance of the treatment program with at least the same efficacy and fewer side effects.

 Caelyx Plus Carboplatin Versus Paclitaxel Plus Carboplatin in Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer in Late Relapse@highlight

This is a study of the efficacy and safety of Caelyx (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) in combination with carboplatin compared to the standard treatment of paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer in late relapse (> 6 months).
