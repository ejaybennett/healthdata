(secondQuint)Efficacy of 3,4-DAP in Fatigue Associated With Multiple Sclerosis.

 We proposed a randomized controlled trial between 3,4-diaminopyridine and placebo .

 The main objective : improvement of fatigue by diminution of EMIF-SEP score between the arm treatment and placebo arm.

 The hypothesis tested is that the 3,4-DAP is efficacy in the fatigue of multiple sclerosis.
