(fifthQuint)A Phase 2 Clinical Trial of the Safety and Effects of IRX-2 in Treating Patients With Operable Head and Neck Cancer.

 IRX-2 is a biologic product that contains multiple cytokines produced under pharmaceutical standards from phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated mononuclear cells obtained from normal healthy donors.

 The IRX-2 regimen is the combination of a 2-week course of IRX-2 itself, an initial low dose of cyclophosphamide and a 3-week course of indomethacin and zinc supplementation.

 The present study is based in large part on observations made during an exploratory Phase 1-2 study of the safety and efficacy of the IRX-2 regimen performed at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCAN), Mexico's National Cancer Institute.

 Patients with head and neck (HN) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were treated with the IRX-2 regimen, some as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery and some for advanced disease.

 Three different doses and dose schedules were studied.

 Evaluation of clinical safety included regular clinical and laboratory evaluations.

 In the patients treated before surgery, evaluation of tumor response was undertaken by comparison of tumor size before and after the IRX-2 regimen.

 This study provided preliminary evidence of the safety and possible efficacy of IRX-2 in the pre-surgical, neoadjuvant treatment of HN SCC.

 The regimen was well tolerated in most patients, and histological and clinical tumor responses were observed.

 The current study utilizes the same IRX-2 regimen evaluated in a more recent Phase 1 trial in patients with recurrent, refractory HN SCC performed at INCAN and the University of Kentucky, where the safety of the IRX-2 regimen was studied and some evidence of clinical activity was observed in 2 of 10 refractory patients.

 A Phase 2 Clinical Trial of the Safety and Effects of IRX-2 in Treating Patients With Operable Head and Neck Cancer@highlight

IRX-2 is designed to activate your own body's immune system so that it can better fight the invasion of head and neck cancer.

 In pre-clinical studies, IRX-2 has been shown to activate a number of different cells of the immune system.

 IRX-2 was previously tested in a study of 13 patients with advanced head and neck cancer who had been previously treated and failed chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

 The trials were specifically designed to test the safety of IRX-2.

 Researchers found that IRX-2 did not appear to have major side effects.

 Also, the researchers believed that further study in less advanced head and neck cancer patients could be useful in obtaining more data on the safety of IRX-2 as well as data on possible effects on tumors and on patient survival.
