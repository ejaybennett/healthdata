(fifthQuint)Vorinostat and Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Solid Tumors.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat (SAHA) and bortezomib in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

 II.

 Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive oral vorinostat (SAHA) twice daily on days 1-14 in step A.

 Patients receive oral vorinostat (SAHA) twice daily on days 1-4 and 8-11 in Step B and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 2, 5, 9, and 12 during the first course and on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 during subsequent courses in both steps A and B.

 Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 Up to 6 additional patients receive bortezomib at the MTD.

 Subsequent cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA until the MTD of that drug is determined.

 Vorinostat and Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Solid Tumors@highlight

This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat and bortezomib in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vorinostat, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Giving vorinostat together with bortezomib may kill more tumor cells.
