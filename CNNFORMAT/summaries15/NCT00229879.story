(firstQuint)Rare Tumor Case Review.

 We excised an intrapericardial teratoma tumor out of a child approximately one month ago.

 This is a very uncommon tumor overall, and even more uncommon in children.

 The majority of reports in the literature are single case reports I would like to report ours, as well as do a literature review to combine all of the cases and see if some conclusions can be made about this rare tumor in children.
