(thirdQuint)Pergolide Treatment and Valvular Heart Disease.

 Some case reports and a single study, which included 78 Parkinson patients, has found a correlation between treatment with the ergotamine derivative dopamine agonists (pergolide) and restrictive valvular heart disease.

 The mechanisms are thought to be the same as with the former used anorectikum, fenfluramine and other drugs stimulating the 5HT-2B receptor.

 In a blinded manner we make physiologic and echocardiographic examination on 160 Parkinson patients treated with either ergotamine or non-ergotamine derivative dopamine agonists (80 patients in each group) to see whether Parkinson patients treated with ergotamine derivatives have more heart valvular disease.

 Pergolide Treatment and Valvular Heart Disease@highlight

In a blinded echocardiographic study we investigate the frequency of valvular abnormalities in a group of Parkinson patients treated with either ergot derived dopamine agonists (pergolide and cabergoline) or non-ergot derived dopamine agonists (pramipexole and ropinirole).

 The ability to detect patients with valvular abnormalities by clinical approach is examined.
