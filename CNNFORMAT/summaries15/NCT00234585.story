(secondQuint)Prospective Randomized Study Comparing Renal Artery Stenting (RESIST)With/Without Distal Protection.

 This study is designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using protective device/drug to prevent renal injury during renal artery stenting (RAS) and to assess whether the preventative effects are measurable, and if there is a differential treatment effect for either device alone or in combination.

 Specific goals of the study include: - To establish device and drug safety - To identify appropriate markers for renal injury - To measure effectiveness of drug and device - To enable the design of FDA efficacy trials for renal artery stenting inclusive of device and or drug The study will address the four following hypotheses: - AngioGuard cent distal protection device provides significant protection from atheroembolization during RAS procedures as measured by affected kidney GFR at 1 month after the procedure.

 - Abciximab (ReoPro) offers protection against platelet aggregation and embolization as measured by affected kidney GFR at 1 month after the procedure.

 - AngioGuard cent and Abciximab are safe, alone and in combination.

 - Is there an interaction effect between AngioGuard cent and ReoPro for efficacy and safety?.
