(firstQuint)Wait and See Antibiotic Prescription for Acute Otitis Media: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

 We conducted a randomized, controlled trial evaluating a consecutive series of children diagnosed with AOM during a one year period in an urban pediatric emergency department, utilizing diagnostic recommendations from contemporary evidence-based guidelines.

 The objectives of the study were to determine whether treatment of AOM using a "Wait and See Prescription" (WASP) significantly reduces use of antimicrobials compared with a "Standard Prescription" (SP) and to evaluate the effects of this intervention on clinical symptoms and adverse outcomes related to antibiotic use.
