(firstQuint)Use or Non-use of Epoetin Beta in Patients Infected by Chronic Hepatitis C.

 Show that the correction of anemia by epoetin beta (NeoRecormon(R)) able to maintain a optimal dose of ribavirin (Copegus(R)).

 The study compares two therapeutic strategies : use or non-use of epoetin beta (NeoRecormon(R)) in patients infected by chronic hepatitis C and treated by combination therapy Peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys(R)) plus ribavirin (Copegus(R)).

 The main judgement criteria are : - Sustained Viral Response (Week 72) - Viral Response at the End of Treatment (Week 48) - Quality of life - Cumulative dose of ribavirin from D0-W24 and from W24-W48 periods - Clinical and biological tolerance.
