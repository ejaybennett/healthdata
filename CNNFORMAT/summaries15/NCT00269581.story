(firstQuint)Headstrong Intervention for Pediatric Headache.

 Children, 7-12 years, with recurrent headaches are randomly assigned to an educational CD-ROM program or the Headstrong CD-ROM program.

 We anticipate that those assigned to the active (Headstrong) program group will have significantly greater reductions in headache frequency, duration, and severity and improvements in mood and quality of life.
