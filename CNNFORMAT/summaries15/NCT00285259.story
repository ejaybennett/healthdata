(fifthQuint)Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Vaccine in Donors and Recipients Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT).

 This study was run by Vical and the record was transferred to Astellas on 1/8/2013.

 Trial will enroll up to 240 subjects (160 recipients and 80 donors).

 Qualified donors and/or CMV-seropositive recipients (donor/recipient pairs or recipient-only subjects) will be assigned randomly to receive either a CMV vaccine or a placebo vaccine.

 Donors will receive 3 vaccines prior to donation and recipients will receive 1 vaccine pretransplant and up to three vaccines posttransplant.

 Recipients will be followed for up to 1 year after transplant to evaluate the safety of the vaccine and to see if there is a clinical benefit in the group that received the CMV vaccine.

 The incidence rates of CMV infection, disease, and other complications from immunosuppression and/or transplantation will be studied.

 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Vaccine in Donors and Recipients Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT)@highlight

The purpose of this trial is to evaluate a CMV vaccine given to related donor/recipient pairs (donors prior to peripheral blood stem cell donation and CMV-seropositive recipients just before and after transplantation) and CMV-seropositive recipient-only subjects (related or unrelated) to determine incidence rates of CMV infection, disease, and other complications from immunosuppression and/or transplantation.

 The outcomes for the groups receiving CMV vaccine will be compared to the outcomes for the group that received the placebo vaccine to see if there is a clinical benefit.

 For this trial, donors and recipients must have matched HLA genotype (matched at 5/6 or 6/6 HLA loci).
