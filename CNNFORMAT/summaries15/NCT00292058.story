(firstQuint)Comparing Telepsychiatry and in-Person Outcomes.

 We predict that patients referred by their family physician for a psychiatric consultation and, if needed, short-term follow-up will have equivalent clinical outcomes when seen via telepsychiatry as compared to those patients seen in-person.

 We also predicted that telepsychiatry will be cheaper than in-person care.

Study Design: a single-centre equivalence trial.

We will use a sample size calculation and analytical methods that are specifically tailored for equivalence trials.

 Comparing Telepsychiatry and in-Person Outcomes@highlight

Psychiatric consultation and short-term follow-up will produce equivalent clinical outcomes and be less costly when provided via videoconferencing (telepsychiatry) than when provided in-person.
