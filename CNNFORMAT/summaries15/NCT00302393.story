(fifthQuint)Study Examining Repeat Dosing of OROS Methylphenidate (CONCERTA) and Immediate Release Methylphenidate in Healthy Adults.

 ROS-MPH's pharmacokinetic profile uses an increasing delivery of MPH over the day (ascending pharmacokinetic curve).

 It was designed to replace IR-MPH TID treatment.

 The main target of MPH in the brain is the dopamine transporter (DAT).

 We have an exquisitely sensitive methodology to measure DAT occupancy using C-11 Altropane and Positron Emission Tomography (PET).

 The time course of decay of the C-11 Altropane permits repeated imaging, thus allowing documentation of the pharmacokinetics of DAT receptor occupancy.

 We will test all combinations of initial administration and then delayed (repeated) administration of the two formulations: IR-MPH to IR-MPH; IR-MPH to OROS-MPH; OROS-MPH to IR-MPH; and OROS-MPH to OROS-MPH.

 Study Examining Repeat Dosing of OROS Methylphenidate (CONCERTA) and Immediate Release Methylphenidate in Healthy Adults@highlight

There are two specific aims of this study.

 The first is to document the pharmacokinetics of dopamine transporter (DAT) receptor occupancy of repeated administration of orally administered, therapeutic doses of a short immediate release-methylphenidate hydrochloride (IR-MPH) and a long-acting formulation of MPH (OROS-MPH) using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with C-11 altropane as the ligand.

 The investigators hypothesize that central nervous system (CNS) DAT occupancy of the OROS-MPH to IR-MPH sequence will be greater than that of IR-MPH to OROS-MPH sequence at 5 hours after the initial administration and that the CNS DAT occupancy of the other two formulations will be intermediate.

 The second aim of this study is to assess whether the abuse liability potential of delayed, repeated administrations of different formulations of MPH is moderated by the oral delivery system in which a delivery system with slower onset may be safer than one with more rapid early release.
