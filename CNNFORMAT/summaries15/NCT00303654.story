(thirdQuint)Loop Resectoscope in Treating Patients With Bladder Cancer or Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Who Are Undergoing Transurethral Resection.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy, in terms of mechanical capabilities, of the Roei loop resectoscope in patients with bladder cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia undergoing transurethral resection of bladder tumor or benign prostatic adenoma.

 - Determine the quality of specimens submitted for histological analysis from patients undergoing this procedure.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

 Patients undergo transurethral resection using the Roei loop resectoscope.

 Surgeon satisfaction with the Roei loop resectoscope is measured by a self-assessment questionnaire.

 The quality of specimens submitted for histological study are also assessed.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Loop Resectoscope in Treating Patients With Bladder Cancer or Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Who Are Undergoing Transurethral Resection@highlight

RATIONALE: Transurethral resection is a less invasive type of surgery for bladder cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia.

 Transurethral resection using a loop resectoscope may have fewer side effects and improve recovery.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well the loop resectoscope works in treating patients with bladder cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia who are undergoing transurethral resection.
