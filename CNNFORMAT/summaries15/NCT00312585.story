(firstQuint)Acupuncture for the Prevention of Postdates Pregnancy.

 There are certain medical conditions that can complicate pregnancies after 40 weeks gestation.

 However, it is not always safe or easy to put these women into labor.

 Acupuncture has been used in Asia for hundreds of years to induce contractions and begin the labor process.

 Acupuncture is not typically used in the United States to induce labor, however.

 The purpose of this study is to determine whether a series of up to five acupuncture treatments can prevent postdates pregnancy.
