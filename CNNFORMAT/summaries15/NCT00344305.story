(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Shedding and Safety of Trivalent Influenza Virus Vaccine Live, Intranasal in Infants and Young Children.

 This was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study designed to evaluate vaccine virus shedding and safety of trivalent influenza virus vaccine live, intranasal in children 6 to < 60 months of age.

 Enrollment of approximately 200 participants was stratified by age, with 100 participants 6 to < 24 months of age (who reached their sixth month but not their second year birthday) and 100 participants 24 to < 60 months of age (who reached their second year but not their fifth year birthday).

 Baseline medical history data collection included the participants prior receipt of influenza vaccine or history of laboratory-confirmed influenza illness in the previous influenza season.
