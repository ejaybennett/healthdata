(firstQuint)N-Acetyl Cysteine in Trichotillomania.

 The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) in trichotillomania.

 Forty subjects with DSM-IV trichotillomania will receive 12 weeks of double-blind NAC or placebo.

 The hypothesis to be tested is that NAC will be effective and well tolerated in patients with trichotillomania compared to placebo.

 The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.
