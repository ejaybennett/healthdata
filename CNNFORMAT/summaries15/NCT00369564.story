(fifthQuint)Glutamic Acid in Reducing Nerve Damage Caused by Vincristine in Young Patients With Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the effect of glutamic acid vs placebo, in terms of decreasing neurotoxicity as measured by a scored neurologic examination, in young patients undergoing vincristine-containing treatment for Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 Secondary - Compare the frequency and types of neurotoxicity observed in patients treated with glutamic acid versus placebo.

 - Determine if a greater proportion of patients receiving glutamic acid are able to receive 100% of their scheduled doses of vincristine versus those not treated with glutamic acid.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to disease and duration of planned vincristine-containing treatment (Wilms' tumor or rhabdomyosarcoma with treatment planned for 9 consecutive weeks [stratum 1] vs acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with treatment planned for 4 consecutive weeks [stratum 2]).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive oral glutamic acid 3 times daily beginning prior to the first dose of vincristine and continuing through week 5 (stratum 2) for a total of 4 doses of vincristine or week 10 (stratum 1) for a total of 9 doses of vincristine.

 - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 3 times daily beginning prior to the first dose of vincristine and continuing through week 5 (stratum 2) for a total of 4 doses of vincristine or week 10 (stratum 1) for a total of 9 doses of vincristine.

 All patients undergo neurologic examination at baseline and at 5 weeks.

 Patients in stratum 1 also undergo additional neurologic examination at week 10.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Glutamic Acid in Reducing Nerve Damage Caused by Vincristine in Young Patients With Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Glutamic acid may help lessen or prevent nerve damage caused by vincristine.

 It is not yet known whether glutamic acid is more effective than a placebo in preventing nerve damage in patients receiving vincristine for Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying glutamic acid to see how well it works compared to a placebo in reducing nerve damage caused by vincristine in young patients receiving vincristine for Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
