(fifthQuint)MRI in Predicting Tumor Reponse After Radiofrequency Ablation in Women With Invasive Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine if radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can induce complete tumor necrosis in women with invasive breast cancer.

 Secondary - Determine whether breast MRI can accurately predict residual cancer and tumor necrosis in patients treated with RFA.

 - Determine the toxicity of RFA in these patients.

 - Determine the cosmetic outcome after RFA in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a prospective, nonrandomized study.

 Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) using gadopentetate dimeglumine.

 Within the next few days, patients undergo radiofrequency ablation (RFA) over approximately 20-30 minutes.

 Patients then undergo a second DCE-MRI 3 to 21 days after RFA, followed by definitive surgery (standard mastectomy or lumpectomy).

 Pathologic confirmation of the post-ablation DCE-MRI findings is performed within 1 to 21 days after the second MRI.

 Tumor cell viability and proliferative activity are assessed by immunohistochemical and biomarker analysis.

 MRI in Predicting Tumor Reponse After Radiofrequency Ablation in Women With Invasive Breast Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses a high-frequency, electric current to kill tumor cells.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may help in learning how well radiofrequency ablation works to kill breast cancer cells and help doctors predict whether breast cancer cells remain after treatment.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well MRI works in predicting tumor response after radiofrequency ablation in women with invasive breast cancer.
