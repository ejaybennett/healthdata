(fifthQuint)Affect Management Group for Adult Survivors of Childhood Trauma.

 Problems of self regulation, e.

g.

 emotional dysfunction, represent a core symptom of adult patients with traumatic childhood experiences.

 Since sufficient capacity for self soothing and emotional regulation are essential for trauma exposure, modern trauma therapy concepts are phase-oriented, beginning with working on "stabilization".

 The study intends to evaluate the efficiency of a 14-week group therapy for adult survivors of relational trauma in childhood.

 Main interventions are psychoeducation about the sequelae of childhood trauma, teaching of skills for affect regulation and techniques for activating resources.

 Inclusion criteria are clinical significant problems with self-regulation and the presence of childhood trauma.

 Outcome measures are based on self-rating questionnaires, clinical interviews and an experimental computer-task at timepoint pre-, post- and 3-month-follow-up.

 There is no control condition in the pilot-study phase.
