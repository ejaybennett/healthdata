(thirdQuint)Pharmacokinetic Study in Cerebral Spinal Fluid After a Single Dose of AVI-4020.

 AVI-4020 was designed to interfere with West Nile virus translation, and has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier in both normal and inflamed meninges in a clinical study in patients with severe West Nile virus disease.

 At issue, is whether this observation is limited to AVI-4020 PMO drug, or is observed with other PMO drugs.

 This study is one of three to assess the specific ability of PMO drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier, using similar dosing, and PK assessment time points.

 In order to rigorously assess the pharmacokinetics, this study is being performed in healthy volunteers at a single point in time.

 The ability of other PMO drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier will set the stage for future studies that exploit this product characteristic.

During a clinical study of people with severe West Nile virus infections, it was determined that the drug AVI-4020 crossed the blood-brain barrier.

 This study will assess the amount of drug that goes across the blood-brain barrier and the drug levels measured in both the blood and urine.

 The objective of this study is to find out how much and how fast this drug crosses this barrier.
