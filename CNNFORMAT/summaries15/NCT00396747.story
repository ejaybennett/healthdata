(secondQuint)A Comparison of Methotrexate Alone or Combined to Infliximab or to Pulse Methylprednisolone in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.

 The effects of Glucocorticoids and Infliximab have never been compared in early RA using MRI as primary outcome measure.

 In the current study, we compare the effects of MTX alone or in combination with intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (MP) pulse therapy or IFX on MRI-detected synovitis, bone edema and erosive changes in early RA patients.
