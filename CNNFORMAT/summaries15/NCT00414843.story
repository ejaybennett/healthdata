(firstQuint)Storage of Bile From Routine Procedures to Study Risk Factors.

 The specific aim of this study is to establish a repository of human bile to serve as a resource for studies looking at molecular predictors of biliary tract cancer.

 The development of fluid based biomarkers will enable early diagnosis in at-risk individuals with a recognized risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, as well as provide surveillance mechanisms for screening populations where biliary tract cancer has a high incidence.
