(firstQuint)Pharmacokinetic Study of Two HIV Protease Inhibitors in Patients.

 Thirty patients with HIV infection will be enrolled in this open-label, parallel arm pharmacokinetic study.

 Subjects receiving either lopinavir/ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir as part of their antiretroviral therapy will have a pharmacokinetic study performed over 12-20 days to examine whether coadministration of lopinavir and atazanavir alters the pharmacokinetics of either agent.

 The safety of these agents in combination will also be explored.
