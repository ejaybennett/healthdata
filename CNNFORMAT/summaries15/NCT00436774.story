(fifthQuint)Treatment Outcome and Quality of Life in Patients With Pediatric Extra-Cranial Germ Cell Tumors Previously Treated on Clinical Trial CCLG-GC-1979-01 or CCLG-GC-1989-01.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the late effects of treatment and the quality-of-life of patients with germ cell tumors (GCT) previously treated on clinical trial CCLG-GC-1979-01 or CCLG-GC-1989-01.

 - Evaluate the late effects of carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin in patients treated on clinical trial CCLG-GC-1989-01.

 - Determine the toxicity of bleomycin and a combination of either cisplatin and vinblastine, etoposide and cisplatin, or carboplatin and etoposide in patients treated on clinical trial CCLG-GC-1979-01.

 - Evaluate tumor-associated/surgical morbidity (bladder, bowel, and lower limb function) in patients with malignant sacrococcygeal tumors treated in these clinical trials.

 - Evaluate tumor-associated/surgical morbidity (sexual function/fertility) in patients with malignant gonadal or pelvic GCTs.

 - Evaluate tumor-associated/surgical morbidity (respiratory function) in patients with thoracic GCTs.

 - Develop a methodology and recommendations for the prospective late evaluation of patients treated on future extracranial GCT clinical trials and those included in this study.

 - Inform clinicians about the late effects of treatment of malignant GCTs and advise them on what long-term care these patients require.

 OUTLINE: This is a cohort, multicenter study.

 Patients complete questionnaires about ototoxicity, bladder and bowel dysfunction, and sexual function and fertility as appropriate.

 They also complete a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire over 20 minutes.

 Treating physicians complete a lower-limb and neurologic dysfunction questionnaire.

 Data from myelodysplasia, second malignancy, ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity assessments are collected from the patient's treating physician.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Treatment for pediatric extracranial germ cell tumors may cause side effects and secondary cancers later in life.

 A study that evaluates patients after receiving combination chemotherapy or surgery may help doctors understand the side effects and secondary cancers that occur later in life.

 PURPOSE: This study is looking at treatment outcome and quality of life in patients with pediatric extracranial germ cell tumors previously treated on clinical trial CCLG-GC-1979-01 or CCLG-GC-1989-01.
