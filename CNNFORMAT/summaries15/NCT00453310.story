(thirdQuint)Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Germ Cell Tumors That Have Relapsed or Not Responded to Treatment.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of sunitinib malate in patients with refractory or relapsed metastatic germ cell tumors.

 Secondary - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the time to tumor response and duration of tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is a open-label study.

 Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28.

 Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 28 days and then periodically thereafter.

 Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Germ Cell Tumors That Have Relapsed or Not Responded to Treatment@highlight

RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with metastatic germ cell tumors that have relapsed or not responded to treatment.
