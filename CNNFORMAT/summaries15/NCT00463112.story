(fifthQuint)Effect of Diet Plus Sibutramine on Hormonal and Metabolic Features in Overweight and Obese Women With PCOS.

 The Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common hormonal disorders in women of reproductive age.

 As a syndrome it has multiple components, such as reproductive (chronic anovulation and infertility), metabolic and cardiovascular.

 Although lean women present PCOS, obesity is one of the main manifestations of the syndrome.

 Androgen excess and insulin resistance underline much of the clinical and metabolic features of the syndrome.

 Recent evidence suggests that PCOS patients have a substantial risk for the development of metabolic and cardiovascular abnormalities similar to those presented in the metabolic syndrome.

 Obesity, particularly of the abdominal type, is presented in approximately half of the women with PCOS, although several studies have shown that percentage can vary from 30% to 75%.

 Several studies have demonstrated that obesity in women with PCOS enhances the clinical and metabolic abnormalities of the syndrome, since obese women with PCOS have more profound insulin resistance or type 2 DM,dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease's risk, and greater level of androgens due to low SHBG levels.

 A modest weight loss (4), 17a-hydroxyprogesterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), glucose, and insulin were taken at baseline as well as at 3 and 6 months of treatment.

 At the same period, an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGGT) with 75-g glucose was performed.

 Blood samples were collected between 08:30 and 09:00 a.

, after an overnight fast, and during the follicular phase of women's menstrual cycle.

 Monthly, subjects' body weight was measured, adverse events, heart rate, blood pressure, and study drug compliance were determined and a pregnancy urine test was performed.

 Body weight was always determined at morning hours with subjects in light clothes.

 Effect of Diet Plus Sibutramine on Hormonal and Metabolic Features in Overweight and Obese Women With PCOS@highlight

Studies on the effect of sibutramine, an anti-obesity drug, on hormonal and metabolic features of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are lacking.

 The objective of this study is to examine the effect of sibutramine plus hypocaloric diet on body composition, hormonal and metabolic parameters and insulin resistance in obese patients with PCOS.

 Overweight and obese women with PCOS were placed in a hypocaloric diet plus sibutramine (10 mg/day) for the first month and then on a hypocaloric diet plus sibutramine (10 mg/day) or hypocaloric diet only for the subsequent 6 months.

 The main outcome measures are: Body composition, hormonal and metabolic features and insulin sensitivity (OGTT) at baseline, at 3 and 6 months of treatment.
