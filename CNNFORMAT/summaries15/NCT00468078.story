(firstQuint)Efficacy and Safety of F-18 FPCIT PET in Parkinson's Disease and Essential Tremor Patients.

 Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder with loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum.

 Essential tremor is one of the conditions most commonly misdiagnosed as parkinsonism, and early clinical differentiation between these conditions can be difficult.

 F-18 FPCIT is a promising radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging to assess the dopamine transporter in the striatum.
