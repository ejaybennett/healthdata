(fifthQuint)Does Heme Oxygenase-1 Induction Ameliorate Cardiac Injury After Myocardial Infarction?.

 The interventional part of this study is a single centre safety and dose defining pilot study in which patients are allocated to heme arginate infusion for 1 day (hem-1d), heme arginate infusion for 2 days, or heme arginate infusion during 3 days (hem-3d) in consecutive order.

 So, the three patient groups consist of three intervention groups.

 Based upon the pharmacokinetic data in porphyria patients (3 mg/kg/day for 4-7 days), the investigators rationalize that 3 fixed doses of heme arginate will be the optimal dose to counter attack the acute phase after NSTEMI.

 Longer infusion of heme arginate seems at this moment not rational.

 The investigators will first administer in 10 patients 1 dose of heme arginate (hem-1d, day 0) to assess safety.

 If safety is assured in the hem-1d group, 10 patients will receive two days of heme arginate infusion (day 0 and 1).

 After this group is completed and safety is assured, the third group (n = 10) will receive heme arginate infusion in three consecutive days after NSTEMI (day 0, 1 and 2 after admission).

 Heme arginate is considered safe in NSTEMI patients if no adverse events occur in the consecutive groups.

 To assess safety during the course of the study the following possible events are monitored: - New onset of myocardial infarction with ST-elevation (STEMI); - Cardiac decompensation; - Sustained ventricular arrhythmia requiring defibrillation; - All cause death; - Drop of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of more than 20 mmHg (MAP is defined as 2 x diastolic blood pressure + 1 x systolic blood pressure divided by 3 (MAP = 2 x Pdias + Psys / 3)); - Eosinophilia (> 0.

5 x 109/l) in combination with fever and/or rash and/or shivering or anaphylactic shock; - Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine above 300 mu mol/l); - ASAT or ALAT are elevated to at least 3 times the upper limit of normal; - Severe hematological abnormalities, defined as thrombocytopenia -GT, AP, LDH), clotting times (INR, APTT, PT), electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, Mg) and furthermore regular hematology (Hb, Ht, thrombocytes) and chemistry (Blood Urea Nitrogen, Creatinine, CK, CK-MB, Troponin T, Brain Natriuretic Peptide, VEGF and Erythropoietin).

 All participants will also be asked for blood to assess DNA polymorphisms affecting HO-1 activity, such as HO-1 polymorphisms, and for assessment of quality of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs).

 Total number included patients into the interventional part of this study will be 30 patients.

 Follow-up is completed 6 months after inclusion of the last patient.

 The investigators estimate inclusion will take approximately 6 months.

 The study duration therefore comes to a total of at least 12 months.

 The maximal duration of the study will be 18 months, including analysis of the results.

 In addition, two groups of patients will be asked in the non-interventional part of this study: 1.

 The investigators hypothesize that due to the acute coronary syndrome HO-1 is activated, but at too low levels to have clinical benefit.

 To determine the time course for HO-1 activity and its degradation products after NSTEMI, the investigators will draw blood and perform all the same assays in 15 patients with NSTEMI as described above.

 It is not possible to use the same assays executed in the interventional part of this study, for heme arginate infusion will interfere with the outcomes.

 2.

 As healthy controls for the blood tests and to gain insight in normal levels of HO-1 activity, the investigators will draw blood and do the same baseline assays in 15 patients with non-typical angina pectoris in whom no cardiac disease could be detected from our out-patient clinic.

 All these patients will be asked to participate in the non-intervention part of this study, receive a separate information letter and will sign an informed consent form.

 If consent is given, blood is drawn via venipuncture.

 Does Heme Oxygenase-1 Induction Ameliorate Cardiac Injury After Myocardial Infarction?@highlight

Rationale: A safety and dose defining study in which the investigators hypothesize that in patients with acute coronary syndrome without ST-elevation (NSTEMI) treatment with heme arginate results in better clinical outcome by inducing the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway.

 Objective: 1) Is induction of HO-1 and its degradation products, especially bilirubin, safe in patients with an acute coronary syndrome without ST-elevation; 2) What is the optimal effective dose to administer in patients with NSTEMI; 3) Are HO-1 and its degradation products endogenously activated in patients with acute coronary syndrome; 4) Does treatment with heme arginate result in a less cardiac damage; 5) Which other cardioprotecting pathways are activated by administration of heme arginate? Study population: Male and female patients with confirmed acute coronary syndrome without ST-elevation, between 18 - 80 yr old.

 Intervention: 10 patients receive a single administration of heme arginate (3 mg/kg), administered intravenously in 15 minutes directly after admission; 10 patients receive two administrations of heme arginate (3 mg/kg) on day 0 and 1; 10 patients receive three administrations of heme arginate (3 mg/kg) on day 0, 1 and 2 after admission, administered intravenously in 15 minutes.

 To determine endogenous levels of HO-1 and time course of HO-1 activation after NSTEMI, blood is drawn and the same assays are performed in 15 patients with NSTEMI.

 As controls for the blood tests, blood is drawn and the same assays are performed in 15 patients with non-typical angina pectoris in whom no cardiac disease could be detected from the investigators out-patient clinic.

 Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is the incidence rate of adverse events between the three treated groups.

 This includes hemodynamic monitoring, rhythm monitoring and biochemical and hematological difference between the three treated groups.

 Secondary endpoints are the differences from baseline between heme arginate treated groups in activity of the HO-1 pathway, including, but not limited to, HO-1 activity, free heme, bilirubin (direct and indirect) levels, serum ferritin, and carbon monoxide (CO).

 Furthermore, differences between heme arginate treated groups on NTproBNP, CK-MB and Troponin T and difference between heme arginate treated subjects in LVEF measured by echocardiography, 3 and 7 days and 6 months after NSTEMI.
