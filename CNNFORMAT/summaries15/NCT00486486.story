(thirdQuint)24-hour Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Control With the Bimatoprost/Timolol Fixed Combination.

 PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES - To show that the mean 24-hour IOP control obtained with BTFC (morning or evening) is statistically better to that with bimatoprost monotherapy given once on the evening.

 - To demonstrate that the fixed combination will provide a significantly better IOP control in the morning when dosed in the evening.

 - To test whether the mean 24-hour IOP control obtained with BTFC given once in the evening may be statistically better to that with BTFC given once in the morning.

 - To show whether there will be less 24-hour fluctuation of IOP with the evening dosing of BTFC.

 STUDY POPULATION Consecutive newly-diagnosed, or suitably washed-out patients with exfoliative glaucoma (XFG) who exhibit a mean untreated IOP greater than 25 mm Hg at baseline (10:00).

 24-hour Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Control With the Bimatoprost/Timolol Fixed Combination@highlight

The objective of this crossover, randomized, placebo controlled, double-masked study is to compare the short-term (12 weeks) mean 24-hour IOP control and safety of the new fixed combination (bimatoprost/timolol, BTFC) given PM with placebo once in the morning, versus BTFC given AM with placebo once in the evening versus bimatoprost given in the evening in patients with exfoliative glaucoma (XFG).
