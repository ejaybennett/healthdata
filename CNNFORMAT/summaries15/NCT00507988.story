(secondQuint)Complex Problem Solving Training in Schizophrenic Patients.

 In patients with schizophrenia, cognitive deficits often lead to an impairment in daily life.

 This observation has led to the development of cognitive training packages aiming a improving these deficits.

 However, it is far from clear which level of cognitive functioning provides the best target for cognitive interventions.

 Traditionally, training has aimed a basic cognitive functions like attention and memory.

 In the present study we aim at a higher-level of function, namely planning and problem-solving skills, which are trained using the software package Plan-A-Day.

 The primary hypothesis is that complex problem solving training improved functional capacity more than traditional training programs addressing basic cognitive function.
