(firstQuint)Prayer as a Possible Adjuvant Treatment for Breast Cancer.

 The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate certain biological mechanisms that may underlie the beneficial effects seen among cancer patients who pray.

 It will evaluate the effect of prayer on humoral (including biochemical/physiological inflammatory/immune) parameters, monitor changes in cancer related biomarkers and evaluate the effect of prayer on blood pressure, quality of life, health and dietary habits in relation to prayer activities, using validated questionnaires.
