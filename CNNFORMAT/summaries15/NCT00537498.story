(secondQuint)Urokinase Therapy in Diabetic Foot Syndrome.

 Patients with diabetic foot ulceration and critical limb ischemia have a high risk of major amputation especially if limbs cannot be revascularized.

 Urokinase is effective in improving the microcirculation in critical limb ischemia by lowering fibrinogen and might improve outcomes.

 There are however no data on the efficacy and safety of urokinase treatment in terms of survival free of major amputation, ulcer healing and the rate of minor and major bleeding.

 Therefore this trial is conducted to investigate the effect of urokinase treatment on these parameters.

 Urokinase Therapy in Diabetic Foot Syndrome@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a treatment with urokinase (500 000 or 1 000 000 IU) can lead to ulcer-healing, lower rate of major amputation, and prolonged survival in patients with diabetic foot syndrome.
