(fifthQuint)Arginine/Omega-3 Fatty Acids/Nucleotides Nutritional Supplement in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Head and Neck Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy.

 OBJECTIVES: - Assess the effects of immunomodulator arginine/omega-3 fatty acids/nucleotides oral supplement (Oral IMPACT(R)) administered via percutaneous gastrostomy during adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III or IV epidermoid head and neck cancer.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 1/2 weeks.

 Patients receive cisplatin IV during weeks 1, 4, and 7 of radiotherapy.

 Patients also receive arginine/omega-3 fatty acids/nucleotides oral supplement (Oral IMPACT(R)) via percutaneous gastrostomy tube 3 times daily for 5 days before each chemotherapy treatment.

RATIONALE: Giving a nutritional supplement containing arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, and nucleotides to patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy may stimulate the immune system and help the body build a stronger immune response.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well an arginine/omega-3 fatty acids/nucleotides nutritional supplement works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
