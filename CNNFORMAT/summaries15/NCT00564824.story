(fifthQuint)The Impact of Caffeine on Brachial Endothelial Function in Healthy Subjects and in Patients With Ischemic Heart Disease.

 Background: Prior work (Chris, M.

 et al, Clinical Science 2005; 109, 55-60) has demonstrated that drinking a cup of coffee (80-100 mg of caffeine) an hour before endothelium-dependent FMD (flow-mediated dilatation) of the brachial artery, effects endothelial function in healthy adults subjects.

 This effect might be attributed to caffeine, given that decaffeinated coffee ( 12 hours and absence of > 48 hour caffeine consumption, patients will receive 200 mg of caffeine tablets or placebo, in a double-blind, cross-over study design.

 An hour later the patient will undergo endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and endothelium-independent, nitroglycerin (NTG)-mediated vasodilation will be assessed non-invasively in the brachial artery, using a high resolution (15 MHz) linear array ultrasound.

 Prior to and after the FMD, blood will be drawn to test caffeine levels, adiponectin, CBC, electrolytes, CRP and lipids.

 The Impact of Caffeine on Brachial Endothelial Function in Healthy Subjects and in Patients With Ischemic Heart Disease@highlight

Prior work (Chris, M.

 et al, Clinical Science 2005; 109, 55-60) has demonstrated that drinking a cup of coffee (80-100 mg of caffeine) an hour before endothelium-dependent FMD (flow-mediated dilatation) of the brachial artery, effects endothelial function in healthy adults subjects.

 This effect might be attributed to caffeine, given that decaffeinated coffee (<2 mg of caffeine) was not associated with any change in endothelial performance.

 In the current study we intend to further examine the impact of caffeine on brachial endothelial function among healthy subjects & in patients with proven ischemic heart disease.
