(firstQuint)Detection of Coronary Stenosis With Intravenous Microbubbles.

 The objective of this clinical study will be to visualize both coronary and carotid arteries as well as detect myocardial perfusion following a routine intravenous injection of Definity (0.

05-0.

20 millimeters), Optison (0.

1-0.

4 millimeters) or PESDA (0.

05-0.

2 mL).

 Following these injections , we will attempt to Contrast Pulse Sequencing on the Siemens Acuson Sequoia system to image both the coronary and carotid arteries, as well as the Myocardial perfusion.
