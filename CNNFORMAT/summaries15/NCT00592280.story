(fifthQuint)Two-Layer Method Preservation and Resuscitation of the Cadaveric Pancreas Before Transplantation.

 Two-Layer Method (TLM) preservation consists of a storage chamber containing a layer of highly oxygenated, water-immiscible liquid perfluorocarbon (perfluorodecalin, C10F18) surmounted by a layer of conventional UW (or similar) organ preservation solution.

 The perfluorocarbon is sufficiently dense (~2 g/ml) that the pancreas floats on top of it, in contact with both layers.

 The perfluorocarbon combines low toxicity with an oxygen content 75 times greater than the UW solution used in standard pancreas storage.

 When preserved under these conditions, the pancreas absorbs oxygen by diffusion and steadily consumes it, supporting sufficient aerobic metabolism to maintain tissue ATP concentrations at near-physiologic levels and prevent, or even reverse, pancreas anoxic injury.

 In animal models of pancreas ischemic and storage injury, TLM preservation has been strikingly successful at improving the outcome of both islet isolation and pancreas transplantation.

 Two-Layer Method Preservation and Resuscitation of the Cadaveric Pancreas Before Transplantation@highlight

The purpose of this project is to compare the effect of oxygenated preservation of the pancreas before transplantation using the "Two-Layer Method" (TLM) against outcomes previously experienced with organs preserved using only standard University of Wisconsin (UW) storage solution.

 It is our hypothesis that TLM preservation will reduce the frequency and severity of complications of pancreas transplantation, increase the number of organs acceptable for transplantation, and spare individual patients and their families suffering and hardship.
