(thirdQuint)Viral Therapy in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Primary Peritoneal Cancer, or Fallopian Tube Cancer That Did Not Respond to Platinum Chemotherapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the safety and tolerability of intravenous (IV) and intraperitoneal (IP) administration of wild-type reovirus (REOLYSIN(R)).

 II.

 Determine the maximum tolerated dose of IP REOLYSIN(R) when used with a fixed dose of IV REOLYSIN(R).

 III.

 Determine the objective response rate (complete response and partial response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria) of treatment with IV and IP REOLYSIN(R) in patients with recurrent, platinum-refractory ovarian epithelial, peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma.

 (Phase II) (phase II closed as of 1/7/2011).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To identify viral replication in tumor following IV reovirus.

 II.

 To identify anti-reovirus antibodies in patients being treated with IV and IP REOLYSIN(R) therapy.

 III.

 To identify viral replication in the abdominal washings of patients undergoing IV and IP REOLYSIN(R) therapy.

 IV.

 To correlate response to therapy with Ras oncogene status.

 V.

 To evaluate double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase activity in tumors.

 VI.

 To correlate molecular predictors of response to REOLYSIN(R) therapy.

 OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of intraperitoneal (IP) wild-type reovirus when administered with fixed dose IV wild-type reovirus.

 PHASE I: Patients receive wild-type reovirus IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5 in course 1, followed by insertion of an IP access port.

 Beginning in course 2, patients receive wild-type reovirus IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5 and wild-type reovirus IP over 10 minutes on days 1 and 2*.

 Treatment with IV and IP wild-type reovirus repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 PHASE II: Patients undergo IP access port insertion before beginning treatment.

 Patients receive wild-type reovirus IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5 and IP (at the maximum tolerated dose determined in phase I) over 10 minutes on days 1 and 2*.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (phase II closed as of 1/7/2011).

 NOTE: *Patients receive IP wild-type reovirus on days 2 and 3 in course 3.

 Prior to each IP wild-type reovirus administration, normal saline is administered through the IP catheter and withdrawn for correlative studies in courses 2 and 3 (phase I) or courses 1 and 2 (phase II).

 Patients also undergo a CT-guided percutaneous tumor biopsy on day 2 of course 3 (phase I or II).

 Samples are analyzed by immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and electron microscopy for the relevant molecular effects of wild-type reovirus on tumor and normal tissue.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 12 weeks.

 Viral Therapy in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Primary Peritoneal Cancer, or Fallopian Tube Cancer That Did Not Respond to Platinum Chemotherapy@highlight

This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of viral therapy in treating patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer that did not respond to platinum chemotherapy (phase II closed as of 1/7/2011).

 Viral therapy may be able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells.
