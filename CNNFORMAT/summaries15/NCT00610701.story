(firstQuint)Lateral Versus Anterior Spanning External Fixator for Tibial Plateau Fractures.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate patients with tibial plateau fractures.

 The goal is to compare the differences between anteriorly placed (front of leg) femoral external fixator pins and laterally placed (side of leg) femoral external fixator pins.

 Specifically, we are evaluating how this placement affects the quadriceps muscle and knee function.

 The parameters that will be assessed are knee function, pain, and range of motion.
