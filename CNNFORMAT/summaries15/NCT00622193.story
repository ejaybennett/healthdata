(firstQuint)Dose Range Study of Anamorelin in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 Cancer cachexia is a devastating, often late-stage complication of an underlying malignancy.

 Despite the significant importance of cancer-related cachexia, treatments are lacking and there are no products approved for this indication.

 Anamorelin HCl, by virtue of its ghrelin agonist activity, may serve a role in the treatment of cancer cachexia.

 This placebo controlled dose range study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of anamorelin HCl in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, a cancer associated with a high prevalence of cachexia.
