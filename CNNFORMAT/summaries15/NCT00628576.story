 Deep Venous Thrombosis of the Lower Extremities.

 Deep-venous thrombosis (DVT) remains a common clinical problem (annual incidence 0.

10-0.

16%) and long-term morbidity as chronic venous insufficience (CVI) in 10-30%.

 As to recurrent DVT, initial treatment with Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin ( to-day's terminology Fractionated Heparin (FH)) and Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) has shown equal efficiency, whereas the efficacy concerning long-term morbidity has only more recently been published.

 This study was initiated to compare the efficacy of UFH and FH concerning the incidence of CVI after symptomatic DVT at short-term and long-term follow-up.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of the new acute treatment of deep venous thrombosis by use of low-molecular-weight heparin compared with standard treatment using unfractionated heparin, especially concerning long-term morbidity.
