(secondQuint)A Prospective Study Comparing Contour SE Microspheres to Embosphere Microspheres for Treating Symptomatic Uterine Fibroids With Uterine Fibroid Embolization (UFE).

 The purpose of this prospective randomized single-center study is to demonstrate comparability using Contour SE cent Microspheres (700-900 mu and 900-1200 mu ) using a near stasis endpoint and Embosphere(R) Microspheres (500-700 mu ) using a "prune tree" endpoint for achieving post UFE fibroid devascularization in women with symptomatic uterine fibroids.

 The study will demonstrate (with the use of contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at baseline and 24-hours post embolization) that uterine fibroids can successfully be devascularized using the embolization protocols.

 Contrast enhanced MRI will be performed at baseline, 24-hours, and 3-months post UFE.

 The subjects will be followed through 12-months post UFE and change from baseline in symptom severity (Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire) will be assessed at 3 months and 12 months.
