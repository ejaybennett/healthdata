(secondQuint)Continuing Lamivudine Versus Switching to Entecavir in Patients Who Achieved Undetectable Hepatitis B Virus DNA.

 Entecavir has a higher potent antiviral efficacy and a lower drug resistance rate than those of Lamivudine in nucleoside-naive CHB patients.

 The switch from Lamivudine to Entecavir in patients who have undetectable hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA < 60 IU/mL) may lead to more prolonged viral suppression to undetectable level by PCR method, compared to patients with continuous lamivudine treatment.

 The results of this study will provide a rationale for switch treatment from one antiviral to another one, especially from LAM to ETV.

This is a randomized, open-labelled, prospective 96-week study comparing the antiviral efficacy and safety of switching to entecavir 0.
