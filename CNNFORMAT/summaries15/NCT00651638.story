(firstQuint)A Study of ARQ 197 in Healthy Volunteers to Assess the Pharmacokinetic (PK) Profile in Extensive and Poor Metabolizers as Defined by Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP 2C19) Genotype.

 This is a pharmacokinetic study designed to compare the metabolism of ARQ 197 in normal healthy volunteers who are extensive metabolizers (EM) or poor metabolizers (PM) as defined by CYP 2C19 genotype.

 This is an open-label, single-dose, parallel group design in which healthy volunteer subjects will receive a single dose of ARQ 197.
