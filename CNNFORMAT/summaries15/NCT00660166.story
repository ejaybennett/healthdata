(fifthQuint)Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Class I Haplotype Mismatched Natural Killer Cell Infusions.

 Natural killer cells are blood cells that are responsible for eliminating cancer cells especially when there are only a few.

 It has been shown that NK cells coming from a "mismatched" person (a relative) have a better chance than the patient's own NK cells to recognize and kill cancer cells.

 These cells will be collected from the blood of a parent, child or sibling and after preparation in the laboratory, will be given to the patient early after an autologous stem cell transplantation like a blood or platelet transfusion.

 A person who has been diagnosed with a blood tumor and received an autologous stem cell transplant has the chance of his/her cancer coming back.

 This study uses NK cells obtained from a relative to prevent disease recurrence by potentially eliminating and eradicating any residual cancerous cells.

 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Class I Haplotype Mismatched Natural Killer Cell Infusions@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to examine the safety of infusing escalated doses of allogeneic (from a relative of the patient), enriched natural killer (NK) cells after autologous (from the patient) stem cell transplantation.

 The hypothesis is that the infusion of these NK cells early after an autologous stem cell transplant will help to eliminate and eradicate any residual cancerous cells that remain in the body and may have survived the chemotherapy or radiation.
