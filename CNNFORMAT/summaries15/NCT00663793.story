(firstQuint)ORAL T-6: Oral Androgens in Man-6.

 This is an 2-3 month open-label, two week pharmacokinetic study of two novel formulations of oral testosterone (T), in normal men whose endogenous T production has been temporarily suppressed by the administration of the potent GnRH antagonist Acyline.

 We will be determining the relative pharmacokinetics of six different oral formulations of T in both rapid and slow release compared to the immediate release preparation studied previously by our group.

 ORAL T-6: Oral Androgens in Man-6@highlight

We propose a study to determine the single-dose pharmacokinetics of these two novel formulations of testosterone in normal men with experimentally induced hypogonadism.
