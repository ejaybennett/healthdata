(thirdQuint)Bioabsorbable Staple Line Reinforcement in Colorectal,Coloanal and Ileoanal Anastomoses.

 This is a randomized prospective trial that compares the use of GORE SEAMGUARD(R) Bioabsorbable Staple Line Reinforcement (CBSG) to standard stapling techniques in colorectal resections.

 The potential exists to utilize CBSG as a means of lowering the rate of post-operative anastomotic leakage and bleeding in high-risk colorectal, coloanal, and ileoanal anastomoses.

 Bioabsorbable Staple Line Reinforcement in Colorectal,Coloanal and Ileoanal Anastomoses@highlight

The primary purpose of this prospective, randomized multicenter center study is to evaluate and compare the outcomes of colorectal, coloanal and ileoanal anastomoses reinforced with a bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement material compared with standard non-reinforced colorectal, coloanal and ileoanal techniques with respect to the incidence of postoperative anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stricture and time to ileostomy closure, if applicable.
