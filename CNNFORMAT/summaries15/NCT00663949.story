(thirdQuint)Assessment of the Effect of Captopril Versus Combination of Captopril and Pentoxifylline on Reducing Proteinuria in Type 2 Diabetic Nephropathy.

 Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of ESRD and has a great impact on mortality and morbidity of diabetic patients.

 Despite renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitors in diabetic patients they can not hinder the progression of renal disease completely.

 TNFa is a cytokine that is a target for medical therapy in diabetic nephropathy.

 In this study the effect of captopril on overt diabetic nephropathy compared to effect of combination of captopril and an antiTNFa drug ( pentoxifylline).

 Assessment of the Effect of Captopril Versus Combination of Captopril and Pentoxifylline on Reducing Proteinuria in Type 2 Diabetic Nephropathy@highlight

Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of ESRD and has a great impact on mortality and morbidity of diabetic patients.

 Despite renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitors in diabetic patients they can not hinder the progression of renal disease completely.

 Pentoxifylline as a TNFa blocker may hinder progression of diabetic nephropathy in combination of captopril.
