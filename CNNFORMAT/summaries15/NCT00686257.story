(thirdQuint)Evaluation Of The Total Face Mask For Emergency Application In Acute Respiratory Failure.

 Despite its demonstrated efficacy in treating selected patients with acute respiratory failure, the application of NPPV is still plagued by a substantial failure rate, ranging from below 10% to above 40%.

 Mask intolerance ranks as one of the most common causes of failure.

 This is related to ill-fitting masks, mask discomfort (despite a properly fitted mask), excessively tightened straps, excessive air leaks around the mask or through the mouth, and claustrophobia.

 The most commonly used masks in the acute care setting are either oronasal masks that cover the nose and mouth, or nasal masks that cover the nose alone.

 Both mask types usually consist of clear plastic dome-shaped mask with a soft silicon gasket to create an air seal with the skin.

 While this approach is usually successful, it may lead to patient discomfort and/or an air leak secondary to the difficulty in creating an effective seal over the bridge of the nose and over mobile structures such as the mandible.

 The Total Face Mask cent (Respironics, Inc.

, Pittsburgh, PA) uses a different approach to avoid some of these limitations.

 Considerably larger than a standard oronasal mask, it covers the entire face and creates an air seal using a silicon gasket around the parameter of the face.

 In this way, gasket pressure is more evenly distributed, and discomfort over the bridge of the nose or chin is eliminated, and air leaking reduced.

 In addition, because one mask size fits virtually all patients, the Total Face Mask cent facilitates the fitting process and permits more rapid initiation of ventilatory assistance.

 Clinical experience to date suggests that claustrophobia is not a common problem with the Total Face Mask cent despite its size, and that its contribution to dead space is comparable to that of most oronasal masks.

 The following protocol aims to compare use of the Total Face Mask cent to the Comfort Full oronasal mask (also by Respironics, Inc.

, Pittsburgh, PA)or RT040 oronasal mask (Fisher&Paykel Inc.

, Wellington, NZ) in the acute care setting for patients meeting standard indications for NPPV.

 Evaluation Of The Total Face Mask For Emergency Application In Acute Respiratory Failure@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the Total Face Mask cent (Respironics, Inc.

, Pittsburgh, PA) (covering whole face) and the standard oronasal facemask (covering nose and mouth) for the emergency treatment of patients with acute respiratory failure with the machine blowing air into the mask placed on the face (noninvasive positive pressure ventilation) (NPPV).
