(thirdQuint)Exercise Dose-Response on Features of the Metabolic Syndrome.

 The proposed study is a randomized, open study comparing low-intensity and moderate-intensity aerobic exercise versus non-aerobic (stretching) exercise on direct measurements of insulin resistance and variables associated with the metabolic syndrome.

 This 6-month intervention will be followed by an additional 6-month follow-up period during which subjects will be encouraged to maintain their exercise regimen (along with their prescribed diet) but without scheduled supervision.

 Behavioral variables associated with adherence will be analyzed along with changes in the above physiological variables.

 Exercise Dose-Response on Features of the Metabolic Syndrome@highlight

This study investigates the degree of improvement in insulin resistance and features of the metabolic syndrome in non-diabetic overweight or obese subjects after training in a low-intensity, moderate-intensity or non-aerobic exercise program, as well as self-initiated exercise behavior after the assigned exercise program.
