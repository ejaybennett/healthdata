(fifthQuint)Intra-Operative Dural Brachytherapy With Yttrium-90 Plaque Applicators.

 - The surgeon will remove the participants tumor from the outer layer of the spinal cord (dura).

 The Y-90 applicator and a "dummy" applicator will be brought to the surgery table in a protected container.

 A "dummy" applicator is the same size and shape as the Y-90 plaque applicator but does not contain radioactive plaque.

 The "dummy" applicator will be placed on the participants dura to make sure it fits properly, then it will be removed.

 The working Y-90 applicator will be placed on the dura for 10-17 1/2 minutes and then be removed.

 - External beam irradiation is a type of high-energy radiation used to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.

 This radiation will be given to the participant only if they have not had it prior to the study.

 - After the treatment, participants will be asked to return for a follow-up visit 6 weeks, 3 months, every 6 months thereafter for 4 years, then annually to year 10.

 At these visits, they will have the following: physical examination; recent medical history; MRI or CT scan (twice each year) and; chest x-ray or chest CT (twice each year).

 Intra-Operative Dural Brachytherapy With Yttrium-90 Plaque Applicators@highlight

The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the feasibility of the Y-90 plaque applicator.

 The Y-90 plaque application is designed to deliver high doses of radiation to tumors in the spine that involve dura (the tough outer layer of the spinal cord).

 Tumors in the spine need a high dose of radiation to kill cancer cells.

 The nearby spinal cord is a sensitive area which does not safely tolerate high doses of radiation.

 The Y-90 plaque applicator is a special technique used to deliver the radiation dose to the tumor cells and avoid the spinal cord.
