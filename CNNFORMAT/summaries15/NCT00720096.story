(fifthQuint)Genomic Directed Salvage Chemotherapy With Either Liposomal Doxorubicin Or Topotecan.

 Patients who take part in the study will have an initial visit and undergo a CT guided core biopsy.

 Using tissue from a CT guided core biopsy, microarray analysis will be performed to help predict which of the two drugs appears to be better suited to individual genomic factors.

 The results will result in being assigned to treatment with either liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan.

 Patients who receive liposomal doxorubicin - IV chemotherapeutic treatment will occur 3 times, 28 days apart, weeks 1,5,and 9.

 At each of these visits patients will be evaluated and have blood work to check their liver tests and electrolytes.

 Every 8 weeks patients will have a radiologic evaluation of their tumor.

 Patients who receive topotecan - IV chemotherapeutic treatment will occur 4 times, 21 days apart, weeks 1,4,7, and 10.

 At each of these visits patients will be evaluated and have blood work to check levels of liver tests and electrolytes.

 Every 8 weeks patients will have a radiologic evaluation of their tumor.

 Genomic Directed Salvage Chemotherapy With Either Liposomal Doxorubicin Or Topotecan@highlight

This pilot study will help us to determine the success of using a special technique called microarray technology to examine cancer genes in order to predict how individual women will respond to one of two therapies, liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan, and which will be more effective in treating ovarian cancer that has returned (recurrent ovarian cancer).

 We believe that this study may lead to a means by which microarray technology can predict the most effective treatment decision, based on the genetic characteristics of her tumor tissue, for a woman with recurrent ovarian cancer.

 Another purpose of this study is to determine how quickly a woman with recurrent ovarian cancer will respond to treatment (treatment response rate) and to evaluate the accuracy of the genomic predictions.

 Recent data suggest that microarray technology can predict a patient's response to chemotherapy; this has not yet been proven in a forward-looking study which is why we are conducting this research.
