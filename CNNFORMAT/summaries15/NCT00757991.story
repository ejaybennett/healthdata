(thirdQuint)Blood Samples From Healthy Volunteers for Genetic Studies in the East Anglia Region of the United Kingdom.

 OBJECTIVES: - To obtain blood samples and simple epidemiological information on a population-based series of adult individuals without cancer.

 - To establish whether polymorphisms in putative cancer predisposition genes are associated with an increased risk of cancer by comparing the frequency of alterations in these genes with the corresponding frequency in a comparable series of cancer patients.

 - To examine the interactions between genetic and non-genetic risk factors.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Participants complete a simple epidemiological questionnaire.

 Participants undergo blood sample collection.

 DNA is extracted from these samples for polymorphism analysis of low penetrance cancer susceptibility genes in the following related clinical trials: MREC-SEARCH-CANCER, MREC-SEARCH-PROSTATE, and MREC-SEARCH-BREAST.

 They may also be used in the analyses of the following related clinical trials: MREC-SEARCH-OVARIAN, MREC-SEARCH-ENDOMETRIAL, MREC-SEARCH-COLORECTAL.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,000 male and 2,000 female participants will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from healthy volunteers in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 PURPOSE: This study is looking at genetic susceptibility to cancer and interactions between genes and the environment in healthy volunteers.
