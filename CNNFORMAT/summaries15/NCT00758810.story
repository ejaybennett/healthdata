(fifthQuint)Impact at One Year of a Secondary Prevention Educational Program on Cardiovascular Risk Factors.

 Classical CV risk factors, quality of life, daily physical activity and energy expenditure, smoking dependency and a daily quantification of fat intake are assessed with previously validated self-administrated questionnaires.

 Further factors like the lipid profile and glycaemia (with HbA1c in case of diabetes) will also be assessed.

 These evaluation will take place once at the of the hospitalization for acute coronary events in all patients, once at the end of any of the three rehabilitation programs for the concerned patients and, finally, one year after the hospitalization or the end of the rehabilitation program (mailed questionnaires and biological check-up).

 At this time, smoking dependency, medication, body mass index, any coronary event or need of coronary revascularization along with the professional ongoing situation (return to work) will be investigated.

 As this study aims to evaluate the efficiency of France's clinical practice in spotting most relevant risk factors, the results of the present study could help us to focus the medical and paramedical resources on the modification of specific relevant risk factors.

 Impact at One Year of a Secondary Prevention Educational Program on Cardiovascular Risk Factors@highlight

In secondary prevention, the beneficial role of cardiac rehabilitation programs after myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass is now well established.

 The large majority of patients don't benefit from cardiac rehabilitation but for those who do, they usually follow an inhospital short health educational program with a sensibilisation to different coronary risk factors like smoking, overweight and inactivity.

 The impact of these inhospital short health educational programs combined to cardiac rehabilitation has never been totally evaluated, especially the impact on smoking cessation, weight loss and daily physical activity.

 Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the impact at one year on 400 consecutive patients' coronary risk profile of: - an inhospital short health educational program alone - an inhospital short health educational program combined to cardiac rehabilitation - a cardiac rehabilitation program alone
