(firstQuint)A Bioavailability and Safety Study of Probuphine Versus Sublingual Buprenorphine in Patients With Opioid Dependence.

 This is an open-label study intended to evaluate the relative bioavailability of 4 Probuphine implants versus 16mg QD sublingual buprenorphine, as determined by plasma BPN AUC(0-24), during 24 hours at steady state.

 This study will also provide open-label safety and tolerability data in patients treated with Probuphine.
