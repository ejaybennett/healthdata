(thirdQuint)A Study of Econazole Foam 1% in Athlete's Foot.

 Treating athlete's foot with a cream can leave a greasy, wet feeling on the foot that is uncomfortable to the user and messy on clothing and foot wear.

 A foam formulation that spreads easily and rubs-in easily that is as effective as the (reference) cream formulation in treating athlete's foot would be a benefit to the user.

 This study is designed to substantiate a clinical bridge between econazole nitrate foam 1% and econazole nitrate cream 1% based on clinical outcome, safety, and pharmacokinetic data.

 The study is (foam) vehicle-controlled and is randomized 1 to 1 to 1 (foam:cream:vehicle).

 A Study of Econazole Foam 1% in Athlete's Foot@highlight

This is a 6-week clinical study (4 weeks of treatment, once per day, plus a 2-week follow-up period) of a topical foam to treat athlete's foot.

 The active ingredient in the foam -- econazole nitrate 1% -- is the same active pharmaceutical ingredient in a cream that your doctor can currently prescribe to treat athlete's foot.

 This study will help to understand if the foam works the same as the cream to treat athlete's foot.
