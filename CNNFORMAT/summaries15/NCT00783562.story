(fifthQuint)Preventive Intervention in Nursery School Teachers.

 Seventy-one nursery school teachers working in nine school buildings were randomly divided into two groups, with each school as a unit of randomization.

 All the teachers in both groups received an ergonomic brochure; teachers in the experimental group also received an extension-oriented exercise program, conducted by a physical therapist.

 Data were collected at baseline and at a two-month follow-up.

 The primary outcome measure recorded was the level of disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire and Oswestry Disability Index), while secondary outcome measures included LBP and neck pain presence (Pain Drawing) and intensity (Visual Analogue Scale).

 At follow-up, a significant improvement was registered in the experimental group for all the outcomes evaluated.

 In conclusion a six-session extension-oriented exercise program proved decisive in preventing low back and neck complaints and in reducing consequent LBP functional disability among nursery school teachers.

 Preventive Intervention in Nursery School Teachers@highlight

Childcare in nursery schools has been shown to be associated with an elevated prevalence of neck, shoulder, arm and low back disorders.

 The current evidence suggests that exercises seem to be the only effective preventive intervention.

 Thus the purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an extension-oriented exercise program in preventing low back/neck pain and functional disability in nursery school teachers.

 In addition, the investigators also sought to identify the occurrence of musculoskeletal complaints in this category of workers.
