(thirdQuint)Long-term Function of Beta Cell Allografts in Non-uremic Type 1 Diabetic Patients.

 1.

 Aim 1: To increase functional beta cell mass by adding rituximab at first implantation 2.

 Aim 2: To increase functional beta cell mass by adding basilixumab at second implantation 3.

 Aim 3: To assess the influence of down-tapering the tacrolimus dose during posttransplant years 2-5 on these data, on metabolic control, on the prevalence of hypoglycemia and on safety parameters.

 4.

 Aim 4: To investigate the potential of the peritoneum and omentum as an alternative site for encapsulated beta-cells.

 5.

 Aim 5: To investigate the potential of the brachioradial muscle as an alternative site for encapsulated beta-cells.
