(secondQuint)Comparison Between Iso-Osmolar and Ipo-Osmolar Contrast Agents in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI).

 This is a multicentric randomized comparison between iso-osmolar and ipo-osmolar contrast agents in patients treated with primary PCI with the evaluation of contrast-induced nephropathy incidence and myocardial tissue reperfusion.

 The study was designed as a non-inferiority trial.

The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of contrast induced nephropathy and myocardial tissue reperfusion following iso-osmolar iodixanol or ipo-osmolar iopromide administration in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary PCI.
