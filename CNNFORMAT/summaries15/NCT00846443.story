(secondQuint)Study of Concurrent Pemetrexed, Cisplatin and Radiotherapy in Local Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 This study was conducted to explore the feasibility of concurrent chemoradiation therapy with pemetrexed, cisplatin and radiotherapy in unresectable local advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

 We will perform the dose escalation of pemetrexed to determine if full dose (500mg/m2) of pemetrexed could be administrated concurrently with cisplatin and conventional dose radiotherapy (66Gy) firstly.

 Secondly, radiation dose will be escalated to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiotherapy when administered concurrently with full dose pemetrexed and cisplatin.

 Study of Concurrent Pemetrexed, Cisplatin and Radiotherapy in Local Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose of pemetrexed and the maximum tolerated dose of radiotherapy when using concurrent pemetrexed/cisplatin/radiotherapy in the patients with local advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
