(secondQuint)Phase 2 Study of REOLYSIN in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With KRAS or EGFR Activation.

 Reovirus Serotype 3 - Dearing Strain (REOLYSIN(R)) is a naturally occurring, ubiquitous, non-enveloped human reovirus.

 Reovirus has been shown to replicate selectively in Ras-transformed cells causing cell lysis.

 Activating mutations in ras or mutation in oncogenes signaling through the ras pathway may occur in as many as 80% of human tumors.

 The specificity of the reovirus for Ras-transformed cells, coupled with its relatively nonpathogenic nature in humans, makes it an attractive anti-cancer therapy candidate.

 Given the ability of reovirus to replicate and cause oncolysis in Ras-activated cells, the high incidence of K-ras mutations in lung cancers, and the Ras-mediated activation often encountered in EGFR-addicted tumors, the administration of REOLYSIN(R) in combination with chemotherapy is expected to result in enhanced clinical benefit in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with K-ras mutations and/or EGFR aberrant activation in their tumors.

 Patients with de novo or acquired EGFR mutations in their tumors that confer resistance to EGFR TKIs (e.

g.

 T790) are expected to benefit as well.

 This is a single arm, open-label, Phase 2 study of REOLYSIN(R) given intravenously with paclitaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks (21 days is defined as a cycle) in NSCLC patients with tumors driven by these pathways.

 Paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg/m2 will be given i.

v.

 as a 3 hour infusion on Day 1 followed by carboplatin given i.

v.

 AUC 5 mg/mL cent minute.

 REOLYSIN(R) will be given over 60 min on Day 1 (starting after completion of the carboplatin infusion), and on Days 2 - 5.

 The treatment cycle will be repeated every 21 days.

 Patients will receive 4 to 6 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin, at the treating physician's discretion according to standard of practice, in conjunction with REOLYSIN(R).

 After completion of the 4 to 6 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin, REOLYSIN(R) may be continued as monotherapy Days 1-5 of each 21 day cycle until there is evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients may continue to receive therapy under this protocol, provided they have not experienced either progressive disease or unacceptable drug-related toxicity that does not respond to either supportive care or dose reduction.

 Phase 2 Study of REOLYSIN in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With KRAS or EGFR Activation@highlight

The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to investigate whether intravenous administration of a wild type reovirus (REOLYSIN(R)) in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin is effective and safe in the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with KRAS or EGFR activation.
