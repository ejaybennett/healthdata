(firstQuint)Blood Gene Expression Signature in Patients Diagnosed With Probable Alzheimer's Disease Compared to Patients Suffering From Other Types of Dementia.

 The main objective of the study is to define the performance of blood-based transcriptomic signatures for AD, identified using SpliceArray tm technology, in the intended use population of patients suffering from dementia, including AD and the most common non-AD dementia (Lewy Bodies dementia, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, dementia due to Parkinson's Disease, and mixed dementia).

 A group of non-demented subjects will serve as a control reference.
