(thirdQuint)Losartan in Treating Pulmonary Fibrosis in Patients With Stage I, II, or III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the effects of losartan potassium on the disease progression in patients with stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer and radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

 - To determine the feasibility of losartan potassium as a possible treatment for radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

 Secondary - The evaluate the effects of losartan potassium on the degree of dyspnea, and lung function (FEV_1 and FVC) in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral losartan potassium once daily for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients undergo assessment of pulmonary function (e.

g.

, gas movement, lung capacity, and diffusion of gases) by spirometry and dyspnea by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at baseline and at weeks 12 and 24.

RATIONALE: Losartan potassium may be effective in treating pulmonary fibrosis caused by radiation therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying losartan to see how well it works in treating pulmonary fibrosis caused by radiation therapy in patients with stage I, stage II, or stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
