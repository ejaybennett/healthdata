(secondQuint)Effect of Dutasteride on HIF-1alpha and VEGF in the Prostate.

 A total of 41 patients awaiting transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) will be divided into two groups (1:1); twenty patients will receive no medication and 21 will receive 0.

5 mg dutasteride daily for 2 to 4 weeks until TURP.

 In both groups, the extent, intensity and intracellular location of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)will be evaluated.

 Microvessel density will be also compared in the two groups.

 Effect of Dutasteride on HIF-1alpha and VEGF in the Prostate@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether dutasteride may influence the expression of angiogenesis factors such as hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH).
