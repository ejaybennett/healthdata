(secondQuint)An Observational Study Evaluating Anti-Idursulfase Serum Antibody Response in Hunter Syndrome Patients.

 This study is being conducted to satisfy post-marketing commitments to monitor anti-idursulfase antibody development in Hunter syndrome patients after long-term idursulfase enzyme replacement therapy.

 The study will be conducted as a sub-study within the Hunter Outcome Survey (HOS).

 Hunter syndrome patients in the HOS who have previously received idursulfase as well as treatment-naive patients who will begin idursulfase treatment within 30 days of study enrollment will be included.
