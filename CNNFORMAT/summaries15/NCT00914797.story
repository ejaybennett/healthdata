(secondQuint)Terbutaline Concentrations in Blood and Urine.

 To investigate the serum and urine concentrations of terbutaline and evaluate the difference between inhaled terbutaline (2 mg) and oral terbutaline (10 mg) in order to distinguish doping with terbutaline from anti-asthmatic treatment with terbutaline.

 To investigate the above mentioned in three groups: healthy men, male asthmatic subjects and male elite athletes with asthma.
