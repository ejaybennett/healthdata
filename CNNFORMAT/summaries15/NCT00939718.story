(fifthQuint)Comparison of Vitamin B12 Supplementation to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) Versus SSRI Antidepressant Treatment Alone.

 Vitamin B12 plays an important role in DNA synthesis and neurological function.

 Its deficiency is associated with hematological, neurological and psychiatric manifestations of which the latter include irritability, personality change, depression, dementia and rarely, psychosis.

 Recent literature has seen links between this vitamin and depression.

 High B12 levels in serum are associated with good treatment response, high homocysteine levels are common in folate / B12 deficiency and in those suffering from depression.

 Hyperhomocysteinemia may have direct effects on neurotransmitters implicated in depression.

 Randomized trials have shown folate and other nutritional supplementations are strategies of atleast significant effect in treating treatment-resistant depression.

 Folate deficiency has also been linked with delay in treatment response as well as relapse.

 To date no trial from Pakistan compares anti-depressant monotherapy with B12 augmentation in a population showing poor or partial response to first drug trial.

 The investigators aim to compare clinical response of SSRI-monotherapy with that of B12-augmentation in a sample of depressed patients.

 Objective To compare reduction in depression of patients with low normal B12 levels on SSRI monotherapy with patients on a combination of SSRI and Vitamin B12 supplementation.

 Hypothesis There will be higher response rate among patients who will be treated with combined SSRI therapy and B12 supplementation as compared to those who will be treated with SSRI alone.

 Operational Definitions Depression: Patients scoring 16 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-Urdu version (HAM-D) 24, 25 Low B12 level : ( 16 on the first 17-items correlates with clinical depression.

 Comparison of Vitamin B12 Supplementation to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) Versus SSRI Antidepressant Treatment Alone@highlight

While treating depression, significant numbers respond poorly to anti-depressants; one cause is vitamin B12 deficiency.

 The investigators are conducting an open label randomized controlled trial to investigate difference in response to SSRI monotherapy alone versus SSRI and intramuscular B12 replacement in people with low-normal B12 levels.

 300 participants will be allocated to each arm of intervention at out patient clinics of the department of Psychiatry at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi Pakistan.

 Baseline and 3 month measurement of depression will be on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Urdu version) and response rates compared.
