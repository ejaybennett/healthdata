(thirdQuint)Whole Body Fluorine F 18 Sodium Fluoride PET/CT Scan and Whole Body MRI in Finding Bone Metastases in Patients With Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of whole-body fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET/CT scan in detecting bone metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer using bone scan as the reference standard.

 II.

 To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of whole-body MRI in detecting bone metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer using bone scan as the reference standard.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo technetium Tc 99m methylene diphosphonate bone scan, fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET/CT scan, and whole-body MRI for the detection of bone metastases.

 Patients with discordant imaging results (negative bone scan and positive PET/CT scan and/or MRI) undergo additional imaging at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

 Whole Body Fluorine F 18 Sodium Fluoride PET/CT Scan and Whole Body MRI in Finding Bone Metastases in Patients With Prostate Cancer@highlight

This phase 0 trial studies whole body fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan and whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in finding bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as whole body fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET/CT scan and whole body MRI, may help find and diagnose bone metastases.
