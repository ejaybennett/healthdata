(firstQuint)J-pouch Versus Side-to-end Coloanal Anastomosis After Preoperative Radiotherapy and Total Mesorectal Excision for Rectal Cancer.

 Invalidating anorectal dysfunctions are common after restorative rectal surgery.

 Improvement of functional results by the technically more demanding J-pouch has been demonstrated in comparison with the straight coloanal anastomosis.

 In the present multicenter randomized trial we assessed whether the J-pouch is also superior to the side-to-end coloanal anastomosis.

The objective of this study was to compare the functional and surgical results of the J-pouch with those of the side-to-end anastomosis and their impact on quality of life.
