(fifthQuint)DOTA-TOC in Metastasized Neuroendocrine Tumors.

 Background: Systemic treatment with the 90Yttrium (90Y) labeled, tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid (DOTA) modified somatostatin analog Tyr3-octreotide (TOC) was introduced in 1998 (Otte et al.

 Lancet 1998).

 [90Y-DOTA]-TOC is administered intravenously and binds to the somatostatin receptor subtype 2, located on the surface of the tumor cell, and exerts its cytotoxic effects by -irradiation.

 The treatment has moderate acute hematologic and nephrologic toxicity and has developed into a promising therapeutic tool for tumors expressing its target receptor (Iten et al.

 Clin Cancer Res 2007, Iten et al.

 Cancer 2009).

 Study Aim: To explore the efficacy of [90Y-DOTA]-TOC and [177LuDOTA]-TOC therapy in advanced neuroendocrine cancer.

 Study Hypothesis: Response to DOTA-TOC is correlated with prolonged survival.

 Study Type: Clinical phase II, single-center, open-label trial Patients: 1500 patients.

The investigators aim to explore the efficacy of [90Y-DOTA]-TOC and [177LuDOTA]-TOC therapy in advanced neuroendocrine cancer.

 Therefore, the investigators assess response, survival and long-term safety profile of systemic [90Y-DOTA]-TOC and [177LuDOTA]-TOC treatment in metastasized neuroendocrine cancer patients.

 Adverse events are assessed according to the criteria of the National Cancer Institute.

 Survival analyses are performed using multiple regression models.
