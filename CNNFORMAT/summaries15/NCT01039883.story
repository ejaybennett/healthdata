(firstQuint)A Study to Compare the Blood Levels of Albaconazole in Healthy Subjects Who Have Received a Single Dose of 400 mg Albaconazole as a Tablet Versus Albaconazole as a Capsule.

 The aim of this study is to compare the bioavailability of the formulation used in earlier clinical studies (albaconazole capsules) with the formulation intended for use in further development (albaconazole tablets).

 The study is also designed to assess the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of albaconazole tablets (400 mg), and assess the bioequivalence of albaconazole tablets with albaconazole capsules.
