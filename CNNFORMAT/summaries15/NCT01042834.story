(firstQuint)Impact of Air Pollution on the Autonomic Nervous System Activity and the Presence of Sleep Apnea in Older Subjects.

 The relation between the air pollution and morbidity, cardiovascular mortality was increasing interest.

 Analyses show an increase of respiratory difficulty, but also cardiac deaths in the daytime when the atmospheric pollution was increased.

 It was demonstrated that health effects of ambient air pollution in subjects presenting cardiac or lung difficulty were important.

 Mechanisms show a possible relation to autonomic nervous system (ANS) deactivation and mortality.

 Particularly, the ageing and ANS reach would be more predictive of cardiovascular events.

 Thus, we suggest estimating in 60 healthy volunteers from 60 to 80 years old, the impact of the air pollution on the autonomic nervous system activity and sleep apnea consequences.
