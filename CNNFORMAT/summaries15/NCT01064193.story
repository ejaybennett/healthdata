(fifthQuint)Impact of Local Biopsy to the Endometrium Prior to Controlled Ovarian Stimulation on Clinical Pregnancy.

 They are possible mechanisms by which endometrial sampling may increase receptivity and improve clinical pregnancy rate of IVF-ET.

 First, local injury to proliferative phase endometrium might induce the decidualization of the endometrium, and increase its implantation rate.

 Second, local injury to the endometrium might provoke the wound healing, involving a mass secretion of different cytokines and growth factor, which are beneficial for embryo implantation.

 Last, the injury might make the endometrium maturation.

 This study proposes to evaluate the efficiency of an endometrial injury in the first controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycle on the rate of clinical pregnancy, in assisted reproductive technologies.

 This study will compare 2 groups of patients.

 The first group will undergo biopsy of the endometrium before the IVF; the second will undergo the IVF alone.

 Inclusions will be conducted on 33 months; the patients will be in the study for a period of 36 weeks.

 The total duration of the study is 39 months.

 Impact of Local Biopsy to the Endometrium Prior to Controlled Ovarian Stimulation on Clinical Pregnancy@highlight

In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the only available solution for many couples with various forms of infertility.

 The embryo implantation step in the IVF procedure is a complex multistage process and represents the majority of the causes of the IVF failure.

 Several approaches have been evaluated to improve implantation rates but none has demonstrated its superiority.

 However, endometrial receptivity is important for pregnancy and several studies suggest that local injury to the endometrium of IVF patients improves the rates of embryo implantation, clinical pregnancy and live birth.
