(fifthQuint)Discovery Stage IND EXEMPT Clinical Study - Etoposide and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms.

 The usual approach group, after local therapy with surgery, 300 double blind random group separated SCLC patients currently used the Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CISPLATIN INJECTION, it will try to look for the relationship between the ETOPOSIDE INJECTION therapeutic efficacy and the Topoisomerase II SNP Genotyping, and the relationship between the ETOPOSIDE INJECTION therapeutic safety and the CYP4503A4 SNP Genotyping, based on precisely sequencing drug targets' genes.

 The study approach group, after local therapy with surgery, 300 double blind random group separated SCLC patients currently used the Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CARBOPLATIN INJECTION, it will try to look for the relationship between the ETOPOSIDE INJECTION therapeutic efficacy and the Topoisomerase II SNP Genotyping, and the relationship between the ETOPOSIDE INJECTION therapeutic safety and the CYP4503A4 SNP Genotyping, based on precisely sequencing drug targets' genes.

 - 1) Detect drug target whole gene precision sequence of everyone patient for all 600 recruited double blind SCLC patients.

 - 2) Mutually compare everyone patient drug target whole gene precision sequence for total 600 recruited double blind SCLC patients.

 - 3) Calculate drug target gene SNPs in all 600 recruited double blind SCLC patients.

 - 4) Correlate everyone patient drug target gene SNP to everyone patient drug efficacy.

 - 5) Correlate everyone patient drug target gene SNP to everyone patient drug safety.

 - 6) Mutually compare the usual approach group SNPs (300 double blind random group separated SCLC patients) with the study approach group SNPs (300 double blind random group separated SCLC patients).

 - 7) Confirm the relationship between drug target gene SNPs and drug efficacy.

 - 8) Confirm the relationship between drug target gene SNPs and drug safety.

 Discovery Stage IND EXEMPT Clinical Study - Etoposide and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms@highlight

Personalized or individualize Etoposide (VP-16) chemotherapy targeting the SCLC patient-specific biomarkers (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms - SNPs of relative etoposide targets, topoisomerase II and CYP4503A4) Targeted SCLC chemotherapy with Etoposide (VP-16) and patient-specific biomarkers (SNPs) Individualize or personalize etoposide chemotherapy toward small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with maximizing effectiveness via assay single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of relative etoposide target - topoisomerase II, and minimizing risk via assay single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of relative etoposide target - CYP4503A4, based on precisely sequencing drug targets' genes.
