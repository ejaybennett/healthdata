(fifthQuint)Empiric Therapy of Mucopurulent Cervicitis (MPC).

 Mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the presence of mucopurulent discharge from the cervix and other signs of inflammation such as easily induced cervical bleeding.

 This phase III study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of no treatment (placebo) versus empiric treatment with a single dose of cefixime 400 mg and azithromycin 1 gram for clinical cure of MPC at 2 months of follow-up.

 Secondary aims of the study are: to compare the pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) rate and adverse event rates between no treatment (placebo) versus empiric treatment; explore the role of bacterial vaginosis and Mycoplasma genitalium in the persistence of MPC; evaluate microbiological cure rate of M.

 genitalium in women treated with cefixime and azithromycin versus placebo; and present the clinical cure, partial response and failure proportions at 2-3 weeks and 2 months for each study arm.

 Participants will include 772 women greater than or equal to 18 years of age from Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) or Family Planning (FP) clinics in good general health with MPC in New Orleans, LA; Birmingham, AL; Jackson, MS; Los Angeles, CA; and an additional site to be determined.

 Research specimens will be obtained at the time of the pelvic examination.

 As part of the study protocol, 3 cervical and 4 vaginal swabs will be collected at screening, follow-up visit 1, and follow-up visit 2.

 Eligible participants with clinical MPC at the time of their pelvic examination (cervical mucopus or easily induced cervical bleeding), will be consented, screened, enrolled, and randomized to one of the following arms: Group 1: empiric treatment: a single dose of cefixime 400 mg (1 capsule oral at 400 mg) and azithromycin 1 gm (2 capsules oral at 500 mg each) or Group 2: no treatment: placebo pills that look identical to the above medications.

 Subjects will be involved in study related procedures for 2 months.

 Empiric Therapy of Mucopurulent Cervicitis (MPC)@highlight

Mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC) is a syndrome with associated symptoms including mucopurulent discharge (mucus and pus) from the cervix and other signs of inflammation such as easily induced cervical bleeding.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of no treatment versus empiric treatment with a single dose of cefixime and azithromycin for cure of MPC.

 Empiric treatment is the initiation of treatment prior to a firm diagnosis.

 Study participants will include 772 women ages 18 and older in good health with MPC.

 Women will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 possible study groups: Group 1 will receive a single dose of cefixime and azithromycin antibiotics and Group 2 will receive placebo (inactive substance).

 Study procedures will include pelvic examination with a cervical swab sample.

 Participants will be involved in study related procedures for approximately 2 months, which includes 3 study visits.
