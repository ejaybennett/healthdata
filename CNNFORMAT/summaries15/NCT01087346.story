(fifthQuint)Parents Thoughts About Kids and Eating.

 Purpose This study will investigate the impact of health information on choices that parents make about food for their children.

 Participants will use a virtual reality model of a buffet to make food choices.

 Mothers and fathers with a biological child between the ages of 3-7 years old may be eligible for this study.

 Participants are recruited from the Washington, DC metropolitan area.

 Study participants will complete THREE sets of surveys and one task.

 Participants will complete a web-based survey before coming in for a study appointment.

 When participants arrive for their appointment, they will watch an interactive presentation on health information.

 Next, participants will interact in a virtual reality environment and will be asked to select virtual lunch for their child from a buffet.

 While in the virtual environment, a participant wears a head-mounted virtual reality headset that allows him/her to see elements of the environment.

 Participants will complete an additional computer-based survey.

 Finally, participants will be asked to complete an online questionnaire a week following their visit.

 The total time for the study visit is approximately 90 minutes.

 The participants children will not be asked to take part in the study.

 Detailed Description This study will investigate issues around the impact of health information on choices that parents make about food for their children.

 Participants will perform tasks that include completing computer-based surveys, watching an interactive computer-based presentation about health information, participating in a virtual reality model by selecting virtual lunch for their children from a buffet, and completing a computed-based exit survey.

 Parents Thoughts About Kids and Eating@highlight

Summary: - A few studies have explored the effects of providing parents with health information about their children.

 However, more information is needed about the relationship between awareness of health information and changes in behavior.

 This study will investigate the impact of health information on choices that parents make about food for their children.

 - Mothers and fathers with a biological child between the ages of 3-7 years old may be eligible for this study.

 Participants are recruited from the Washington, DC metropolitan area.

 - In this study, before visiting the research center, participants will answer online questionnaires about their children's health and eating habits and their own health and eating habits.

 - At the research center, participants will use a virtual reality model of a buffet to make food choices for their children.

 Participants will be introduced to the computer-based virtual buffet scenario as a training session to prepare for using the buffet during the experimental context.

 While in the virtual environment, participants wear a virtual reality helmet that allows them to see the virtual buffet scenario.

 - After the training session, participants will watch an interactive computer presentation about a health topic.

 - Participants will then visit the virtual buffet scenario again for the formal session, and will choose a virtual lunch meal for their child as before.

 - At the end of their visit, participants will complete post-test questionnaires about their experiences during the experiment and other research-related information.

 - Participants will be asked to complete a follow-up questionnaire online a week after their visit - The total time for the study visit is approximately 90 minutes.

 The participants children will not be asked to take part in the study.

 Eligibility: - Men and Women at least 18 years of age who have a biological child between the ages of 3 and 7 who has no major diet-related health conditions, developmental delays, or disabilities.

 You may not take part in the study if you have a history of seizures and/or are pregnant.
