(secondQuint)Resistance Training in Knee Osteoarthritis.

 Patients in experimental group participated in a 12-week progressive resistance training using a repetition maximum (RM) exercise in which patients performed 1RM with the maximum bearable weight.

 Once the 1RM was determined, training was divided into the following regimen: 2 series of 8 repetitions, the first with 50% and the second with 70% of 1RM.

 The exercises were knee extension and flexion and hip abduction and adduction, all performed in machines.

 The 1RM load was reevaluated every 2 weeks.

 The control group remained on a three-month waiting list for physiotherapy.

 Patients were assessed for pain, function, quality of life, muscle strength and six-minute walk test.
