(thirdQuint)Cholecyst- Versus Cystic Duct Cholangiography During Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy.

 This study was conducted on 60 patients with symptomatic gall bladder stones undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

 Patients were randomized into two groups: Group (1) was evaluated by cholecyst-cholangiography by puncture through the gall bladder fundus.

 Group (2) was evaluated for the standard cystic duct cholangiography.

Cholangiography was considered successful if it could be performed with complete delineation of the biliary tree with flow of the dye through the duodenum occurred.

 It is to be noted that inability to cannulate the cystic duct for example, is considered a failure.

 Cholecyst- Versus Cystic Duct Cholangiography During Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy@highlight

Standard cystic duct cholangiography (CDC) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be difficult, time consuming and bile duct injury may be caused by attempts to cannulate the cystic duct.

 Operative cholangiography performed by direct puncture of the gall bladder fundus or Cholecystocholangiography (CCC) is a valid and easier alternative.
