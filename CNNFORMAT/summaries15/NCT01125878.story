(fifthQuint)Types of Resistant Starch and Their Effect on Appetite.

 This study will require one initial screening visit (approximately 1 hour) and four study visits each lasting approximately 4 hours.

 All visits should be done in 2 months.

 We are looking for healthy, non-smoking, premenopausal female volunteers older than 18 with no medical history of diabetics, heart, lung, kidney, stomach, or liver disease.

 The initial screening visit will determine subject eligibility through height, weight and waist circumference measurements, blood glucose finger prick and eating, health and mood surveys.

 If willing and eligible to participate, subjects will have four study visits.

 All study visits will be scheduled according to each individual subject's menstrual cycle.

 At each visit subject will be asked to eat the cookie bar and then answer questions about their feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat.

 Subject will continue to answer questions about their feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat at specific time points up to 3 hours after eating the yogurt.

 After 3 hours a lunch meal will be served.

 The lunch meal consists of typical deli items, such as pasta, rolls, salad, etc.

 Subject will be allowed to eat as much or as little of the lunch as they'd like.

 Types of Resistant Starch and Their Effect on Appetite@highlight

Investigators are interested in learning how appetite responds to certain types of starch and fiber mixtures.

 In this research study, subjects will be asked to consume cookie bars containing different types of starch and fiber mixtures, then describe their feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat for the 3 hour study period.

 Subjects will be asked to do this on four separate occasions.

 Following the 3 hour study period, a deli-style lunch will be served.

 Investigators want to see how appetite responds to these four different starch and fiber mixtures.
