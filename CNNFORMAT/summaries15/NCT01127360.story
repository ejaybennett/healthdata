 LUCAS (LUcentis Compared to Avastin Study) A randomized, double-blind, prospective multicenter study comparing the effect of intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (Avastin) to ranibizumab (Lucentis) when given to patients with exudative (wet) age-related macular degeneration in Norway.

 Version: 4, Protocol: 166-09, EudraCT: 2008-004225-41 Purpose: LUCAS is a prospective, randomized, multicenter study comparing the effects of intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (Avastin) with ranibizumab (Lucentis) when given to patients with exudative (wet) AMD in Norway.

 The study will include 420 patients to be recruited starting March 2009.

 The study will continue for 2 years after completed enrollment.

 Design: LUCAS is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, with 1:1 parallel groups treated with either bevacizumab (Avastin) 0.

05 ml (25 mg/ml) or ranibizumab (Lucentis) 0,05 ml (10 mg/ml).

 The drug is injected intravitreally according to an "inject and extend" principle (5).

 Randomization will be stratified by center and performed with minimization according to prognostic factors.

 Treatment Regimen: Bevacizumab (Avastin) will be given as an intravitreal injection of 0.

05ml (25 mg/ml) from a vial containing 4 ml.

 Ranibizumab (Lucentis) will be given as an intravitreal injection of 0.

05 ml (10 mg/ml) from a vial containing 0.

23 ml.

 Follow-up and treatment will follow a principle called "inject and extend.

" This connotes the following: initial follow-up and injection with a 4 week intervals until the macula is dry.

 When dry, then follow-up and injection will be increased 2 weeks at a time.

 If the patient has a recurrence of wet AMD, then the interval is reduced by 2 weeks at a time until the macula is once again dry.

 The shortest interval is 4 weeks.

 When once again extending, the treatment interval shall not be as long as the interval of the original recurrence, as this could confer risk for new activity.

 Therefore further follow-up and injection occurs at the "ideal" interval which is hereby defined as being 2 weeks less than that of the original recurrence.

 With this method, the patient receives an injection at each follow-up, presuming that no complications occur.

 The maximum interval is limited to 12 weeks.

 Treatment will continue for 2 years.

 After the study is completed, then the patient is to be offered continued treatment, in accordance with the ophthalmology department's routines, If there is no response to treatment after 3 injections with a 4 week interval, then the patient shall be removed from the study and be offered alternative treatment, such as combination treatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT).

 LUCAS (Lucentis Compared to Avastin Study)@highlight

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in individuals over 50 years of age.

 Bevacizumab and ranibizumab are two agents developed by the American pharmaceutical corporation Genentech, both of which inhibit blood vessel growth factors.

 These drugs, when injected intraocularly, reduce the pathological growth of blood vessels in the macular area of the eye.

 Bevacizumab (Avastin) is an antibody developed for intravenous treatment of metastasized colon cancer.

 Ranibizumab (Lucentis) is an antibody fragment developed from a similar antibody.

 It was introduced 2006 as an effective treatment for wet AMD.

 Treatment costs are, however, up to 50 times higher compared to use of bevacizumab.

 Avastin has shown similar effects to ranibizumab, and has been used off-label in many countries, both before and after Lucentis received approval.

 There is thus a recognized need for large randomized studies to garner proper scientific proof of Avastin's effectiveness regarding exudative AMD.

 LUCAS is a randomized multicenter study, performed in Norway, comparing ranibizumab and bevacizumab use for AMD.

 The goal of the study was to demonstrate if the two agents were equivalent regarding both efficacy and safety.

 A total of 441 patients with objective evidence of wet AMD were randomized to a double-blind treatment with ranibizumab or bevacizumab over the course of 2 years.

 The treatment interval was determined by a "Treat and Extend" protocol.
