(firstQuint)Clinically Indicated Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients With Cardiac Devices.

 This prospective cohort study to use an established MRI device safety protocol to decrease the risk of clinically indicated MR imaging in patients with implantable cardiac devices.

 All devices will undergo a complete interrogation and testing of thresholds, sensing, battery voltage and impedances prior to and following imaging.

 Pre-MRI, devices will be programmed to setting that will ensure MRI safety.

 During imaging, patients will blood pressure, heart rate and O2 sat level will be monitored continuously.
