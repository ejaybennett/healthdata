(thirdQuint)(EASY)-IMProving Adherence to Clopidogrel Trial (IMPACT)).

 Optimal treatment with Clopidogrel and Aspirin is critical for preventing complications after implantation of drug-eluting stents (DES).

 The premature cessation of Clopidogrel is a well recognized factor of thrombosis of stents, especially DES.

 Indeed, there remains a large portion of patients that prematurely stop clopidogrel.

 No study has demonstrated that a therapeutic management program could improve patient compliance to their antiplatelets.

 Through an open-label clinical study, two groups of patients who just received their DES will be compared: one with the usual protocol (consisting of seeing the cardiologist 6 weeks after the intervention) and one with the normal care supplemented by a simple and efficient follow-up (consisting of phone calls at 7 days, 1 month, 6 months and 9 months explaining the importance of antiplatelet therapy, evaluating the health of the patient and well received prescription from the pharmacy).

 Patients in both groups will receive a prescription to Clopidogrel and Aspirin (for 1 month), with 11 renewals.

The purpose of this study is to test the impact of a multidisciplinary approach to improve the adhesion and persistence to Clopidogrel therapy.

 A simple and inexpensive therapy management involving a tighter monitoring of patients by nurses and pharmacists will improve the persistence and adhesion to Clopidogrel and Aspirin after the implantation of drug-eluting stents.
