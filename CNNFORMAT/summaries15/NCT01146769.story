(firstQuint)Early Pelvic Floor Muscle Training Improves Pelvic Floor Muscle Strength in Patient After Low Anterior Resection.

 The functional outcome after low anterior resection varies greatly.

 Proportion of patient suffers from urgency and incontinence.

 Pelvic muscle disuse with atrophy and fibrosis may be a cause for the poor function.

 Peri-operative pelvic floor muscle training may preserve pelvic floor muscle bulk and function and thus improve functional outcome after surgery.
