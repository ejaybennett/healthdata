(fifthQuint)Study of VMP001 and AS01B in Healthy Malaria-Nave Adults.

 This is a Phase 1/2a, non-randomized, open label, dose escalation study in healthy, malaria-naive adults aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive).

 The vaccine will be administered with GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' adjuvant system AS01B.

 This is a first-in-human study of VMP001; therefore the study design will incorporate a dose-escalation phase evaluating 15 mu g, 30 mu g, and 60 mu g doses of VMP001 in 500 mu L of AS01B.

 A total of 30 volunteers, divided into 3 groups (10 in each group), will receive 3 doses of the VMP001/AS01B vaccine.

 Group 1 will receive 15 mu g of VMP001, Group 2 will receive 30 mu g of VMP001, and Group 3 will receive 60 mu g of VMP001 at each immunization.

 The dose of AS01B will be 500 mu L for all groups.

 The first and second dose in each group will be separated by 28 days.

 The third dose in the three groups will be given at intervals scheduled to normalize the time to challenge between the last immunization and challenge.

 The second and third dose in Group 1 will be separated by 56 days, Group 2 by 42 days and Group 3 by 28 days.

 The challenge will occur 2 weeks following the third immunization.

 A group of 6-12 infectivity controls will begin participation in the study at the challenge stage.

 They will not receive any immunizations or placebos prior to challenge.

 All volunteers will receive a standard treatment regimen consisting of chloroquine and primaquine on the day that parasitemia is detected.

 Volunteers who do not become parasitemic will also begin the same treatment regimen on day 28 following the challenge (study day 126).

 Safety and immunogenicity will be evaluated during the study through the final study visit 6 months after challenge (study day 280).

 Study of VMP001 and AS01B in Healthy Malaria-Nave Adults@highlight

This is a first-in-humans safety, immunogenicity and efficacy study with recombinant proteinVMP001, a Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite (CS) protein based vaccine.

 This open label study will be performed in malaria-naive adults in the United States.

 Three doses of VMP001 formulated in AS01B will be given intramuscularly at different intervals followed by a challenge with P.

 vivax infected mosquitoes.

 Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy parameters will be studied.
