(fifthQuint)A Phase I/IIa Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Topical LTX-109 in Subjects Nasally Colonized With Methicillin-resistant/-Sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA/MSSA).

 Subjects with persistent colonies of MRSA/MSSA in the nostril will be recruited to receive either active treatment or placebo.

 This is a dose escalating study.

 First grout will receive either 1% Lytixar cent or placebo, next group 2% Lytixar cent or placebo and finally 5% Lytixar cent or placebo.

 Dose escalation will be performed after a brief safety evaluation of the tolerability after application of Lytixar cent /placebo vehicle TID for three days.

 Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from subjects who are willing.

 Subjects will be followed until 9 weeks after initiation of treatment.

 A Phase I/IIa Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Topical LTX-109 in Subjects Nasally Colonized With Methicillin-resistant/-Sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA/MSSA)@highlight

This is a pilot study conducted to evaluate the safety, local tolerability and efficacy of LTX-109(Lytixar cent ), a lytic peptide designed to kill bacterias quickly and efficient.

 LTX-109 (Lytixar cent )will be applied in the anterior nares in subjects who are carriers of nasal colonies of MRSA/MSSA.

 The extent of systemic absorption of LTX -109 when applied to the anterior nares will be evaluated and the effect of Lytixar cent as to clear colonies of MRSA/MSSA during the the observation period and Week 2 to Week 9 after treatment.
