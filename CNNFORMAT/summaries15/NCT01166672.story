(firstQuint)BCRL Prevention Pilot.

 Breast cancer related lymphedema occurs in 20-30% of survivors.

 Weight loss could prevent onset.

 We seek to do a pilot study to establish feasibility of 1) recruiting survivors at risk for lymphedema to do a weight loss intervention, 2) achieving 10-15% weight loss over 26 weeks in this population, and 3) attendance at follow-up visits 6 months.
