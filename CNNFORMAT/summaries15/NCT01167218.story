(secondQuint)Study to Assess Platelet Dysfunction With Verify Now Assay.

 Verify Now is a rapid, simple, point-of service assay to measure platelet aggregation.

 The verify now assay is designed to assess platelet function based on the ability of activated platelets to bind fibrinogen.

 It is hoped that this study will detect the subtle platelet functional abnormalities in patients with hematological disorders.
