(thirdQuint)Palliative 3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy in Reducing Radiation Side Effects in Patients With Lung Cancer.

 ICORG 06-34.

 The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that using technically sophisticated 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for the palliative treatment of lung cancer patients will result in equivalent degrees of symptom relief and a reduction in the primary endpoint of oesophagitis.

 Single arm therapeutic clinical study.

 RT Treatment Regimens: 17 Gy/2 fractions or 20Gy/5 fractions or 39Gy/13 fractions Primary Endpoint: -The occurrence of Grade 3 or higher oesophagitis in the interval between start and 1-month post completion of treatment as determined by CTCAE Version 4.

02 Patients will be assessed pre treatment, during treatment, 2 weeks post completion of treatment, one month post completion of treatment, three months post completion of treatment, and three monthly thereafter -All patients who complete treatment (and whose on-treatment toxicity is documented) will be evaluable.

 Secondary Endpoint: - Quality of Life Assessment.

 All patients will be required to complete the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL (Version 1) and the Lung Specific Module (LC 13) - The occurrence of other AEs Safety Endpoint: -Radio-induced oesophagitis, acute and long term, using the CTCAE Version 4.

RATIONALE: 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy may lessen side effects caused by palliative radiation therapy and improve the quality of life of patients with lung cancer.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy works in reducing the side effects of palliative radiation in patients with lung cancer.
