(fifthQuint)Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of Recombinant Factor VIII Fc Fusion Protein (rFVIIIFc) in Previously Treated Subjects With Severe Hemophilia A.

 Participants are assigned to one of three treatment regimens: 1) a tailored prophylaxis regimen, 2) a weekly dosing regimen, or 3) an on-demand regimen.

 Treatment continued for 28 (2) to 52 (2) weeks.

 PK assessments for all participants are conducted on varying schedules, according to participants' group assignments.

 Additionally, two subgroups are defined.

 One subgroup of participants undergo PK profiling with a single dose of the comparator Advate(R).

 A second subgroup consists of participants from any of the treatment arms that required surgery during the study.

 Depending upon country location, participants might have the option of continuing treatment within study 8HA01EXT (NCT01454739).

 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of Recombinant Factor VIII Fc Fusion Protein (rFVIIIFc) in Previously Treated Subjects With Severe Hemophilia A@highlight

The primary objectives of this study are: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rFVIIIFc administered as a prophylaxis (Arm 1), weekly (Arm 2), on-demand (Arm 3), and surgical treatment regimen; to evaluate the efficacy of the rFVIIIFc tailored prophylaxis regimen (Arm 1); to evaluate the efficacy of rFVIIIFc administered as an on-demand (Arm 3) and surgical treatment regimen.

 The secondary objectives of this study are: to characterize the PK profile of rFVIIIFc and compare the PK of rFVIIIFc with the currently marketed product, Advate(R); to characterize the range of dose and schedules required to adequately prevent bleeding in a prophylaxis regimen, maintain hemostasis in a surgical setting, or to treat bleeding episodes in an on-demand, weekly treatment, or prophylaxis setting.
