(fifthQuint)A Multicenter, Open-label, Single Dose Study of the Safety and Efficacy of GSK1358820 (Botulinum Toxin Type A) in Chinese Subjects With Post-stroke Focal Upper Limb Spasticity.

 This trial is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GSK1358820 for the treatment of patients with focal wrist, finger and in some cases, thumb spasticity post-stroke.

 Qualified patients will be eligible for enrollment upon completion of double-blind study 112958.

 Patients will receive a single treatment session with intramuscular injections of GSK1358820 "200U or 240U (if thumb spasticity is present)".

The subjects will be observed for 12 weeks post injection.

 Each completed subject will attend 4 clinic visits.

 The maximum study duration is 13 weeks.

 The study includes a 1 week pretreatment period, during which the screening visit (visit 1 could be the last visit of previous double-blind study 112958 or any time within 3 months after completion of previous study) is to take place.

 Only one upper limb (meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be evaluated and treated in the study.

 Subjects will receive a single intramuscular treatment with investigated drug at day 0 (visit 2).

 There will be two post-injection follow-up visits at week 6 and 12 (visits 3 to 4).

 A Multicenter, Open-label, Single Dose Study of the Safety and Efficacy of GSK1358820 (Botulinum Toxin Type A) in Chinese Subjects With Post-stroke Focal Upper Limb Spasticity@highlight

This trial is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GSK1358820 for treatment in post-stroke subjects with focal wrist, finger and in some cases, thumb spasticity.

 Qualified patients who complete GSK double-blind study 112958 will be enrolled.

 Subjects will receive a single treatment session of intramuscular GSK1358820 "200U or 240U (if thumb spasticity is present)".

 The subjects will be observed until 12 weeks post injection.

 Outcome measures include changes from baseline at every post injection visit as measured on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Disability Assessment Scale (DAS) and Global Assessment Scale.

 Safety parameters will be measured including adverse events, vital signs (pulse and blood pressure) and clinical laboratory tests (haematology, serum chemistry and urinanalysis).
