(secondQuint)Prognostic Biomarkers in Patients With Endometrial Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To validate the clinicopathologic associations and prognostic significance of ATR mutation in endometrioid endometrial cancer cases with defective DNA mismatch repair.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 DNA extracted from previously collected tumor samples is analyzed to validate the clinicopathologic associations and prognostic significance of ATR mutation.

 Prognostic Biomarkers in Patients With Endometrial Cancer@highlight

This research study is studying prognostic biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with endometrial cancer.

 Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.
