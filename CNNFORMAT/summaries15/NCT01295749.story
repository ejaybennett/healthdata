(fifthQuint)Effects of Laryngeal Tube Ventilation on no Flow Time During Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest.

 Multicentric, prospective, controlled, randomized study with parallel groups in single blind.

 Patients will be included in chronological periods to avoid selection biais (one month with the first medical device the next month with the other one).

 The determination of these periods will be centralized.

 The emergency vehicles will be supplied sufficiently with devices.

 This design has been chosen in order to answer to the emergency problem.

 Patients will be included and ventilated by paramedical staff (first responders) before medical staff (Mobile Intensive Care Unit) intervention.

 Complete detailed information will be given to the patient or to the family and consent asked.

 The comparison of no flow time between the two strategies in out of hospital cardiac arrest will be the following : A : ventilation by bag valve mask and interrupted chest compression B : ventilation by laryngeal tube and continuous chest compression.

 Effects of Laryngeal Tube Ventilation on no Flow Time During Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest@highlight

International recommendations stress on the importance of no flow time reduction in cardiac arrest management.

 In fact, no flow time is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality.

 In France, cardiac arrests are treated by first responders (including emergency nurses) before the arrival of a mobile intensive care unit.

 Those first responders use bag-valve-mask for ventilation and therefore practice conventional CPR (30 chest compression / 2 ventilation rhythm).

 Laryngeal tube is a safe and efficient device in cardiac arrest ventilation.

 The purpose of our study is to compare the no flow time between two strategies of out of hospital cardiac arrest management by first responders: conventional CPR with bag-valve-mask ventilation vs.

 compression only CPR with Laryngeal Tube ventilation.
