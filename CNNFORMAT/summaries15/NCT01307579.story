(fifthQuint)Caspofungin Acetate or Fluconazole in Preventing Invasive Fungal Infections in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Who Are Undergoing Chemotherapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine if prophylaxis with caspofungin (caspofungin acetate) administered during periods of neutropenia following chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with a lower incidence of proven or probable invasive fungal infections (IFI) compared with fluconazole.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine if prophylaxis with caspofungin will result in a lower incidence of proven or probable cases of invasive aspergillosis (IA) compared with fluconazole.

 (Clinical) II.

 To determine if prophylaxis with caspofungin will result in improved survival compared to fluconazole.

 (Clinical) III.

 To determine if prophylaxis with caspofungin will result in less empiric antifungal therapy compared to fluconazole.

 (Clinical) IV.

 To determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of biweekly galactomannan (GM) and beta-D glucan testing in diagnosing IFI.

 (Biological) V.

 To test the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in innate immunity and proven or probable IFI.

 (Biological) VI.

 To develop predictive models of IFI using SNP in genes involved in immunity and clinical covariates.

 (Biological) OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive caspofungin acetate intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once daily (QD) beginning within 24-72 hours following the last dose of chemotherapy for each course and continuing until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 100-500/uL following the nadir or the next chemotherapy course begins.

 ARM II: Patients receive fluconazole IV over 1-2 hours or orally (PO) QD beginning within 24-72 hours following the last dose of chemotherapy for each course and continuing until ANC > 100-500/uL following the nadir or the next chemotherapy course begins.

 In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of invasive fungal infections or disease progression.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

 Caspofungin Acetate or Fluconazole in Preventing Invasive Fungal Infections in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Who Are Undergoing Chemotherapy@highlight

This randomized phase III trial studies caspofungin acetate to see how it works compared to fluconazole in preventing invasive fungal infections in patients with acute myeloid leukemia who are undergoing chemotherapy.

 Caspofungin acetate or fluconazole may help prevent fungal infections caused by chemotherapy.

 It is not yet known whether fluconazole is more effective than caspofungin acetate in preventing fungal infections in patients with acute myeloid leukemia who are undergoing chemotherapy.
