(fifthQuint)Outcomes and Costs Associated With Initiating Maintenance Treatment With Fluticasone Propionate 250mcg/Salmeterol Xinafoate 50mcg Combination (FSC) Versus Anticholinergics Including Tiotropium (TIO) in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

 All population i.

e.

 at least 40 years: Each initial maintenance treatment (IMT) cohort (FSC 250/50mcg dose only, IP, and TIO) includes patients aged 40 years and older with at least 9 months of continuous enrollment (6 months pre-index and at least three months post-index) with a primary or secondary diagnosis of COPD [International Classification of Disease, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 491.

xx].

 Patients are observed such that everyone provides minimum 6 months of pre index baseline data and minimum 3 months post index (risk analysis) and minimum 12 months post index for cost analysis.

 Patients must receive either a 30-day supply of FSC or IP or TIO as the initial IMT medication, indicating "intent to treat.

" Patients may not also have a prescription filled for the other IMT medication within 60 days of the index date, or for the combination therapy budesonide/ formoterol (BFC), an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or a long acting beta agonist (LABA).

 Six months of observation (continuous enrollment) prior to the index date is assessed to confirm that the patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as to identify baseline characteristics and covariates.

 Cost analysis was done using a 12 months fixed follow up period.

 Outcome measures are assessed during the post-index period Elderly cohort 65+: Identical methods and design were used for subanalyses in patients aged 65 years and over except comparison was FSC vs.

 TIO only.

 75+ cohort: Identical methods and design were used for subanalyses in patients aged 75 years and over except comparison was FSC vs.

 TIO only.

To evaluate COPD-related clinical outcomes and total healthcare utilization in commercially insured (at least 40 years with a subanalysis of those aged 65 years and older) COPD population associated with the use of fluticasone/salmeterol combination (FSC) 250/50mcg compared to other initial maintenance therapies (IMTs), specifically, tiotropium bromide (TIO), and either ipratropium bromide or ipratropium bromide/albuterol (IP).

 This is a hypothesis testing study Ho: There is no difference in time to first COPD-related events between FSC and TIO and FSC and IP Ha: There is a difference in time to first COPD-related events between FSC and TIO and FSC and IP Hypothesis for the key secondary outcome of COPD-related costs that was tested was: Ho: There is no difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and TIO and FSC and IP Ha: There is a difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and TIO and FSC and IP
