 Amendment 4 unblinded treatment after an interim analysis for all subsequently enrolled TN participants (the Second Cohort) who were receiving grazoprevir 400 or 800 mg daily, and they were down-dosed to 100 mg daily between Treatment Week (TW) 3 and TW12 for the remainder of the 12-week treatment course.
