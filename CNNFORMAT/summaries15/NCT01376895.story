(fifthQuint)Project Power: An HIV Risk Reduction Intervention for Black Men Who Have Sex With Men and Women (BMSM/W).

 The purpose of this study is to examine the preliminary efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of delivering a culturally and developmentally tailored HIV risk reduction intervention via the Internet in real-time that promotes risk reduction among black men who have sex with men and women (BMSMW).

 During the Developmental Phase, our activities will consist of completing development (finalizing sessions, completing the manuals) of a theoretically grounded, culturally based, individual intervention, Project POWER, to reduce risk of HIV acquisition and transmission among BMSMW.

 The investigators will then conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the preliminary efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility of POWER compared to HEALTH.

 Using chain referral methods, the investigators will recruit 200 BMSMW (100 per arm) and assign them to 1 of 2 conditions (POWER or HEALTH).

 Participants will complete an assessment battery delivered via ACASI at baseline, immediate post intervention and at 3 months post intervention.

 The investigators will also measure uptake of HIV and STI testing.

 Participants will also complete acceptability/feasibility assessments after the.

 Project Power: An HIV Risk Reduction Intervention for Black Men Who Have Sex With Men and Women (BMSM/W)@highlight

The goal of this study is to develop and test a program to help Black men who have sex with men and women reduce their chances of getting or giving HIV infection to their sex partners.

 The program is designed to be delivered via the internet so that it would be available to more men.

 Men who agree to participate in the study will be assigned by chance to receive the POWER intervention or a similar program that is focused on general health called POWER-HEALTH.

 They will also complete a computer administered interview when they first enroll in the study, 2 weeks following the last session of the program and 3 months after that.

 Participants will receive a small compensation for their time and effort.
