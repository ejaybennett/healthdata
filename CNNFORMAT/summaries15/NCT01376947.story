(thirdQuint)Comparison of the Difficulty on Insertion of IUD Devices Between Nulliparous and Multiparous Women.

 In our study we compare the difficulty at insertion of IUD between nulliparous and parous women with an without cesarean section.

 We compare the pain reported by the patient to the difficulty reported by the professional that performed the insertion.

 We also compare the pain the patient refers on the day of insertion and the pain the patient refers to remember a month after insertion.

 Our hypothesis is that there is no difference between nulliparous and multiparous patients.
