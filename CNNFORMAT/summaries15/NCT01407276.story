(secondQuint)A Study of Omarigliptin (MK-3102) in Participants With Impaired Renal Function (MK-3102-009).

 In Part I, three panels of 6 participants each will be enrolled with varying degrees of renal disease (mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment) based on their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

 Each of these panels will be matched with a corresponding panel of equal number of healthy, age-, race-, BMI- and gender-matched control participants.

 All panels will receive a single oral dose of 3-mg omarigliptin, followed by plasma sampling and urine collection.

 In Part II, 6 participants with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis will receive a single 3-mg oral dose of omarigliptin immediately following hemodialysis (HD) (Period 1) and 2 hours prior to HD (Period 2).

There will be approximately 1 month between Period 1 and Period 2.

 A corresponding panel of equal number, healthy matched control subjects (age, race, BMI, gender) will also receive a single 3 mg dose by mouth.

 Omarigliptin dose administration will be followed by plasma sampling for both panels.

 A Study of Omarigliptin (MK-3102) in Participants With Impaired Renal Function (MK-3102-009)@highlight

This is a 2-part study in participants with renal impairment and matched healthy participants to investigate the effect of impaired renal function on the plasma and urine levels of omarigliptin (MK-3102) after taking a single 3 mg dose by mouth.
