(fifthQuint)Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) to Treat Children With Solid Tumors or Leukemias.

 Background: The ras gene product plays a critical role in cell signal transduction.

 Activating Ras mutations occur in 30% of all human cancers, and the ras pathway may be upregulated in absence of ras mutations.

 Activated Ras initiates several signaling cascades, and the best characterized is the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade.

 Ras initiates this pathway by recruiting Raf kinase to the plasma membrane where it is further modified for full activation.

 A high frequency of B-Raf mutations has recently been reported in a variety of adult solid cancers.

 Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) is a novel, orally bioavailable, bi-aryl urea, which potently inhibits wild type and mutant raf.

 In addition, sorafenib inhibits several receptor tyrosine kinases including human VEGFR-2, FLT3, c-KIT, and p38 alpha, suggesting that sorafenib may mediate anti-tumor activity via several additional mechanisms.

 In early adult clinical trials sorafenib has been well tolerated, with minimal myelosuppression.

 Dose-limiting toxicities were hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, pain, and rash.

 Responses to sorafenib have been observed in early clinical trials in adults with a variety of tumors, including tumors that have not been described to harbor raf mutations.

 Sorafenib recently was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of refractory renal cell cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral Sorafenib in children with refractory solid tumors or refractory leukemias.

 To define the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of Sorafenib.

 To evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and activity of sorafenib administered at the MTD for refractory leukemias in patients with AML and FLT3-ITD mutations ELIGIBILITY: Patients (greater than or equal to 24 months to less than or equal to 21 years) with refractory solid tumors or refractory leukemias.

 Patients (greater than or equal to 24 months to less than or equal to 21 years) with AML and FLT3-ITD mutation (Part C).

 Participation in pharmacokinetic sampling is mandatory for Part C.

 DESIGN: Sorafenib will be administered orally BID on a continuous dosing schedule (28 days = 1 treatment cycle).

 Dose escalations will be performed to define the MTD.

 Initially, the spectrum of toxicity and MTD will be defined in patients with solid tumors.

 Patients with refractory leukemias will be entered at the solid tumor MTD, to determine whether patients with leukemia tolerate this dose level.

 Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics of sorafenib will be studied in patients with solid tumors and leukemias.

 In Part C: 14 patients will receive sorafenib at 150 mg/m(2)/dose, BID to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and activity of sorafenib.

 Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) to Treat Children With Solid Tumors or Leukemias@highlight

Background: - Sorafenib is an experimental anti-cancer drug that works by blocking proteins thought to be important for tumor growth.

 It has blocked the growth of tumors in test tubes and in some animal models.

 - Sorafenib is approved for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer.

 - This is the first time sorafenib is being tested in children with cancer.

 Objectives: - To determine the highest dose of sorafenib that can be safely given to children and young adults with cancer.

 - To determine the side effects and benefits, if any, of sorafenib in children and young adults with cancer.

 - To study how the body handles sorafenib and the drug's effects on cells and proteins in the blood.

 Eligibility: -Patients between 2 and 21 years of age with solid tumors or leukemias that do not respond to standard treatment.

 Patients between 2 and 21 years of age with AML and FLT3-ITD mutation for Part C of the study.

 Design: - Patients take sorafenib tablets every day about every 12 hours in 28-day treatment cycles for a maximum of 24 cycles.

 - The dose is increased in succeeding groups of 3 to 6 children until serious side effects occur.

 Subsequent patients then receive the drug at lower doses.

 - Patients have a physical exam, blood and urine tests, and CT or MRI scans periodically to monitor safety and treatment effects.

 Leukemia patients also have bone marrow aspirates.

 Patients with a solid tumor may have an MRI.

 Children whose bones are still growing have X-rays of the lower legs periodically to monitor bone structure.

 - Patients have additional blood studies to determine the amount of sorafenib in the blood, the effect of the drug on proteins and cells in the blood, and genetic differences that affect how individuals respond to the drug.
