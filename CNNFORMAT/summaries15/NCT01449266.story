(firstQuint)Safety and Dialysability of Dotarem in Dialysed Patients.

 Ten adult patients suffering from end stage renal failure and requiring hemodialysis treatment for 3 times were enrolled.

 Patients received a single dose of Dotarem(R) at 0.

1 mmol/kg before being submitted to hemodialysis to assess the dialysability of Dotarem(R) .

 After injection of Dotarem(R), 3 sessions of hemodialysis were performed as follows: The first hemodialysis session started between 1 to 2 h after the injection; The second hemodialysis session occurred 2 days (i.

e.

, 48 2 h) after the Dotarem(R) injection; The third hemodialysis session occurred 4 days (i.

e.

, 96 4 h) after the Dotarem(R) injection.

 The decrease in serum Dotarem(R) concentration was assessed after each hemodialysis session.

 Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, injection-site tolerance, and laboratory assessments.

Two safety follow-up visits were performed: one 3 weeks ( 2 days) and one 3 months ( 4 days) after the Dotarem(R) injection.
