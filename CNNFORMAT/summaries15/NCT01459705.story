(fifthQuint)Comparing Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy to Prolonged Exposure.

 The rationale for this study is based on growing evidence demonstrating that VRET is an efficacious treatment for PTSD and holds the potential to improve access to care for Soldiers who would otherwise avoid treatment.

 Although PE is considered one of the most effective cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) for treatments for PTSD, there are reasons why it may not be the most viable option for many Soldiers.

 First, prolonged exposure requires a level of emotional engagement during exposure to the trauma that many patients are unable to obtain.

 Second, stigma and concerns about how Soldiers will be perceived by peers and leadership has a dramatic impact on whether a Soldier will seek care.

 VRET may address these concerns and may also improve treatment outcomes and access to care by augmenting the patient's re-living of the trauma with a sensory-rich environment and moderating stigma perceptions by offering non-traditional treatment that is a preferable option for many Soldiers who are reluctant to seek out traditional talk therapies.

 Despite its promise as a viable treatment option, few studies have examined VRET for combat-related PTSD and there are no published studies that have compared VRET to PE in the treatment of combat-related PTSD.

 Positive results may provide new treatment options for all Soldiers, but should prove to be an especially attractive option for Soldiers who either do not respond to, or are reluctant to engage in other established therapies such as PE.

 Comparing Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy to Prolonged Exposure@highlight

This study is evaluating the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) by comparing it to prolonged exposure therapy (PE) and a waitlist(WL) group for the treatment of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in active duty (AD) Soldiers with combat-related trauma.

 The investigators will test the general hypothesis that 10 sessions of VRET or PE will successfully treat PTSD, therapeutically affect levels of physiological arousal, and significantly reduce perceptions of stigma toward seeking behavioral health services.
