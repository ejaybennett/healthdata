(fifthQuint)A Double-blind Placebo Controlled Trial of Sentra PM, a Medical Food.

 Sentra PM can induce restorative sleep compared to placebo, and as good as a sleep drug (trazadone) in subjects experiencing non-restorative sleep.

 Sentra PM taken with trazadone works better than either product alone.

 Twenty-six subjects will be randomized to a two week ingestion of Sentra PM at bedtime, twenty-six subjects will be randomized to a two week ingestion of trazadone at bedtime, twenty-six subjects will be randomized to a two week ingestion of Sentra PM with trazadone at bedtime and twenty -six subjects will be randomized to a two week ingestion of placebo at bedtime.

 Each morning after ingestion of either active product or placebo, the subject will fill out sleep questionnaires.

 On the fourteenth day of ingestion, a repeat 24-Hour ECG examination will be performed on all one hundred and four subjects and each subject will give a second blood sample for analysis.

 On the morning of the 14th day of ingestion the final sleep questionnaires will be completed.
