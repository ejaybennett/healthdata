(thirdQuint)Polar Wand Carbon Dioxide Cryotherapy for Barrett's Esophagus.

 Prospective pilot study to be performed in 14 Barrett's Esophagus patients with low grade and high grade dysplasia, referred for standard of care treatment.

 Patients will receive treatments with carbon dioxide Polar Wand cryotherapy at 0, 2 and 4 months, followed by surveillance endoscopy with four quadrant biopsies throughout the entire Barrett's esophagus (BE)segment at 6 months, followed by endoscopy with additional treatments (if needed) at 8 and 10 months, followed by a final surveillance endoscopy at 12 months, with four quadrant biopsies throughout the entire initial BE segment length.
