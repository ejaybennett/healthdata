 CHOP, Improvement of Therapy of Elderly Patients With CD20+ DLBCL Using Rituximab Optimized and Liposomal Vincristine.

 Primary objective of study: "OPTIMAL>60 Less Favourable" Patients with less favourable prognosis: To test whether progression-free survival (PFS) can be improved by substituting conventional by liposomal vincristine; To test whether PFS can be improved by 12 optimised applications instead of 8 2-week applications of rituximab.

 "OPTIMAL>60 Favourable": Patients with favourable prognosis: Comparison of neurotoxicity of conventional and liposomal vincristine; Determination of PFS for the treatment strategy of reducing treatment in patients with negative FDG-PET after 4 x R-CHOP/CHLIP-14 (PET-4) and comparison with the corresponding patient population in RICOVER-60.

 Secondary objectives: "OPTIMAL>60 Favourable" and "OPTIMAL>60 Less Favourable": Comparison of the prognostic value of a pre-treatment FDG-PET (PET-0) with conventional CT/MRT.

 Investigation of the prognostic value of different FDG-PET derived imaging biomarkers for lymphoma load (SUV, MTV, TLG).

 Comparison of the FDG-PET-based individualised treatment strategy in OPTIMAL>60 with the fixed (pre-defined) treatment strategy in RICOVER>60.

 Estimation of the vincristine-related neurotoxicity ("OPTIMAL>60 Less Favourable only, since vincristine related neurotoxicity is primary objective of the study in favourable patients) and other toxicities (all patients).

 Determination of the therapeutic efficacy of a Vitamin D substitution by comparing the first patients without Vitamin D substitution with patients with Vitamin D substitution.

 CHOP, Improvement of Therapy of Elderly Patients With CD20+ DLBCL Using Rituximab Optimized and Liposomal Vincristine@highlight

The purpose of this study is to improve the outcome of elderly patients with CD20+ Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma and to reduce the toxicity of standard used Immuno-Chemotherapy by using an optimised schedule of the monoclonal antibody Rituximab, substituting conventional by Liposomal Vincristine and by a PET-guided reduction of therapy in Combination with Vitamin D Substitution.
