(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of the DANUBIO Paclitaxel Eluting Balloon in In-Stent Restenosis Lesions (DEBREST).

 The DEBREST clinical trial is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, interventional study evaluating the investigational Danubio Paclitaxel Eluting Coronary Balloon in patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) lesion(s) with reference vessel diameter 2.

5 mm and 3.

5 mm.

 The trial will allow the treatment of up to two ISR (either Bare Metal Stent (BMS) or Drug Eluting Stent (DES) ISR) per patient in native coronary arteries with mandatory predilatation with a conventional balloon.
