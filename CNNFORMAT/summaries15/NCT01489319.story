(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Oral Lipid Ingestion in Relation to Ovarian Androgen Secretion in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

 The investigator hypothesizes that in women with PCOS, HCG administration will stimulate an exaggerated ovarian androgen response, dairy cream ingestion will stimulate white blood cells to generate an inflammatory response, and that there is a relationship between HCG-stimulated ovarian androgen secretion and the inflammatory response to dairy cream ingestion regardless of body fat status.

 Thirty (30) women with PCOS (10 normal weight with normal abdominal adiposity, 10 normal weight with increased abdominal adiposity and 10 obese) and 30 ovulatory control women (10 normal weight with normal abdominal adiposity, 10 normal weight with increased abdominal adiposity and 10 obese) will participate over a 3-year period.

 The investigator also hypothesizes that both salsalate and PCE administration for 12 weeks will attenuate the ovarian androgen response to HCG administration and the inflammatory response to dairy cream ingestion, reduce abdominal adiposity, increase insulin sensitivity and induce ovulation in normal weight women with PCOS.

 A subset of 16 women with PCOS of which 8 will receive salsalate (4 normal weight with normal abdominal adiposity and 4 normal weight with increased abdominal adiposity) and 8 will receive PCE (4 normal weight with normal abdominal adiposity and 4 normal weight with increased abdominal adiposity) will participate in this intervention over a 3-year period.

 This pilot project will help determine the feasibility of conducting a larger double-blind, randomized trial in women with PCOS to further test the latter hypothesis.

 Evaluation of Oral Lipid Ingestion in Relation to Ovarian Androgen Secretion in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between lipid-induced inflammation and ovarian androgen secretion in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); and to examine the effect of salsalate and polygonum cuspidatum extract (PCE) containing resveratrol on lipid-induced inflammation, ovarian androgen secretion, body composition and ovulation in a subset of normal weight women with PCOS.
