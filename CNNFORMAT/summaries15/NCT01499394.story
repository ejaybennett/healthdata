(fifthQuint)Caris Biorepository Research Protocol.

 The Caris Biorepository is an effort toward defining the future of medicine incorporating the discoveries of the genomic era by providing physicians, researchers and scientists access to quality human specimens and data aimed at improving human health and fighting disease.

 This will be accomplished through acquiring and sharing valuable biospecimen information and clinical outcomes in a collaborative, secure environment.

 The Caris Biorepository will bridge the gap and correlate human specimens with clinical and specimen data valuable to multiple and varying entities interested in advancing science with precision medicine by targeting disease treatments.

 The objective of this project is to develop and implement a state-of-the-science Biorepository that ensures molecular integrity and clinical relevance of human biospecimens used in research and clinical medicine.

 The Caris Biorepository will also provide vital biospecimens and data to internal researchers and external research collaborators such as government, academia and industry collaborators for the use of drug development discoveries, clinically relevant research trials, publications and posters, and the implementation of future healthcare policies.

 This project may also impact characterization of trends in practice patterns and their relation to patient outcomes as well as the economic implications of differing evaluation, treatment and management paradigms.

 Caris Biorepository Research Protocol@highlight

The Biorepository for Caris Life Sciences is designed for the purpose of making quality biospecimens and associated clinical data available for research studies related to advancing precision medicine and improving care for patients.

 The Caris Biorepository is a repository of prospectively collected biological specimens and associated clinical and demographic data gathered from multiple sources to be stored, used and shared for research.

 Caris Life Sciences will maintain the data and specimens and will control access to and use of the information and specimens by multiple individuals for multiple purposes which may evolve over time.
