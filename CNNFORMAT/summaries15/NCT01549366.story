(thirdQuint)Comparison of the Aspen Device Versus Pedicle Screws for Supplemental Posterior Fixation in Lumbar Interbody Fusion.

 This is a multi-center, prospective randomized clinical study to evaluate the clinical outcome of subjects with degenerative disc disease (DDD) (defined as back pain of discogenic origin with degeneration of the disc confirmed by history and radiographic studies) and/or spondylolisthesis utilizing either Aspen Spinous Process Fixation System or Pedicle Screws for supplemental posterior instrumentation as an adjunct to an anterior or lateral approach to lumbar interbody fusion.

 The primary hypothesis is that change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) of subjects in the study group (Aspen) will be non-inferior to the control group (pedicle screw instrumentation).

 The non-inferiority margin is pre-specified to be 10 ODI score points.

 If the non-inferiority is established, superiority of Aspen to the control will be tested.

 The study will involve up to 25 investigational sites.

 Enrollment is expected to take approximately 24 months.

 Subjects will be followed for 2 years, with the anticipated duration of the study being approximately 4 years from start to finish.

 Comparison of the Aspen Device Versus Pedicle Screws for Supplemental Posterior Fixation in Lumbar Interbody Fusion@highlight

The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the Aspen cent device compared to pedicle screw instrumentation for posterior fixation in the treatment of patients with degenerative disc disease and/or spondylolisthesis.

 The Aspen cent device will be compared to pedicle screw instrumentation in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) improvement and success of fusion.
