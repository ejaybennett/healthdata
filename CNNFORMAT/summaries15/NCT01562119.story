(secondQuint)Long Term Evaluation of Human Acellular Dermal Matrix Allograft For Coverage of the Wound After Extensive Deep Burn.

 The potential of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) had been proved to improve cosmetic and functional outcomes, nevertheless, there had been few reports about the long term results of the morphological, histological and functional changes after placement.

 The present study was to retrospectively evaluate the long-term outcomes of the cograft acellular dermal matrix (ADM) with autologous thin split-thickness skin for coverage of functional regional wounds in burned patients.
