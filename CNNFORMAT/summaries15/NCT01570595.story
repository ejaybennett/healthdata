(thirdQuint)Positively Smoke Free on the Web (PSFW) for Smokers Living With HIV.

 Positively Smoke Free on the Web is the first web-based cessation program developed expressly for people living with HIV (PLWH) who smoke tobacco.

 It is a resource that is ready for clinical use, but its feasibility and efficacy have yet to be studied.

 Main study goals are (1) to evaluate the website's feasibility (i.

e.

, recruitment, adherence, retention, and satisfaction) in a cohort of 69 PLWH smokers, and (2) to complete a prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of the online program to standard care (total N = 138) with a primary outcome of 3 month point-prevalence abstinence.
