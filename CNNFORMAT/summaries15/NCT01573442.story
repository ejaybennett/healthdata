(thirdQuint)Testosterone in Treating Postmenopausal Patients With Arthralgia Caused by Adjuvant Aromatase Inhibitor Treatment.

 This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial evaluating subcutaneous testosterone for the alleviation of aromatase inhibitor induced arthralgia.

 A parallel group design will be utilized for this two-arm study: subcutaneous testosterone vs.

 placebo.

 Patients are stratified according to baseline pain score (5-6 vs.

 7-10) and age ( 60).

 The primary objective is to determine whether testosterone will reduce AI-induced arthralgia and associated joint symptoms.

 The secondary objective is to explore whether testosterone will have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, with particular reference to androgenic adverse events including acne, hirsutism, and alopecia.

 Patients are followed up to six months as defined in the protocol.

 Testosterone in Treating Postmenopausal Patients With Arthralgia Caused by Adjuvant Aromatase Inhibitor Treatment@highlight

This randomized phase III trial studies testosterone to see how well it works compared to placebo in treating postmenopausal patients with arthralgia (joint pain) caused by anastrozole or letrozole.

 Testosterone may help relieve moderate or severe arthralgia associated with the use of aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole or letrozole.
