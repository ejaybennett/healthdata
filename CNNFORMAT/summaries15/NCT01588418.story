(firstQuint)Acute Effect of Exenatide on Brain Glucose Metabolism.

 This study will elucidate if exenatide has an effect on brain glucose metabolism.

 This will be accomplished by measuring the rate of glucose binding in various brain regions by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) after glucose load with exenatide injection and compare it with placebo injection measured in the same subject.

 The changes will be compared with peripheral and hepatic glucose metabolism and lipolysis.
