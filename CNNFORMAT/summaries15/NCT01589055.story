(fifthQuint)IV Nicotine Induced Changes in Hormone Function, Mood States and Behavior.

 These clinical studies are designed to examine the acute effects of intravenous nicotine on anterior pituitary (ACTH, LH) and adrenal hormones (DHEA and cortisol).

 We also plan to study norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), because nicotine stimulates rapid release of NE and E in preclinical and clinical studies.

 The studies will examine the acute effects of intravenous nicotine on the gonadal steroid hormones and the reciprocal feedback regulation by LH.

 The temporal covariance of hormonal changes with serum nicotine levels and nicotine-induced changes in subjective states and cardiovascular measures will be measured.

 The covariance between nicotine-induced changes in endocrine, subjective and cardiovascular effects and the temporal concordance with increases in serum nicotine and cotinine levels will be determined.

 Gender and menstrual cycle phase influences on the effects of nicotine on HPA and HPG hormones and subjective effects will be assessed.

 IV Nicotine Induced Changes in Hormone Function, Mood States and Behavior@highlight

Clinical studies are proposed to analyze the interactions between nicotine, alterations in endocrine hormones, mood and cardiovascular measures.

 The studies are designed to examine the contribution of gender and menstrual cycle phase.

 It is hypothesized that analysis of nicotine's rapid hormonal, cardiovascular and subjective effects will be important for developing novel biologic approaches to treatment for nicotine abuse and dependence as well as advancing understanding of the neurobiology of nicotine reinforcement.
