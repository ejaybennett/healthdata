(secondQuint)Ability of Partial Inverse Agonist, Iomazenil, to Block Ethanol Effects in Humans.

 Alcohol is abused commonly, but there is no antidote for alcohol intoxication the way naltrexone or naloxone is an antidote for opioids.

 A medication that has the potential to block alcohol actions in the Central Nervous System could act as a unique medication in the treatment of alcohol intoxication and alcoholism.
