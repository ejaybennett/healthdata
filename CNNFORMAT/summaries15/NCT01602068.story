(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Iontophoretic Dexamethasone Phosphate Delivery Prior to Implantation of a Posterior Chamber IOL.

 Phase 2, proof-of-concept (POC) clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ocular iontophoretic delivery of dexamethasone phosphate ophthalmic solution compared to ocular iontophoresis with a placebo (100 mM citrate buffer of pH 5.

7) in patients planning to have cataract surgery with implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL).

 The population studied was comprised of males and females scheduled for unilateral cataract surgery with implantation of a posterior chamber IOL.

 Eligible patients were enrolled into the study and were randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio into one of the following two treatment arms.

 Treatments were administered on the day prior (Day -1) to cataract surgery (Day 0).

 Subjects were scheduled to return to the clinic on Days 1, 7, 14, and 28.

 All subjects were scheduled to exit the study on Day 28.

 Subjects were asked to complete a daily pain score assessment questionnaire for the first 14 days post-surgery (Days 0 - 14).
