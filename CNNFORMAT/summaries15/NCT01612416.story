(secondQuint)Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Analysis for Glaucoma.

 Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy characterized by gradual degeneration of neuronal tissue in which retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are injured, leading to the loss of the visual field.

Recent studies have separately demonstrated a reduction in the macular retinal thickness and in the retinal nerve fibers in both POAG and NTG.

It has been demonstrated that in early stage NTG macular GCC thickness showed a strong correlation with thickness of the RNFL.

 However there have yet to be any reports regarding the comparison of macular thickness, ganglion cell complex and retinal nerve fiber layer between POAG and NTG with RS-3000 RetinaScan at early stage.

 Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Analysis for Glaucoma@highlight

The aim of this study is to examine whether there is a difference in macular ganglion cell complex thickness and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in early-stage Primary open angle glaucoma and normal tension glaucoma with spectral domain OCT.
