(thirdQuint)Analgesic Benefits of Perineural Versus Intravenous Dexamethasone in Patients Receiving Sciatic Nerve Block.

 Patients scheduled to have foot and ankle surgery will typically receive a single shot sciatic nerve block to serve as the primary anesthetic and as part of a multi-modal post-operative analgesic plan.

 Perineural dexamethasone has been investigated as an adjuvant for brachial plexus nerve blocks but its effect on sciatic nerve block outcomes has yet to be determined.

 More importantly, it is not known whether the beneficial effect of perineural dexamethasone on analgesia duration leads to a better quality of surgical recovery.

 We hypothesized that perineural dexamethasone leads to a better quality of postsurgical recovery than intravenous dexamethasone or saline control.

 The investigators are investigating the use of perineural dexamethasone together with local anesthetics can improve the quality of recovery for patients receiving sciatic nerve blocks for foot and ankle surgery.
