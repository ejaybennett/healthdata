(secondQuint)Comparing Driving Performance Among Trained and Untrained Drivers Using a Driving Simulator.

 Motor vehicle crashes remain the number one cause of death among teens in the United States.

 Teen drivers (ages 16 to 19) are four times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than adult drivers (ages 25 to 69).

 Driving simulators are a safer alternative to on-road assessments that are often affordable and can provide experimental control for research.

 Though driving simulators have advantages for evaluating driving performance in teens, there are gaps in the literature on the validity of a multidimensional outcome of driving performance in a simulator.

 To further examine the validity of a multidimensional measure of driving performance in a simulator, we compare simulated driving performance among teens who are trained hazard anticipation-perception training and those who are not.

 Comparing Driving Performance Among Trained and Untrained Drivers Using a Driving Simulator@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine differences in driving performance on a simulated driving assessment between novice teen drivers who receive the Risk Anticipation-Perception Training (RAPT) program and novice teen drivers who do not receive the training program.
