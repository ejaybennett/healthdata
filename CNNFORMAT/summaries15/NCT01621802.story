(secondQuint)Immunogenicity and Safety Study of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' Combined Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) Vaccine in Subjects Four to Six Years of Age.

 The GSK Biologicals' MMR vaccine (Priorix(R)) and Merck's MMR vaccine (M-M-R(R)II) are referred to as Inv_MMR vaccine and Com_MMR vaccine respectively.

 2 lots of the comparator vaccine (Com_MMR_L1 and Com_MMR_L2) will be used, but the 2 lots will be analysed as a pool.

 The Inv_MMR vaccine will be administered as a second dose to children who already received a first dose Com_MMR vaccine.

 Since the second dose of a MMR vaccine in the US is routinely co-administered with DTaP-IPV vaccine (Kinrix(R)) and varicella vaccine (VV) (ProQuad(R) or Varivax(R)), some children will receive one dose of these vaccines along with either of the MMR vaccines.

The purpose of this study is to support licensure of GSK Biologicals' MMR vaccine (Priorix(R)) in the US by generating immunogenicity and safety data in contrast to the US standard of care, Merck's MMR vaccine (M-M-R(R)II), when given as a second dose to children four to six years of age.
