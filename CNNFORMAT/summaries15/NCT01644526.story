(fifthQuint)A Pilot Study To Evaluate The CreatiVasc Hemoaccess Valve System In Patients Requiring Arteriovenous Graft Placement.

 The Hemoaccess Valve System (HVS) is a subcutaneous valve device that is implanted when a new AV graft is placed.

 A saline pump delivers fluid to the arterial balloon valve and closes that end of the graft off to blood flow.

 Using the dialysis blood lines, saline flushes residual blood from the graft back into the body.

 Then the venous balloon valve closes and heparinized saline resides in the graft between dialysis sessions.

 When the patient returns for dialysis, the dialysis technician deflates the valves and allows blood to flow to the graft for dialysis.

 (The saline inside the graft simply enters the blood stream.

) By only having saline inside the AV graft between dialysis sessions, there is no post-dialysis bleeding where the dialysis needles were cannulated, and because blood flow is restored to its normal course in the vein and artery, the traditional turbulent blood flow through the graft is eliminated, reducing the traditional complications caused when arterial blood is diverted through the graft then into the vein.

The ability to selectively control blood flow through an arteriovenous (AV) graft only when it is needed for dialysis may reduce the current repetitive complications such as thrombosis, venous hypertension post-dialysis bleeding, and blood steal from the extremities.

 The Hemoaccess Valve System (HVS) allows an AV graft to be turned on to blood flow when it is needed for dialysis then when dialysis is concluded, the device shuts off arterial blood flow and residual blood in the graft is flushed back into the body, using the dialysis blood lines.

 Once the graft is cleared of blood, the venous valve is then closed.

 Heparinized sterile saline reside in the graft between dialysis sessions.

 By having only saline in the graft and restoring normal blood flow to the artery and vein, it is believed that this will dramatically reduce the current complications associated with now having blood diverted through the graft 24/7.
