(fifthQuint)Sleep Self-Regulation Using Mental Imagery.

 Sleep deprivation is a significant health issue in the modern workplace.

 We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of techniques involving mental imagery promoting relaxation (arousal reduction; AR) and simulation of the appropriate sleep behavior in the likely environments (implementation intentions; II) in a population of daytime employees.

This randomised controlled trial assessed the efficacy of four mental imagery techniques for improving sleep and its related behaviour: (1) imagery focused on reducing arousal levels; (2) imagery incorporating implementation intentions (a strategy designed to link specified behaviour with the anticipated context) for sleep-related behaviour; (3) a combination of imagery using arousal reduction and implementation intention strategies; or (4) a condition where participants were asked to imagine their typical post work activities.
