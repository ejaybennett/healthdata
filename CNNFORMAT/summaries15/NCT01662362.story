(thirdQuint)Abbott ESA Chagas Assay Post-Market Study.

 ABBOTT ESA Chagas testing will be performed at a minimum of two blood donor centers.

 Testing will be performed using the FDA-licensed ESA Chagas assay and will be performed in accordance with the ESA Chagas package insert.

 ABBOTT PRISM Chagas repeatedly reactive blood donor specimens identified by U.

S.

 blood donor centers, as part of the routine blood donation process, will be tested with the FDA-licensed ESA Chagas.

 Specimens will also be tested with radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) for antibody to T.

 cruzi, a laboratory developed test, and the FDA-licensed ORTHO T.

 cruzi ELISA.

 The donor centers will contact the donors and request the donor to return to complete a questionnaire and provide a follow-up specimen.

 In addition, a minimum of 300 blood donor specimens with ABBOTT PRISM Chagas nonreactive results will also be tested with ESA Chagas.

 These specimens will be unidentified, leftover specimens from routine donor testing and not individually identifiable.

 Specimens that are positive or indeterminate with ESA Chagas will be further tested with RIPA.
