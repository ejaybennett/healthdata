(fifthQuint)Goal Directed Mechanical Ventilation Aimed at Optimal Lung Compliance.

 Identifying the dominant factor affecting respiratory system compliance by measuring transpulmonary pressure may better direct and optimize mechanical ventilation.

 Thus, instead of limiting mechanical ventilation by plateau pressure, PEEP and Inspiratory pressure adjustment would be individualized specifically for each patient's lung compliance as indicated by transpulmonary pressure.

 The main goal of this approach is to specifically target transpulmonary pressure instead of plateau pressure, and therefore achieve the best Lung compliance with the least transpulmonary pressure possible.

 Goal Directed Mechanical Ventilation Aimed at Optimal Lung Compliance@highlight

Patients with acute respiratory failure exhibiting decreased respiratory system compliance with hypoxemia or carbon dioxide retention are often difficult to ventilate with current guidelines that limit applied plateau pressure Yet, these guidelines do not take into consideration chest wall mechanics.

 The investigators sought to determine whether partition of the respiratory system into its components by measuring esophageal pressure and thus assessment of pleural pressure, would help in patients with acute respiratory failure to identify the factors contributing to low respiratory system compliance.
