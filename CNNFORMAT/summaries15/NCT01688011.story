(thirdQuint)Connect MDS/AML Disease Registry.

 This Disease Registry will collect data on patient characteristics, treatment patterns and clinical outcomes.

 The objective is to describe how newly diagnosed MDS, ICUS or AML patients are treated; and to build a knowledge base regarding the effectiveness and safety of front-line and subsequent treatment regimens in both community and academic settings.

 Enrolled patients will receive treatment and evaluations for MDS, ICUS or AML according to the standard of care and routine clinical practice at each study site.

 All treatments that patients receive for MDS, ICUS or AML will be recorded, including initial treatment and any subsequent therapy.

 Data on treatment outcomes, including response rates as measured by the treating physician, evidence of progression, survival, and patient-reported outcomes will be collected quarterly on the electronic CRF.

 Connect MDS/AML Disease Registry@highlight

The purpose of the Connect(R) MDS/AML Disease Registry is to provide unique insights into treatment regimens and sequencing of these regimens as they relate to clinical outcomes of patients with newly diagnosed MDS, ICUS or AML in routine clinical practice and evaluate molecular and cellular markers that may provide further prognostic classification and/or might be predictive of therapy outcomes.
