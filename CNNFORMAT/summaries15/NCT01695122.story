(secondQuint)Valproic Acid and Platinum-based Chemoradiation in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

 Valproic acid is a known histone deacetylase inhibitor.

 In addition to activating apoptosis pathways, cell differentiation and downregulating expression of growth factors, it also promotes radiosensitization.

 Most patients with Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma are diagnosed with locally advanced disease, in which long term disease control is still a challenge.

 The incorporation of epigenetic regulation into standard treatment could improve results of definitive platinum-based chemoradiation in such patients.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the addition of valproic acid to standard platinum-based chemoradiation as definitive treatment of locally advanced Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma can improve treatment outcomes, such as response rate.
