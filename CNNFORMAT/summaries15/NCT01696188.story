(fifthQuint)A Study Comparing Two Methods of Placing an Interscalene Nerve Catheter for Postoperative Pain Control in Patients Who Undergo Open Shoulder Surgery.

.

 Interscalene nerve block is an effective method of analgesia for surgery of the upper extremity.

 Perineural interscalene catheters offer the advantage of extended pain relief up to 48 hours after shoulder surgery.

 This is a prospective, randomized trial designed to compare two approaches (posterior and anterolateral) to interscalene continuous nerve catheter placement for analgesia after open shoulder surgery (open rotator cuff repair, total shoulder arthroplasty or revision, hemi-arthroplasty, or proximal humerus open reduction internal fixation).

 Specifically, the objectives of this study are to compare measured pain scores, opioid consumption, and catheter dislodgements.

 We hypothesize that the anterolateral approach will produce lower pain scores, less opioid consumption, and fewer catheter dislodgements.

 All patients undergoing open shoulder surgery will be recruited and enrollment in the study will not deviate from the current standard of care at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.

 All nerve blocks will be placed by a regional anesthesiologist or a fellow in regional anesthesia.

 Patient medical history will be obtained and blocks will be placed per usual protocol.

 Block efficacy will be assessed by physical exam immediately after placement by the anesthesiologist and another member of the research team.

 Operative details, including medications given, will be recorded.

 Patient pain scores and medications given in the PACU will be recorded.

 Supplementary analgesics will be available.

 Pain scores, medications given, and sensory examinations will be recorded for 48 hours postoperatively.

 Data will be analyzed both at the conclusion of the study and at several interims before that.

 A Study Comparing Two Methods of Placing an Interscalene Nerve Catheter for Postoperative Pain Control in Patients Who Undergo Open Shoulder Surgery.

@highlight

This is a randomized, double-blinded, prospective study designed to compare two approaches (in the plane of the ultrasound beam and out of the plane of the ultrasound beam) to placing an interscalene nerve block and catheter for pain control after open shoulder surgery.

 Both approaches have been used successfully but neither has been proven to be superior.

 Our endpoints are pain scores, time for block placement, and catheter dislodgements.

 We hypothesized that patients with the out-of-plane approach would have decreased pain and fewer catheter dislodgements.
