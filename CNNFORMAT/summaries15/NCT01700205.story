(secondQuint)"Watch Your Baby Grow" Study.

 This is a randomized clinical trial of infants whose parents decided to formula feed them; mother-infant dyads will be randomized when infant is 2 weeks of age to one of 2 groups.

 The groups will differ in the composition of the formula fed to the infant during the first year of life.
