(fifthQuint)Re-directed T Cells for the Treatment (FAP)-Positive Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.

 This is a phase I trial for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

 A fixed single dose of adoptively transferred FAP-specific CD8 positive re-directed T cells will be given in the pleural effusion.

 Three patients who are at the time point of screening not operable will be treated with re-directed T cells administered into the pleural effusion after completion of 3 cycles of palliative chemotherapy.

 In the case of one AE grade III/IV or one SAE - and the occurrence of DLT both judged to be treatment related by an independent safety monitoring board - the patient number will be expanded to 6 patients.

 The study will be stopped if one additional DLT occurs also judged to be treatment related.

 Patients will be treated with 1x10e6 re-directed FAP-specific T cells injected in the pleural effusion.

 The study ends 35 days after adoptive T cell transfer.

 Re-directed FAP-specific T cells will be administered at day 0 (day 14 of the third cycle of palliative chemotherapy).

 The study is designed to demonstrate safety of 1x10e6 re-directed FAP-specific T cells.

 The next patient will be enrolled earliest, when the previous patient completed day +14 and the safety monitoring board has not declared any DLTs.

 The palliative chemotherapy is not part of the study protocol.

MPM patients are not eligible for surgical procedures like decortication or pleuro-pneumectomy and have a median survival of 12 months with palliative chemotherapy.

 Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are of crucial need in this clinical situation.

 This is a phase I trial for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma with pleural effusion testing the safety of a fixed single dose of 1x10e6 adoptively transferred FAP-specific re-directed T cells given directly in the pleural effusion.

 Lymphocytes will be taken 21 days before transfer from peripheral blood.

 CD8 positive T cells will be isolated and re-programmed by retroviral transfer of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) recognizing FAP which serves as target structure in MPM.
