(fifthQuint)Risk Adapted Treatment for Primary Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

 Induction chemotherapy: idarubicin (12mg/m2/day intravenous, days 1, 3 and 5), intermediate-dose cytarabine (500mg/m2/12h, intravenous, days 1, 3 and 5) and etoposide (100mg/m2/day, intravenous, from day 1 to 3) as in AML-99 trial (NCT01716793), with the addition of subcutaneous G-CSF from day 0 to the last day of chemotherapy.

 This induction therapy is repeated if complete remission (CR) is not achieved after the first course of treatment.

 Consolidation therapy (as in AML-99 trial): mitoxantrone (12mg/m2/day, intravenous, days 4 to 6) and intermediate-dose cytarabine (500mg/m2/12h from day 1 to 6).

 Risk-stratification according to cytogenetics, courses to CR and availability of an HLA-identical sibling: - Patients in the favorable cytogenetics group [t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16)] and Leukocyte index 20 at diagnosis the intention is to perform an autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation.

 - Patients in intermediate risk group, with normal karyotype, a single course of induction chemotherapy to achieve the CR, the absence of adverse molecular features (FLT3-ITD or MLL-PTD) and low minimal residual disease levels after consolidation (MRD cent as "in vivo purging" followed by an autologous PBSC transplantation.

 Risk Adapted Treatment for Primary Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)@highlight

The AML-03 regimen investigates the addition of G-CSF priming to both induction and consolidation chemotherapies administrated in the previous AML-99 trial (NCT01716793) refines risk-stratification based on biological characterization also the AML-03 trial incorporates novel approaches for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: such as Mylotarg cent "in vivo purging" in autografts, extends unrelated volunteers donors for allotransplants in high-risk patients, and introduces reduced intensity conditioning in patients with elder age (more than 50 years old).

 The aims of these modifications are to analyse eficacy and toxicity of this induction and consolidation therapy and to analyse the disease free survival in patients who achieved complete response following a risk adjusted therapy.
