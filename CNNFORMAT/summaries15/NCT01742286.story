(thirdQuint)Phase I Study of LDK378 in Pediatric, Malignancies With a Genetic Alteration in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK).

 LDK378 is a novel inhibitor of ALK that is active in a broad range of ALK-activated tumor models, including models driven by mutated versions of ALK known to be resistant to crizotinib, and by ALK gene amplification.

 The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended dose for expansion in pediatric patients, and to delineate a clinical dose to be used in any future pediatric studies, with and without food.

 This study will also assess the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of LDK378 in pediatric patients with neuroblastoma, and other ALK-activated tumors.

The purpose of this study is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended dose for expansion of LDK378 as a single agent, assess safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity and characterize single and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics when administered orally to pediatric patients with ALK-activated tumors, with and without food.
