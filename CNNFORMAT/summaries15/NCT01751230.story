 A Personalized Telehealth Intervention for Health and Weight Loss in Postpartum Women@highlight

The purpose of this study is to help women lose the weight they gained during their pregnancy using a SmartPhone app the investigators have developed called E-Moms.

 The investigators hypothesize that the moms given the app to use during the study will lose more weight than the moms who do not use the app.
