(firstQuint)Beta Cell Restoration Through Fat Mitigation.

 BetaFat is a 2-arm, unblinded study to compare gastric banding to treatment with metformin over a 24-month period in moderately obese adults with pre- or mild type 2 diabetes.

 The primary outcome will be change in -cell compensation for insulin resistance, which the investigators will compare between groups.

 Secondary analyses will include other potential markers of -cell health and potential mediators of treatment-specific effects.

 The main focus will be on mediators related to obesity.

 Clinically, the project will serve as a test of concept for use of gastric banding relatively early in the spectrum of obesity and -cell disease.

 Biologically, the results will provide crucial information on potential mediators of -cell failure and its arrest or reversal in the context of obesity.

 Those mediators will guide the development of more effective treatment and monitoring for the -cell disease that causes type 2 diabetes.

Weight loss achieved through gastric banding will be superior to treatment with metformin in preserving or restoring pancreatic beta cell function in people with prediabetes or mild type 2 diabetes.
