(firstQuint)Clinical Trial to Assess the Influenza Vaccination (FLUVAC 02).

 Influenza vaccination strategies aim at protecting high-risk population from severe outcomes.

 Estimating the effectiveness of seasonal vaccines against influenza related hospitalisation is important to guide these strategies.

 The objective is to measure the population effectiveness of influenza vaccine in patients hospitalized with virologically confirmed influenza laboratory during the influenza season 2012/2013 in a French hospitals network.

 This is a study "case-control" involving a nasopharyngeal sample for all hospitalised patients presenting an influenza-like illness within seven days.

 Cases will be patients RT-PCR positive for influenza.

 Controls will be patients negative for any influenza virus.
