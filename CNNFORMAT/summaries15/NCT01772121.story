(secondQuint)Observational Study on Prevalence of Host and Viral Genotypes in Chronic Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C Patients in India.

 The overall goal of this study is to correlate the host and viral genetics of patients infected with viral hepatitis with their clinical presentation.

 This study will provide the first nation-wide estimate of key host genetic polymorphisms associated with immune response, such as in the IL28B gene locus which has been associated with treatment outcomes in hepatitis C.

 Characterization of HCV and HBV viral genotypes and sub-types across different geographic regions will allow for an exploration of associations between host and viral genotypes.

 Another objective of this study is to identify co-morbid illness and metabolic factors that are associated with chronic liver disease due to viral hepatitis.

 Finally, this survey will explore patient awareness of their disease, risk factors for disease progression, and their treatment options.

This study will define the substantial disease burden associated with viral hepatitis in India, and provide a foundation to understand the host and viral determinants of disease pathogenesis that may ultimately impact treatment decisions and outcome
