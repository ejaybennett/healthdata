(secondQuint)Occipital Nerve Stimulation (ONS) for Migraine: OPTIMISE.

 Initial reports of managing migraine headache with ONS described a technique in which electrical leads were implanted in the subcutaneous space transverse to the occipital nerve, in the back of the head, under x-ray guidance.

 The leads were tunneled under the skin to an implantable pulse generator (IPG) implanted in the chest wall or abdomen.

 The OPTIMISE Trial is designed to be a pivotal study of the Boston Scientific PRECISION neurostimulation system, when the system is used for ONS.

 The PRECISION System has been previously been approved for Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS).

 Occipital Nerve Stimulation (ONS) for Migraine: OPTIMISE@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) using the Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) Precision cent System in the management of intractable chronic migraine, when used in conjunction with anti-migraine medications.
