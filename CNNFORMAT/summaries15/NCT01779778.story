(firstQuint)Diurnal and Nocturnal Effect of Travatan With SofZia Preservative on Intraocular Pressure and Ocular Perfusion Pressure.

 The investigators hypothesize that Travatan Z will significantly lower intraocular pressure and increase ocular perfusion pressure during both the diurnal and nocturnal period, during a 24-hour evaluation, compared to baseline.

 The investigators further hypothesize that the medication effects will persist at 72 hours after discontinuation of the drug.
