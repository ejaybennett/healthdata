(thirdQuint)A Phase Ib/II Dose-finding Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of LDE225 + INC424 in Patients With MF.

 The purpose of this phase Ib/II clinical trial is to: a) evaluate the safety of the co-administration of LDE225 and INC424 in myelofibrosis patients and establish a maximum tolerated dose and/or Recommended Phase II dose of the combination and b) to assess the efficacy of the co-administration of LDE225 and INC424 on spleen volume reduction.

 Adult patients, aged 18 years, with myelofibrosis that meet intermediate or high risk prognostic criteria and exhibit palpable splenomegaly 5 cm below the left costal margin that have not been previously treated with a JAK or Smo inhibitor will be eligible for this study.

 Approximately 36 patients will participate in the Phase Ib dose escalation and safety expansion part of the study.

 Dose escalation will be dependent on the available toxicity information (including adverse events that are not DLTs), PK, PD, and efficacy information, as well as the recommendations from the Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM).

 In the Phase II part of the study approximately 46 patients will be enrolled: 18 patients will be enrolled into Stage 1, if following an interim analysis the minimum number of responders are observed, 28 additional patients will be enrolled into stage 2.

 If less than the minimum number of responders are observed in Stage 1 then further enrollment will be halted.

 Approximately 82 patients will be enrolled in the entire study.
