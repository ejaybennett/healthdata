(fifthQuint)Effective Screening for Pain Study.

 Background: In light of the importance of pain and widespread interest in patient-centeredness, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been emphasizing and successfully making pain and its management a routine feature of the health record and a focus of care.

 Awareness of pain and efforts to improve pain management rest on the VA's '5th Vital Sign' - a policy and practice of nursing staff routinely screening for 'pain now' at every health encounter using a 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).

 The team's previous research on VA's '5th Vital Sign' informs the specific design of this Effective Screening for Pain (ESP) study as well as the proposed research products.

 Alternatives to the current pain screening approach may improve the sensitivity and specificity of screening for chronic pain.

 These alternatives include the nurse administered NRS with a one week look back period and a three item scale (PEG) incorporating intensity and emotional and physical interference.

 The PEG is very similar to the gold standard Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) from which it is derived, in its sensitivity, specificity, and sensitivity to change in detecting clinically important, functionally impairing pain.

 The investigators plan to evaluate alternatives to the VA's current '5th Vital Sign' for pain screening, focusing on simple, feasible measures that can be used cross-sectionally for pain screening.

 In the setting of a primary care clinic, the investigators plan to cross-sectionally evaluate three arms - a nurse documented NRS now, a tablet computer-based NRS one week, and a tablet computer-based PEG.

 Objectives: 1) Qualitatively evaluate Veteran and multidisciplinary provider perspectives on pain screening and the use of the NRS vs.

 the PEG items, point of care vs.

 mobile reporting, clinician-assessed vs.

 patient-reported pain, and usefulness of medical chart and patient-derived health information in screening, assessment, management, and follow-up of pain.

 2a) Quantitatively assess, in a 3-arm randomized controlled primary care clinical team-based trial using tablets, the feasibility and completion rates, validity, and variability of pain information obtained comparing: Tablet-based vs.

 nurse-documented pain (e.

g.

, 5th vital sign by tablet vs.

 clinician assessed) and the rate and severity of pain detected in tablet-based 'NRS one week' (Arm 1), tablet-based PEG (Arm 2), and usual 5th vital sign (Arm 3).

 Also pain, self-reported disability, and Veteran satisfaction with pain screening mode for chronic pain detection.

 2b) Informed by Aims 1 and 2a, qualitatively evaluate provider perspectives on different pain reports and features of informatics prototypes to facilitate better pain management.

 Methods: The investigators are conducting a two phase mixed method study that will build on prior work to develop and test enhanced pain screening approaches for primary care and Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs).

 In the first (development) phase of the study, the investigators will conduct semi-structured qualitative interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians, other primary care team members including non-provider staff, and primary care Veteran patients, to understand what patient-reported pain assessment data are most useful for clinical decision-making and how this pain information can best be integrated into primary care team processes, including the role of informatics to optimize primary care pain management and link pain screening to management.

 This will inform the development of the enhanced pain screening approaches used in the Aim 2 randomized controlled trial (RCT).

 The investigators will also submit the enhanced tablet-based pain screening approaches to usability testing by the University of California Office of Information Technology.

 The second (testing) phase of the study will include a multisite RCT to test the final enhanced pain screening approaches (Arm 1 PEG; Arm 2 NRS 'pain now') compared with the NRS one week (Arm 3), on patient and primary care clinician outcomes.

 The investigators will assess whether the approaches improve detection of pain-related impairment, and also the feasibility, acceptability, and provider and patient experience with enhanced screening.

 Status: The investigators have completed Aim 1 data collection, coding, and analyses.

 They have presented some findings as conference posters and presentations at two conferences.

 Two manuscripts are currently under review and others are being prepared for submission.

 Findings from Aim 1 were used to guide the development of a tablet-based pain screening survey that the investigators tested in Aim 2a as a randomized control trial.

 The investigators have have completed data collection, and are currently analyzing results.

 For Aim 2b, the investigators have completed qualitative semi-structured interviews with providers about their perspectives on pain reporting processes, and have begun analyzing those transcripts.

 The investigators have conducted several interviews with patients and will continue collecting and analyzing those interviews.
