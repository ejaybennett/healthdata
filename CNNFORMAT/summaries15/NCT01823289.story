(secondQuint)An Efficacy and Safety Study of Itraconazole Sequential Therapy (Intravenous Injection Followed by Oral Solution) in Invasive Pulmonary Fungal Infections.

 This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single arm, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of itraconazole sequential therapy in participants with IPFI.

 The study duration will be 4 to 6 weeks.

 The treatment will be divided into the intravenous (into a vein) injection period and the oral solution administration (giving) period.

 During the intravenous injection period 200 milligram (mg) twice daily loading dose (large initial dose) will be given for first 2 days, 200 mg once daily for the subsequent 12 days.

 Then sequential itraconazole oral solution 200 mg twice daily will be given as maintenance therapy (treatment designed to help the original primary treatment to succeed) for 2-4 weeks.

 Participant's clinical, mycological and comprehensive efficacy will be assessed at Week 6.

 Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
