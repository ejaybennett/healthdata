(firstQuint)Capecitabine Pharmacokinetics(PK)-Actual Versus Ideal Body Weight.

 Cycle 1 : Capecitabine 1,250 mg/m2 PO BID for 7 consecutive days (D1 - D7) will be administered by subject (with Ideal Body Weight being used to determine BSA) for dosage.

 Day 8-No drug administered.

 Capecitabine 1,250 mg/m2 PO BID for 7 more consecutive days (D9 - D15) will be administered by subject (with Actual Body Weight being used to determine BSA) for dosage.

 There will be 6 consecutive days that no drug will be administered by subject (Days 16-21).

 Cycle 2 and beyond: Capecitabine 1,250 mg/m2 PO BID for 14 consecutive days (D1 - D14) will be administered by subject (with Actual Body Weight being used to determine BSA) for dosage.

 Days 15-21-No drug administered.

 Capecitabine Pharmacokinetics(PK)-Actual Versus Ideal Body Weight@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to find what happens to capecitabine in the body when dosed using actual versus ideal body weight in subjects with advanced tumors and elevated body mass index.
