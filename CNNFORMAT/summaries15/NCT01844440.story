(secondQuint)Diagnostic of Transient Lower Esophageal Sphincter Relaxation With Combined Impedance and High Resolution Manometry in Patients With GERD.

 tLESRs represent the main mechanism of all types of reflux events.

 Inhibition of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (tLESRs) has become one of the most relevant therapeutic objectives in patients with reflux symptoms resistant to proton pump inhibitors.

 HRM is the gold standard for detecting and characterizing tLESR, and could be considered as part of the pharmacological evaluation of new drugs targeting tLESRs.

 HRM criteria for the objective definition of tLESRs in GERD patients have to be established, as it has been done in healthy patients Subjects will undergo impedance / manometry recording with solid-state catheter systems, during a 30-min fasting and a 2-hour postprandial periods.

 Diagnostic of Transient Lower Esophageal Sphincter Relaxation With Combined Impedance and High Resolution Manometry in Patients With GERD@highlight

The aim of this study is to establish and validate High resolution manometry (HRM) criteria for the definition of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (tLESRs) in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients.
