, measures of intellectual function, academic abilities, attention, memory, processing speed and executive functions) and investigate the relationship of change to relevant demographic factors (e.

g.

, gender, age at treatment, time since treatment and socioeconomic status) and clinical factors (e.

g.

, treatment intensity/risk group, posterior fossa syndrome).

 - To assess the impact of a computer-based working memory intervention, relative to standard of care, on additional performance- and rater-based measures of attention, processing speed and executive functions.

 - To compare the impact of a computer-based working memory intervention in conjunction with an aerobic training intervention, relative to either intervention in isolation, on measures of attention, processing speed and executive functions.

 - To evaluate the maintenance of improvements on measures of attention, working memory, processing speed and executive functions six months following participation in the computer-based working memory intervention program.

 Outline: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to molecular subgroup assignment (WNT, SHH, or Non-WNT Non- SHH) and then by clinical risk stratification (extent of resection, M stage, histologic subtype, and cytogenetic features).

 All patients will be treated with risk-adapted radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy.

 Patients assigned to Stratum W1 will receive reduced dose radiation therapy.

 Patients assigned to Stratum W2, S1, N1, or N2 will receive standard dose radiation therapy.

 Patients assigned to Stratum W3, S2, or N3 will receive high dose radiation therapy.

 Radiation therapy will be followed by 4 cycles of adjuvant conventional chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, cisplatin and vincristine for all patients.

 Patients assigned to Stratum N2 or N3 (Non-WNT Non-SHH with high risk factors) will receive 3 additional cycles of pemetrexed and gemcitabine chemotherapy intermixed into the conventional adjuvant chemotherapy cycles.

 Patients with SHH subtype (Stratum S1 or S2) who are skeletally mature will receive 12 months additional maintenance therapy with vismodegib.

 Patients may consent to provide tumor tissue, blood, and CSF samples for biological studies.

 Tumor tissues are analyzed for the activation of the WNT signaling pathway, activation of the SHH signaling pathway, validation of novel patterns of gene expression via immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis; validation of genetic abnormalities via interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH); construction of gene expression profiles via microarray analysis; construction of DNA methylation profiling via microarrays; single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis for DNA copy number aberrations; potential oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes via DNA sequence analysis; expression of a number of cell signal proteins implicated in the biology of medulloblastoma via western blot; expression of additional proteins encoded by genes associated through SNP and gene expression array analysis with clinical disease behavior.

 Blood samples are analyzed from patients whose tumors contain gene mutations via sequence analysis of constitutional DNA.

 CSF and blood samples are analyzed for identification of potential tumor markers.

 Parents may consent to have blood samples analyzed for inheritable gene mutations associated with medulloblastoma.

 Patients may also consent to exploratory research that include additional functional MRI imaging to investigate damage to neural connections from therapy; additional psychological testing to identify neurocognitive effects of therapy; additional heart and lung testing to identify treatment effects; additional endocrine studies to identify treatment effect on growth and development.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.

 A Clinical and Molecular Risk-Directed Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Medulloblastoma@highlight

Historically, medulloblastoma treatment has been determined by the amount of leftover disease present after surgery, also known as clinical risk (standard vs.

 high risk).

 Recent studies have shown that medulloblastoma is made up of distinct molecular subgroups which respond differently to treatment.

 This suggests that clinical risk alone is not adequate to identify actual risk of recurrence.

 In order to address this, we will stratify medulloblastoma treatment in this phase II clinical trial based on both clinical risk (low, standard, intermediate, or high risk) and molecular subtype (WNT, SHH, or Non-WNT Non-SHH).

 This stratified clinical and molecular treatment approach will be used to evaluate the following: - To find out if participants with low-risk WNT tumors can be treated with a lower dose of radiation to the brain and spine, and a lower dose of the chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide while still achieving the same survival rate as past St.

 Jude studies with fewer side effects.

 - To find out if adding targeted chemotherapy after standard chemotherapy will benefit participants with SHH positive tumors.

 - To find out if adding new chemotherapy agents to the standard chemotherapy will improve the outcome for intermediate and high risk Non-WNT Non-SHH tumors.

 - To define the cure rate for standard risk Non-WNT Non-SHH tumors treated with reduced dose cyclophosphamide and compare this to participants from the past St.

 Jude study.

 All participants on this study will have surgery to remove as much of the primary tumor as safely possible, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

 The amount of radiation therapy and type of chemotherapy received will be determined by the participant's treatment stratum.

 Treatment stratum assignment will be based on the tumor's molecular subgroup assignment and clinical risk.

 The participant will be assigned to one of three medulloblastoma subgroups determined by analysis of the tumor tissue for tumor biomarkers: - WNT (Strata W): positive for WNT biomarkers - SHH (Strata S): positive for SHH biomarkers - Non-WNT Non-SHH, Failed, or Indeterminate (Strata N): negative for WNT and SHH biomarkers or results are indeterminable Participants will then be assigned to a clinical risk group (low, standard, intermediate, or high) based on assessment of: - How much tumor is left after surgery - If the cancer has spread to other sites outside the brain [i.

e.

, to the spinal cord or within the fluid surrounding the spinal cord, called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)] - The appearance of the tumor cells under the microscope - Whether or not there are chromosomal abnormalities in the tumor, and if present, what type (also called cytogenetics analysis)
