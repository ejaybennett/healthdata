(secondQuint)Acute High-risk Abdominal Surgery Study - an Optimized Perioperative Course.

 Emergency surgery is associated with high mortality rates, post-operative complications and prolonged duration of hospital admission.

 The investigators will implement a multidisciplinary optimized perioperative course consisting of a number of interventions carried out before, during and after surgery.

 Hypothesis: An optimized perioperative course will reduce the 30-day mortality in emergency abdominal surgery patients.

 The investigators will do a post-hoc analysis of the data registered.
