(fifthQuint)Population Effects of Antiretroviral Therapy to Reduce HIV Transmission (PopART).

 HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 071 (PopART) will investigate the impact on HIV incidence of universal voluntary HIV counseling and testing (with referral to care) provided to a community through a house-to-house campaign, in combination with early ART for individuals who are HIV-positive, and other proven preventive interventions.

 The design of HPTN 071 (PopART) will allow the study team to distinguish between the impact of universal testing with referral for HIV care in accordance with national guidelines, and the impact of universal testing with referral for early ART initiation for those with HIV infection.

 In addition, HPTN 071 (PopART) will determine if a program of universal voluntary testing, including early ART initiation, is feasible and acceptable when delivered on a large scale to entire communities.

 Evaluating the effectiveness of universal voluntary HIV counseling and testing with the offer of early ART is a key global health priority.

 Population Effects of Antiretroviral Therapy to Reduce HIV Transmission (PopART)@highlight

PopART is a community randomized trial that is investigating whether a community-wide combination HIV prevention package including annual home-based HIV testing, active referral and the offer of immediate ART for those testing HIV-positive, along with the promotion of proven HIV prevention methods (such as voluntary medical male circumcision, prevention of mother to child transmission and condom use), will help to prevent transmission and substantially reduce new HIV infections.

 The study is being conducted in 21 communities in Zambia and South Africa (randomized into 3 arms, each with 7 communities) with a total population of approximately 1.

2 million individuals.
