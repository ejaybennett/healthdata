(fifthQuint)Trial of WP1066 in Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma and Brain Metastasis From Melanoma.

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you join this study.

 Up to 6 groups of 1-6 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of the study, and up to 6 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.

 Up to 12 participants who will have surgery on the tumor during the study will be enrolled in Part 3.

 If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose of WP1066 you receive will depend on when you joined this study.

 The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of WP1066.

 Each new group will receive a higher dose of WP1066 than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.

 This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of WP1066 is found.

 If you are enrolled in Part 2 or Part 3, you will receive WP1066 at the highest dose that was tolerated in Part 1.

 If you are enrolled in Part 3, you will have additional tumor testing and advanced MRIs performed as described below.

 Study Drug Administration: You will take WP1066 by mouth 2 times per day on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of Weeks 1 and 2 of each 28-day cycle.

 For 2 hours before and 2 hours after each dose, you must fast (have nothing to eat or drink except water).

 If you miss a dose, you may take it within 24 hours.

 However, if it has been more than 24 hours since when you were supposed to take WP1066, you will need to contact the study doctor.

 For the first and last dose of Cycle 1, you will take WP1066 in the clinic so that timed blood tests can be done.

 If you are the first enrolled participant in a study group, you will be watched for 1 hour after your first dose in Cycle 1, and your vital signs will be checked every 15 minutes.

 The study doctor may decide to lower your dose of the study drug if you have side effects.

 You will write down the times of your doses of WP1066 in a study drug diary that will be given to you.

 You should bring the diary to the clinic at the end of each cycle.

 Study Visits: At every visit, you will be asked about any new drugs you may be taking, including vitamins, herbs, and supplements.

 You will also be asked about any changes in your health, how you feel, and any side effects you may be having.

 On Day 1 of Cycle 1: - You will have a physical and neurological exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.

 - Your performance status will be recorded.

 - Blood (up to 6 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

 - Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing before receiving WP1066 and 8 times during the 10 hours after the dose.

 PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.

 - You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

 On Day 2 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK testing.

 On Day 8 of Cycle 1, blood (up to 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 On Day 14 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing before receiving WP1066 and 8 times during the 10 hours after the dose.

 On Day 15 of Cycle 1, blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for PK testing and routine tests.

 On Day 22 of Cycle 1 and Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 2, blood (up to 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 On Day 1 of Cycle 2: - You will have a physical and neurological exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.

 - Your performance status will be recorded.

 - Blood (up to 6 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

 - You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

 On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond: - You will have a physical and neurological exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.

 - Your performance status will be recorded.

 - Blood (up to 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 Every 8 weeks, if you are in Part 1 or Part 2, you will have an MRI to check the status of the disease.

 Every 8 weeks, if you have melanoma, you will have a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease.

 If you are in Part 3, leftover tumor tissue from surgery will be tested for immune responses and to find out if STAT3 is in the tumor.

 Before surgery, after surgery, and every 8 weeks after that, you will have an advanced MRI to check the status of the disease.

 The advanced MRI is a special MRI that takes about an hour and a half longer than usual, and provides very detailed information for studying the area of the brain where the tumor is.

 If the study doctor thinks it is needed, certain tests may be repeated at other times.

 If it is more convenient, you can have your blood and urine collections for routine tests done at your local clinic or lab instead of at MD Anderson.

 Length of Study Drug Dosing: You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

 Follow-Up Visits: At 1 and 2 months after your last study drug dose: - You will be asked about any changes in your health, how you feel, and any side effects you may be having.

 - You will have a physical and neurological exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.

 - Your performance status will be recorded.

 - Blood (up to 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 Trial of WP1066 in Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma and Brain Metastasis From Melanoma@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of WP1066 that can be given to patients with recurrent (has returned after treatment) cancerous brain tumors or melanoma that has spread to the brain.

 The safety of this drug will also be studied.

 WP1066 is designed to target the STAT3 pathway in cancer cells, which makes these cells divide, increases new blood vessels to the tumor, causes the cancer cells to move throughout the body and brain, and avoids them being detected by the immune system.

 Targeting this pathway may cause the immune system to kill the cancer cells.

 This is the first study using WP1066 in humans.

 This is an investigational study.

 WP1066 is not FDA approved or commercially available.

 It is currently being used for research purposes only.

 Up to 33 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
