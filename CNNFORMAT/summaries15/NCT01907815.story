(secondQuint)Trametinib and Akt Inhibitor GSK2141795 in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the proportion of patients achieving complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete recovery of platelets (CRp) as best response within 4 cycles of therapy of trametinib in combination with GSK2141795 (Akt inhibitor GSK2141795) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with rat sarcoma (RAS) mutations.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the disease-free survival of patients achieving CR/CRp.

 II.

 To determine the duration of response of patients achieving CR/CRp.

 III.

 To determine the toxicity profile of trametinib in combination with GSK2141795 in this patient population.

 IV.

 To determine the biologic effects of trametinib in combination with GSK2141795 on leukemia cells.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 PO QD on days 1-28.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks.

 Trametinib and Akt Inhibitor GSK2141795 in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well trametinib and protein kinase B (Akt) inhibitor GSK2141795 work in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

 Trametinib and Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
