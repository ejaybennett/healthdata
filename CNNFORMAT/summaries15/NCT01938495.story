(fifthQuint)Diaphragm Pacing System (DPS) In Participants With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

 The study is a randomized controlled study to compare standard of care (control) to DPS (diaphragm stimulator named The NeuRx(R) Diaphragm Pacing System cent ).

 Although it remains uncertain if DPS is efficacious for the ALS subject, given the preliminary studies performed by the device manufacturer, it has received FDA humanitarian device exemption (HDE) approval as a humanitarian use device (HUD).

 This study will utilize a 2:1 randomization schedule such that eligible ALS subjects will have a 2/3 chance of receiving DPS and 1/3 chance of standard of care (control) treatment.

 The NeuRx(R) Diaphragm Pacing System cent (DPS) is a four channel, implanted percutaneous diaphragm muscle stimulation system.

 Under general anesthesia, the intramuscular electrodes are laparoscopically implanted in the diaphragm.

 The ends of the implanted electrodes are tunneled subcutaneously to an exit site on the chest or abdominal wall and connected to an external stimulator.

The study is being conducted to determine if DPS treatment for people with ALS and hypoventilation is associated with improved survival or diaphragm function.

 The primary objective of the study is to conduct a multi-center, randomized controlled clinical trial comparing standard of care (control) to diaphragm stimulator treatment with the NeuRx(R) Diaphragm Pacing System cent (DPS) with respect to survival.

 The secondary objective of the study is to conduct a multi-center, randomized controlled clinical trial to compare standard of care treatment (control) to DPS in ALS subjects with hypoventilation.
