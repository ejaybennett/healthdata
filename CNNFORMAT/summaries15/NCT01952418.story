(firstQuint)Effect of Video Monitor Size on Adenoma Detection Rate.

 Gastrointestinal endoscopists perfoming routine endoscopic procedures and their patients will be randomized to one of two endoscopy rooms at the MGH Ambulatory Endoscopy Center at Charles River Plaza.

 The two rooms will have identical equipment with the exception that one room will have the current standard size video monitor (NDS 26") used at this facility while the other room will have a larger video monitor (NDS 32").

 The ADR achieved by each physician in each room will be compared.
