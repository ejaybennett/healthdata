(firstQuint)Efficacy of Topical 0.

2% Xanthan Gum in Patients With Dry Eye.

 Oxidative stress is the result of an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant systems .

 The eye is constantly exposed to solar UV radiation which is the major inducer of ROS production and therefore oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several eye disease, including dry eye.

 Xanthan gum is a complex exopolysaccharide utilized as a food additive.

 Its chemical structure shows a capacity to react with ROS indicating a role as an anti-oxidative molecule.

 In the present study aging patients with dry eye will be enrolled.

 Signs and symptoms of dry eye as well as levels of oxidative stress in tear will be evaluated afte 30 days of treatment with eye drops containing carboxymethylcellulose or xanthan gum.
