 Occupational Therapy in the Context of Head Start@highlight

The purpose of this study is to identify the role of occupational therapy within Head Start programs.

 Representatives within Head Start will be asked to participate in a nationwide internet based survey identifying the amount and type of services provided within this area.

 The Model of Human Occupation (MOHO) will also be included in the study by identifying current use of the model and how it can be utilized in the future.

 In order to complete this study to the fullest extent, we must begin by defining the Model of Human Occupation as well as understanding the mission of the National Head Start Association.

 The vision of MOHO is to support practice that is focused on occupation, client centered, holistic, evidence-based, and complementary to other occupational therapy models.

 The mission of the National Head Start Association is to coalesce, inspire and support the Head Start field as a leader in early childhood development and education.

 This has lead researchers to perform the following study: An examination of occupational therapy in the context of Head Start.
