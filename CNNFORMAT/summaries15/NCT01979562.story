(firstQuint)Knowledge of Predicting Increased Risk for an Overuse Injury in Runners.

 The running style and the training composition and the body composition are thought to have major effect on the development of overuse injuries.

 To define a prevention strategy, one must have the knowledge about risk factors and causation.

 The training composition is very relevant clinically but the underlying factors have not been studied yet.

 For the present there is no scientifical evidence of a possible relation between the body composition such as the mutual length and width of femur and tibia and the development of overuse injuries.

 Thus, the aim of this study is to achieve evidence-based knowledge of these factors in order to advice runners about the precautions and to avoid that people get a sedentary lifestyle.
