(secondQuint)Measurement of Neonatal Microvascular Hemodynamics Using Non-invasive Optical Technologies.

 The researchers want to use optical technologies to non-invasively detect blood flow that can tell the onset of blood loss.

 The research can measure blood flow in stable premature infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit over the duration of several weeks.

 The technologies are Laser Speckle Imaging and Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy.

 Laser Speckle Imaging non-contact imaging technology, is sensitive to blood flow in superficial tissues.

 Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy, a probe-based contact technology like pulse oximetry, measures hemoglobin concentrations and states deeper below the skin surface.

Alterations to microvascular blood flow in premature infants, are known to contribute to several major disease entities.

 The optically-measured tissue blood flow, to determine tissue perfusion that can be use to detect blood loss.
