(fifthQuint)PK Analysis of Moxifloxacin in the Treatment of CAP.

 We determined the pharmacokinetic profile of moxifloxacin 400 mg/day in 18 patients treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia.

 .

 Moxifloxacin plasma concentrations were determined the day after therapy initiation using ultra high performance liquid chromatography.

 The moxifloxacin plasma concentration-time profiles were described with a one compartment model, using NONMEM.

 Peak drug concentrations (Cmax) and 24-hour area under the free drug concentration-time curve values (fAUC0-24) predicted for each patient were evaluated against epidemiological cut-off MIC values for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Legionella pneumophilia.

 PK-PD targets adopted were Cmax/MIC 12.

2 for all pathogens, fAUC0-24/MIC > 34 for S.

 pneumoniae and fAUC0-24/MIC > 75 for H.

 influenzae and L.

 pneumophilia.

 The same PK-PD estimates were used in the simulations of probability of target attainment (PTA) versus MIC.

 PK Analysis of Moxifloxacin in the Treatment of CAP@highlight

At the Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus Denmark, moxifloxacin is used in the empirical treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

 This study was designed to determine the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin 400 mg/day to patients treated empirically for CAP.

 To accomplish this aim, we established a pharmacokinetic population model.

 This approach was adopted with the dual purpose of assessing the potential efficacy of the drug and performing Monte-Carlo simulations to characterize the maximal MICs for which recommended pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) targets are obtained for pathogens commonly known to cause CAP.
