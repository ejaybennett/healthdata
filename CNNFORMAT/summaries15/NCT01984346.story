(secondQuint)CONVERGE - Epi/Endo Ablation For Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation(AF).

 The objective of this randomized pivotal study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the AtriCure EPi-Sense(R)-AF Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax(R) for the treatment of symptomatic persistent Atrial Fibrillation (AF) patients, refractory or intolerant to at least one Class I or Class III anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD).

 153 subjects from up to 27 US and 3 OUS sites.

 Randomized 2:1.

 The primary efficacy endpoint is success or failure to be AF/AT/AFL free absent class I and III AADs except for a previously failed or intolerant class I or III AAD with no increase in dosage following the 3-month blanking period through the 12-month post procedure follow-up visit.

 The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of major adverse events (MAEs) listed in the protocol for subjects undergoing the convergent procedure for the procedural to 30-day post procedure time period.
