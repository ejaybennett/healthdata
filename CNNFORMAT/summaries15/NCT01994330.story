(thirdQuint)Severe Aortic Stenosis and Acquired Von Willebrands Disease: The Impact of Desmopressin in Valve-Replacement Surgery.

 Randomized Controlled trial compared with placebo in a double blind fashion.

 Subjects with severe aortic stenosis (transvalvular gradient >50 mmHg or valvular area of lass than 1 cm2) scheduled for aortic valve replacement were enrolled.

 the day of surgery blood samples were taken in order to confirm diagnosis (factor VIII activity and Protein electrophoresis for Von Willebrands multimers) and then 0,3 mcg/k of DDAVP or saline equally labeled as "study drug" were administered en 30 minutes a half hour before incision.

 Blood loss, postoperative hematocrit and transfusion requirement were measured, plasma sodium was measured as a safety issue.

 Severe Aortic Stenosis and Acquired Von Willebrands Disease: The Impact of Desmopressin in Valve-Replacement Surgery@highlight

Acquired Von Willebrand disease (type 2A) has been described in patients with severe aortic stenosis, the association of aortic stenosis and Digestive bleeding due to this phenomena has received the name of Heyes syndrome.

 We propose that administering Desmopressin (DDAVP) in patients scheduled to aortic valve replacement surgery will reduce blood loss and transfusion rate.

 this was a pilot study
