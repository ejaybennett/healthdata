 Nab-paclitaxel is a formulation of the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel that is combined with a human protein called albumin.

 In Canada, nab-paclitaxel is currently approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

 This drug has been tested in other cancers and has shown promising activity in lung cancer, melanoma and pancreatic cancer.

 Information from research studies suggests that nab-paclitaxel may be a useful treatment for urothelial cancer.
