(thirdQuint)Hydrogel Balloon Assisted Intracranial Aneurysm Coiling Registry.

 This is a prospective, single arm, single center study of patients with ruptured or unruptured saccular aneurysms that are embolized using MicroVention second-generation hydrogel coils and undergo balloon remodeling with the MicroVention Scepter Occlusion Balloon Catheter.

 Data for each patient will be collected 6 3 months post-procedure for the study.

The objective of the GELATIN registry is to prospectively evaluate intracranial aneurysm occlusion and retreatment rates as well as adverse event rates in patients undergoing balloon-assisted coiling using the MicroVention Scepter Occlusion Balloon Catheter and second-generation MicroVention hydrogel coils for treatment of previously treated or untreated ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms.
