(secondQuint)A Phase I/II Study of [124I]mIBG PET/CT in Neuroblastoma.

 Neuroblastoma is the most common tumour of childhood after brain tumours.

 Approximately half of cases are high risk and despite extensive treatments outcome is very poor.

 More than 60% of high risk patients suffer relapse or further spread of their disease and long-term survival is below 10%.

 Existing imaging techniques are not sensitive enough to accurately assess the level of risk which is critical in determining the best choice of treatment.

 This study will compare a new type of imaging against the existing imaging techniques.

 The new scans use a new tracer called [124I]mIBG which is taken up by the cancer tissue much more than by normal tissues.

 This tracer can be used with a 3D imaging technique called PET/CT to pinpoint where the disease has spread and quantify the amount of disease.

 Patients will be those scheduled to have an [123I]mIBG scan for routine care during a planned break in treatment.

 A Phase I/II Study of [124I]mIBG PET/CT in Neuroblastoma@highlight

This study aims to show that 3-dimensional PET/CT imaging with a new novel PET tracer (called [124I]mIBG) can detect as many or more sites of neuroblastoma (a type of childhood cancer) compared to the recommended 1-dimensional routine scans (called [123I]mIBG planar scintigraphy).
