(thirdQuint)Observation of Microvessels and Invasion in Early Colorectal Lesions by NBI.

 The microvessel count (MVC) is a classical method of assessing histologic grade.

To verify whether NBI could predict histology through microvascular architecture,we measured lesion microvessels by immunohistochemistry.

On the other hand,we applied immunohistochemistry of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) to validate the capability of NBI for estimating invasion depth.

MMP-7 is directly involved in the processes of growth, invasion, and metastasis of colorectal cancer.

Our target was to clarify the diagnostic accuracy of magnifying NBI in early colorectal lesions,combined with the verification of microvessel count and MMP-7 expression.

 Observation of Microvessels and Invasion in Early Colorectal Lesions by NBI@highlight

Combined with magnifying endoscopy,narrow-band imaging (NBI) contrasts microvascular architecture on lesion surface.

The histology of early colorectal lesions could be predicted under NBI view.

However,its capability for estimating invasion depth remains to be verified.

The study is based on the hypothesis:NBI can predict histology and invasion depth,combined with the verification of microvessel count and MMP-7 expression.
