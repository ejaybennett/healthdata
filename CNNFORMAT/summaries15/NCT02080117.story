(secondQuint)Adequate Definition of Delayed Graft Function in Living and Deceased Donor Kidney Transplantation.

 Delayed graft function after kidney transplantation has been reported to be an important predictor for poor short and long-term survival.

 Delayed graft function increases post-transplantation morbidity, hospital stay, and incidence of premature graft failure.

 However, the definition of delayed graft function varies and more than ten definitions have been used in previous studies.

 Although the definition using dialysis requirements during seven days after transplantation has been used most frequently, dialysis may be required without any evidence of renal damage during one week after transplantation.

 Furthermore, the incidence of delayed graft function in living donor kidney transplantation using this definition has been reported to be relatively low (as low as 1.

6%) compared with the incidence in deceased donor kidney transplantation (up to 50%).

 Therefore, it is required to establish a better definition of delayed graft function in deceased donor kidney transplantation.

 We attempt to compare various definitions of delayed graft function in deceased donor kidney transplantation and find the definition that can predict graft function survival best in deceased donor kidney transplantation.
