(fifthQuint)Cognitive Health in Ageing Register: Investigational, Observational and Trial Studies in Dementia Research: Prospective Readiness Cohort Study.

 This is a prospective, non-interventional study consisting of a Main Study, a SubStudy, and an Ancillary Study that will enroll participants without dementia who are considered at high, medium, and low risk for developing AD from a community based register (referred to as the CHARIOT registry) in the United Kingdom.

 The Main Study will be conducted only at one site and the SubStudy and the Ancillary Study will be conducted at two sites.

 Participants in both the Main Study and the SubStudy will undergo a series of neuropsychological evaluations to characterize the patterns of cognitive change and their inter-relationship in the earliest stages of cognitive impairment.

 The SubStudy will investigate the longitudinal change of components of the PACC and RBANS in ARAD individuals who have demonstrable amyloid in the brain by either PET or CSF compared with individuals not classified as ARAD.

 The Ancillary Study will explore how measures of retinal amyloid plaques relate to cerebellar amyloid SUVR taken from PET imaging or with amyloid beta 42 levels measured in CSF.

 Data collection to assess outcome measures associated with disease progression will occur at baseline and every 6 months thereafter at the clinic during the follow-up period of 48 months (Main Study).

 SubStudy participants will be followed every 3 months throughout the SubStudy and will alternate between completing the alternative forms of the PACC and RBANS for a period of up to 3.

5 years (42 months).

 Ancillary Study participants will be followed on Day 1, Days 4-15 and a follow-up call (greater than [30] and less than [<] 35 days after Visit 2).

 Blood, urine, and saliva samples will be collected from participants during the study for biomarker analyses to assess risk factors for dementia, Alzheimer's disease or confounding factors of dementia risk.

 Adverse events experienced by the participants during their participation in the study will be monitored.

 Cognitive Health in Ageing Register: Investigational, Observational and Trial Studies in Dementia Research: Prospective Readiness Cohort Study@highlight

The purpose of this study is (i) Main Study: To describe the baseline characteristics (including demographics, cognitive status, and other measures) and the cognitive and functional changes of persons at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD).

 (ii) SubStudy: To investigate the longitudinal change of the components of the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) and the components of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) in asymptomatic at risk for AD (ARAD) individuals compared with individuals not classified as ARAD.

 (iii) NeuroVision Ancillary Study: To explore correlation between retinal amyloid beta plaques identified by fluorescence with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta 42 testing in participants at risk for Alzheimer's dementia.
