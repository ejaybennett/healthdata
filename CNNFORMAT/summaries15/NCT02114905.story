(fifthQuint)Dissemination of Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) to Occupational Therapists: A Feasibility Study.

 CBIT training materials designed by the study team have been used to train occupational therapists (OTs) at WC/NYPH and UAB to deliver CBIT, and data has been collected to measure training acceptability.

 OTs will be supervised in the practice of CBIT with youth in the New York City and Birmingham areas.

 Pre- and post-treatment assessment measures will be collected from 16 families (8 from each site) to evaluate intervention acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity.

 Patient and parent satisfaction of CBIT-OT will also be documented.

 The investigators will look within subjects to ascertain change in reported tic severity.

 This study is designed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of treatment, feasibility of research design, as well as demonstrate the ability to disseminate the study protocol to a new care discipline in methodologically rigorous fashion across multiple sites.

 Dissemination of Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) to Occupational Therapists: A Feasibility Study@highlight

Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) is an evidence based intervention for tic disorders.

 A recent scientific review of research priorities completed by the Tourette Syndrome Association recommended widespread dissemination of CBIT as an important next step in services delivery research.

 Given early evidence that occupational therapists can deliver CBIT effectively, a dissemination strategy using occupational therapists may improve accessibility to this treatment, at lower cost and with decreased stigma.

 Thus the goal of this study is to develop and test a training and dissemination model with occupational therapists (OTs) using an expert, multi-disciplinary team at Weill Cornell/New York Presbyterian Hospital (WC/NYPH) and University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).

 The investigators have adapted CBIT, the gold-standard behavioral intervention program for children with tic disorders (Woods et al, 2008a,b), for eventual use in OT programs across the country.
