(firstQuint)Targeted Natural Killer (NK) Cell Based Adoptive Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) After Radiochemotherapy (RCT).

 Patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in stage III A and III B showing at least stable disease after RCTx will be enrolled into the clinical trial.

 The aim of the study is to show the efficacy of an adjuvant treatment with Hsp70-peptide TKD/IL-2 activated, autologous NK cells following completion of standard radiochemotherapy (Cisplatin/Vinorelbine).

 Patients will be randomized 1:1 either to the interventional study group to receive 4 cycles of autologous immunotherapy with activated NK cells or to the control group (BSC).
