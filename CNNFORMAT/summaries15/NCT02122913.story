(secondQuint)Oral TRK Inhibitor LOXO-101 for Treatment of Advanced Adult Solid Tumors.

 The trial will be conducted in 2 parts: an initial dose escalation phase of larotrectinib in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

 This will be followed by an expansion phase in solid tumor subjects with an NTRK fusion.

 During the escalation phase, larotrectinib will be taken once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID).

 During the expansion phase, the larotrectinib dose selected from the escalation phase will be explored in approximately 40 additional subjects.

 Enrollment into the dose esclation portion of this study has been completed and is currently closed to enrollment.

 Patients will continue to be considered for enrollment into the dose expansion portion of this study.

 The objectives of the dose escalation phase are to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and recommended dose of orally administered larotrectinib.

 The objectives of the expansion phase are to better characterize the safety and efficacy of larotrectinib in patients with NTRK fusions.
