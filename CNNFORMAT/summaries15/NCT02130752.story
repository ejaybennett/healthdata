(fifthQuint)Ultrasonic Scalpel vs.

 Monopolar Electrocautery for D2 Distal Gastric Carcinoma Surgery.

 Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) 1.

 Preoperative evaluation Patients satisfied with inclusion/exclusion criteria will be informed to join in the clinical study and signature the inform consent.

 2.

 Randomization preoperative evaluation found that R0, D2 Gastrectomy can be performed, the case will entrance into the Randomization period.

 Random numbers are computer-generated, with the third party applications.

 3.

 Surgical procedures The surgical treatments is adopted the traditional open gastrectomy approach and adjuvant D2 lymphadenectomy.

 The SOP of the surgical treatments are according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer treatments guidelines, 2010, Version 3.

 4.

 Postoperative recovery Postoperative recovery period need to collect those relevant parameters of all the patients.

 All the relevant parameters had definitely definition in the Case Report Form of this study.

 5.

 Follow-up The follow-up of this study divide into two parts, the postoperative quality of life and tumor characteristics outcomes.

 The information of the postoperative quality of life is collected by the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire in four postoperative time intervals.

 The tumor related outcomes included long-term postoperative complications, recurrence type, relapse free survival (months) and the overall survival (months).

 Ultrasonic Scalpel vs.

 Monopolar Electrocautery for D2 Distal Gastric Carcinoma Surgery@highlight

Gastric cancer as one of the most common gastrointestinal cancers, radical resection of primary lesions combined with dissection of regional lymph-nodes is acknowledged by surgeons all over the world.

 By the invented and adopted energy surgical instruments, surgical procedure is safer and easier than before.

 The newly surgical instruments reduce the post-operative mortality and morbidity combined easy procedures of surgery.

 As the most popular instruments used in the gastric surgery, ultrasonic scalpel and monopolar electrocautery were received lots of attention and concern.

 Some studies have shown some advantage of the two instruments, which were they can facilitate the surgical treatment and make the surgery safer and more effective.

 Although, some small retrospective sample reports claimed that ultrasonic scalpel brought benefit in blood loss, dissection lymph-node intraoperative complications and even postoperative complications.

 And Korea small sample randomized controlled trail presentation that ultrasonic scalpel can reduced blood loss and surgical duration.

 However, postoperative complications were with no statistical significance between the two instruments.

 Cost- effective analysis of the energy instruments is still controversial.

 Large sample randomized control trail with high quality is needed.

 By the reasons above, a multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted by 9 hospitals from North to South in China aims to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes, when using of the ultrasonic scalpel or monopolar electrocautery in traditional open gastrectomy.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of ultrasonic scalpel compared with monopolar electrocautery in D2 distal gastrectomy, include, intraoperative parameters, postoperative complications, cost data, and post-operative quality of life.
