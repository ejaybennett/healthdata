(fifthQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of NexoBrid in Subjects With Thermal Burns.

 This is a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, controlled, assessor blinded, three-arm study aiming to demonstrate superiority of NexoBrid treatment over Gel Vehicle control and over SOC treatment in thermal burn subjects with burns.

 Following the enrollment of a patient to the study and prior to randomization Physicians will define one or more Target Wounds (TWs) per subject according to TWs definition.

 All subjects' deep (DPT and FT) burns that comply with the specified entrance criteria are intended to receive study treatment per the randomized study arm.

 The randomization procedure will be initiated only after all Target wounds of a subject have been defined.

 Patients will be assigned to the treatment arm in a 3:3:1 ratio (NexoBrid: SOC : Gel Vehicle).

 Patients will be treated in the same way in all study arms (NexoBrid, SOC or Gel vehicle) except for the eschar removal stage which will be performed as per the randomization study arm.

 Prior to initiation of eschar removal treatment, subjects will be medicated with appropriate analgesia and undergo wound cleansing and dressing of all wounds with antibacterial solutions .

 Following wound cleansing and antibacterial treatments, subjects will undergo the eschar removal process as per treatment assignment (NexoBrid, SOC or Gel Vehicle, following randomization).

 Subsequent to complete eschar removal, all wounds will be assessed and treated in the same manner, in accordance with post-eschar removal wound care strategy.

 Post eschar removal, subjects will undergo daily vital signs and pain assessments, until hospital discharge (HD) and weekly assessments of wound progress, until wound closure.

 Following wound closure confirmation visit, subjects will be followed up at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post wound closure for long term outcomes evaluation.

 A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of NexoBrid in Subjects With Thermal Burns@highlight

This study will be a three-arms study intending to demonstrate superiority of NexoBrid treatment over the Gel Vehicle placebo control treatment and over SOC in thermal burn subjects.

 The study objectives are: 1.

 To demonstrate the efficacy of enzymatic eschar removal with NexoBrid by providing complete eschar removal as compared with Gel vehicle, 2.

 To demonstrate the efficacy of enzymatic eschar removal with NexoBrid by providing earlier complete eschar removal, reduction in patients' surgical burden and its related blood loss as compared to SOC, 3.

 To assess the safety of NexoBrid compared to SOC, including demonstration that treatment with NexoBrid does not cause an unacceptable level of harm on wound closure outcome and long term outcomes of cosmesis and function.
