(fifthQuint)INternational ORthopaedic MUlticenter Study in Fracture Care (INORMUS).

 Number of Participants: 40,000 Primary Research Objectives: To determine among adult individuals admitted to hospital with musculoskeletal trauma (e.

g.

 fractures or dislocations): 1.

 The incidence of major complications (mortality, re-operation and infection) as a composite outcome and as individual components within 30 days post-hospital admission.

 2.

 The factors (system and patient variables) associated with the composite of major complications (mortality, re-operation and infection) within 30 days post-hospital admission.

 Secondary Research Objective: To determine the rates of major complications within 30 days post-hospital admission by type of fracture treatment provided (e.

g.

 splinting versus operative fixation).

 Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria: This study has minimal exclusion criteria by design.

 All patients 18 years of age or older admitted to a recruiting hospital for treatment of an orthopaedic injury that occurred within 3 months will be eligible for participation.

 Patients who are diagnosed with an orthopaedic fracture, dislocation, or fracture dislocation of the appendicular skeleton or spine will be included.

 Study Outcomes: The primary outcome is mortality within 30 days from hospital admission for all of our research objectives.

 The secondary outcomes are re-operation and infection within 30 days from hospital admission.

 Duration of Patient Follow-Up: Study participants will be followed until 30 days post hospital admission.

 INternational ORthopaedic MUlticenter Study in Fracture Care (INORMUS)@highlight

Background: Worldwide, injuries from trauma represent a major public health problem.

 The World Health Organization (WHO) has deemed this problem as one of the most important global priorities, calling 2011-2020 the 'Decade of Action for Road Safety'.

 Despite this, there is little empirical data in low and middle-income countries quantifying the burden of musculoskeletal injuries.

 Methods: INORMUS is a global, prospective, multi-center, observational cohort study.

 The primary objective of the study is to determine the mortality, re-operation and infection rates of musculoskeletal trauma patients within 30 days post-hospital admission.

 The INORMUS study seeks to enroll 40,000 patients from low-middle income countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
