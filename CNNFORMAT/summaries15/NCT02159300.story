(fifthQuint)Brain Rhythms in Fibromyalgia: A Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Study.

 The investigators will use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to non-invasively record brain activity in women with fibromyalgia (FM) pain and in healthy subjects.

 The MEG data will be analyzed in terms of the presence of normal alpha rhythm and abnormal low frequency and gamma oscillations and their source in the person's brain using their MRI.

 The investigators will use clinical evaluation, MEG recordings and MRI scans to achieve the following aims: 1.

 Determine if abnormal brain rhythms in the delta (0.

5 cm will be accepted.

 (The same fiducial points will be used for the MRI to co-register the MEG and MRI data.

) Each person will have three MEG recording sessions.

 Two MEGs will be recorded with the eyes closed (EC), and one will be recorded with the eyes open (EO).

 Including the time to fill out paperwork, measure their head shape, and the time between MEG recordings, the investigators estimate that each participant will spend 60-90 minutes at the New York University Center for Neuromagnetism.

 Instructions to participants for MEG recordings.

 An investigator will explain that the purpose of the recording is to look at brain activity while the patient is relaxed.

 There will be three 7-minute recordings.

 The first will be with the eyes closed.

 They will be told to please relax, but try not to fall asleep.

 Next, there will be a recording period with the eyes open.

 They will be told to please try not to move the eyes, but look at something the entire time.

 Third, there will another recording with the eyes closed.

 The investigator will let the person know when the recording begins, half way through each recording, and come in to see how they are doing after each recording.

 The person will be asked to please try not to move the head during the recordings.

 Magnetoencephalography is FDA approved and is routinely used for brain mapping in epilepsy and in pre-surgical patients and is standard of care in these cases (Shiraishi et al.

, 2005; Makela et al.

, 2006).

 However, these recordings are being performed exclusively for research purposes.

 Magnetic fields will be recorded using a 275-channel whole-head MEG system (CTF Systems Inc.

, Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada) (McCubbin et al.

, 2004).

 A third-order software gradient (Weinberg et al.

, 1984) will be used with a recording bandpass of 0.

25-125 Hz.

 3.

 Data Analysis and Data Monitoring.

 During each run magnetic fields will be recorded in 42 consecutive 10-sec trials.

 In this way, if the person moves during the session, the 10 sec trial during which this occurs can be eliminated from analysis.

 Neuromagnetic fields will be recorded in the eyes-closed state to minimize signals from ocular muscles and high-frequency visual system activation, and in the eyes-open and fixated state to decrease the amplitude of the alpha-range (8-12 Hz) peak (and thereby better facilitate the examination of spectrally proximal signals).

 Spectral analysis and independent component analysis will be carried out as in our previous studies (Walton et al, 2010).

 MRI and Source Reconstruction The purpose of the MRI (without contrast) is to provide an anatomical image of the person's brain that will be used to localize the brain activity recorded by the MEG.

 The MEG and MRI recordings must be co-registered so that they can be aligned accurately.

 The same location markers, called fiducial markers (see above), must be used for the MEG and the MRI.

 So, it is best if both recordings are done on the same day.

 The MRI is after the MEG because the MEG instrument can detect magnetic field as small as 10-15 Tesla.

 The MRI generates a magnetic field that, although small, can be detected by the MEG instrument and interferes with recording brain activity.

 The location of the three MEG fiducials is marked using a fine point magic marker.

 The person is then escorted to the MRI suit and the 3 MRI fiducials are put on the person using the magic marker points as guides.

 All MRI scans will be carried out on the 3 T Alegra platform, due to its better single-to-noise ration (SNR), spatial and spectral resolution, compared with the 1.

5 T instruments.

 Where MRI data is present the investigators will maintain a degree of uniformity across experiments by performing MRI constrained modified minimum norm inverse modeling on each data set.

 The MRI constrained inverse will be computed by assuming that the current source density is confined to grey matter as segmented from the MRI data.

 Each subject's MRI is segmented, and a tessellated cortical surface is reconstructed for each hemisphere using the software FreeSurfer (Dale et al.

, 1999).

 These cortical surfaces are then sub-sampled to create a sources pace of ~40,000 vertices.

 The lead field matrix, L, is computed for the dipole moments normal to the cortical surface or for all components.

 Potential biases or problems.

 A potential bias is during analysis of the MEG data.

 This will be mitigated since the person analyzing the data will be blinded to the pain status of the subject.

 Study subjects are identified by a code only in all data.

 Procedures, situations, or materials that may be hazardous.

 None.

 3.

 Data Storage and Confidentiality.

 Trained staff will conduct interviews in a respectful and sensitive manner.

 Records will be coded, stored and reviewed by participant number only.

 These coded records will be kept in locked files in locked offices.

 Access to computer-based data will be restricted by protection codes and login passwords, and all computers will be kept in rooms with restricted access.

 Brain Rhythms in Fibromyalgia: A Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Study@highlight

The long-term purpose of the investigator's research is to understand the pathophysiological basis of chronic pain.

 This will help provide a framework for the development of effective treatments.

 The purpose of this specific study is to find if there are abnormal brain rhythms in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) who are in pain since this will indicate particular types of treatments.

 FM is a disorder of the muscles and/or joints, and patients experience sever fatigue.

 FM occurs more often in women than in men (3.

4% of women, 0.

5% of men).

 The diseases can appear at any age, but in most of the cases it occurs in women of childbearing age.

 FM is considered a chronic pain condition since the pain is persistent.

 Pain and tenderness can be widespread throughout the body.

 FM patients are more sensitive to sound and pressure stimulation than healthy controls, indicating that there may be changes in the brain.

 Also, pain is made worse under conditions of stress.

 Treatments for FM pain include life style changes such as exercise, dietary changes, cognitive-behavioral therapy, medications and even surgery, but there is no accepted "best" treatment.

 This is partly because the underlying cause of the pain is not well understood.

 The design of this study is to record brain activity to find if there are abnormal brain rhythms in people with FM that are not present in healthy adults of the same age.

 Specifically, the investigators will test the hypothesis that constant low frequency oscillations will be present in patients with chronic pain due to FM.

 This has been found in people with other types of pain and is called Thalamocortical Dysrhythmia (TCD).

 The study has two parts.

 In the first part, a complete medical history will be obtained, including a description of the person's pain.

 In the second part the investigators will use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to non-invasively record brain activity.

 The MEG data will be analyzed in terms the presence of normal alpha rhythm and abnormal low and high frequency oscillations.

 Each person will have an MRI so the investigators can localize the rhythms recorded by the MEG in the person's brain using their MRI.

 The people who record and analyze the MEG recordings will not know if the person is a healthy control or a FM patient.

 The two parts will be joined to test the hypothesis and find if there is a correlation between the people with abnormal low frequency brain rhythms and the presence or degree of pain.
