(fifthQuint)Biomarkers for Gynecologic Cancer.

 "AminoIndex Technology" was developed based on high-throughput and absolute quantitative analysis method of amino acids and amines using UFLC-MS, and creating a clinical database to search for amino acid patterns across different diseases including cancer.

 "AminoIndex Technology" can evaluate certain health conditions and the possibility of diseases by analyzing the balance of plasma amino acids.

 Multicenter studies in Japan were conducted to develop an blood based biomarker panel for cancer.

 This study wil be conducted to evaluate the performance of AminoIndexTM (gynecological) biomarker based on "AminoIndex Technology" for gynecological cancers in US populations.

 This will be done by analyzing plasma metabolites including amino acids, from endometrial and ovarian cancer patients, from patients with benign gynecological disease, and healthy subjects using Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) and Liquid Chromatography - Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MSMS).

 Biomarkers for Gynecologic Cancer@highlight

A novel blood metabolic biomarker, AminoIndexTM (gynecological), was developed for gynecological cancers from over 400 Japanese patient's plasma free amino acid profiles (PFAAs) by a rapid and sensitive LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry), followed by multivariate statistical analyses.

 However, further studies to assess whether this biomarker demonstrates the same performance characteristics in non-Japanese populations for cancer is yet to be determined.
