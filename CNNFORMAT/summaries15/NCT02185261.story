 Standard risk acute leukemia patients (except t(9;22)(q34; q11), t(15;17), inv(16)(p13q22), t(16;16)(p13; q22), or t(8;21)(q22; q22) cytogenetic abnormalities.

) undergone unmanipulated blood and marrow transplantation following day 60 post-transplantation who were minimal residual disease positive after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation received interferon -2b.

 The end points were safety and immunologic response.

 Following time is 12 months.

 Primary Outcome Measures: *The feasibility and efficacy of administering of subcutaneous interferon -2b in this patient population.

 [ Time Frame: 1 years ] Secondary Outcome Measures: *The immunologic impact and clinical outcomes of subcutaneous interferon -2b in patients after unmanipulated blood and marrow transplantation [ Time Frame: 1 years ] Estimated Enrollment:81 Study Start Date: Jun 2014 Estimated Study Completion Date: Jun 2016 Intervention Details Description: *Drug:Interferon -2b (subcutaneously at dosages of 3 million units 2-3 times per week) for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Acute leukemia patients who were MRD positive after day 60 post-transplantation receive interferon -2b(subcutaneously at dosages of 3 million units 2-3 times per week).

 Interferon -2b continues for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Participants will be seen periodically while they are receiving interferon -2b.

 Physical exams and blood tests will be performed weekly for the first two weeks and then every other week until the completion of 6 months therapy.

 Interferon  for the Therapy of Minimal Residual Disease@highlight

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of interferon among patients undergone unmanipulated blood and marrow transplantation following day 60 post-transplantation who were minimal residual disease positive after transplantation.

 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an effective treatment option for acute leukemia and many other hematological malignancies.

 However, post-transplant relapse can occur in some patients, and the prognosis of these patients is usually very poor.

The persistence or recurrence of minimal residual disease (MRD) in the post-transplant period is an independent risk factor of relapse.

 Therefore, MRD monitoring can be used to screen patients with a high risk of relapse to provide timely intervention and prevent post-transplant relapse.

Interferon -2b exerts a relatively strong immunomodulatory effect.

 It can kill acute leukemia (AL) cells by regulating T-cell and/or natural killer cell functions.

Consequently, interferon -2b may have potential therapeutic value for AL patients with MRD-positive after transplantation.

 The study hypothesis: Prevention of relapse using interferon -2b following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with standard risk acute leukemia can reduce relapse rate.
