(firstQuint)Effect of High-flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen on Lung Volumes Determined by Electrical Impedance Tomography.

 Prospective clinical study in ICU with patients requiring High-flow nasal cannula oxygen comparing lung volumes determined by electrical impedance tomography and diaphragmatic ultrasound before, during and after High-flow nasal cannula oxygen.

 Duration of High-flow nasal cannula oxygen is 30 minutes.
