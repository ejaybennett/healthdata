(fifthQuint)TIGER-1: Safety and Efficacy Study of Rociletinib (CO-1686) or Erlotinib in Patients With EGFR-mutant/Metastatic NSCLC Who Have Not Had Any Previous EGFR Directed Therapy.

 This is a randomized, Phase 2/3 study of rociletinib versus erlotinib as a first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutant advanced/metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR-activating mutations.

 The study will consist of Phase 2 and Phase 3 parts which will use the same enrollment criteria and treatment assignment principles.

 Patients will be randomized 1:1 to erlotinib or rociletinib.

 The Phase 2 part is an open-label study.

 In the Phase 3 part, the sponsor will be blinded to the efficacy and safety results.

 The study will consist of a screening phase to establish study eligibility (including tumor genotype) and document baseline measurements, a treatment phase, in which patients will receive either rociletinib BID or erlotinib QD to ascertain safety and efficacy until protocol-defined disease progression, and a follow-up phase, to monitor survival status and subsequent NCSLC cancer therapy.

 In the Phase 2 part only, patients initially randomized to erlotinib may be eligible to participate in an optional crossover phase to receive rociletinib if they demonstrate the T790M resistance mutation after radiographic progression on erlotinib treatment among other eligibility requirements.

 Patients eligible for this study must have EGFR-mutated NSCLC who have not been treated with an EGFR-directed therapy.

Treatment with rociletinib or erlotinib is continuous.

 Each 28 day period of treatment will represent one cycle, with dosing initiated on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1 D1).

 TIGER-1: Safety and Efficacy Study of Rociletinib (CO-1686) or Erlotinib in Patients With EGFR-mutant/Metastatic NSCLC Who Have Not Had Any Previous EGFR Directed Therapy@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and anti-tumor effect of rociletinib with erlotinib in patients whose tumors have specific EGFR mutations and who have not previously received any treatment for advanced/metastatic EGFR mutated NSCLC.

 This study is a 'Randomized' Study.

 This means that upon entering the study, patients will be randomly assigned to be dosed with either rociletinib twice a day or erlotinib once a day.

 Patients will continue to take either rociletinib or erlotinib until it is no longer beneficial.
