(secondQuint)Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (FSRT) in Treatment of Brain Metastases.

 Standard of care for treatment of patients with brain metastases, which are considered not surgically removable, is radiation therapy to the brain lesions.

 This treatment is called Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (FSRT) and is given without chemotherapy and usually over 5 days.

 Researchers of this study want to find out if adding an investigational drug, called TPI 287, to standard radiation therapy (FSRT) can help people with brain metastases from cancer.

 TPI 287 is a drug that is being tested and is not approved for sale in the United States by the U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The main purpose of this study is to see whether addition of TPI 287 to FSRT is safe and tolerable.

 Researchers also want to find out if adding TPI 287 to FSRT can help with better controlling the growth of brain lesions in people with brain metastases from their cancer.
