(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy Trial for Alpha-Beta Depleted T-Cell Infusions Post Haplo Transplant.

 Transplant patients participating in this clinical trial will receive one of 3 standard pre-transplant chemotherapy preparative regimens as appropriate for their specific disease.

 They will then receive a standard non-manipulated donor stem cell infusion on transplant day (day 0) followed by cyclophosphamide (days +3 and +4) and an alpha-beta t-cell reduced donor stem cell infusion on day +7.

 Safety and Efficacy Trial for Alpha-Beta Depleted T-Cell Infusions Post Haplo Transplant@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of post-transplant cyclophosphamide and a post-transplant infusion of donor cells, that have been specially processed to remove alpha beta t-cells, in patients undergoing a haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplant to help reduce the risk of relapse without increasing the risk of graft-versus-host disease.
