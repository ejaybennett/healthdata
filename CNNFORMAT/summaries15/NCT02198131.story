 Pulsed Dye Laser in Treating Patients With Post Radiation Dysphonia@highlight

This pilot trial studies pulsed dye laser in treating patients with post radiation dysphonia.

 Dysphonia, or vocal cord scarring, can include trouble with the voice when trying to talk, such as hoarseness, change in voice pitch, and poor voice quality, and it commonly happens after radiation therapy for laryngeal cancer.

 Pulsed dye laser may improve post radiation dysphonia.
