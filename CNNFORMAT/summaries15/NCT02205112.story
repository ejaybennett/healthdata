(secondQuint)A Phase III Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Intravenous Infusion of Nemonoxacin in Treating CAP.

 Community-acquired Pneumonia (CAP) remains a leading cause of death in both developing and developed countries.

 In the choice of antibacterial agents used to treat CAP, fluoroquinolones have received considerable attention because of their wide spectrum of bactericidal activity.

 TG-873870 (Nemonoxacin), a non-fluorinated quinolone (NFQ), is a selective bacterial topoisomerase inhibitor.

 This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy, microbiological efficacy and safety of Intravenous nemonoxacin compared with Intravenous levofloxacin in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

 Besides, the populationpharmacokinetics (PPK) of nemonoxacin in adult patients with CAP after continuous IV Infusion and the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD)are to be determined.
