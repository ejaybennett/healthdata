(fifthQuint)A Survey on the Success of Inhibitor Elimination Using Individualized Concentrate Selection and Controlled ITI.

 As a result of many technological advances in the last two decades, current factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates (both plasma-derived and recombinant products) are considered very safe in terms of pathogen safety.

 The development of inhibitors against FVIII or factor IX (FIX) is considered as a major complication during replacement therapy of haemophiliacs.

 Prospective studies of previously untreated patients (PUPs) have suggested that inhibitors develop in up to 33% of patients with moderate to severe haemophilia A.

 Several strategies are used to control bleedings in such patients, e.

g.

 high-dose treatment with FVIII concentrates, treatment with activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) or treatment with activated factor VII (FVIIa).

 Immune tolerance induction (ITI) in order to eradicate inhibitors in patients suffering from an inhibitor to FVIII with high dose treatment of FVIII was first reported in 1977 by Brackmann & Gormsen in the so-called "Bonn Protocol" and was investigated from then on in a series of clinical studies applying the same or a modified version of the "Bonn Protocol".

 During these investigations high dose FVIII treatment has been proven efficacious in inducing immune tolerance and was shown to exert a long lasting effect in more than 80 % of the patients treated.

 The observational immune tolerance induction research program (ObsITI) will allow a systematic prospective and retrospective data documentation and analysis on the success rate of ITI by using individualized concentrate selection.

 In order to investigate the role of in vitro tests on individual ITI success rate in patients undergoing ITI, the inhibitor plasma samples can be assayed against different FVIII concentrates using the following in vitro tests: 1.

 Batch selection: The potential variation in inhibitor reactivity with different FVIII concentrates/batches of the same concentrate can optionally be studied according to a modified Oxford method (HZRM Hamophilie-Zentrum Rhein Main, Germany).

 2.

 Thrombin generation assay (TGA): In this optional in vitro test the plasma samples from an inhibitor patient can be spiked with different concentrates and the thrombin generation will be measured using the TGA to evaluate the potential of different FVIII concentrates to generate thrombin (Haemophilia Centre Malmo, Sweden).

 3.

 Thrombin Generation Test (TGT) to monitor FVIII efficacy: TGT will evaluate the correlation between clinical bleeding phenotype of patients and their thrombin generation capacity before and during ITI in order to predict the patients with the highest risk of bleeding.

 In vitro efficacy of two FVIII doses (low and high) in the presence and absence of FEIBA 80IU/kg will be evaluated.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the clinical bleeding phenotype of inhibitor patients before and during ITI in order to detect patients with the highest bleeding risk.

 4.

 Epitope mapping: The antibody epitopes on FVIII will be identified by screening peptide libraries and FVIII fragments with inhibitor patient plasma.

 This will help to identify relevant epitopes recognised by inhibitors in haemophilia A.

 This research program will give an opportunity to comprehensively study various aspects of inhibitors and the induction of immunotolerance in a relevant number of patients.

 Knowledge about relevant epitopes from patient plasma rather than from model systems (i.

e.

 monoclonal antibodies or mouse models) will help to understand the immune response to FVIII and to develop novel strategies to deplete inhibitors or inhibitor secreting B cells (University Hospital Frankfurt, Laboratory for Molecular Haemostasis and Immunodeficiencies, Frankfurt, Germany).

 5.

 IgG Subclasses specific for FVIII: Plasma samples will be tested for IgG-subclasses specific for FVIII.

 Most inhibitors belong to the subclasses IgG1 and IgG4.

 There are some indications that the ratio of IgG1 and IgG4 might influence ITI outcome (University Hospital Frankfurt, Laboratory for Molecular Haemostasis and Immunodeficiencies, Frankfurt, Germany).

 6.

 Immunogenotyping: In addition this study will investigate genetic risk factors (gene defect responsible for haemophilia, HLA class II alleles, immune response genes) as a potential variable with impact on course and outcome of ITI.

 Recently a significantly higher inhibitor incidence has been found in patients (brothers) with IL-10.

G allele 134, TNFA - 308G>A polymorphism within Hap and polymorphisms in the CTLA-4-gene compared to those brothers without the above mentioned polymorphisms (University Hospital Bonn, Haemophilia Centre, Bonn, Germany).

 7.

 Immune-monitoring of patients undergoing ITI: The evolution of several " markers " of the immune response during the treatment of inhibitor-positive patients with high dose FVIII will be evaluated in a subgroup of 40 patients.

 The goal of this study is to identify the " immune markers " that may predict the positive outcome of immune tolerance induction, (Sebastien Lacroix-Desmazes, INSERM, Paris, France, and Christoph Konigs, Laboratory for Molecular Haemostasis and Immunodeficiencies at the University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany.

 A Survey on the Success of Inhibitor Elimination Using Individualized Concentrate Selection and Controlled ITI@highlight

This research program is initiated to evaluate and document data on the success of ITI in 300 haemophilia A patients with newly developed or already existing FVIII-inhibitors (also patients who might potentially have failed in earlier ITIs), which will be treated with ITI - preferably high-dose based on individualized product selection, in order to improve management of this potentially devastating complication of haemophilia treatment.

 In order to investigate the role of in vitro tests on individual ITI success rate in patients undergoing ITI, the inhibitor plasma samples can be assayed against different FVIII concentrates using the following in vitro tests: Batch selection, Thrombin generation assay (TGA), Thrombin Generation Test (TGT) to monitor FVIII efficacy, Epitope mapping,IgG Subclasses specific for FVIII, Immunogenotyping.
