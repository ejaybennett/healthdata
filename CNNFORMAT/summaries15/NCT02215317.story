(thirdQuint)Sleep and Stent Study: a Multicentre, Prospective Study.

 Preliminary data suggest that OSA may lead to adverse cardiovascular outcomes after PCI.

 However, existing data were generated from small-scale, single-center studies.

 Therefore, in the Sleep and Stent Study, the investigators aim to conduct a large-scale multi-national cohort study to determine the association between OSA and the incidence of adverse cardiovascular outcomes over a long-term follow-up period.

 The investigators hypothesize that OSA is an independent risk factor for the development of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) in coronary artery disease patients treated with PCI.

 Results from the Sleep and Stent Study will advance the fundamental understanding of the burden and prognostic implications of OSA in patients undergoing PCI for coronary artery disease.

 Sleep and Stent Study: a Multicentre, Prospective Study@highlight

Elucidating the effects of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on cardiovascular outcomes is crucial in risk assessments and therapeutic recommendations for affected individuals.

 The Sleep and Stent Study is a multi-center observational study investigating the relationships between OSA and cardiovascular outcomes in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
