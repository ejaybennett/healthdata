(fifthQuint)Thirty Million Words Home Visiting: A Longitudinal RCT.

 Thirty Million Words Home Visiting: A Longitudinal RCT is a longitudinal, randomized control trial that will take place over the course of five years.

 The study will consist of two groups, the Treatment group and the Control group.

 Timelines and measurements are consistent across both groups.

 (Please see Study Procedures for a more detailed explanation of each phase.

) During the Recruitment Phase, a TMW research assistant (RA) will recruit participants for the study.

 If interested in joining the study, participants will complete the Preliminary Enrollment Consent.

 From this point forward, all study activities will take place in the participant's home.

 To follow the completion of the Preliminary Enrollment Consent, participants will be asked to complete a series of baseline measurements over a four-week time period.

 RAs will facilitate the collection of these measures.

 Following satisfactory completion of the baseline measures, participants will move on to the Enrollment Phase at which point they will complete the Enrollment Consent.

 Additionally, participants will complete Video 1, administered by an RA.

 Following the Enrollment Phase, participants will move on to the Intervention Phase.

 During the Intervention Phase, participants will first complete Assessment 1.

 A staff member of the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago (NORC) will conduct this and all subsequent assessments.

 Following Assessment 1, participants will receive 12 bi-weekly home visits over a six-month period from trained TMW Home Visitors.

 During the home visits, Home Visitors will deliver one of two different curricula to the respective groups.

 The Treatment group will receive the TMW Curriculum.

 The Control group will receive the alternative Nutrition Curriculum, which provides information about the importance of healthy nutrition for child development, strategies for healthy eating, and meal preparation.

 In addition to receiving the home visits, participants will also complete LENA recordings on a bi-weekly basis, alternating weeks with the home visiting schedule.

 Following the Intervention Phase, participants will move on to the 42-month Follow-up Phase.

 In this phase, participants will complete 4 curricula supplementation 'Boosters,' 6 video sessions, 6 Assessments, and 8 more LENA recordings.

 Thirty Million Words Home Visiting: A Longitudinal RCT@highlight

Thirty Million Words Home Visiting: A Longitudinal RCT is a longitudinal, randomized control trial, which is required to confirm whether the parent behavior changes seen during the feasibility trial are sustainable, and, critically, whether those changes translate into positive impacts on child language outcomes, child social-emotional development, and subsequent school readiness.

 The investigators will deliver the Thirty Million Words (TMW) Curriculum to 100 Treatment families, and the investigators will be following the children through kindergarten in order to measure the effects and sustainability of the curriculum.

 The investigators will deliver a Nutrition Curriculum to 100 Control families in order to control for the possible attentional effects experienced by those in the Treatment group.

 Moreover, as an ethical consideration, the investigators wish to also provide families in the Control condition with valuable education that may enhance their children's development.

 The investigators hypothesize that the primary effects of the TMW Intervention will significantly 1) improve low-SES parents' understanding of the importance of parent language in a child's development, 2) increase parents' linguistic interaction, responsiveness, and overall engagement with their children, and 3) increase children's language output.

 Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that increased parental interaction will result in 4) an improvement in children's social-emotional development.

 Finally, the investigators hypothesize that these social-emotional and linguistic gains through early development, along with sustained increased parental engagement, will be expressed in 5) increased child school readiness upon kindergarten entry.
