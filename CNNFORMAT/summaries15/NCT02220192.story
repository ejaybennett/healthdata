(secondQuint)An Alternative Treatment for Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Using the Focal Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure.

 Standard treatment for precancerous cells of the cervix is called electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP).

 Standard LEEP involves treating the entire cervix using FDA-approved equipment.

 Focal LEEP utilizes the same surgery and the same equipment but only treats the visually unhealthy part of the cervix and not the entire cervix.

 Side effects and unusual symptoms will be monitored as well as the patient's thoughts and recommendations of the procedure.

 The total amount of time of study participation is six months.

This is a pilot study to test the short-term effectiveness of an alternative treatment approach for precancerous cells of the cervix.

 The study will also explore whether this new treatment is feasible to perform and if it is acceptable to patients.
