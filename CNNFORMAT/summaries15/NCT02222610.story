(firstQuint)Study of the Efficacy and Tolerability of Intravitreal Injections of Ranibizumab Compared to Intravitreal Injections of Ranibizumab Combined With Targeted Retinal Photocoagulation to Treat Radiation Retinopathy.

.

 RRR is a phase II, randomized, multicenter, clinical study to assess the tolerability and efficacy of ranibizumab treatment administered in subjects with radiation retinopathy.

 Subjects will be randomized into one of 3 arms; IVT monthly vs.

 ranibizumab treatment administered IVT monthly combined with peripheral targeted photocoagulation vs.

 ranibizumab treatment administered IVT for three months followed by as needed treatment of ranibizumab combined with peripheral targeted photocoagulation over 48 weeks.

 From week 52 to week 101, all 3 treatment arms will employ a treat and extend protocol for IVT ranibizumab treatment.
