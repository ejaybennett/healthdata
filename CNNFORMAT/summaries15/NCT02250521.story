(secondQuint)McGrath MAC ISR-McGRATH MAC Video Laryngoscope Study.

 Using our primary endpoint for the study would assist us in determining at which modified Cormack-Lehane glottic grade by direct laryngoscopy our expert laryngoscopists use the indirect view for intubation of these potentially difficult airways.

 Secondary endpoints, such as time for laryngoscopy, time for intubation, glottic view, number of intubation attempts, and subjective ease of laryngoscopy performance, will be measured.

 Direct laryngoscopy is an important airway management skill every anesthesiologist is required to master.

 Since the introduction of the laryngoscope into clinical anesthesia practice, innovators have attempted to improve and perfect the design of the laryngoscope blade to facilitate endotracheal intubation.

 Prior to video laryngoscopy, teaching direct laryngoscopy has challenged instructors as they may have been unable to share the student's view.

 This challenge has been overcome by video laryngoscopes which allow direct vision laryngoscopy by the airway manager and indirect viewing on a monitor screen by an instructor.

1-4 Video laryngoscopes improve visualization of laryngeal structures and may increase the likelihood of successful tracheal intubation.

Our primary aim for the study is to measure intubation success rate on first attempt in management of the difficult airway, which could possibly allow us to determine at what direct laryngoscopic grade it becomes advantageous to use the McGRATH(R) MAC video laryngoscope.
