(firstQuint)The Effects of L-Tyrosine on 24 Hour Blood Pressure and Heart Rate in Parkinson's Disease.

 We will be monitoring 24 hour ambulatory BP and HR in subjects with PD on 3 separate visits.

 The first visit will be without an intervention to establish a baseline of 24 hour BP fluctuations.

 One week later the subject will be given either L-tyrosine (2,000 mg) with B6 (10 mg) or a sugar pill.

 We will monitor 24 hour BP and HR after supplementation.

 One week later the subject will repeat the same procedures with either supplement or placebo.

 This is a total of 3 visits with 24 hour ambulatory BP and HR monitoring.
