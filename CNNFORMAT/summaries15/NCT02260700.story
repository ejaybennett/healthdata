(thirdQuint)A Study to Evaluate Bioavailability, Food Effect, Safety and Tolerability of a Solid Dosage Formulation of JNJ-54861911 in Healthy Older Male Participants.

 This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center, single-dose and 3-way Crossover (the same medications provided to all participants but in different sequence) study to determine the bioavailability of JNJ-54861911 solid dosage formulation in healthy older male participants.

 The study will consist of 3 parts: Screening Phase (that is, 28 days before study commences on Day 1), an open-label treatment Phase (consists of 3 single-dose treatment periods, either a single oral suspension formulation [Treatment A] or solid formulation 25 milligram (mg) dose of JNJ-54861911 under fasted [Treatment B] or fed conditions [Treatment C] in subsequent 3-treatment periods; each treatment period separated with washout period of 6 days) and follow-up Phase (7 to 14 days after last dose administration).

 The maximal study duration for a participant will not exceed 8 weeks.

 All the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 6 treatment sequences.

 Followed by an overnight fast of at least 10 hours participants will be administered with study treatment under fasted condition or fed condition (30 minutes after high-fat, high-calorie breakfast).

 Participants will not be allowed to have food until 4 hours of drug administration.

 Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment.

 Bioavailability will be primarily evaluated by pharmacokinetic parameters.

 Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

The purpose of this study is to determine pharmacokinetics (the study of the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) and the relative-bioavailability (the extent to which a drug or other substance becomes available to the body) of JNJ-54861911 solid dosage formulation compared with JNJ 54861911 oral suspension formulation in healthy older male participants.
