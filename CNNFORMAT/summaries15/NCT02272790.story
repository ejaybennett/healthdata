(firstQuint)AZD1775 Plus Chemotherapy in Platinum-Resistant Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer.

 This is an open-label, four-arm lead-in safety and efficacy study in which AZD1775 will be combined in four separate treatment arms as follows: AZD1775 plus gemcitabine (Arm A); AZD1775 plus weekly paclitaxel (Arm B); AZD1775 plus carboplatin (Arm C); and AZD1775 plus PLD (Arm D).

 A subset of patients will be evaluated for the safety assessment of each treatment arm.

 The AZD1775 plus paclitaxel arm (Arm B) will enrol approximately 30 additional patients at selected sites as part of a further efficacy evaluation based on emerging data that suggests clinical activity.

 In addition, the AZD1775 plus carboplatin arm (Arm C) will enrol approximately 23 patients overall at selected sites as part of a further efficacy evaluation based on emerging data that suggests clinical activity.

 To further optimise the dosing schedule of AZD1775 in Arm C, a safety expansion arm (referred to as Arm C2) of approximately 12 additional patients will be enrolled at selected sites to explore emerging pre-clinical and clinical data that suggest that prolonged AZD1775 exposure may increase the clinical activity.
