(fifthQuint)Nurse-led Psycho-education Program for People With First-onset Mental Illness.

 The development of APNs in Hong Kong is in line with nursing development internationally.

 Since 2001, the Hospital Authority has appointed about 530 nurses as APNs, in whom about 50 are in mental health practice.

 Five of these psychiatric APNs function independently and interdependently with other health care team members to excel to health educators and care coordinators with fulfilments in health assessment, education and care coordination for clients with noticeable mental health problems, being referred to psychiatric outpatient service.

 A structured one-to-one psycho-education program has been developed and trial run to provide early psychiatric and psychosocial intervention and support to the clients who have been triaged by the psychiatric nurses in two outpatient clinics in the Kowloon East Cluster as categorised as those who present noticeable mental symptoms but low risks of self-harm or violence.

 These clients are arranged to have their first psychiatrist consultation in the clinic within two to eight weeks following triage.

 Prior to the consultation appointment, they are referred to the psychiatric APN in the nurse-led clinic for providing further psychosocial health assessment and early intervention and psychological support.

 As estimated by the clinic staff, there are 60% of the clients (i.

e.

 60 cases per month) triaged and classified as such category in the two outpatient clinics.

 This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the one-to-one, nurse-led psycho-education program provided by the psychiatric APN for those newly referred clients with mental health problems on improving their mental and emotional conditions, quality of life, and satisfaction with service, and on reducing their rates of hospitalization and default follow-up in two psychiatric outpatient clinics (OPD) in Kowloon East region of Hong Kong.

 Objectives of the study 1.

 To investigate the effects of the nurse-led psycho-education program for newly referred clients with mental health problems triaged as Category 2 on improving their mental state, anxiety state, insight and treatment attitude, self-efficacy in life situations, general health, and utilisation of and satisfaction with mental health care services provided over a period of 12 months follow-up; and 2.
