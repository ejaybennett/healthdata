(thirdQuint)Transdermal Vagal Stimulation for POTS.

 Background Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a syndrome characterized by disabling symptoms of inadequate cerebral perfusion on assuming the upright posture, including light-headedness, fatigue, palpitations, altered mentation, headache, nausea, presyncope, and occasionally syncope.

 POTS is characterized by an excessive increase in heart rate and exaggerated increase in plasma catecholamine levels on standing in the absence of a blood pressure fall.

 These disabling symptoms persist for more than six months.

 Objective The objective of this study is to study the effect of vagal stimulation on heart rate modulation during supine and upright posture as a treatment modality for patients with POTS.

 Transdermal Vagal Stimulation for POTS@highlight

Some patients experience high heart rates and symptoms of light-headedness, fatigue, headache during standing despite well maintained blood pressure.

 These patient are disabled and can't be in upright position for a longer time.

 The purpose of this study is to test whether electrical stimulation of a nerve through a skin of the ear may improve heart rate response and reduce disabling symptoms.
