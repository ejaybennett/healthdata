(secondQuint)Global Strain and Mechanical Dispersion May Predict Death and Ventricular Arrhythmias Better Than Ejection Fraction.

 1.

 The main aim of this study is to investigate if global strain and mechanical dispersion may predict death and ventricular arrhythmias better than left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with myocardial infarction and heart failure.

 2.

 In patients who receive internal cardioverter defibrillator(ICD) the main aim is to investigate if mechanical dispersion may predict ventricular arrhythmias better than EF.

 3) No interventions,only evaluation of the measurements obtained with transthoracic echocardiography.

 4) Follow up for 3 years.

The aim of the study is to investigate if global strain and mechanical dispersion may predict death and ventricular arrhythmias better than ejection fraction(EF) in patients with myocardial infarction and heart failure regardless of cause.
