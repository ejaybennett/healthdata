(firstQuint)Safety Study of Eteplirsen to Treat Advanced Stage Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

 This is an open-label, multi-center study to explore the safety and tolerability of eteplirsen injection in participants with advanced stage DMD with confirmed genetic mutations amenable to treatment by exon 51 skipping.

 Participants will be evaluated for inclusion during a Screening/Baseline period of up to 4 weeks.

 Eligible participants will receive once weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of 30 mg/kg eteplirsen for 96 weeks, followed by a safety extension (not to exceed 48 weeks).

 Safety will be regularly assessed throughout the study via the collection of adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms (ECHOs), vital signs, and physical examinations.
