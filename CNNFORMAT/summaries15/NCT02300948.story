(fifthQuint)Optimizing Periconceptional and Prenatal Folic Acid Supplementation.

 A prospective, randomized, 2-arm, interventional study involving women of child-bearing age will compare the folate status and pharmacokinetics of PregVit-Folic5(R) and PregVit(R).

 Some women of childbearing age, particularly those who do not practice multivitamin supplementation, may have inadequate intake and blood concentrations of vitamins and minerals, including those micronutrients which are important in pregnancy.

 Folic acid is one of the important vitamins in pregnancy which can be obtained from folate-rich foods, folic acid-fortified foods, and multivitamins.

 It is important to examine the folate status of fertile women, who do not usually practice multivitamin supplementation, before and after they implement folic acid containing-multivitamin supplementation.

 The investigators wish to measure red blood cell and serum folate concentrations among women who are healthy and/or childbearing age, those planning a pregnancy or early in pregnancy (900 nM red blood cell folate) against NTDs.

 Optimizing Periconceptional and Prenatal Folic Acid Supplementation@highlight

There are three objectives in this study: 1.

 To assess the serum folate pharmacokinetics of ingesting a single dose of PregVit-Folic5(R) versus a single dose of PregVit(R) (a multivitamin containing 1.

1 mg folic acid) 2.

 To assess the steady-state red blood cell (RBC) and serum folate concentrations achieved in non-pregnant, fertile women who supplement daily with PregVit-Folic5(R) versus PregVit(R) 3.

 To assess the steady-state RBC and serum folate concentrations achieved before and during pregnancy in women planning a pregnancy or early in pregnancy (<6 weeks gestation) who supplement daily with PregVit-Folic5(R) versus PregVit(R).
