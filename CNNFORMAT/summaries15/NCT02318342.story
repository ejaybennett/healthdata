(thirdQuint)Assessment of TRanscathetEr and Surgical Aortic BiOprosthetic Valve Thrombosis and Its TrEatment With Anticoagulation.

 Patients with a history of bioprosthetic valve replacement undergo cardiac contrast CT imaging and transthoracic echocardiography to evaluate structural and functional integrity of the aortic valves.

 The imaging studies will be performed at least 48-hours after bioprosthetic valve replacement.

 Patients with prosthetic valve abnormalities suggestive of thrombus will be administered anticoagulation therapy with Vitamin K antagonists (Warfarin) for 3 months with goal International Normalized Ratio (INR) 2-3, followed by repeat contrast CT of the chest and transthoracic imaging.

 Repeat imaging following 3 months of anticoagulation therapy is performed to evaluate the response to anticoagulation therapy.

 INR levels will be monitored and warfarin dose adjusted to maintain target INR 2-3.

 Assessment of TRanscathetEr and Surgical Aortic BiOprosthetic Valve Thrombosis and Its TrEatment With Anticoagulation@highlight

This is a prospective study designed to evaluate the structural and functional integrity of transcatheter or surgical bioprosthetic valves with multimodality imaging.

 The study further aims to confirm resolution of the early bioprosthetic valve thrombotic changes with Vitamin K antagonists (warfarin) mediated anticoagulation therapy.
