(secondQuint)CLLR3: Bendamustine + GA101 (BG) in Relapsed or Refractory CLL Followed by GA101 Maintenance for Responding Patients.

 The type II anti-CD20 antibody GA101 has demonstrated a high efficacy as single agent (ORR 62%) and was well tolerated in previously treated patients with CLL.

 Additionally, there is evidence that immunochemotherapy consisting of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) is active in patients with refractory and relapsed CLL.

 Besides FCR, the combination of bendamustine with rituximab (BR) has shown to be active in both relapsed and previously untreated patients with CLL.

 In preclinical studies GA101, a glycoengineered, humanized type II anti-CD20 antibody, has shown superior activity compared with type I antibodies.

 Therefore, a combination therapy with FC + GA101 (FCG) or B + GA101 (BG) might further improve the therapeutic outcome in relapsed or refractory CLL.

 The CLLR3 trial was designed to investigate and to compare the efficacy and safety of induction with both immunochemotherapies followed additionally by a maintenance therapy with GA101 for responding patients.
