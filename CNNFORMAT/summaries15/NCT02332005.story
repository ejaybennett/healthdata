(fifthQuint)12-Month Efficacy and Safety of Diepalrestat in Adults With Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy, a DB, Placebo-Controlled Study.

 This 12 month double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group efficacy and safety study will enroll 400 adult diabetic subjects with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) to investigate the effect of diepalrestat (BNV-222) 150 mg, 300 mg, or placebo on MNCV and patients' perception of nerve function over 12 months as measured by VAS scales and composite clinical outcome patient reported scales that evaluate numbness, tingling, cramping, paresthesiae, hyperesthesia, coldness, weakness and spontaneous pain perception of upper and lower extremities, and the effects on other measures of nerve motor and sensory conduction.

 Subjects will be assessed at screening and baseline, with office visits every 12 weeks, for a total of 6 visits.

 Subjects will be assessed by testing motor nerve conduction velocity and other assessments at each office visit.

 A subgroup of 24 patients will be selected for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing for up to 48 hours with additional blood draws on Day 7 and 14.

 This study will investigate the ability of diepalrestat to reduce the ongoing deterioration of nerve function which is a hallmark of the DPN process.

 12-Month Efficacy and Safety of Diepalrestat in Adults With Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy, a DB, Placebo-Controlled Study@highlight

An interventional study to investigate the efficacy and safety of diepalrestat (BNV-222) in diabetic patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

 Subjects will receive twice daily an oral dose of diepalrestat, an aldose reductase inhibitor, or placebo to investigate the effect on motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and symptomatic clinical responses over 12 months of treatment.

 Subjects will be assessed at screening and baseline, with office visits every 12 weeks, for a total of 6 visits.

 The study will explore in a double-blind fashion, the effect of two doses of diepalrestat, 150 and 300 mg, to reduce the loss in nerve conduction velocity that is expected to be demonstrated in the group randomized to placebo treatment for up to 12 months.
