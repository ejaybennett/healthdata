(thirdQuint)Multimedia Toolkits to Implement 12-Step Recovery Concepts in Group Counseling.

 The study has three aims.

 Aim 1 involves the development of an evidence-based 12-step facilitation toolkit curriculum.

 Toolkit structure and content is grounded in theory and empirical findings, and incorporates feedback from 12-step facilitation experts and individuals with a history of substance abuse.

 Aim 2 consists of implementing the resulting five-module Toolkit in a multi-site randomized controlled trial using a pre-/post-Toolkit training design that includes 1- and 6-month post-training assessments.

 Group counselors employed at community-based outpatient and inpatient substance abuse treatment programs will be randomly assigned to a Toolkit or treatment-as-usual condition.

 Data obtained from audiotaped sessions will identify between group differences in counselor adherence to 12-step content and skillfulness.

 Additional data will be collected on counselor satisfaction, 12-step attitudes and beliefs, and 12-step knowledge, as well as on Toolkit acceptability, feasibility, and short-term sustainability.

 Aim 3 will determine whether exposure to the Toolkit curriculum results in stable 12-step involvement and decreased self-reported substance use among clients.

This study is developing and testing a 12-step toolkit with five modules, training counselors to use them, and studying their frequency of use, desirability, effectiveness and patient outcomes.

 The toolkit includes counselor written guides, posters, client worksheets, engagement activities, and videos designed to be shown during substance abuse treatment group sessions to explain and encourage 12-step participation.
