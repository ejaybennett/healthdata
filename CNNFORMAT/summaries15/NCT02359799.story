(thirdQuint)Robotic Rehabilitation of Cerebral Palsy.

 The participants are randomly placed to two groups, either Lab group or Home group.

 For both groups, the participation will involve 18 training sessions over 6 weeks with 3 sessions each week.

 Each training session consisted of 20 minutes of passive stretching followed by 30 minutes of active movement training and ended up with 10 minutes of passive stretching.

 In addition, there are 3 visits for outcome assessment in the research lab, which carry out before and after the 6-week training, and at 6 weeks follow-up after the training.

 For the Home group, the participants will be initially trained by the research team at the lab setting on how to use the rehab robot.

 The training will be done over the first one or two sessions.

 The research team will go through with the participant and family members on how to operate the rehab robot at home.

 The participants and family members will practice using the rehab robot at the lab setting until they feel comfortable using the robot independently.

 Before taking the device home, the participants are asked to go through each step of the training without assistance from the research staff.

 The participants and family member will use their own vehicles to take the portable rehab robot home and do the training at home.

 Audiovisual interaction and instruction can be done through Internet if the participants need help in doing the training.

 Training data will be saved in the rehab robot, which can be uploaded to the server managed by the research team.

 Training setups can be adjusted based on the progress.

 For both groups, the participant will be asked to sit with the foot attached to a footplate and leg fixed by a leg-support.

 The robot will move the ankle joint slowly to the preset extreme range of motion and stretch the joint back and forth.

 The participant will be also asked to move the joint voluntarily to play video games on a computer.

 Each training session lasts about 1 hour.

 Outcome assessments Assessments are done before, after the training treatment sessions, and at the follow-up.

 During the assessment sessions, the ankle will be moved by the robot to test passive range of motion and joint stiffness.

 The participants will also move the ankle voluntarily and the active range of motion and muscle strength will be recorded.

 Clinical exam scales will be done including modified Ashworth scale, Selective Control Assessment of Lower Extremity (SCALE), balance, and walking ability (distance covered in 6 minutes).

 Robotic Rehabilitation of Cerebral Palsy@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of home-based and lab-based stretching and active movement rehabilitation on ankle impairments in children with cerebral palsy using a portable rehab robot.

 Children with spastic cerebral palsy are placed into two groups, participating in robot-guided passive and active movement training in a research lab setting (Lab group) or in home setting (Home group).
