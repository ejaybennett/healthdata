(fifthQuint)Retrograde Colonic Irrigation to Manage Spina Bifida Functional Digestive Sequelae: a Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized Controlled Trial.

 Sphincter dysfunctions impair the quality of life and patients' self-esteem.

 However, defecation disorders are important issues the Spina Bifida National Reference Center has to deal with.

 Indeed, more than half of patients are concerned.

 These disorders are mainly due to fecal stasis.

 Treatments include laxatives and hygiene recommendations.

 Colonic irrigation can also be useful, especially to achieve colonic vacuity and improve continence.

 The use of intra-rectal balloon inflation probes and the control of instillation flow improved retrograde colonic irrigation efficacy.

 Nevertheless, this technique is currently not evaluated in young adults suffering from Spina Bifida functional digestive sequelae, who are mainly concerned by Malone enema.

 The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of retrograde colonic irrigation associated with usual care (medical treatments, patient education) on anorectal dysfunction (incontinence and/or constipation), compared to usual care only.

 Retrograde Colonic Irrigation to Manage Spina Bifida Functional Digestive Sequelae: a Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized Controlled Trial@highlight

Spina Bifida is a developmental congenital disorder caused by the incomplete closing of the embryonic neural tube, leading to serious malformations of the nervous system.

 Caudal neuropore malformations almost always lead to sensory-motor deficits (including complete paraplegia) with orthopedic deformations, pressure sores, and pelvic/perineal neurological dysfunctions (affecting the bladder-sphincter, anorectal, and genital sphere).

 The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of retrograde colonic irrigation associated with usual care (medical treatments, patient education) on anorectal dysfunction (incontinence and/or constipation), compared to usual care only.
