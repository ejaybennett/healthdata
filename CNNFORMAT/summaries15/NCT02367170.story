(thirdQuint)Project 4A: Inspiratory Muscle Training and Diaphragm Strength.

 In this research study, investigators will assign study participants to two groups: high intensity inspiratory muscle training and low intensity inspiratory muscle training group.

 This research study will last up to 28 days in 24 mechanically ventilated patients with CCI.

 The goal is to determine if the research participants can respond to a training program by improving weaning outcomes from the ventilator.

 This will be determined by measurement of breathing muscle strength with magnetic stimulation, measurement of diaphragm thickness with ultrasound, inspiratory muscle training, and blood and urine samples.

Investigators will assess the effect of exercise on markers of inflammation and protein catabolism.

 This research study will further our understanding of how treating Chronic Critical illness (CCI) - related respiratory muscle weakness with strength training can not only improve muscle function, but also potentially blunt the inflammation and catabolism of Peristent Inflammation/Immunosuppression and Catabolism (PICS).
