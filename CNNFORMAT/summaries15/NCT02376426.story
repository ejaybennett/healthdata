(firstQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Heterologous Prime-Boost Ebola Vaccine Regimens in Healthy Participants.

 This is a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of MVA-BN-Filo and Ad26.

ZEBOV administered in different sequences and schedules to healthy adult participants.

 The study consists of a screening period of up to 28 days, a vaccination period in which participants will be vaccinated at Baseline [Day 1] followed by a boost on Day 29 or 57 and a post-boost follow-up, until all participants have had their 21-day post-boost visit (Day 50 or Day 78).

 The participants who received active vaccine will enter a long-term follow-up.

 The total duration of the study will be about 1 year for participants who received vaccine and about 3 months for participants who received placebo.

 Immunogenicity and safety will be monitored during the study.
