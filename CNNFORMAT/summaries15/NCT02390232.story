(thirdQuint)Prospective Cohort Assessing the Role of the Genotoxin Colibactin From Escherichia Coli B2 in the Genesis of NASH.

 Gut microbiota composition is now linked to the onset of obesity, metabolic disorders, and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease .

 While simple steatosis has benign prognosis, steatohepatitis (NASH) leads to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma and increases cardiovascular and cancer- related mortality.

 Some Escherichia coli (E.

 coli) belonging to the B2 phylogenetic group are involved in many diseases.

 Those producing the genotoxin colibactin are in addition known to induce a chronic alteration of intestinal permeability, one of the major factors leading to NASH.

 Prospective Cohort Assessing the Role of the Genotoxin Colibactin From Escherichia Coli B2 in the Genesis of NASH@highlight

In a population of patients with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), the investigators will compare the composition of the gut microbiota from patients with simple steatosis with that with steatohepatitis.

 The purpose of this study is to determine if the pathogenic Escherichia Coli to the B2 group and producing the genotoxin colibactin is a factor for developing NASH.
