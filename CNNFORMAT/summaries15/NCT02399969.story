(fifthQuint)Battlefield Acupuncture for the Treatment of Low Back Pain in the Emergency Department.

 The researchers will review the chief complaints of patients arriving to the emergency department in epic.

 Subjects will be identified and recruited in the emergency department based on chief complaint of "back pain".

 Subjects will be approached by a researcher who will then recruit them to participate in the study using the attached informed consent form.

 Researchers will not be acting as treating physicians at the time of the study.

 50 patients that present to the emergency setting with the complaint of low back pain will be randomized to standard care or standard care plus Battlefield Acupuncture.

 The patients randomized to receive Battlefield Acupuncture will receive the treatment according to the defined protocol, which involves placement of ASP indwelling needles in up to 5 auricular points.

 One ear will be selected, and the areas which will be needled will identified and prepped with alcohol to reduce risks of infection.

 Up to 5 sterile ASP semi- permanent needles will be placed.

 Treatments will be provided by MDs or PAs who have been trained to administer the Battlefield Acupuncture technique.

 All patients will complete pre- and post- treatment surveys regarding their pain rating and functional limitation from pain.

 Additional data will be collected from EPIC regarding demographic information, medication administration, and length of stay.

 Data will be collected from the subject at the time of enrollment, and again one hour following enrollment.

 No further data will be collected directly from subjects.

 Additional follow-up data regarding medications prescribed and length of stay will be collected from the chart after patient discharge.

 Battlefield Acupuncture for the Treatment of Low Back Pain in the Emergency Department@highlight

The purpose of this study is to study acupuncture for the treatment of low back pain in the emergency department.

 Current treatments for low back pain in the emergency department generally include pills or injections of medications to treat pain and relax muscles.

 However, it is known that many of these medications have risks and toxicities which may limit their safe use in some patients.

 Therefore, new types of treatments are needed.

 Acupuncture is an ancient form of healing that has been practiced in some form for centuries.

 In modern times, acupuncture has been studied for the long-term treatment of low back pain and some research suggests it may be effective.

 However, very little research has examined the use of acupuncture for immediate pain relief in the emergency department.

 This research will study a type of acupuncture called Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA).

 Battlefield acupuncture was designed by a physician in the US military with the purpose of providing immediate pain relief.

 It involves the placement of 5 small needles in each ear.

 The needles may be removed at any time.

 The hypothesis of this study is that battlefield acupuncture may improve mobility and pain of patients with low back pain in the emergency department.
