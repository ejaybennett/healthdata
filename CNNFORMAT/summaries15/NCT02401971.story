(fifthQuint)Irinotecan Plus Thalidomide in Second Line Advanced Gastric Cancer.

 This is a prospective, randomized, multi-center, controlled clinical trial, aimed to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of thalidomide and CPT-11 in advanced gastric cancer.

 A total of 900 patients are planned to be enrolled into the study.

 Patients with diagnosis of advanced gastric cancer will be randomized into two groups, and be treated with thalidomide+ CPT-11 or CPT-11, respectively.

 The primary end point is time to progression (TTP), and the secondary end points include efficacy, overall survival (OS) and the occurrence of delayed diarrhea.

 Irinotecan Plus Thalidomide in Second Line Advanced Gastric Cancer@highlight

Recent clinical studies have demonstrated a reduction of irinotecan (CPT-11) gastrointestinal toxicities when the CPT-11 is administered in combination with thalidomide in patients with diagnosis of gastric cancer.

 The main purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of thalidomide and CPT-11 in advanced gastric cancer.

 The investigators will also manage to find out the possible interactions between CPT-11 pharmacokinetics and thalidomide to explain the previously described gastrointestinal toxicity reduction.
