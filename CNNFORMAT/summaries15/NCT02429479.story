(fifthQuint)Preparing Family Caregivers to Make Medical Decisions for Their Loved Ones.

 The long-term goal is to help family caregivers of seriously ill patients be better prepared to serve as surrogate decision-makers when their loved ones can no longer make medical decisions for themselves.

 Research shows that family caregivers find surrogate decision-making highly stressful and emotionally burdensome, in part because they feel unprepared for surrogate decision-making.

 To date, no studies have determined which advance care planning (ACP) process best prepares caregivers for this role.

 The investigators' prior work shows that a computer-based decision aid can help patients make more informed decisions and communicate their wishes more effectively.

 The investigators now propose to determine if family caregivers of patients with life-threatening illnesses are better prepared for surrogate decision-making: 1) when they engage in a structured ACP process together with patients; and 2) when they use this online decision aid for ACP.

 This will be accomplished via a randomized, controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design comprising 4 groups: Standard ACP/Patient Alone (Group 1), Decision Aid/Patient Alone (Group 2), Standard ACP/Patients and Caregivers Together (Group 3), and Decision Aid/Patients and Caregivers Together (Group 4).

The overarching goal of the project is to improve the process and experience of surrogate decision-making by family caregivers.

 Since feeling unprepared to make surrogate decisions is a major contributor to caregiver stress, the primary outcome is caregiver self-efficacy --i.

e.

, caregivers' assessment of how well prepared they feel to serve effectively as a surrogate decision-maker.

 Through follow-on Renewal funding, we are now also qualitatively examining family caregivers' experience with surrogate decision-making.
