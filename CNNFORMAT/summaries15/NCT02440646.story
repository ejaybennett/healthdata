(fifthQuint)Natural History of Atherosclerosis in Real-World Patients Underwent Computed Tomography Angiography.

 The retrospective studies have shown that most atherosclerotic plaques responsible for future acute coronary syndromes are angiographically mild, and the lesion-related risk factors for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) are poorly understood.

 Pathological studies have shown that thrombotic coronary occlusion after rupture of a lipid-rich atheroma with only a thin fibrous layer of intimal tissue covering the necrotic core (a thin-cap fibroatheroma) is the most common cause of myocardial infarction and death from cardiac causes.

 However, the prospective identification of thin-cap fibroatheromas has not been achieved, in part because the imaging tools to identify them in vivo did not exist until recently (Stone GW, et al, 2011; doi: 10.

1056/NEJMoa1002358).

 Both CTA and 3D QCA provide us with a potential of the non-invasive imaging of atherosclerotic lesions, but accuracy and safety remain the keystone limitations of these approaches.

 CTA has the unique advantage over detecting non-calcifying plaques in addition to calcifying lesions, thus allowing for direct visualisation of early atherosclerosis stages such as lipid and fibrous atheroma, which are risk factors for future coronary events.

 Long-term studies report of an increased risk of adverse outcome associated with vulnerable fibroatheroma, whereas calcifying lesions tend to remain rather stable.

 Studies investigating the accuracy, outcome and, thus, the diagnostic benefit of coronary CTA in chest pain patients are scarce (Plank F, et al, 2014; doi:10.

1136/openhrt-2014-000096).

 The accuracy of three dimensional (3D) QCA has recently developed to overcome 2D QCA limitations, however, accuracy and precision of 3D QCA measurements in the different stage lesions has not been established (Kan J, et al, 2014).

 In a prospective cohort single-center observational study REALITY, 720-1080 chest pain patients ('all-comers' REALITY registry of CTA patients, Ural Institute of Cardiology, Yekaterinburg, Russia; www.

ru) between September 2010 and May 2015 underwent functional testing and computed tomography angiography, and/ or 3D quantitative coronary angiography with or without further percutaneous coronary intervention.

 Subsequent plaque burden/ % stenosis (plaque burden for both culprit and non-culprit lesions will be calculated as a lesion volume (vessel volume-lumen volume)/lumen volume x 100; the variable will be adjusted for CTA and 3D QCA due to technical limitations; the correlation between PB and other variables (including composition of the atheroma) will be then assessed), major adverse cardiovascular events (death from cardiac causes, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization due to unstable or progressive angina) will be judged to be related to either originally treated (culprit) lesions or untreated (non-culprit) lesions.

 Moreover, the clinical potential of CTA vs 3D QCA in two real-world patient flows of the Chest Pain center will be estimated with the special focus on safety (contrast-induced nephropathy, radiocontrast-induced thyroid dysfunction, and radiation dose).

 The diagnostic accuracy of both CTA and 3D QCA will be analyzed in deceased patients.

 The follow-up period will achieve 3-5 years when retro- and prospectively collected clinical events and imaging outcomes will be determined at the hospital, in 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after the first imaging examination.

 The independent ethics expertise will be provided by the Ural Medical University, Yekaterinburg, Russia (www.

 Patients will be provided with the Coronary Passport (REALITY Registry) which includes data of the complex examination with a 128-slice CT, two interviews with the risk factor modification recommendations, lab screening (serum fasting glucose, asparagine transaminase, alanine transaminase, total bilirubin, carbamide/ urea, creatinine, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol), complete blood count, ECG, and Echo.

 The Registry patients will be tested with HeartAge, SCORE, Duke ACC/ AHA, Duke - DCS, Diamond-Forrester - DFM, The Seattle Angina Questionnaire - SAQ, Duke Activity Status Index -DASI, and EQ-5D-5L.

 Patients will be screened for the major risk factors and its modification: unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, smoking, insulin resistance, diabetes, overweight or obesity, lack of physical activity, unhealthy diet (elements of Mediterranean and so called 'Russian' diet), older age, genetic or lifestyle factors, family history of early heart disease.

 Moreover such factors as CRP, sleep apnea, stress and alcohol consumption will be assessed.

 Maximum 400 chest pain patients with the clinical manifestation (medical history, mental status testing with MMSE and mini-cog, a physical and neurological exam) of degenerative and/ or paroxysmal encephalopathy will be enrolled to the subanalysis with MSCT-screening of the cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease in association with markers of HSV-1 and fungi (Candida glabrata, Candida famata, Candida albicans, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Phoma, and Syncephalastrum racemosum, others).

 The main aim of our study was to evaluate the natural history of atherosclerosis within the concept of the Glagovian artery remodeling with the assessment of the clinical potential and safety of such imaging tools as CTA and 3D QCA.
