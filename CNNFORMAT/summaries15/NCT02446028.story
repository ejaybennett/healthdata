 BIOD-531 is a formulation of recombinant human insulin with a biphasic absorption profile characterized by rapid absorption (to prevent meal-time rises in blood glucose) and a secondary longer (basal) phase.

 The purpose of this trial is to evaluate glucose control and safety of BIOD-531 compared to a pre-mixed insulin which is commonly used to provide both meal-time and long acting insulin.
