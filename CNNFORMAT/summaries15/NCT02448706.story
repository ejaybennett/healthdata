(thirdQuint)Variability In Hearing Aid Outcomes In Older Adults.

 Response to hearing aids is highly variable, with some individuals reporting much more benefit than others.

 Preliminary work by our laboratory and others suggests that patient factors-including cognition-may contribute to differences in how individuals respond to altered speech cues, such as those alterations introduced by hearing aid processing.

 The long-term goal of this work is to improve hearing aid outcomes by optimizing hearing aid processing for each individual.

 Variability In Hearing Aid Outcomes In Older Adults@highlight

The goal of this project is to find out if the way a hearing aid processes a sound signal should be determined in part by an individual's cognitive characteristics.

 We anticipate that the outcome of this work will be a battery of assessments that will guide hearing aid processing for older patients with hearing loss.
