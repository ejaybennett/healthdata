(secondQuint)Fenofibrate and Propranolol in Burn Patients.

 Determine the clinical benefits and underlying mechanisms whereby the metabolic perturbators fenofibrate and propranolol impact burn patient outcomes.

 The investigators hypothesize that these metabolic regulators given for one year will maintain body mass, improve muscle function by increasing protein synthesis, augment wound healing, reduce fibrosis, improve cardiovascular function, reduce systemic inflammation, restore insulin sensitivity, and decrease liver dysfunction without the risk of the hypoglycemia.

 Fenofibrate and Propranolol in Burn Patients@highlight

The proposed study will test the hypothesis that Propranolol, fenofibrate and fenofibrate plus propranolol have therapeutic, physiological, and metabolic effects that will improve clinical outcomes, and the long-term recovery, rehabilitation, and QOL in burned patients.
