(secondQuint)Pharmacokinetics of Two Different High-dose Regimens of Intravenous Vitamin C in Critically Ill Patients.

 Rationale: Critically ill patients with trauma or sepsis exhibit a high degree of vitamin C deficiency at ICU admission and vitamin C plasma concentrations decrease even more during the first three days of admission.

 Vitamin C is a natural anti-oxidant and crucial for endothelial and organ protection Objective: To determine the pharmacokinetics of two high dose regimens of intravenous vitamin C in critically ill patients, in particular the attained plasma concentration and the fraction retained in the body and excreted in urine.

 Study design: Prospective randomized controlled pharmacokinetic intervention study Study population: Adult critically ill patients admitted to the ICU of the VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, with sepsis or SIRS after major surgery or trauma with a non-neurological sequential organ failure (SOFA) score >6 and an expected length of ICU stay of >96 hours.

 Intervention (if applicable): Patients will receive either 2 or 10 gram/day vitamin C intravenously twice daily for two days in bolus or continuous infusion.
