(thirdQuint)Risk Factors for Co-existence of Cervical Elongation in Uterine Prolapse.

 Purpose: Thus the aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors of co-existence of cervical elongation in uterine prolapse.

 Patients and Methods: Between January 1994 and October 2014, all women underwent vaginal total hysterectomy in a medical center were enrolled in this study.

 Medical records were reviewed.

 Cervical elongation is defined as the presence of cervical length >3.

38 cm or cervix to corpus ratio >0.

79.

 Expected Results: The investigators will get the risk factors of co-existence of cervical elongation in uterine prolapse, and the result should be helpful for preoperative consultation, especially for uterine-preserving pelvic floor reconstruction surgery.

 Risk Factors for Co-existence of Cervical Elongation in Uterine Prolapse@highlight

The presence of co-existence of cervical elongation in women of uterine prolapse may decrease the patients' satisfaction of uterine-preservation surgery for uterine prolapse, and additional surgery, such as Manchester surgery, may be needed to solve the problem.
