(fifthQuint)The Effects of Cannabis on Dystonia and Spasticity on Pediatric Patients.

 The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of two cannabis oils containing the main cannabinoid 9 -THC and CBD ratio of 1 to 6 and 1 to 20 (respectively), on spastic movement disorder and dystonia.

 40 children will be enrolled in this study and will be divided into 2 groups: 1.

 Children with spasticity and dystonia due to cerebral palsy 2.

 Children with spasticity and dystonia due to genetic neurodegenerative diseases Each group will be randomly divided into two groups: I.

 Active comparator: 6-to-1 ratio of CBD to THC oil II.

 Active comparator: 20-to-1 ratio of CBD to THC oil During the study the following variables will be collected: - Consumption of drugs \ medication intake - Spasticity grade measured using the Modified Ashworth Scale - Dystonia grade measured using the Barry Albright Dystonia Scale - Patient's subjective report about the severity of his/her spasticity and/or dystonia - Pain scale - Restlessness scale - Quality of life measures: function, sleep, mood , appetite , weight - Safety tests: liver function, renal function, blood tests (complete blood chemistry), blood pressure, pulse, ECG - Side effects - Addiction test The purposes of the study: 1.

 Efficiency - examining the effect of cannabis on dystonia and spasticity.

 2.

 Examining the most effective cannabinoid ratio for the relief of dystonia and spasticity.

 (9 -THC and CBD ratio of 1 to 6 or 1 to 20, respectively).

 3.

 Examining the effect of cannabis on quality of life measures (such as medication intake, mood, appetite, sleep).

 4.

 Safety: examination of side effects and unwanted effects of cannabis and its limitations.

 Research Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that cannabis consumption will reduce dystonia and spasticity symptoms in children with motor disability related to genetic neurodegenerative diseases and cerebral palsy and as a result improves motor function, non-motor function and quality of life.

 The Effects of Cannabis on Dystonia and Spasticity on Pediatric Patients@highlight

A clinical trial is planned to study the effects of cannabis on dystonia and spasticity in children with neurological diseases.

 The clinical trial will include 40 children divided into two groups: children with spasticity and dystonia due to cerebral palsy, and children with spasticity and dystonia due to genetic neurodegenerative diseases.

 Each group will be randomly divided into two arms and will receive Avidekel cannabis oil 6-to-1 ratio of CBD to THC or enriched Avidekel cannabis oil 20-to-1 ratio of CBD to THC.

 During the study, various variables will be collected including: medication intake, spasticity, dystonia score, pain scale, restlessness scale, quality of life measures, safety tests, side effects, and an addiction test.

 The investigators hypothesize that cannabis consumption will reduce dystonia and spasticity in children with motor disability related to genetic neurodegenerative diseases and cerebral palsy and as a result improve motor function, non-motor functions and quality of life.
