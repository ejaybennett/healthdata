(fifthQuint)Transarterial Chemoembolization Versus Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 Primary liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem.

 Curative therapies for HCC are considered hepatic resection, liver transplantation and radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

 Hepatic resection is preferred for patients with limited disease, non-cirrhotic livers or selected patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis.

 Unlike resection, liver transplantation treats the tumor and the underlying cirrhosis present in the liver.

 Candidates for liver transplantation are preferably those with cirrhosis and tumors that comply with the Milan criteria (single tumor 3cm).

 Because most patients are not amenable to resection or liver transplantation, RFA has emerged as an effective treatment option.

 RFA is limited by the location of the tumor in the liver and by the tumor size with best results after RFA achieved for tumors 3cm.

 For patients that are not eligible for RFA due to large or multifocal tumors, transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads (TACE-DEB) is the preferred treatment.

 Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivers a highly effective dose of irradiation to the tumor while maximally avoiding dose delivery to surrounding healthy structures.

 SBRT is offered as an ablative local treatment with reported high percentages of complete and partial responses with limited toxicity.

 An international expert committee on HCC has recommended time to progression (TTP) as primary endpoint for phase II randomized trials.

 Although data is scarce the best published median TTP after TACE-DEB was 16 months and after SBRT 36.

5months in a more or less comparable patient population (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage system A-C).

 The present study will include patients not eligible for resection or RFA.

 Patients may be eligible for bridging or for down staging to transplantation.

 Well compensated liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) and disease confined to the liver (one to three tumors cumulative diameter 6cm) is required.

 To our knowledge this trial will be the first in the world to compare TACE-DEB and SBRT.

 This trial may have a big impact on the control of the disease and may contribute to change the standard of care from a palliative to a more radical/curative intention in this patient population.

 Transarterial Chemoembolization Versus Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma@highlight

Rationale: This study will compare head to head in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ineligible for surgery or radiofrequency ablation, the standard treatment arm, transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads (TACE-DEB), with the experimental arm, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).

 The investigators hypothesis is that the time to progression is more favorable after SBRT than after TACE-DEB.

 The expected time to include the required patients for this trial will be four years.

 To the best of the investigators knowledge this study will be the first in the world that will compare both techniques in a randomized trial.

 Objective: To assess the time to progression after TACE-DEB and after SBRT in a comparable population of patients diagnosed with HCC.

 Study design: Randomized, prospective, open-label, and phase II study.

 Study population: Patients diagnosed with HCC, Child-Pugh grade A, one to three tumors, cumulative diameter 6cm, and 18 years old.

 Intervention: Patients with HCC will be randomized to receive the standard treatment, TACE-DEB loaded with doxorubicin or the experimental arm, SBRT.

 Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint of this study will be time to progression, defined as time from randomization to radiological progression.

 Secondary endpoints will be: - Time to local recurrence - Response rate (complete and partial response) - Overall survival - Toxicity - Quality of life.
