(firstQuint)Hyperglucagonaemia in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes - Role of Glucagon Clearance.

 In the present project we wish to identify whether the elimination and degradation of glucagon differ between healthy control subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes.

 Furthermore, we wish to examine whether obesity is an independent factor for altered glucagon metabolism.

 Thus, by examining glucagon elimination in obese subjects with and without type 2 diabetes and in lean subjects with and without type 2 diabetes we will be able to describe the metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of glucagon in a broad spectrum of individuals with different levels of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction.

The study aims to evaluate the elimination and degradation of glucagon in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to matched healthy subjects.
