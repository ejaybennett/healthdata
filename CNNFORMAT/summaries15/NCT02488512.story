(fifthQuint)Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy With 90Y-Dotatoc in Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell and Mantle Cell Lymphomas.

 PEPTIDE RECEPTOR RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY (PRRT) WITH 90Y-DOTATOC IN RELAPSED/REFRACTORY DIFFUSE LARGE B CELL AND MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMAS.

 This is a prospective, single arm, open-label, phase II study.

 It is estimated that a maximum of 35 patients will be enrolled in 36 months; the treatment efficacy will be tested in 18 patients in the first stage, if 2 or fewer patients will show an objective response, the study will be closed; if > 2 objective responses will be observed, a total of 35 patients will be enrolled.

 Follow up period is 48 months.

 Single-center The primary objective is the evaluation of objective response rate (ORR).

 of Y-PRRT in relapsed or refractory DLBCl and MCL NHL, not suitable to other therapies, included HDCT, or patients relapsed after HDCT with ASCT.

 The secondary objectives are toxicity (acute and late), progression free survival, overall survival and Quality of life.

 35 patients will be enrolled in 36 months in two stages (18 patients in the first stage, if 2 or fewer patients will show an objective response, the study will be closed).

 Each patient will receive a maximum cumulative 90Y-DOTATOC activity of 11.

1 GBq (300 mCi), divided into 4 cycles (1.

8 - 2.

8 GBq for each cycle) with an interval of 6 - 8 weeks between cycles.

 The 90Y-DOTATOC will be slowly infused intravenously.

 The study will be conducted following the Optimal Two Stage Design assuming the true response probability: - under H0 (p0) =30% and considering alpha=0.

05 and power=0.
