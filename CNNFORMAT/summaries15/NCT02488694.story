(thirdQuint)Maintaining ERBB Blockade in EGFR-mutated Lung Cancer.

 This is a randomized, open-label, phase II study of maintaining pan-ERBB blockade following platinum-based induction chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutated, metastatic NSCLC progressing after first-line treatment with afatinib.

 Patients who have progressed after first-line treatment with afatinib will be screened while receiving an induction phase which consists of at least three but not more than four cycles of cisplatin/carboplatin plus pemetrexed given in 21-day cycles.

 Patients who do not progress (i.

e.

 complete or partial response, or stable disease - CR, PR or SD) after completion of three or four cycles induction chemotherapy will then be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive maintenance therapy with either afatinib (40 mg/d, or last dose if reduced during first-line treatment) or pemetrexed (500 mg/m every 21 days, or 375 mg/m if dose was reduced during induction therapy) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient consent withdrawal.

 Maintaining ERBB Blockade in EGFR-mutated Lung Cancer@highlight

This study aims to compare the efficacy of afatinib maintenance with pemetrexed maintenance following induction therapy with platinum/ pemetrexed in patients with metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progressing after first-line treatment with afatinib with respect to progression-free survival.
