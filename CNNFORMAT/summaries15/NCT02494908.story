(thirdQuint)Evidence of Neuroplasticity After Performing a Cognitive Task in Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease Patients.

 Aim: to utilize high sensitivity DTI MRI methodology to explore evidence for subtle microstructural brain alterations after performing a cognitive task and to compare those changes in patients with PD to healthy controls of the same age.

 PD patients and controls will undergo a full cranial MRI scan for depiction of anatomy and structural abnormalities (scan duration ~40 min).

 Immediately afterwards the subjects will play a car race computer game (Need for Speed) for 90 minutes.

 Following the game, the patients will undergo an additional DTI MRI scan (~15 minutes).

As seen in previous studies Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) MRI is able to detect very subtle changes in brain tissue even after a very short timescale of hours resulting from performing a cognitive task and learning, We wish to explore and compare those changes to patients with idiopathic PD (IPD) and see if there are changes in the learning process and can we detect them using widely available noninvasive techniques such as MRI.
