(secondQuint)A Comparison Between Conventional Surgery and Piezosurgery.

 The study is about measuring the amount of HSP70 using Elisa kit for detecting HSP70 and mason trichrome for histological findings in which the study samples are patients who have bilateral impacted mandibular third molar to be extracted with bone removal.

 First we collect bone sample for mason trichrome with either method then we collect the second samples after removing most of the bones cover the impacted third molar for checking HSP70 levels.

 Then the bone samples are treated using a special protocol to eliminate the protein from bone samples for the Elisa analysis.

 The other bone samples are going to be studied under the microscope.

Evaluation of the effect of conventional and piezo-surgery on the secretion of Heat Shock Protein (HSP70) and on the vial bone cells at the peripheral bone cut sides after the removal of impacted mandibular third molars on both sides of the jaw.
