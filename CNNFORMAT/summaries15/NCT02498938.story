(secondQuint)The Association of SERPINA1 Gene Disturbance in Patients With Lung and Gum Disorders.

 periodontitis is a polymicrobial inflammatory disease caused by various modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.

 the non-modifiable risk factors include genetic polymorphisms like the gene coding for alpha-1-antitrypsinase COPD is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by deterioration of lung function due to loss of elasticity of the lungs.

 SERPINA1 gene product has a protective role on the connective tissue components of both lungs and gums.

 Hence, this study tries to determine if the gene polymorphism in COPD serves as a risk factor for developing periodontitis.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and periodontitis are chronic inflammatory diseases.

 The study aims to determine if the genetic polymorphism of SERPINA1 gene in patients with COPD serve as a risk factor for developing periodontitis.
