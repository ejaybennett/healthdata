(thirdQuint)Darunavir/Cobicistat and Dolutegravir to Maintain Virologic Suppression and Reduce NRTI-associated Toxicity.

 NRTIs have been a stalwart for treatment in both the pre- and post-ART eras.

 However, NRTIs have numerous toxicities partly due to the fact that they are analogs of naturally occurring nucleotides and interfere with the activity of numerous cellular functions.

 In highly treatment-experienced individuals with more than two active drugs in their salvage regimens, an NRTI-sparing regimen has been shown to be non-inferior to an NRTI-containing regimen [33].

 However, studies with NRTI-sparing regimens not consisting of more than two active medications have generally been disappointing.

 One limitation of earlier NRTI-sparing regimens has been a higher pill burden than more standard regimens.

 However, the approvals of DTG and the co-formulated DRV/COBI, both with well-established antiviral activities, may allow for a compact, effective, NRTI-sparing regimen.

 A switch to DTG/DRV/COBI in virologically suppressed HIV-infected individuals has the potential to avoid NRTI-associated toxicity while maintaining virologic suppression.

 Darunavir/Cobicistat and Dolutegravir to Maintain Virologic Suppression and Reduce NRTI-associated Toxicity@highlight

This is a clinical research study to see if switching to Darunavir/Cobicistat ((PREZCOBIX cent , DRV/COBI ) and Dolutegrivir (Tivicay(R), DTG) in HIV-infected individuals with undetectable HIV viral load on nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-containing therapy will be effective in maintaining virologic suppression at 48 weeks of treatment.
