(fifthQuint)The Effect of Thermotherapy on Recovery and Performance.

 The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a 20 min.

 external cooling application (+8C ) versus a external thermo neutral application (+32C) up to 72 hours post application.

 The study is divided in two projects: Project A: This study is focusing on the recovery process after a max.

 jump performance (3x30 counter movement jumps).

 Directly after the exercise subjects receive a cooling or thermo-neutral application.

 Recovery characteristics measured by vertical jump performance (objective) and delayed onset muscle soreness and rated perceived exertion (subjective) are measured in function of time up to 72 hours post cooling intervention.

 Project B: This study is focusing on the effect of 20 min.

 cooling or thermo-neutral application on the M.

 quadriceps femoris performance (MVC).

 After the thermo-application, the 60% endurance MVC is measured by means of surface EMG (OT Bioelettronica 10-750 Hz) in a ergometer chair 90 degrees knee flexion (Cor 1 Bioelettronica).

 Muscle conduction velocity, MVC (objective), delayed onset muscle soreness and rated perceived exertion (subjective) are measured in function of time up to 72 hours post thermo-application.

 The Effect of Thermotherapy on Recovery and Performance@highlight

This study investigates the effects of cooling on the recovery and performance characteristic in young healthy subjects.

 The study is divided in two projects: Project A: investigates the effects of 20 min.

 post-exercise cooling on vertical jump performance and delayed onset muscle soreness and rated perceived exertion.

 Project B: investigates the effects of 20 min.

 pre-exercise cooling on maximal voluntary contraction of the right M.

 quadriceps femoris and delayed onset muscle soreness and rated perceived exertion.
