(secondQuint)Trans-catheter Arterial Embolization Combined With p53 Gene Therapy for Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 Treatment options for advanced HCC are limited due to patients' poor condition, advanced stage, concomitant intra- and extra-liver diseases, and resistance to both chemo- and radio-therapy.

 Trans-catheter embolization (TAE) is a safe locoregional treatment for advanced HCC and p53 gene has multiple anticancer functions, and both methods do not have immune-inhibitory effects as chemo- or radio-therapy.

 The objectives of this study are to investigate clinical efficacy and immunoreaction usingTAE plus recombinant adenoviral human p53 gene (rAd-p53) in treatment of advanced HCC.
