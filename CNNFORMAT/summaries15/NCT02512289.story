(firstQuint)Impact of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation, Associated With Upper Limb Robot-assisted Therapy, on Motor Recuperation.

 tDCS and RAT will be used in chronic stroke patients to improve a variety of functions such as motor functions with upper limb.

 tDCS will be applied in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised fashion.

 A session of RAT will be associated with tDCS/placebo.

 Behavioural data will be collected before and after tDCS, associated with RAT.
