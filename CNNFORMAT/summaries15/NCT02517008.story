(firstQuint)The Impact of Non-monetary Incentives on Facility Delivery in Rural Zambia.

 This clustered randomized controlled trial assessed the impact of providing a package of childcare items (a cloth, baby diaper, and blanket) to women conditional upon delivering at a facility on facility delivery rates in rural Serenje and Chadiza Districts in Zambia.

 Facilities were randomized to either provide the intervention or not.

 Facility-level antenatal care (ANC) and delivery registers were used to measure the percentage of women attending antenatal care who delivered at a study facility during the intervention period.

 Results from the trial were then used to model the cost-effectiveness of mama kits at-scale in terms of cost per death averted.
