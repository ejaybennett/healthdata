(secondQuint)Topical Use of Difinsa53 to Prevent Radiation Dermatitis.

 The proposed study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of DIFINISA53 cent , a safe silibin-based skin cream, on preventing radiation dermatitis (RD) when compared to an over the counter ointment, Aquaphor, in women undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer following lumpectomy or mastectomy surgery.

 Presently there is no known fully effective topical protectant from RD and there is no consensus among radiation oncologists on how best to treat RD.

 This study seeks to identify a more effective option for patients receiving radiation therapy.

 Each participant will apply the DIFINISA53 cent cream to one area of the treated skin and Aquaphor to another area of treated skin.

 Skin reactions will be evaluated using medical professional assessment, participant assessment, and photographic assessment by a third party.
