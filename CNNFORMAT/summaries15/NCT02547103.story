(fifthQuint)Chlorhexidine Gluconate Versus Mupirocin Ointment in the Prevention of Peritoneal Dialysis-Related Infection.

 Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is one of renal replacement therapy used for end-stage renal disease.

 Since 2011, there has been increasing numbers of patients under "PD First" policy of Thai government.

 The most common PD related complication is PD-related infection categorized PD-related peritonitis, and exit site and tunnel infection.

 Although possible to treat PD-related infection, incidence of technical failure, and death due to peritonitis are still high in Thailand.

 PD-related infections mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

 To prevent PD-related infection, cleaning with aseptic solvents using aseptic technique and prevent infection by prescribing prophylactic antibiotics are recommended.

 The International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) has recommended position statement of the regular use of mupirocin ointment around the catheter exits point and apply in nasal cavity.

 However, there is rising concern of long term use of mupirocin for mupirocin resistance of S.

 aureus.

 CHG is antiseptic use in clinical practice.

 It can coat at least 12 hours on skin and has anti-bacterial covered in both grams negative and positive.

 Several meta-analysis studies showed effectiveness of CHG in prevention of hospitals infection i.

e.

 reduces catheter-related sepsis, postoperative infection, and microbial resistance.

 According to PD-related infection, CHG has very little evidence of its effectiveness.

 This pilot study aims to evaluate effectiveness, safety, and cost-utility of CHG-soaked cloths compares to mupirocin ointment and exit site usual care (normal saline and povidone-iodine) with aseptic technique in prevention of PD-related infection.

 It is a pilot study, double-blind, stratified randomized controlled trial.

 Participants will be randomized to three arms mupirocin, usual care, or CHG-soaked cloths.

 They will be followed at 1,3,6,9, and 12 months or until PD-related infection, catheter removal, or death.

 The primary outcome is PD-related infection.

 Secondary outcomes are safety, adverse events related to treatments.

 Other outcomes are hospitalization due to PD-related infection, technical failure,change of modal of dialysis, adherence to medication, death due to PD-related infection.

 Costs include providers and patients expenses.

 Utility is assessed using EQ-5D-5L.

 Chlorhexidine Gluconate Versus Mupirocin Ointment in the Prevention of Peritoneal Dialysis-Related Infection@highlight

This pilot study aims to evaluate effectiveness, safety, and cost-utility of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)-soaked cloths compares to mupirocin ointment and exit site usual care (normal saline) with aseptic technique in prevention of PD-related infection.

 It is a pilot study, double-blind, stratified randomized controlled trial.

 Participants will be randomized to three arms mupirocin, usual care, or CHG-soaked cloths in a ratio of 1:1:1.

 They will be followed at 1,3,6,9, and 12 months or until PD-related infection, catheter removal, or death.

 The primary outcome is PD-related infection.

 Secondary outcomes are safety, adverse events related to treatments such as skin irritation, rash etc.

 Other outcomes are hospitalization due to PD-related infection, technical failure,change of modal of dialysis, adherence to medication, death due to PD-related infection.

 Costs include providers and patients expenses.

 Utility is assessed using the EuroQol (EQ), five-dimensional (5D), five-level (5L) version.

 The results of this study are anticipate nephrologists and health care professional involving to PD in decision making for a plan to prevent PD-related infection.

 In addition, the results will lead to clinical guideline development a prevention of PD-related infection.
