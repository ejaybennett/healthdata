(fifthQuint)Asthmatuner a Self-management App for Asthma: A Randomized Controlled Multicentre Trial.

 2.

 Background Clinical gaps hamper proper asthma management, and leads to delayed or undiagnosed disease, poor adherence to treatment, inadequate self-care abilities, inadequate understanding of disease severity, poor patient education, inadequate measurement of lung function, and inconsistent evaluation of symptoms.

 To improve the patient's ability to self-manage and to overcome clinical gaps, evidence emphasizes clinics to offer comprehensive patient education.

 The national Finish asthma programme (1994-2004) focused on applying effective strategies of asthma management, as a result, patient's self-management was improved, and cost-effective through limited demands on the health-care and social security system.

 Novel applications embodied in smartphones are straightforward alternative to facilitate health care and support patients with hands-on guidance for self-management of asthma.

 Asthmatuner is a smartphone app that enables evaluation of lung function and symptoms.

 The app provides patients with a daily treatment plan adjusted for symptoms and lung function.

 Additionally, information is accessible and can be assessed by health care providers through a back-end system.

 Future versions of Asthmatuner will be enabled through patient's own medical record.

 Self-management apps with hands-on guidance for self-management of asthma present a promising future for closing clinical gaps, but the overall benefits of using the service in the treatment of asthma need comprehensive evaluation that answers scientific questions and end-user opinions.

 3.

 Aims The primary aim is to evaluate Asthmatuner and the clinical effect on patients self-reported asthma control test (scores of ACT/C-ACT).

 The secondary aim is to evaluate the effect on patients and HR-QoL and medical adherence.

 Primary outcomes The primary outcome will be scores of ACT/C-ACT and Paediatric asthma quality of life questionnaire (PAQLQ) or Mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (Mini-AQLQ).

 Secondary outcomes The secondary outcomes are scores of Medicine adherence report scale (MARS) and costs of prescribed dose and type of control medication and total amount of direct and indirect costs for patient/caregiver.

 4.

 Material and methods 4.

1 Data collection Questionnaires: - A health questionnaire completed at the first visit will provide information regarding asthma medical history, health utilization, annual income and employment status.

 - ACT will be used to assess asthma control in patients 12 years or older, and C-ACT in children of age 6 to 11 years.

 A mean score equal or below 19 indicates uncontrolled asthma.

 Scores above 19 defines asthma to be controlled in both tests.

 - HR-QoL will be applied in patients from 6 to 11 years of age using the validated Swedish translated Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ), and the mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (mini-AQLQ) in patients from 12 years of age.

 - Self-reported medication adherence will be measured with five-item MARS, developed to assess adherence with asthma medication.

 The MARS comprises statements about medication use behaviors.

 The patient is asked to answer each behavior with a score between 1-5 based on of following alternatives; "always", "often", "sometimes", "rarely" or "never".

 A mean MARS score will then be calculated, and a score of 4.

5 or greater indicates good adherence.

 - Time consume, utility and satisfaction using Asthmatuner will be asked patient/caregiver, nurses and physicians in relation to applied management.

 4.

2 Subjects Two stratified groups with diagnosed asthma (male and female) will be invited to the study; children and adolescents (6-17 years) from the lung and allergy department of Astrid Lindgren children's Hospital and adolescents (> 12 years) and adults from the primary care sector of Stockholm.

 Inclusion criteria - Consent to participate is voluntary.

 - Age > 6 years - Diagnosed asthma - Asthma control score (ACT/C-ACT) less than 20 Exclusion criteria - Ongoing comorbidity affecting the health status of asthma - Asthma control score (ACT/C-ACT) equal or more than 20 - Participation in other drug trial 4.

3 Power analysis The power analysis is based on our previous analysis of ACT/C-ACT and HR-QoL scores in schoolchildren with uncontrolled severe asthma [21].

 The scores for severe uncontrolled asthma were on average for ACT 17 (SD 3.

3) and for PAQLQ 5.

4 (SD 0.

77).

 Thus, an estimated improvement of ACT from 17 to 19 (two points) or PAQLQ from 5.

4 to 5.

9 (0.

5 points) requires 38-43 patients in each group (Asthmatuner vs.

 conventional management) to attain an 80 % power at 5% significance level.

 4.

4 Study design The study is designed as a randomized, multi-centre, blinded-controlled, crossover trail.

 Patients are enrolled randomized 1:1 at visit 1.

 Computer-generated random number sequence will be used for randomization of patients into one of the two-arms of 8 + 8 weeks of asthma management; Asthmatuner - conventional or conventional - Asthmatuner.

 The randomization will keep blinded for the study team but not for study nurse or physician.

 A washout period of minimum 2 weeks will be applied between management periods.

 Management period 2 is initiated at visit 3 and finalized at visit 4.

 The clinical setting with nurse-based asthma clinic is currently regarded as state-of-the-art for conventional asthma treatment in primary health care in Sweden.

 The study will therefore be conducted in a primary care setting with integrated asthma nurse that follows established national and international guidelines.

 4.

5 Intervention procedures Study nurses and physicians will consecutively recruit participants in the asthma clinic.

 At enrollment of Asthmatuner, the physician will prescribe a three level treatment plan, which is adjusted for the patients status of asthma if controlled, partly controlled or uncontrolled.

 Study nurse will insert the plan in the back-end system of Asthmatuner.

 Before enrolment of conventional management, a separate written treatment plan adjusted for patients asthma will be applied to each participant and in the medical journal.

 Visit 1: Eligibility of participants will be checked.

 The patient will be given information about the study procedures and must sign the informed consent form.

 At the visit the following procedures will be conducted and documented: - Demographic data - Body height and weight - Medical history about allergy and asthma will be obtained with health questionnaire - Asthma control will be assessed with ACT or C-ACT - HR-QoL; Mini-AQLQ or PAQLQ - MARS questionnaire - Lung function, dynamic spirometry including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, forced expiratory flow after 50% of vital capacity (FEF50) - Randomization to; Asthmatuner - conventional self-management or conventional - Asthmatuner - Prescribe and apply treatment plan (Asthmatuner or Conventional) - Control of inhalation technique At visit 2, the following procedures will be conducted and documented: - ACT/C-ACT - HR-QoL; Mini-AQLQ/PAQLQ - MARS - Lung function, dynamic spirometry (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC and FEF50) - Revise treatment plan if necessary (Asthmatuner or Conventional) - Revision of adverse events.

 At visit 3, the following procedures will be conducted and documented: - ACT/C-ACT - HR-QoL; Mini-AQLQ/PAQLQ - MARS - Lung function, dynamic spirometry (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC and FEF50) - Prescribe and apply treatment plan (Asthmatuner or Conventional) - Control of inhalation technique - Revision of adverse events.

 At visit 4, the following procedures will be conducted and documented: - ACT/C-ACT - HR-QoL; Mini-AQLQ or PAQLQ - MARS - Lung function, dynamic spirometry including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, forced expiratory flow after 50% of vital capacity (FEF50) - Revision of adverse events 4.

5 Statistical analysis The study hypothesis will be tested by examining patients change from baseline in asthma control (ACT/C-ACT), HR-QoL (PAQLQ/Mini-AQLQ), and in MARS scores between asthma management groups.

 Results will be summarized between each group as mean scores and analysed by paired t-tests.

 4.

8 Withdrawal A patient should be withdrawn from the trial if, in the opinion of the investigator, it is medically necessary, or if it is the wish of the patient.

 In any circumstances the reasons for withdrawal should be documented in the Study termination report.

 Participants who discontinue from the study for any reason will be replaced.

 4.

9 Safety An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in participants using or not using Asthmatuner.

 AE include the following: - All suspect adverse reaction - All reactions from medical overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity - Apparently unrelated illness, including the worsening of a preexisting illness - Injury or accident - Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination - Laboratory abnormalities that require clinical intervention or further investigation unless they are associated with an already reported clinical event.

 Preexisting conditions In this trial, a preexisting condition i.

e.

 asthma, should not be reported as an adverse event unless the condition worsens or episodes increases (i.

e.

 exacerbations) in the frequency during the adverse event reporting period.

 Procedures Diagnostics and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as adverse events.

 However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.

 The AE reporting period begins upon starting the use of Asthmatuner or conventional management (visit 1).

 Each participant will be questioned about AE for each visit 2 and 3.

 All AE that occur in the trial should be reported to investigator and specified in the participants medical journal and in a separate AE form with following information: - Type of AE - Date and time of AE - Association with Asthmatuner (No/Yes/Unknown) - Gravity (Serious or Non-serious) - Reporting time - Follow-up (resolved or unresolved) Gravity Each AE is to be classified by the investigator as serious or non-serious.

 This classification of the gravity of the event determines the reporting procedure to be followed.

 An AE that meets one or more of the following criteria is classified as serious: - Death - Life-threatening - Hospitalization - Persistent or significant disability/incapacity - Congenital anomaly/birth defect All serious AE should directly be reported to investigator.

 5.

0 Ethics The trial will be performed in accordance with the World Medical Assembly Helsinki recommendations guiding physicians in biomedical research involving human subjects [26].

 It is the responsibility of the investigators to obtain approval of the trial from regional ethic committee.

 It is the responsibility of the investigators to give each patient prior to inclusion in the trial, full adequate information regarding the trial and the procedures.

 The patient must be informed about their right to withdraw from the trial at any time.

 Written patient information must be given to each patient before enrollment.

 In addition, it is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain signed informed consent from all participants.

 Asthmatuner a Self-management App for Asthma: A Randomized Controlled Multicentre Trial@highlight

Primary aim: Evaluating the effect of Asthmatuner on patients self-reported asthma control test (ACT/C-ACT)compared with conventional asthma management.

 Secondary aim: Evaluating patients health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) medical adherence by using Asthmatuner compared with conventional management.

 Total sample size: Stratified study population consisting of 43 females and males with diagnosed asthma at the age of at least 6 years pediatric specialist care and 43 females/males in primary care.

 Study design: This is a multi-centre, blinded, randomized controlled, cross-over trial over to at least 16 weeks.

 Subjects: Two stratified groups of participants with uncontrolled asthma will be recruited; (1) children and adolescents from Astrid Lindgren's Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, and (2) adolescents and adults from the primary health care sector in Stockholm, Sweden.

 The asthma control test (ACT/C-ACT) will be applied for evaluation of asthma control, a score less than 20 will be required for inclusion.

 Intervention: Asthmatuner is an app supporting self-management evaluating symptoms and lung function with external spirometry.

 The app gathers the information to define patients asthma control.

 Subsequently, Asthmatuner provides the patient with a treatment recommendation based on the individual treatment plan.

 Procedures: Participants are randomized (1:1) into the one of two-arms of asthma self-management with Asthmatuner - conventional or conventional - Asthmatuner.

 Questionnaires will collect information about asthma control, HR-QoL, Medicine adherence report scale (MARS) and history of medical health concerning health care utilization and personal costs and income.

 Analysis: The study hypothesis will be tested by examining difference in patients change in asthma control (ACT/C-ACT) and HR-QoL (PAQLQ/Mini-AQLQ).

 Results will be summarized at each management period as mean scores and analysed by paired t-tests.
