(secondQuint)ATTUNE Single-Use Instrumentation vs.

 ATTUNE Reusable Instrumentation in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty.

 This study is designed as comparative, sequential, non-randomized, multi-center investigation.

 Up to four sites will recruit approximately 88 subjects.

 Each site is expected to implant the ATTUNE primary cemented total knee in approximately 22 subjects.

 The sequential design requires all ATTUNE TKA with reusable instruments be completed before doing any ATTUNE TKA with single use instruments.

 The mechanical axis alignment will be assessed at the 3 month follow-up by independent radiographic review.
