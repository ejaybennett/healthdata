(secondQuint)Milk Patch for Eosinophilic Esophagitis.

 This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to study the efficacy and safety of Viaskin(R) Milk, an allergen extract of milk administered epicutaneously using the Viaskin(R) epicutaneous delivery system (EPIT) in subjects from 4 to 17 years old with a milk induced Eosinophilic Esophagitis.

 Subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio into two different treatment groups, to receive EPIT with Viaskin(R) Milk (500 mu g of milk proteins) or placebo.

 Subjects who complete the double-blind treatment period (approximately 11 months), will automatically rollover into an open label treatment period (additional 11 months).

 All subjects will receive the 500 mu g (micrograms) Viaskin Milk patch.
