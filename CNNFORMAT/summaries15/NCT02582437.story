(firstQuint)MAC Bipsectral Index Below 50 for Chronic Opioid User.

 1.

 Patients selection in elective surgery which need general anesthesia.

 2.

 MAC BIS50 data was collected in each patients (by blinded investigator) 3.

 The data collection will be continued for enough sample size for using Dixon Up Down Method Analysis 4.

 After Data collection, MAC BIS below 50 will be analyzed in both groups ( Chronic opioid users versus opioid naive patients).
