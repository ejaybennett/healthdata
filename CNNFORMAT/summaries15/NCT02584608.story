(thirdQuint)Use of ACTIMMUNE in Patients With ADO2.

 This is a single center, open-label, dose-escalation study evaluating the efficacy, as defined by biochemical endpoints, and safety profiles of ACTIMMUNE in ADO2 subject.

 The investigators will treat 12 ADO2 subjects (children or adults age 3-65) with Actimmune(R) via a dose escalation protocol to a dose of 50 mu g/m2 subcutaneously three times per week (TIW) for 8 weeks.

 If serum CTX does not increase by more than 25% by week 8, the dose will be increased to 100 mu g/m2 subcutaneously TIW.

 Individual subjects in whom ACTIMMUNE administration increases bone resorption markers during the 14 weeks of this trial will be eligible for a 1 year extension trial.
