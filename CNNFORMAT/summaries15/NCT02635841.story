(thirdQuint)Compassionate Use of Deferiprone in Patients With PKAN.

 Patients with PKAN who have completed both the randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial TIRCON2012V1 and its follow-up, the single-arm open-label extension study TIRCON2012V1-EXT, may enroll in this compassionate-use/expanded access program in order to continue receiving the iron chelator deferiprone.

 Participants in this program will be followed locally by their own neurologist or other appropriate specialist.

 Patients will take deferiprone oral solution 80 mg/mL at the same dose they were prescribed in the TIRCON2012V1-EXT clinical trial.

 Safety monitoring of the patients will be performed.

 At a minimum, the program will continue until the analysis of the currently blinded TIRCON2012V1 trial is completed (approximately Q4 2016), at which time it will be re-evaluated.
