(thirdQuint)Study on Incidence of Diabetic Ketoacidosis Among Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treated With Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors or Other Antihyperglycemic Agents.

 This study will be an overall retrospective, observational, new-user cohort study using 4 large administrative claims databases in the US.

 Participants diagnosed with T2DM and initiated on SGLT2i or other AHAs (metformin, sulfonylureas (SU), thiazolidinediones (TZDs), DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), GLP-1 agonists, insulin, and other AHAs) between April 1, 2013 and the end of claims data availability will be included in the study and will be estimated for incidence rates of DKA in the different AHA new-user groups.

The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) among participants diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and pair-matched on exposure propensity scores for new use of any sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) versus new use of various other antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs), combined as one group.
