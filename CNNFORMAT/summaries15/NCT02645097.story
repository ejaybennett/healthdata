(firstQuint)Ideal Anatomic Location for Saphenous Nerve Blocks: A Prospective Clinical Evaluation.

 This is a prospective, randomized, observer blinded clinical trial comparing motor strength in knee extension between two sets of patients, one receiving a proximal thigh block of the saphenous nerve and one receiving a distal thigh block of the saphenous nerve.

 The secondary objectives are to compare the pain relief and quality of life of participants in these two groups.
