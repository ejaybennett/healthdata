(secondQuint)Acetaminophen/Codeine vs Acetaminophen/Ibuprofen for Pain Control and Patient Satisfaction After Hand Surgery.

 Primary Objective: To establish, through a randomized control trial, whether post-operative Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen (non-opioid regimen) would provide equivalent post-operative analgesia to ambulatory hand surgery patients compared to Acetaminophen and Codeine (opioid regimen).

 Secondary Objective: To establish whether the opioid versus non-opioid post-operative pain regimen influences patient satisfaction.

 Sixty-three patients enrolled for each group (non-opioid and opioid).

 Approximately 145 patients will be required to achieve complete data for 63 patients in each group (assuming 15% lost to follow-up & failure to comply with study protocol).
