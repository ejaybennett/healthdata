(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Appeal and Impact of E-Cigarettes Among Chronic Smokers With Smoking-Related Cancers.

 The aim of the study is to determine the appeal of e-cigarettes compared to combustible cigarettes as measured by the degree to which patients succeed in reducing their cigarette consumption over the 9 weeks they are supplied with product, along with their consumption of e-cigarettes.

 We will measure past use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks.

 We will also assess the effect of e-cigarette substitution on toxicity by measuring expired carbon monoxide and urine NNAL, a carcinogenic metabolite of cigarette smoke.
