(fifthQuint)RCT(Randomized Clinical Trial ) of Antibiotic Therapy in Chronic Endometritis.

 This study will be carried out at the Hysteroscopy centre of the Fuxing Hospital, Beijing, China.

 A total of 82 women with chronic endometritis who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria will be recruited: 1.

 Pre-menopausal 2.

 Agreed to have repeat hysteroscopy and a second endometrial biopsy ~4 weeks after the first hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy 3.

 No evidence of hyperplasia or cancer in the initial endometrial biopsy Exclusion Criteria: 1.

 steroid hormone therapy within the preceding one month of recruitment 2.

 Allergy to antibiotic 3.

 Concurrent infection which require additional courses of antibiotic therapy before the second endometrial biopsy specimen.

 Power calculation: assuming that the spontaneous CD138 conversion (from +ve to -ve) rate is 25% and that the antibiotic therapy results in 60% conversion rate, the total number of subjects required in each arm of the RCT will be 37, accepting a Type I error of 0.

05 and a Type II error of 0.

1.

 Assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, 41 subjects will need to be recruited into each arm.

 Hence, a total of 82 subjects who fulfilled the inclusion criteria will be required.

 Recruitment: Women will be recruited form the day case hysteroscopy unit of the Hysteroscopy center, Fuxing Hospital, Beijing, China.

 The Hysteroscopy center currently carries out ~600 day case hysteroscopy per month.

 In all cases, endometrial biopsy specimen will be obtained at the time of hysteroscopy for histological evaluation.

 Since 2013, all endometrial specimens have been routinely examined with the used of CD138 antibody to establish if there is evidence of chronic endometritis, in addition to routine histopathological examination.

 Previous audit showed that ~15% of subjects had positive staining for CD138 cells.

 In addition, it is estimated that about 1/5 of subjects undergoing hysteroscopy and biopsy will fulfill the inclusion criteria.

 Assuming a successful recruitment rate of 75% among those who are eligible, the total number of subjects to be screened will be 3,650 in order to successfully recruit 82 subjects.

 Given that we carry out ~600 hysteroscopy per month, the recruitment will take ~6-9 months.

 Randomization: computer generated Antibiotic therapy: Staff Pharmacist will dispense medication; placebo will consist of vitamin C tablet Consent: written informed consent will be obtained Repeat endometrial biopsy & histological evaluation: The repeat endometrial biopsy will be performed after completion of the the antibiotic therapy.

 Immunohistochemical study using CD138 antibody will be performed.

 RCT(Randomized Clinical Trial ) of Antibiotic Therapy in Chronic Endometritis@highlight

82 cases with a diagnosis of chronic endometritis, confirmed by the presence of plasma cells in endometrial biopsy sample identified by immunohistochemical staining using CD138 antibody, will be recruited.

 The subjects will be randomly divided into two groups, the experimental group will be given antibiotic (Augmentin) treatment, the control group will be given placebo.

 A repeat endometrial biopsy sample will be obtained one month after completion of the antibiotic therapy to assess the response to treatment.

 The cure rate will be compared between the two groups
