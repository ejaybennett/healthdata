(thirdQuint)Adjuvant Dendritic Cell-immunotherapy Plus Temozolomide in Glioblastoma Patients.

 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a microscopically infiltrative disease, is the most common malignant brain tumor worldwide.

 Despite optimized standard of care treatment median survival and prognosis remain poor with a median survival of only 15% and five year survival after diagnosis of 5%.

 In this single arm single centre phase I/II trial the investigators will determine the overall and progression free survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM when autologous WT1 mRNA loaded dendritic cell vaccination is added to standard of care treatment.

 During two years of recruitment the investigators will include 20 patients with newly diagnosed, histologically verified glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) who have received a total or subtotal resection of the tumor.

 Patients who underwent prior radiation or chemotherapy or with a history of other malignancy will be excluded.

 In addition to standard of care consisting of adjuvant chemoradiation with temozolomide and temozolomide maintenance patients will receive an intradermal vaccination with autologous WT1 mRNA-loaded dendritic cells commencing 1 week after radiotherapy.

 The dendritic cell therapy product will be generated and administered in the Antwerp University Hospital, more specifically the Center for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine (CCRG) and the Division of Hematology, both headed by Prof.

 Zwi Berneman.

 Recruitment began in December 2015 and is intended to continue until the end of 2020 or when 20 patients are enrolled.

 After 2 years of follow up (expected until 2022) overall and progression free survival analysis will be performed and this will be compared with the published data of standard of care treatment without vaccination.

 In addition the investigators will look for feasibility, incidence of adverse events and immunogenicity.

In this phase I/II trial, the primary objective is to determine overall and progression-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma when autologous Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) messenger (m)RNA-loaded dendritic cell (DC) vaccination is added to adjuvant temozolomide maintenance treatment following (sub)total resection and temozolomide-based chemoradiation.
