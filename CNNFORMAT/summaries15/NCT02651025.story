(secondQuint)Effects of Resistance Training on Physical Activity in Daily Life and Functional Capacity in Hemodialysis Patients.

 The patients will be randomized into two groups: intervention and control groups.

 Patients in the intervention group will receive a supervised resistance exercise training, during hemodialysis, three times/week for 12 weeks, and patients allocate to the control group will received a passive stretching program during the same timeframe.
