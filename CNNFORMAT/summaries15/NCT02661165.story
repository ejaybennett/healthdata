(fifthQuint)How Does the Spirituality of Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Influence Their Self-management?.

 Patients will be recruited from diabetes clinics.

 The bio-statistical markers will be: include their living situation (living alone or with family/partner); date of T2D diagnosis; current age; glycated haemoglobin (hba1c) blood test; body mass index and current pharmacological therapy.

 This data will be collected from the Diabetes Clinic to contextualize the qualitative data.

 These measurements will reveal how well a participant is managing their T2D.

 The Biographic Narrative Interpretive Method (BNIM) will involve interviews with eight participants.

 Each participant will have at least 2 and possibly 3 interviews at a location of their choice.

 The data will undergo thematic analysis, which will be interpreted.

 The results will be used to encourage clinicians to consider the spirituality of people with T2D when planning their care, thus giving holistic treatment.

 How Does the Spirituality of Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Influence Their Self-management?@highlight

This exploratory study is researching how the spirituality of a group of British patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), impacts their approach to the self-management of their condition.

 Bio-statistical markers will be taken from consenting participants' Clinic database records.

 Qualitative interviews will be conducted with participants, and the results analysed and interpreted, alongside their bio-statistical markers.

 Results will be presented in healthcare peer reviewed journals and conferences, to inform clinicians how patients' self-management of their T2D is influenced by their spirituality.
