(secondQuint)Study of ADCT-402 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL).

 Study ADCT-402-102 is the first clinical study with ADCT-402 in patients with B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

 ADCT-402 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized antibody directed against human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19), stochastically conjugated via a valine-alanine cleavable, maleimide linker to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin.

 The study will be conducted in 2 parts.

 In Part 1 (dose escalation) patients will receive an infusion of ADCT-402 either be on weekly administration or every 3-week administration.

 Patients on weekly administration will receive an infusion of ADCT-402 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 3 week treatment cycle.

 Patients on 3-week administration will receive an infusion of ADCT-402 on Day 1, every 3 weeks.

 Dose escalation will continue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 In Part 2 (expansion), all patients will be assigned to the recommended dose and/or schedule of ADCT-402 identified in Part 1 by the Dose Escalation Steering Committee.

 For each patient, the study will include a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment period (until withdrawal), and a follow-up period to assess disease progression and survival for up to 12 months after the last dose of study drug.

 The total study duration will be dependent on overall patient tolerability to the study drug and response to treatment.

 It is anticipated that the duration of the entire study (Parts 1 and 2) could be approximately 3 years from first patient treated to last patient completed.

 Study of ADCT-402 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL)@highlight

This study evaluates ADCT-402 in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).

 Patients will participate in a dose-escalation phase (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2).

 In Part 2, patients will receive the dose level identified in Part 1.
