(thirdQuint)Loop Ileostomy Closure:Stapled or Hand-sewn Anastomoses? Suture or Mesh Closure of the Stoma Site?.

 Postoperative complications after closure of a temporary loop ileostomy after rectal cancer surgery are common.

 In this study the investigators propose the hypothesis that a stapled anastomotic technique will decrease postoperative small bowel obstruction and a mesh closure of the stoma site in the abdominal wall will decrease hernia formation.

 All patients will be randomized to stapled or hand-sewn anastomosis.

 The randomization to mesh or suture closure of the abdominal wall is optional.

 The stapled anastomotic technique is performed by the use of a linear staple device and the hand-sewn technique with a running seromuscular monofilament suture.

 The stoma site has two options and will be closed either by the use of mesh (lightweight), positioned under the muscle (retromuscular), or just by long-lasting suture.

 The anterior fascia of the rectus as well as the skin are closed by the use of running monofilament longlasting sutures, the latter in a pursestring procedure.

 Loop Ileostomy Closure:Stapled or Hand-sewn Anastomoses? Suture or Mesh Closure of the Stoma Site?@highlight

There are severel problems associated with the closing of a temporary loop-ileostomy after surgery for rectal cancer.

 The purpose of this study is to answer two questions: 1.

 The choice of anastomotic method - does it influence the postoperative course? 2.

 The use of a prophylactic mesh when closing the stoma site - will there be less hernias?
