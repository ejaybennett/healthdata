(thirdQuint)The Effect of Probiotic Streptococci and pH-rising Components on the Oral Microbial Flora.

 The aim was to analyse the effect of daily intake of probiotic alpha-haemolytic facultative anaerobic streptococci (Streptococcus oralis), pH-rising components and Stevia on the oral microflora in hyposalivated subjects.

 Material and methods: Subjects with hyposalivation (unstimulated secretion rate of 10 000 cfu/ml of mutans streptococci and/or lactobacilli on the tongue or in the supragingival plaque were included.

 Eighteen subjects used probiotic tablets ( 4/day) and gel (once a week) for 3 months and 9 used placebo tablets and gel.

 The salivary secretion rates were measured and microbial samples collected and analysed using cultivation technique twice both at baseline and at the 3-month follow up (1-2 weeks between the appointments).

 The Effect of Probiotic Streptococci and pH-rising Components on the Oral Microbial Flora@highlight

The test group consisted of eighteen subjects with hyposalivation used probiotic tablets ( 4/day) and gel (once a week) (streptococci, bicarbonate and carbamide) for 3 months and 9 used placebo tablets and gel.

 The salivary secretion rates were measured and microbial samples collected and analysed using cultivation technique twice both at baseline and at the 3-month follow up (1-2 weeks between the appointments).
