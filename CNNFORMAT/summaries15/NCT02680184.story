(firstQuint)Clinical Study of CMP-001 in Combination With Pembrolizumab or as a Monotherapy.

 Objectives: Primary (Part 1): cent To determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of CMP-001 when given in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced melanoma.

 Primary (Part 2): cent To assess and describe the safety profile of CMP-001 when administered as monotherapy Methodology: This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b clinical study of intratumoral administration of CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab or as a monotherapy in subjects with advanced melanoma.

 The study will be conducted in two parts.

 Part 1 (CMP-001 + pembrolizumab) is comprised of two phases: 1) a Dose Escalation Phase and 2) a Dose Expansion Phase.

 Part 2 of the study is designed to assess the CMP-001 as a monotherapy.

 The Part 1 Dose Escalation phase of the study will evaluate two treatment schedules of CMP-001 (at doses of 1 mg, 3 mg, 5 mg, 7.

5 mg or 10 mg) administered in combination with pembrolizumab, designated as Schedule "A" or "B".

 There were 44 subjects enrolled into the Part 1 Dose Escalation phase of the study.

 - Schedule A: CMP-001 will be administered once a week for 7 weeks (total of 7 doses) then administered once every 3 weeks until discontinuation.

 - Schedule B: CMP-001 will be administered once a week for 2 weeks, then once every 3 weeks for 5 additional doses (total of 7 doses).

 Thereafter it will be administered once every 3 weeks until discontinuation.

 The Part 1 Dose Expansion phase of the study will evaluate the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CMP-001 + pembrolizumab on treatment Schedule A.

 There will be a maximum of 80 subjects enrolled in the Part 1 Dose Expansion phase.

 Part 2 will evaluate CMP-001 as a monotherapy on treatment Schedule A.

 If the subject progresses after 8 weeks of CMP-001 monotherapy treatment they have the option to crossover onto the combination treatment of CMP-001+ pembrolizumab.

 There will be a maximum of 20 subjects enrolled in Part 2.

 There will be a maximum of 144 patients enrolled in this study.
