(firstQuint)VectorFlow Tunneled Dialysis Catheter (TDC) Versus Palindrome TDC.

 The VectorFlow tunneled dialysis catheter is a novel symmetrical tip design tunneled dialysis catheter which in pre-clinical testing and retrospective review has improved flow and patency compared to other dialysis catheter designs.

 This study will compare 90 day patency rates of newly inserted VF catheters to the Palindrome catheter both of which are FDA approved devices and will inserted as standard of care.

 The Palindrome catheter has been selected as the comparison device because it is also a symmetrical tip catheter design and prior studies by the manufacturer of this device suggests it has a lower occlusion rate and better flow compared to other catheter designs.
