(secondQuint)A Trial of Increased Dose Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) for High-Grade Meningiomas.

 This is a Phase I/II clinical trial.

 Researchers are trying to find out if using increased-dose intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for treatment of Meningiomas will be more effective than the current treatment.

 The intensity modulated part of IMPT allows for even better concentration of the radiation dose to the desired target and less dose to the surrounding normal tissues than even traditional passive scattering proton therapy can do.

 Proton beams can be regulated to stop within or shortly beyond treatment targets.

 Therefore there is little exposure of the normal tissue to radiation.

 The FDA (the U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration) has not approved IMPT as a treatment for any disease.
