(thirdQuint)Effects of Vaginal Lactoferrin Administration Prior to Genetic Amniocentesis on Inflammatory Mediators.

 Pregnant women undergoing genetic amniocentesis within the 16th-18th gestational week will be enrolled at the Obstetric Unit, University of Ferrara.

 The selected patients will be randomly assigned to receive a vaginal compound containing 300 mg of lactoferrin 4 hours before amniocentesis or they will be untreated (controls).

 Amniotic fluid samples will be obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis and the sample not required for clinical purposes will be centrifuged to remove particulate material and the supernatants will be aliquoted and stored at -80C until assay.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of vaginal lactoferrin administration on amniotic fluid PGE2 level and MMP-TIMP system in women undergoing genetic amniocentesis.

 Two groups of patients will be prospectively enrolled: not treated with lactoferrin and treated with vaginal lactoferrin 4 hours prior to mid-trimester genetic amniocentesis.
