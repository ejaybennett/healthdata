(secondQuint)Patient Navigation for Lung Screening at MGH Community Health Centers.

 The specific aims of this study are: Specific Aim 1: To develop a patient navigator (PN) program for lung screening for patients who are current smokers, aged 55-77 years, potentially eligible for lung screening and are receiving care at community health centers (CHCs) affiliated with MGH.

 Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the new lung screening PN program in improving screening rates and increasing use of tobacco cessation services in a randomized controlled trial.

 Specific Aim 3: To demonstrate that equity is maintained in rates of lung screening and in follow up of abnormal chest CT results, comparing eligible smokers from CHCs with eligible smokers from other practices within the MGH primary care network.
