(firstQuint)Glyburide vs Glucovance in the Treatment of GDM.

 This study will be a randomized open label trial of glyburide compared to glucovance in the management of gestational diabetes.

 We hypothesize that glucovance will provide improved glycemic control and a lower failure rate with no increase in neonatal adverse outcomes.

 Sixty-seven patients will be randomized by computer to each arm of the study.

 Outcomes will be glycemic control, failure rate of the drug to achieve glycemic goals, and neonatal outcomes.
