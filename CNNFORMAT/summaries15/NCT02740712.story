(thirdQuint)Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interaction Study of Rucaparib.

 This is a Phase 1, open-label, sequential, drug-drug-interaction (DDI) study in patients with advanced solid tumors.

 The study will consist of 2 parts: a DDI part (Part I) and a rucaparib treatment part (Part II).

 In Part I, the PK of cytochrome P450 (CYP) cocktail probes: caffeine, S-warfarin, omeprazole, and midazolam and a P-glycoprotein probe (digoxin) will be assessed with and without rucaparib treatment.

 Patients will receive single doses of CYP drug cocktail (caffeine, warfarin, omeprazole, and midazolam) on Day 1 and Day 12, and single doses of digoxin on Day 2 and Day 13.

 Continuous treatment with 600 mg rucaparib twice daily (BID) will start on Day 5 and will last until at least Day 16 of Part I.

 In Part II, the treatment with rucaparib in 28-day cycles will continue until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for discontinuation.

 Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interaction Study of Rucaparib@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess pharmacokinetic concentrations of multiple probes alone followed by assessment of the same drug pharmacokinetic concentrations when the patient has steady-state exposure to rucaparib followed by cycle-by-cycle treatment with rucaparib continuing until disease progression or other reason for discontinuation.
