(fifthQuint)Pembrolizumab and Ipilimumab After Prior Immunotherapy for Melanoma.

 Primary Objective: To determine the irRECIST* response rate of pembrolizumab with ipilimumab following initial progression or stable disease to anti-PD1/L1 antibody (or combination not containing anti-CTLA4) in subjects with advanced melanoma.

 Secondary Objective 1.

 To summarize the progression-free survival (RECIST v1.

1 and irRC) of the combination following prior treatment with anti-PD1/L1 antibody.

 2.

 To assess the safety of the combination following prior treatment with anti-PD1/L1 antibody.

 Exploratory Objective: To evaluate changes in the tumor microenvironment and other biospecimens before and after adding ipilimumab to pembrolizumab.

 Pembrolizumab and Ipilimumab After Prior Immunotherapy for Melanoma@highlight

Phase II study evaluating the benefit of the combination of anti-PD1 (pembrolizumab) and anti-CTLA4 (ipilimumab) antibodies in advanced melanoma.

 The study will determine the response rate of the combination and evaluate other clinical parameters such as progression-free survival and safety of the combination following anti-PD1/L1 antibody.

 The study will also provide the opportunity to investigate blood or tumor based factors that may predict response to anti-PD1 antibody in combination with anti-CTLA4.
