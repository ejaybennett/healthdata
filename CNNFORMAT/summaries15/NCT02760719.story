(thirdQuint)The Effectiveness of Nebulized Hypertonic Saline Solution for Acute Bronchiolitis.

 Acute viral bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in infants up to two years old.

 Currently there is no effective treatment so standard treatment remains supportive care with supplemental oxygen to correct hypoxia, minimal handling to minimise the risk of exhaustion and the provision of fluids.

 In recent years some studies have suggested that nebulised hypertonic saline, which improve airway hygiene, may influence the course of the illness and reduce the duration of hospitalisation without significant side effects.

 Study protocol: half of the included patients will receive standard treatment for bronchiolitis, which includes only supportive care, the other half will additionally receive nebulized 3% hypertonic saline solution with salbutamol (to avoid potential bronchial obstruction) three times daily.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of nebulized 3% hypertonic saline solution with salbutamol in the treatment of children under 2 years, hospitalised for acute viral bronchiolitis.

 Half of the participants will receive nebulized 3% hypertonic saline solution with salbutamol three times daily, the other half will receive standard supportive care, which is the cornerstone of the bronchiolitis management.
