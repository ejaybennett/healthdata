(thirdQuint)Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Interaction Between Four Different Single Doses of BIA 3-202 and a Single Dose of Levodopa/Benserazide (100/25 mg).

 This was a single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, single-graded-dose, crossover study with five single-dose treatment periods.

 The washout period between doses was 152 days.

 For each of the five treatment periods, volunteers were to be admitted at the UFH on the day before the treatment day.

 On each treatment period, the pre-dose assessment were to be completed, BIA 3-202/Placebo was to be administered concomitantly with the dose of Madopar(R) 125 and post-dose assessments were to be completed.

 Subjects were discharged 30 h post-dose.

 Subjects should attend five treatment periods and were to receive a different dose of BIA 3-202 or placebo during each of these treatment periods.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile of BIA 3-202 and its metabolites, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between 4 different single doses of BIA 3-202 (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg) and a single dose of standard levodopa 100 mg/benserazide 25 mg (Madopar(R) 125) in adult male and female healthy volunteers.
