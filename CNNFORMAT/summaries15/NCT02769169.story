(firstQuint)Double-dose Ranibizumab for Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy.

 Recently, it's reported that intravitreal high dose Lucentis(R)(Ranibizumab) could benefit to both regression of the polyps and the relief of macular edema in PCV patients.

 Since it was a single arm prospective study with a relatively small sample size, randomized clinical trials were needed to confirm the efficacy of high dose Ranibizumab in PCV treatment.

 In this study, the investigator will compare the efficacy of double-dose (1mg, 3+prn) Raibizumab with regular dose (0.

5mg, 3+prn) for PCV treatment.
