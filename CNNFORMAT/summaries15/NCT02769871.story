(firstQuint)NICE: NeuroImaging in Cessation Education.

 The investigators hypothesize that showing actual images of a patient's stroke to the participant on either brain CT or MRI will be a similarly easy to understand quantification of damage done to the participant's body.

 Given the link between smoking and stroke risk, the investigators believe that providing this imaging in addition to standard smoking cessation education may improve rates of smoking cessation after stroke.

 If this proves true, addition of a patient's neuroimaging to standard post-stroke smoking cessation education would be an easy method to improve smoking cessation rates in stroke patients, at minimal cost.

The investigators aim to examine the effect on smoking cessation rate by showing stroke patients who are active smokers images of their strokes.
