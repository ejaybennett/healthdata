(secondQuint)Study to Prevent Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery Involving Cardiopulmonary Bypass.

 Angion Biomedica Corp.

 has developed a small molecule hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) mimetic, termed BB3, which exerts significant nephroprotective effects in several preclinical renal injury models.

 Angion intends to develop BB3 as a therapy to prevent and/or treat acute kidney injury.

 BB3 is a new molecular entity and the proposed treatment is novel since no drug is currently available with an indication to prevent and/or treat acute kidney injury.

 This is a randomized, prospective, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.

 Patients who will be undergoing a surgical procedure involving CPB and are at elevated risk pre-surgery for AKI will be eligible to participate in the study.

 Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either BB3 or placebo (normal saline) immediately after surgery.

 Study drug will be administered for a total of 4 daily intravenous (IV) infusions.

 The first post-operative dose MUST be started within 4 hours of completing CPB.

 The second dose will be administered 24 2 hours after completing CPB, and the third and fourth doses will be administered 24 2 hours after each previous dose.

 Patients will be followed for safety, PK (in a subset of patients), and efficacy up to Day 90, with Day 1 being the day of the first infusion of study drug.

 Patients will be assessed daily through Day 7 and then on Days 14, 30 and 90.

 Efficacy endpoints include assessment of post-CPB renal injury, expressed as percent increase in sCr above Baseline over time and the maximum percent increase in sCr following CPB, from 24 hours after end of CPB through Day 5; the proportion of patients reaching each KDIGO stage or having no AKI at specified time points through Day 30; and analyses among patients who develop AKI assessing time to recovery or reduction in KDIGO stage.

 Approximately 100 patients will be randomized; 50 patients will be randomized to BB3 and 50 patients to placebo.

 Study to Prevent Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery Involving Cardiopulmonary Bypass@highlight

The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of BB3 in preventing AKI compared to placebo when administered to patients at risk for developing acute kidney injury (AKI) following cardiac surgical procedures involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
