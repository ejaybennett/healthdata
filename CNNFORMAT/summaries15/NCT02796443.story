(fifthQuint)The Real World of Acute Cholecystitis.

 Background: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and population based studies are in favor of an early operation in acute cholecystitis (1, 2).

 Thus, one of the largest RCT so far, demonstrated significant more complications in a group of delayed cholecystectomy.

 The main problems in these studies are the exclusion criteria used, ie severe cases are not considered.

 Objective: In a cohort study all cholecystectomy patients are analysed to demonstrate that delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) in a real world setting has a less complication rate than early cholecystectomy (ELC).

 Setting: Academic Teaching Hospital with 400 beds, seven departments (anesthesiology and intensive care medicine, orthopaedics and trauma surgery, visceral and thoracic surgery, gastroenterology, cardiology, gynecology and obstetrics, psychiatry.

 The visceral and thoracic department has a main focus on minimally invasive techniques.

 Participants: All cholecystectomy patients during 1/2006 and 9/2015 Variables: Clavien Dindo Complication score, American Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) Score, conversion rate, onset of symptoms, histology, hospital stay Data sources: Chart analyses.

 The Real World of Acute Cholecystitis@highlight

Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and population based studies in acute cholecystitis are in favor for early laparoscopic surgery versus a delayed operation several weeks later.

 The main problems in these studies are the exclusion criteria used, thus not reflecting the real world setting of acute cholecystitis.

 The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that a delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a real world scenario has no worse outcome in comparison with an early operation (within 72 hours after onset of symptoms).
