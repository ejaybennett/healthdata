(thirdQuint)Effect of a Comprehensive Nutrition Support Product on the Nutritional Status of Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

 It is estimated that 1-1.

3 million people in the United States suffer from the Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC).

 The pathophysiology of IBD involves malnutrition, malabsorption, altered intestinal permeability, inflammation, and gut flora alterations.

 Individuals with IBD are at risk for nutrient deficiencies due to decreased intake, decreased absorption and/or increased enteral losses.

 The most common deficiencies involve many micronutrients including vitamins and minerals; less commonly, adults may also be at risk for macronutrient deficiencies involving protein and total energy intake.

 The product being studied is a comprehensive nutrition support product that was formulated to meet the nutritional needs of individuals with digestive complaints.

 This study will assess the effect of the study product on blood markers of nutritional status in adults with IBD.
