(secondQuint)Social Inequalities in the Participation and Activity in Children and Adolescents With Hodgkin-lymphoma.

 Hodgkin-lymphoma is a rare malignancy among children and adolescents (about 140 each year in Germany) which is highly curable.

 Beside this therapeutic success, a lot of therapy-related long-term problems arise (e.

g.

 fertility disorders, thyroid diseases, secondary malignancies).

 While most of the studies focused on mental and physical impairments, little attention has been drawn to social dimensions of health.

 Due to the disease and the requirements of the therapy, participation of children with hodgkin-lymphoma can be impaired acutely or chronically.

 This can be of serious consequences, because participation in daily life is an important component of the development of children and adolescents.

 To determine the influence of social, personal and treatment-related factors on participation, all patients who were actual treated in the international therapy study EuroNet-PHL-C2 in all of Germany (N 700) and their parents will be interviewed.

 Statistical analyses will be done using descriptive and multivariate methods taking account of treatment-related issues (e.

g.

 stage of disease, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, progression/relapse).
