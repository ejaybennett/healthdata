(fifthQuint)The Bangladesh Environmental Enteric Dysfunction Study.

 Study design This will be a community-based intervention study.

 Survey, screening, enrollment of subjects will be done in Mirpur in Dhaka city.

 Subjects Participants will be recruited from two age groups: a child cohort (age 12 to 18 months) and an adult cohort (age 18 to 45 years).

 The child cohort will consist of two groups of children- stunted children (LAZ score cent Lactulose-Rhamnose test Blood bio-markers - C- Reactive Protein - Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein - Soluble cluster of differentiation 14 - Kynurenine-Tryptophan Ratio - Glucagon-like peptide-2 - Insulin-like growth factor-2 - Tissue Transglutaminase - Ferritin - Zinc - Pepsinogen I/II Ratio - Low density lipoprotein related receptor 1 (LRP1) - Blood plasma metabolomics Other proposed biomarkers cent Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth After completion of nutritional therapy, all enrolled participants will have an assessment for response which will include: - Anthropometric measurements - Collection of one 5 ml blood sample for serum bio-markers of gut function and screening tests for the endoscopy with biopsy procedure, if the procedure is indicated for failure to thrive - Collection of stool specimen for bio-markers of gut function - Administration of lactulose-rhamnose solution and collection of urine for up to 2 hours for urine bio markers of gut function At this time, the final inclusion criterion for endoscopy with biopsy will be evaluated to determine whether the participants failed nutritional therapy or had an adequate response, or have an underlying disease that caused the malnutrition.

 Failure of nutritional therapy in this study, or failure to respond, is defined in the absence of any other underlying diseases such as tuberculosis: - LAZ score remains < -2 for stunted children cohort - LAZ score remains < -1 for "at risk of stunting" children cohort - BMI < 18.

5 and < 10% increase in BMI for adults.

 Participants who meet the study definition of "failure to respond" will be checked for presence of any secondary cause of malnutrition like tuberculosis, carcinoma, any parasitic infection etc.

 Stool microscopy for parasite identification will be done at icddr,b parasitology lab as soon as possible after collection of stool samples.

 If nothing conclusive can be found, the participants may be requested to undergo preparations for upper GI endoscopy with biopsy, as they may benefit from further evaluation to identify the potential cause(s) of intervention failure and to determine an appropriate therapeutic course.

 It will also benefit others by validating the non-invasive bio-marker signature of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction.

 Participants who will undergo endoscopy will receive necessary treatments according to diagnosis.

 Participants having celiac disease and clotting disorder (tested by prothrombin time / International Normalized Ratio coagulopathy) will be excluded from the study.

 Endoscopy of upper gastrointestinal tract will be done as per standards recommended by North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN0, American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE).
