(fifthQuint)Validation of Sleep Apnea Screening Device.

 Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) results in tiredness, depression and fatigue, and has several associated common comorbidities.

 It is believed that over 80% of OSA remains undiagnosed.

 Poorer and disadvantaged communities are at higher risk for sleep disorders, including OSA, even after accounting for other risk factors.

 The gold-standard method for diagnosing OSA is in-laboratory polysomnography; however, this procedure is generally available only to patients with health insurance due to its high cost.

 As a result, communities at particularly high risk for OSA are less likely to have this serious sleep disorder appropriately diagnosed and treated.

 An affordable, available, FDA-approved and easy-to-use over-the-counter OSA screening tool would allow greater screening of at-risk individuals, especially in underserved communities with low socioeconomic status, hopefully encouraging a greater proportion of such individuals to seek treatment for their condition.

 Zansors(R) has developed a bioengineered, semiconductor prototype that measures breathing and movement during sleep.

 It is a 1.

5 x 2.

5 x 0.

2 inch wireless package using four key technologies: 1.

 an adjustable microphone; 2.

 a 3-axis accelerometer; 3.

 embedded algorithms to measure sleep events; and 4.

 acrylic adhesive.

 The product will be designed as an FDA-approved over-the-counter device that the patient can wear during sleep and wake up with a color score of red, yellow, or green depending on their sleep apnea status.

 The features of this product include that it is home-based; easy to use; non-invasive; wireless; disposable; low cost ($20-50); and presents easily understandable test results.

 However, such a device must first be validated against gold-standard polysomnography.

 The specific goal of this project is to compare the Zansors(R) micro sleep sensor screening device against gold-standard polysomnography to establish the device's preliminary validity to screen for OSA accurately.

 Validation of Sleep Apnea Screening Device@highlight

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea.

 OSA affects an estimated 18-40 million adults and 0.

7-3% of all children in the US.

 The marketplace currently does not have an affordable, easy-to-use, over-the-counter, home-based OSA screening device.
