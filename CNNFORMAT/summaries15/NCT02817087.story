(firstQuint)Multifocal Brain Magnetic Stimulation in Chronic Ischemic Stroke.

 This study uses transcranial magnetic stimulation of brain motor areas to test whether upper-body motor function can be improved.

 This is a double-blind study where half of patients will receive real stimulation and half will receive sham (placebo) stimulation.
