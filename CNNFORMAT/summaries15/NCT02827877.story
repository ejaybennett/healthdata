(fifthQuint)Copper (Cu) 64-DOTA-Trastuzumab PET Imaging in Predicting Response to Treatment With Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab Before Surgery in Patients With HER2 Positive Breast Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax) in patients with previously untreated HER2+ breast cancer.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate if the uptake of copper 64 Cu-64-DOTA-trastuzumab, a proposed indicator of responsiveness to HER2-directed therapy, correlates with serpin peptidase inhibitor alpha-1 antiproteinase, antitrypsin, member 1 gene (SERPINA1) expression, which has been shown to be associated with estrogen receptor positive (ER+)/ HER2+ patient survival, both in the HER2+/ER+ patients and in all patients.

 II.

 To compare uptake of copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab in the patients with complete pathologic response (pCR) vs.

 non-pCR patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes immediately before receiving copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab IV on day 0.

 Patients undergo PET scans at 18-24 and 42-48 hours, on day 1 and 2.

 Within 4 days after completion of PET scans, patients then receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes weekly or every 3 weeks and pertuzumab IV over 30-60 minutes.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients undergo surgery after 6 courses of trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.

This pilot clinical trial studies how well copper Cu64-DOTA-trastuzumab positron emission tomography (PET) works in predicting response to treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab before surgery in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as copper Cu 64 DOTA-trastuzumab PET, may help predict a patient's response to trastuzumab and pertuzumab before surgery in patients with locally advanced HER2 positive breast cancer.
