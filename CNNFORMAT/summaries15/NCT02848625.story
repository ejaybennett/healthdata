(thirdQuint)Yoga Effect on Quality of Life Study Among Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.

 Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive fibrotic (scarring) disease of the lung of unknown cause.

 Approximately 100,000 Americans will die from IPF this year.

 There is no cure for IPF other than lung transplantation, which only 1% of patients will receive.

 Recently, 2 drugs were approved by the FDA to slow the rate of decline in lung function among patients with IPF.

 These drugs do not decrease symptoms or improve quality of life.

 Symptoms of IPF include shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue, all of which may also adversely affect quality of life.

 Yoga is a practice of exercises, including breathing exercises, that has been shown to be relatively safe and to improve quality of life in some patients with other advanced lung diseases.

 We hypothesize that regular yoga and breathing exercises, specifically designed for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, over a period of 12 weeks will lead to improved quality of life as measured by several different quality of life questionnaires.

 Yoga Effect on Quality of Life Study Among Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis@highlight

This study will evaluate whether regular yoga exercises designed specifically for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis is associated with any change in quality of life.

 Half of the participants will be randomized to yoga, half to usual care.

 After the first group completes 12 weeks of yoga, the patients who were randomized to usual care will completed 12 weeks of yoga.
