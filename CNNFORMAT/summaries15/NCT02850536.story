(secondQuint)CAR-T Hepatic Artery Infusions or Pancreatic Venous Infusions for CEA-Expressing Liver Metastases or Pancreas Cancer.

 Patients undergo leukapheresis from which peripheral blood mononuclear cells are purified.

 T cells are activated and then re-engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) specific for CEA.

 Cells are expanded in culture and returned to the patient by percutaneous hepatic artery infusion at specific cell doses.

 Prior to the first dose, each patient will undergo diagnostic angiography to verify suitable arterial anatomy.

 Three anti-CEA CAR-T doses per patient are planned at 1-week intervals.

 Low dose interleukin-2 will be given via an ambulatory infusion pump for 4 weeks.

 Normal liver and tumor biopsies will be obtained at the time of the initial diagnostic angiogram and during the final session following the 3rd CAR-T infusion.

 Patients with CEA+ liver metastases who exhibit in-liver control following CAR-T therapy who also have CEA+ primary pancreatic tumors may be eligible to receive direct intrapancreatic CAR-T retrograde venous infusions.

 A maximum of 2 infusions will be delivered.

 No additional IL-2 will be given and there will be no additional biopsies.
