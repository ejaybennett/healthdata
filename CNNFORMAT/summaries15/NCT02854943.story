(firstQuint)The Prognostic and Diagnostic Value of Ferritin in Critically Ill Patients With Special Focus on Underlying Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis.

 The study is a retrospective register study of critically ill patients from Charite - University Medicine Berlin during 2000 and 2016 that had at least one measurement of plasma ferritin.

 Outcome, underlying diagnoses and HLH-2004 criteria (Henter JI et al.

 2007) will be analysed and the HScore of these patients will be calculated (Fardet L et al.

 2014).

 All recorded data of the specific admission term in ICU will be used for the analysis.

 No follow-up of the patients after discharge will be performed in this study.

 The study does not involve any randomization or any drug testing.
