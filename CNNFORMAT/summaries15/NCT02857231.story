(firstQuint)Bioimpedance Spectroscopy Compared to CardioMEMS.

 This is a prospective, single-arm, observational, non-randomized clinical study that will enroll patients with heart failure who have had a CardioMEMS cent device implanted to monitor their diastolic pulmonary artery pressure.

 The study will recruit and enroll ten participants from the Scripps Clinic.

 Participants will be monitored 3 times a week for a period of 4 weeks.

 At each monitoring visit, the patient's diastolic pulmonary artery pressure will be measured by CardioMEMS cent and the ImpediMed's BIS technology.

 Participant's vital signs and weight will also be taken at each monitoring visit.
