(fifthQuint)Estimation of MMP-8 Levels in GCF and Serum and Its Correlation With Wound Healing and Clinical Outcomes After Coronally Advanced Flap and Subepithelial Connective Tissue Graft for Root Coverage in Recession Defects: A CLINICO-BIOCHEMICAL STUDY.

 NEED FOR THE STUDY: Coronally advanced flap with Subepithelial Connective Tissue Graft (CAF+SCTG) technique has proven to be one of the most successful modalities for root coverage.

1 The success of any surgical procedure is dependent on wound healing.

 Wound healing after surgical procedure is complex and highly orchestrated event that includes hemostatic phase, inflammatory phase, phase of new tissue formation and the final remodelling phase leaving behind collagen rich extracellular matrix (ECM) and a dense and stable tissue.

2 During wound healing clot provides a foundation for the future ECM.

 ECM plays a vital role to prompt cellular migration, adhesion, wound contraction and epithelialization.

 This crucial role of ECM is maintained by a group of enzymes collectively known as Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs).

 MMPs plays a central role in wound healing.

3,4 Failure of regulation of these MMPs has been correlated with faulty wound healing.

3,4 MMPs (i.

e.

 collagenases, gelatinases, matrilysins, stromelysins, and membrane type MMPs) are family of zinc dependent endopeptidases capable of cleaving extracellular matrix (ECM) in healing wounds.

3 MMP-8 are primarly produced by neutrophils and are also produced by other cells such as oral epithelial cells, plasma cells and fibroblasts.

7 MMP-8 is expressed during the myelocytic stage of development of PMN (Polymorphonuclear cell) precursors in the bone marrow29 and is stored as latent enzyme (pro-mmp-8) within the specific granules of PMN.

30 Pro-MMP-8 is rapidly released from activated PMN undergoing degranulation31 and then is activated via cysteine switch mechanism to yield the active form of enzyme.

29 MMP-8 (polymorphonuclear collagenase5) cleaves the triple helix of fibrillar collagen and has affinity for type I collagen and type III collagen5 that is abundantly found in connective tissue of gingiva.

 MMP-8 degrades gelatin type VII, VIII and X collagen.

5 MMP-8 has been implicated to be important for acute wound healing.

6 Assessment of wound healing progression after surgery is important.

 Currently blunt surrogate markers such as probing is used.

 Limitation of these markers is that it represents the history of healing and not the ongoing activity.

 As hallmark of healing is collagen remodeling, it is of interest to study the cytokine profile that relates to wound healing.

 Such knowledge may potentially lead to new diagnostic strategies to study wound healing in a better way reflecting the healing phenotype.

 The function of collagenase during normal wound healing after periodontal surgery has been relatively ill-defined due to lack of studies in this area.

10 Most of the research has concentrated on the characterisation of MMP-8 during pathogenesis of periodontal disease8 and the changes in MMP-8 level after periodontal treatment.

 Nwomeh et al studied MMP-8 from dermal wound healing by collecting wound exudate from occlusive bandage.

 He noted that MMP-8 peaked at day 4 and persisted for about a week.

 MMP-8 over expression leads to faulty healing.

5 Chronic wounds have 30 times greater MMPs than acute wounds.

 Inhibiting excessive protease expression in these wounds may allow a prospective wound healing treatment.

5 Very less is known about the cellular aspects of soft tissue healing in the oral mucosa.

 The assumption that oral healing is similar to dermal wounds might provoke confusion, as there are certain subtle difference like reduced scar formation in the dermal wounds2, role of IL-1 in oral wounds and absence of IL-1 in dermal wounds11, faster healing in oral wounds, presence of saliva that aids in healing etc.

 Overall it is still a matter of speculation and ambiguity about the differences in the unique healing pattern of oral wounds.

 Understanding wound healing at molecular level provides an in depth basis to develop treatment strategies that can prevent delayed healing.

2 As recommended by Consensus Report of 10th European workshop on periodontology that, there is a need for more studies at cellular level to identify cytokine, chemokine, and intracellular signaling networks for better regenerative approaches10, the present clinical trial was designed.

 On account of a considerable lacunae in this area of periodontal research, this study is planned to assess the MMP-8 levels during the post-op healing following CAF+SCTG surgery for recession coverage and to better identify the mechanism involved in wound healing.

 This information can be used to prevent the normal surgical wound from altered healing experience.

2 REVIEW OF LITERATURE: Sanctis et al.

 (2011) conducted a study to determine the use of connective tissue graft (CTG) in root coverage.

 The results proved CAF in association with SCTG is a valid approach in the treatment of recession defects Nwomeh et al.

 (1999) assessed the sources of collagenases (MMP-8, MMP-1) and their activity in normal healing wounds and chronic non healing ulcers.

 The results showed MMP-8 is predominant collagenase present in normal healing wounds and chronic non healing ulcers had increased level of MMP-1,8 and decreased levels of TIMP-1 Armstrong et al (2002) reviewed the key role of MMP-8 in wound healing as predominant collagenase.

 He elaborated the expressions of peak levels of MMP-8 at day 4 and 7 during normal wound healing.

 Hammerle et al (2014) in a consensus report that reviewed the biological processes of soft tissue wound healing in oral cavity, found that oral soft tissue healing at teeth, implants and edentulous ridge follows the same phase as skin wound healing and human histological data are limited.

 Sorsa et al (2010) compared four methods for gingival crevicular fluid matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-8) detection i.

e.

, Immunofluorometeric assay, Dip stick test, dentoAnalyser immunoblot assay and ELISA kit in their study and concluded that all the assays are comparable and dentoAnalyser is among first quantitative MMP-8 chair side testing devices in periodontal and peri implant diagnostics and research.

 Fernandez et al ( 2007 ) conducted a study to investigate the role of MMP_8 in cutaneous wound healing healing.

 They observed significant delay in wound closure in MMP-8 -/- mice and an altered inflammatory response in their wounds.

 They indicated that MMP-8 participates in wound repair by resolution of inflammation and open the possibility to develop new strategies for treating wound healing defects.

 Mohd H et al (1999)19 assessed the levels of MMP-8 and MMP-3 during early healing phase following a guided tissue regeneration procedure by assessing GCF (Gingival Crevicular Fluid) samples for quantification of MMP-8 and MMP-3.

 They found that presence of the membrane appeared to increase the levels of MMP-3 and -8 and relate to the resorption of the bioresorbable membrane by host systems.

 Dickinson et al (2013) studied the early events in periodontal regeneration in the canine supraalveolar periodontal defect model by using histologic and immunological techniques and concluded that activation of cellular regenerative events in periodontal wound regeneration is rapid, the general frame work of tissue formation ( bone, periodontal ligament, and Connective tissue) is broadly outlined within 14 days.

 Shaw et al (2009) reviewed wound repair at a glance and described the complex process of wound repair.

 He emphasized that the remodeling of extracellular matrix is accomplished by a delicate balance of MMPs.

 Teles et al (2010) measured the levels of GCF biomarkers and subgingival bacterial species in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects.

 He concluded that clinically healthy sites from periodontitis subjects present higher levels of GCF biomarkers and periodontal pathogens than sites from healthy subjects.
