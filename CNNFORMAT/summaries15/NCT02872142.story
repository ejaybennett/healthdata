(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Plasma Exchange With Albutein 5% in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

 This is a phase 2, prospective, open-label, single-arm pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PE with Albutein(R) 5% in subjects with ALS.

 The planned enrollment is 10 subjects who have a definite, possible, or probable diagnosis of ALS, according to the revised El Escorial criteria.

 Enrolled subjects will be treated with PE using Albutein 5% as a replacement solution during an Intensive Treatment Phase (2 PEs per week over 3 weeks) followed by a Maintenance Treatment Phase (weekly PE for 21 weeks) for a total treatment duration of 6 months.

 A 6-month follow up will begin after the last PE.
