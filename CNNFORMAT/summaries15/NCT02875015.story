(thirdQuint)Liposomal Bupivacaine vs.

 Bupivacaine Hydrochloride and Lidocaine During Suburethral Sling Placement.

 This is a prospective, comparative, randomized study.

 Women with pure stress urinary incontinence or mixed urinary incontinence with a predominant stress component who had chosen to proceed with a midurethral sling will be randomized to two groups.

 The study group will have the hydro-dissection performed with a diluted liposomal bupivacaine solution.

 The comparison group would have the hydro-dissection performed with a diluted bupivacaine HCL and Lidocaine solution.

 The postoperative pain will be compared between groups using a visual analog scale.

 The quality of recovery will be compared between the groups using the quality of recovery short form.

 Postoperative opioid consumption will be compared between the two groups.
