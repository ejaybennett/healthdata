(fifthQuint)Study of IACS-010759 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you joined the study.

 Up to 6 groups of 3-6 participants will be enrolled in the dose escalation part of the study.

 Up to 18 participants will be enrolled in dose expansion.

 If you are enrolled in dose escalation, the dose of IACS-010759 you receive will depend on when you join this study.

 The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of IACS-010759.

 Each new group will receive a higher dose of IACS-010759 than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.

 A new group at a higher dose level may be started at the same time as an ongoing group receiving a lower dose.

 If this happens, participants will be assigned in an alternating manner between the lower dose and higher dose groups.

 This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of IACS-010759 is found.

 If you are enrolled in the dose expansion part of the study, you will receive the dose level of IACS-010759 that was found to be the best dose in the escalation part of the study.

 In the dose expansion part of the study, 6 participants will also be enrolled in a food-effect group (described in more detail below) to help researchers understand the effects of taking the study drug with food.

 Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 21 days.

 You will take the drug in 2 phases: Induction Phase and Maintenance Phase.

 In the Induction Phase, you will take IACS-010759 by mouth one (1) time every day on Days 1-7 of Cycle 1.

 At the end of the Induction Phase, you will move on to the Maintenance Phase.

 During the Maintenance Phase, you will take IACS-010759 by mouth 3 times each week.

 The study doctor will tell you when to take your dose.

 You should take each dose with a glass of water and at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.

 If you miss a dose, you should not take another dose until the next scheduled time.

 If you are enrolled in the food-effect group, you will take your first dose of IACS-010759 within 30 minutes after eating a high fat meal.

 You will be admitted to the hospital on Day 7 of Cycle 1 for 24 hours.

 This is done so that you can be checked on for any side effects.

 Length of Study: You may continue to take IACS-010759 for up to 12 cycles.

 If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may be able to continue receiving the study drug beyond 12 cycles.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Your participation on this study will be over after long-term follow-up (described below).

 You will only have this blood draw 1 time on Day 12.

 On Day 15 of Cycle 1: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) and urine will be collected for routine and acid/base level testing before the dose.

 - Blood (about 6 teaspoons each time) will be drawn before the dose and then 4 hours after the dose for PD testing.

 - Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn before the dose and then 4 hours after the dose for PK testing.

 - You will have an EKG before and after the dose.

 On Days 17 and 21 of Cycle 1: - Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn to check how well your pancreas functions and for routine and acid/base level testing.

 - Urine will be collected for routine tests.

 - On Day 21 only, blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for PD testing.

 - On Day 21 only, you will have an EKG.

 - On Day 21 only, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy to check the status of your disease and to create a lab test to learn how well the drug works.

 On Days 1 and 21 of Cycles 2 and 3: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine, acid/base level, and PK testing.

 During Cycle 2 only, this blood draw will also be used to check how well your pancreas functions.

 - During Cycle 2 only, urine will be collected for routine tests.

 On Day 21 of Cycle 3 only, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy.

 On Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 2: - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn before the dose for routine and acid/base level and PK testing.

 If you are unable to return to the clinic for the visit, this testing can be performed by a local doctor and the results will be sent to the study doctor.

 The research nurse will call you to ask about your health.

 These calls should last about 5 minutes.

 Long-Term Follow-up: If the disease appears to be responding to the study drug, a member of the study staff will call you every 3-6 months for up to 5 years to ask how you are doing and about any side effects you may be having.

 Each call should last about 5 minutes.

 If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may be asked to come into the clinic for a physical exam.

 Study of IACS-010759 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)@highlight

This clinical research study has 2 parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.

 The goal of dose escalation in this clinical research study is to find the best dose of IACS-010759 that can be given to patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

 The goal of dose expansion in this clinical research study is to learn if the dose of IACS-010759 found in the dose escalation part of the study is the best dose to use in future studies using IACS-010759 in patients with AML.

 The safety and tolerability of this drug will also be studied.

 This is the first study using IACS-010759 in humans.

 This is an investigational study.

 IACS-010759 is not FDA approved or commercially available.

 It is currently being used for research purposes only.

 The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

 Up to 48 participants will take part in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
