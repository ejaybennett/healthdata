(thirdQuint)Safety and Feasibility of the Shockwave Lithoplasty System for the Treatment of Peripheral Vascular Stenosis.

 Shockwave Medical, Inc.

 intends to conduct a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, clinical study designed to evaluate the early safety and performance of the Shockwave Lithoplasty(R) System in subjects with moderate to heavily calcified peripheral arteries with 2.

5mm to 3.

5mm reference vessel diameter at the target site.

 The Shockwave Lithoplasty(R) System is indicated for lithotripsy-enhanced, low-pressure balloon dilation of calcified, stenotic peripheral arteries in patients who are candidates for percutaneous therapy.

 Up to twenty subjects will be enrolled and treated with Lithoplasty(R) System.

To observe early safety and performance of the Shockwave Medical Lithoplasty(R) System (specifically, Lithoplasty(R) Catheters: 2.

5 x 60mm, 2.

75 x 60mm, 3.

0 x 60mm, 3.
