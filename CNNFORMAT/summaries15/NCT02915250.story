(thirdQuint)A Trial to Compare Post Prandial Blood Glucose Control of BioChaperone Combo With Humalog Mix25 and With Simultaneous Injections of Humalog and Lantus in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes.

 This is a two-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, 3-treatment, 3-period cross-over study using a standardised solid meal test in subjects with type 2 diabetes to investigate postprandial glucose control of BioChaperone(R) Combo compared with Humalog(R) Mix25 and with simultaneous subcutaneous injections of Humalog(R) and Lantus(R) during three separate dosing visits.

 Furthermore, this study aims to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of the three different study treatments.

 During each dosing visit, subjects will be given 3 doses of IMP on three consecutive days (Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3).

 Dosing on Day 2 and Day 3 will be followed by a standardised solid meal test.
