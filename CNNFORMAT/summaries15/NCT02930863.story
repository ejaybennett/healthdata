(thirdQuint)Pulse Oximetry With Automated Verbal Prompts.

 The investigators will examine and observe the patient's stay in the PACU and utilize the pulse oximetry software and data to analyze the ability to evaluate the difference in patient oxygenation levels and supplemental oxygen use with automated verbal prompted monitoring versus a standard care control group.

 As well as determine if automated verbal prompted monitoring leads to less monitor alarms and subsequent improvement of subjective alarm fatigue and patient satisfaction with their care versus standard care.

 The pulse oximeter will have a finger probe that will be attached to the patient's middle finger to read the patient's SpO2 levels.

 Each time the participant's pulse oximetry value declines to 93% or less, an automated verbal prompt, created via the software, will generate as a soft prompt.

 This will be followed up by a hard prompt if no improvement is seen in their oxygenation level after a period of time.

 A positive feedback elicitation will be given if the participant's saturation levels increase above 93%.

 This automated verbal prompt guidance will take place during the entirety of the investigational group's PACU stay.

 Pulse Oximetry With Automated Verbal Prompts@highlight

This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an automated voice prompting system on post operative hypoxia within the Postoperative Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU).

 This will be done to detect an improvement of the patient experience and provider care through a decrease in the number of peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitor alarms via the patients own ability to follow the instruction and improve their SpO2 levels.
