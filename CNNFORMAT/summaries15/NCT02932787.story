(fifthQuint)Effects of Installing Height-adjustable Workstations on Office Workers Workplace Sitting Time and Productivity.

 Sedentary behaviour has been found to be ubiquitous within the workplace and due to the negative consequences of sedentary behaviour upon health, research has began to look at ways to reduce and interrupt sedentary behaviour.

 Interventions that have introduced height-adjustable workstations into the workplace have been found to reduce sedentary behaviour.

 Some employees and employers are concerned that using height-adjustable workstations and trying to reduce workplace sedentary behaviour can lead to a loss of workplace productivity.

 The present study looked at the effects of installing height-adjustable workstations on occupational sitting time and workplace productivity in desk-based workers.

 Workplace activity was measured objectively using ActivPal accelerometers and productivity was measured via self-report measures.

 Measurements took place at baseline, four weeks after receiving the height-adjustable workstation, then four weeks after the removal of the height-adjustable workstation.

 Effects of Installing Height-adjustable Workstations on Office Workers Workplace Sitting Time and Productivity@highlight

The purpose of this study was to look at the effects that height-adjustable workstations on occupational sitting time and workplace productivity in office workers.

 Participants workplace activity (sitting, standing and walking) and productivity was measured before the installation of the height-adjustable workstations.

 Workplace activity and productivity were then measured four weeks after the installation of height-adjustable workstations and four weeks after the removal of height-adjustable workstations, where possible.

 The results were compared to a control group who received no intervention whilst the intervention had the height-adjustable workstations.
