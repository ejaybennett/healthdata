(fifthQuint)Study to Evaluate the Benefit of a High Frequency Ventilation System During Lung or Breast Cancer Radiotherapy Treatment.

 Primary objective : Demonstrate the clinical benefit of the HFPV coupled to thoracic radiotherapy in 2 distinct and frequent clinical situations : 1.

 Tomotherapy for lung and left breast tumors.

 The investigators assume that the volume of irradiated healthy tissue will be much less when using HFPV as compared to free breathing during tomotherapy sessions .

 2.

 In comparison with Active Breathing Control (ABC system).

 The investigators assume that the HFPV will lead to breathing motions cessation the same way as the ABC system, but will abrogate pause times when administrating the radiotherapy.

 This will shorten the radiotherapy sessions for lung patients treated with stereotaxis and for breast cancer patients.

That study combines High Frequency Percussive Ventilation (HFPV) with radiotherapy treatment in patients with tumors that are moving with respiration like breast or lung cancers.

 The use of a High Frequency Percussive Ventilation system leads to the cessation of respiratory motions while administering radiotherapy (RT) to tumors which allows a reduction of the amount of irradiated normal tissues and which potentially decrease radiation-induced collateral damages.
