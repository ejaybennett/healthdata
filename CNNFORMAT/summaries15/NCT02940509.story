(secondQuint)Ketamine and Magnesium in Post-operative Pain Control in Patients Treated With Opioids.

 In this randomized control trial, patients' postoperative pain scores will be assessed as scored by the Numeric Rating Score (NRS) system.

 Intraoperative and postoperative narcotic usage, nausea scores and patients' perception of their quality of recovery via the QoR-40 survey will also be assessed.

 The use of intraoperative Ketamine and Magnesium is predicted to decrease postoperative pain in patients on chronic opioid therapy for management of chronic pelvic pain and will overall improve patients' postoperative experience.

The goal of this research proposal is to determine if the intraoperative administrative of Ketamine and Magnesium during laparoscopic gynecologic surgery improves postoperative pain in patients on chronic opioid therapy for management of chronic pelvic pain.
