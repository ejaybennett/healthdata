(fifthQuint)OsteoArthritis and Therapy for Sleep.

 Twenty-five percent of older adults experience significant osteoarthritis (OA)-related comorbid sleep disturbance.

 Insomnia is associated with substantial negative effects on function, mood, and medical resource utilization.

 Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is evidence based and has been shown to be efficacious in populations with a variety of comorbid conditions including OA-related chronic pain.

 However, in-person CBT interventions are unlikely to be widely deployable in healthcare systems.

 Telephone delivery has the advantage of giving patients access to personalized, efficacious CBT-I interventions from home, increasing generalizability, and outreach to minority, rural, and other underserved populations.

 Older (60+ yrs) primary care patients across Washington State will be screened for severe persistent OA-related insomnia and pain.

 Two hundred and seventy patients will be randomized to either CBT-I or an education only attention control (EOC).

 Each treatment will consist of six 20-30 minute telephone-based sessions over an eight week period.

 Pre-treatment, post-treatment (2 months and 12 month) assessments will include measures of sleep, pain, fatigue, mood, and quality of life.

 A cost effectiveness evaluation of the intervention will also be conducted.

 The proposed research will determine if telephone CBT-I improves OA insomnia and associated outcomes in a state-wide primary care population of older adults, and inform policy decisions about widespread dissemination of telephone CBT-I in this and related patient populations.

 OsteoArthritis and Therapy for Sleep@highlight

Osteoarthritis (OA) pain affects 50 percent of older adults, more than half of whom also experience significant sleep disturbance.

 This randomized trial will determine whether a telephone-based cognitive behavioral treatment targeting insomnia in older adults with chronic severe OA-related insomnia and pain results in substantially greater reductions in insomnia severity and in related improvements in pain, fatigue, mood, quality of life and healthcare costs compared to telephone-delivered education (attention control) about insomnia.

 The trial will test an intervention that if demonstrated to have long term efficacy is scalable and has the potential for wide-scale deployment in healthcare systems.
