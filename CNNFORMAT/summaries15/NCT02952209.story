(thirdQuint)The Effect of Alveolar Ridge Preservation After Tooth Extraction in the Posterior Maxilla.

 Fifteen subjects requiring extraction of one posterior tooth in the right maxilla and one posterior tooth in the left maxilla will be considered for enrollment.

 Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive alveolar ridge preservation on one side of the maxilla and only an extraction on the other side of the maxilla.

 Extraction of the failing teeth will be performed atraumatically; a mucoperiosteal flap will not be employed.

 After removal of the tooth, the alveolus will be meticulously debrided and cleaned.

 In the test site, the socket will be filled with xenograft and a collagen membrane.

 In the control site, no graft material or collagen membrane will be used.

 Clinical measurements, standardized peri-apical radiographs and Cone Beam Computed Tomography scans will be performed immediately following tooth extractions (visit 2) and 6 months (visit 4) after extractions.

 Subjects will be examined over the course of 6 months.

 Investigators will be trained prior to participating in the study.

 Training will be undertaken during a site initiation visit and will include a detailed description of all study procedures including treatment methods, and measurement methods to obtain study endpoints.

 The Effect of Alveolar Ridge Preservation After Tooth Extraction in the Posterior Maxilla@highlight

This study is designed to assess the effects of Alveolar Ridge Preservation (ARP) after tooth extraction compared to extraction alone in the posterior maxilla.

 The results of this study will demonstrate if the use of ARP reduces alveolar ridge resorption at 6 months post extraction in the posterior maxilla region.
