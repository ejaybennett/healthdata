(secondQuint)Trial of SPI-2012 Versus Pegfilgrastim in the Management of Chemotherapy Induced Neutropenia in Early- Stage BReast Cancer Patients Receiving Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide (RECOVER).

 This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter study to compare the efficacy and safety of SPI-2012 with pegfilgrastim in breast cancer patients treated with TC chemotherapy to prevent and reduce Neutropenia.

 Approximately 218 patients will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment arms: Each cycle will be 21 days.

 Total 4 cycles will be evaluated for this study.

 On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will receive TC chemotherapy.

 On Day 2 of each cycle, patients will received study drug (SPI-2012 or pegfilgrastim).

 After cycle 1, as applicable, patients who have received at least one dose of study drug will be followed for 12 months after the last dose of study treatment for safety.
