(thirdQuint)Roll-over Study to Collect and Assess Long-term Safety of Everolimus in Patients With TSC and Refractory Seizures Who Have Completed the EXIST-3 Study [CRAD001M2304] and Who Are Benefitting From Continued Treatment.

 This is a multi-center, open label study to evaluate the long term safety of everolimus in patients with TSC and refractory seizures currently being treated in the Novartis-sponsored study EXIST-3 study and are judged by their parent study investigator as benefiting from the current study treatment.

 The study is expected to remain open for approximately 10 years (or until 31-Dec-2022 in the UK) from First Patient First Visit (FPFV).

 Patients will continue to be treated in this study until they are no longer benefiting from their everolimus treatment as judged by the Investigator or until one of the protocol defined discontinuation criteria is met or everolimus becomes commercially available according to local regulations.
