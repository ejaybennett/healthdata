(firstQuint)PATET Ratio to Rule Out Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn.

 Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn(TTN) is the most common diagnosed disease in state of neonatal respiratory distress.

 However there is not an adequate method to diagnose or rule out TTN.

 In several studies pulmonary artery Doppler indices are investigated as the possible indicators of pulmonary function.

 As a result of these studies, physiological processes in fetal lung maturation were established; pulmonary tissue impedance or resistance decreases with increasing gestational age, leading to increased pulmonary blood flow.

 In a normal lung maturation process the peak sistolic velocity is reached in midsystole, but in case of any reason disturbing the nornal development process,the peak occurs earlier.

 We suggested that TTN, which is a factor increasing pulmonary tissue impedance like respiratory distress syndrome(RDS) and pulmonary hypoplasia, would change pulmonary artery(PA) Doppler indices, thus by the way of evaluating pulmonary artery Doplerr indices, we could predict possible diagnosis of TTN.

This study aims to find out whether diagnosis of Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn(TTN) can be predicted via evaluating pulmonary artery Doppler indices.
