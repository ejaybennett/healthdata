(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Ruxolitinib in the Treatment of Anemic Myelofibrosis Patients.

.

 This is a study of treatment with ruxolitinib in patients who present with transfusion dependent or independent anemia at screening defined as an hemoglobin <10 g/dL with 10 mg BID starting dose with subsequent up titrations depending on safety and efficacy.

 This dosing approach for anemic MF patients will be systematically studied in this prospective multicenter phase II open label single arm trial to determine if the levels of spleen length reduction and symptom improvement are consistent with those reported in previous clinical trials with ruxolitinib in patients with anemia and doses according to platelet counts at the moment of treatment initiation, and whether this lower starting dose and up titration approach may minimize the initial hemoglobin and platelet declines and transfusion requirements.
