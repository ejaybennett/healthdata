(secondQuint)Hybrid Catheter Ablation for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation.

 Epicardial (EPI) catheter approach is considered as an accessory to endocardial (ENDO) ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation (PeAF).

 We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of EPI ablation as first option to the patients who had previous endocardial ablation for PeAF.

 This is prospective randomized controlled, single center study.

 study population is recurred AF patient with failed previous ENDO catheter ablation for PeAF.

 The investigators randomized study population to both groups: Hybrid group (EpI + ENDO ablation) versus control group (conventional ENDO ablation).

 Clinical outcome (Freedom from AF/Atrial tachycardia) and procedural safety will be compared.
