(thirdQuint)A Comparison of Visualization Between Shamrock Technique and Paramedian Transverse Scan in Lumbar Plexus Blockade.

 Background: Ultrasound-guided lumbar plexus block (USG LPB) is regarded as a form of advanced ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (USGRA).

 One of the key challenges of USG LPB is visualization of the lumbar plexus.

 That are currently in use for ultrasound-guided lumbar plexus blockade - paramedian transverse scan (PMTS) and shamrock technique.

 Method: Twenty-three healthy adult volunteers aged 18 years were enrolled in this prospective cohort study.

 Ultrasound visualization results were compared between methods.

The primary objective of this study was to compare ultrasound visibility of the lumbar plexus at the intertransverse space between paramedian transverse scan and shamrock technique.

 Moreover obtaining a clear image of relevant structures is imperative.

 Thus, the secondary objective was to assess ultrasound visibility of each relevant structure and overall visibility between these two methods.
