(fifthQuint)Parent eReferral to Tobacco Quitline.

 This is a randomized controlled study of electronic quitline referral compared to standard practice.

 Parent enrollment in the quitline will be reported to the study team by the state tobacco quitline, managed by the Pennsylvania Department of Health.

 This is a single site study at one large outpatient pediatric practice.

 Eligible study participants are parents/caregivers (hereafter referred to as "parents"), 18 years of age or older, who are present for the child's healthcare (both well-child and acute) visit, who smoke, and who are interested in receiving treatment through the tobacco quitline.

 The intervention is electronic referral to the tobacco quitline for parent smokers.

 The referral process will be embedded in a tobacco treatment clinical decision support (CDS) tool, created to help pediatricians provide counseling and treatment to parent smokers.

 The primary outcome of interest is smoker enrollment in the quitline, defined as the proportion of parent smokers identified in the clinic that enroll in quitline treatment compared across the intervention (electronic referral) and control (standard practice) approaches.

 Secondary outcomes include patient and parent demographic and behavioral factors associated with successful enrollment.

Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is a significant public health problem in that it both harms children and is widely prevalent, affecting more than 40% of US children.

 Tobacco cessation quitlines are effective in helping smokers quit, but few smokers make use of their services.

 Electronic health record-based systems that automate referral of interested parents to quitlines through pediatric settings may increase the proportion of smokers who successfully enroll in treatment.
