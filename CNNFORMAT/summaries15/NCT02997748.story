(thirdQuint)Remote Ischemic Preconditioning After Cardiac Surgery.

 Acute kidney injury (AKI) complicates 7-19% of cardiac surgical procedures.

 The investigators recently found that remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) using transient external compression of the upper arm prior to cardiac surgery was effective for reducing the occurrence of AKI (37.

5% compared to 52.

5% with sham; absolute risk reduction (ARR),15%; 95% CI, 2.

 Fewer patients treated with RIPC received renal replacement therapy (RRT) (5.

 Moreover, the investigators found that the effectiveness of this intervention was strongly associated with the release of cell-cycle arrest biomarkers into the urine.

 Patients with urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 ([TIMP-2] cent [IGFBP7]) 0.

5 (ng/ml)(ng/ml)/1000 before surgery had a significantly reduced rate of AKI compared to patients with lower urinary [TIMP-2] cent [IGFBP7] concentration (relative risk (RR), 67%; 95% CI, 53% to 83%, P cent [IGFBP7] to 0.

5, and only in this group was the intervention effective-patients that did not achieve this level showed no benefit.

 Our goal is to eventually design and conduct a Bayesian 2-stage adaptive design sequence trial to evaluate the effectiveness of RIPC to prevent AKI in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

 The dimensions of dose include duration, intensity and number of cycles.

 However, before this trial can be designed we need to answer 4 questions: i.

 Do baseline urinary [TIMP-2] cent [IGFBP7] levels predict AKI (enrichment)? ii.

 Do [TIMP-2] cent [IGFBP7] changes elicited by RIPC predict protection (RIPC efficacy measure)? iii.

 Is there a dose-response relationship between RIPC "dose" and [TIMP-2] cent [IGFBP7]? iv.

 Is a dose-escalation RIPC protocol where doses are increased for non-responders, feasible and safe within the anesthesia workflow for cardiac surgery cases (practical)?.

 Remote Ischemic Preconditioning After Cardiac Surgery@highlight

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a well-recognized complication after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

 The aim of this study is to reduce the incidence of AKI by implementing remote ischemic preconditioning and to evaluate the dose-response relationship using the biomarkers urinary [TIMP-2] *[IGFBP7] in high risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
