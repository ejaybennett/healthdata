(fifthQuint)Insulin Degludec for the Management of Patient With Recurrent Diabetic Ketoacidosis.

 Hypothesis: Use of a longer-lasting basal insulin (degludec) in patients with recurrent Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) will reduce the rate of recurrent DKA and improve adherence to daily administration in patients who have had 2 or more episode of DKA in the past 2 years.

 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients admitted with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) to Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) who have a prior episode of DKA within 2 years will be offered enrollment in a prospective, randomized unblinded trial to determine whether long acting insulin degludec will reduce the rate of recurrent DKA and improve compliance over the period of 1 year when compared with the control group who will stay on their pre-study long acting insulin (glargine or detemir).

 Primary Outcomes: To determine the difference in rate of recurrent Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) over 6 months and 12 months in participants who have a history of previous DKA and medication adherence between groups treated with degludec vs other long-acting insulins (glargine or detemir).

 Secondary outcomes: BG control (Hba1c during study period) tested q 3 months Discharge long-acting insulin dose compared to admission dose LOS for DKA admission Number of readmissions in one year Number of ER visits Hypoglycemia -self reported, documented by glucometer or ER visit for severe hypoglycemia Adherence to study regimen from phone call information and clinic visits Inclusion criteria: Patients age >18 year with previous diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus and previous admission for DKA in any facility within the prior 2 years who meet the criteria for DKA at the time of admission and are willing to participate in the study protocol will be enrolled in the study.

 DKA is defined as: 1.

 Serum bicarbonate below 18 mg/dl 2.

 Anion Gap over greater than or equal to 16 3.

 Serum ketones or beta hydroxybutyrate elevation > 3 mmol/L 4.

 Serum glucose greater than or equal to 250 mg/dl Exclusion Criteria: Patients with no previous DKA, patients who are not willing to consent to participate in the study protocol for 1 year, pregnant women, dementia, and end stage renal disease on dialysis.

 Study Protocol: Investigators will obtain informed consent and enroll participants admitted to the Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) in this study from Jan 2016 until investigators have adequate enrollment.

 Investigators will collect the initial data as following: 1.

 Age, sex, height, weight, BMI 2.

 Age at diagnosis of diabetes 3.

 Number previous DKA admissions in past 2 years, lifetime (even if the admission was to other hospitals) 4.

 Preadmission insulin dosing - long acting 5.

 Reason for DKA 6.

 Alcohol, drug use, homelessness, mental illness 7.

 Admission labs - HCO3, AG, BOHB, glucose, creatinine 8.

 Length of stay with each DKA episode( LOS) The participants will be randomly assign to the intervention or control groups.

 Intervention Group: Discharge on once a day degludec insulin by pen (supplied by Novo) at dose 0.

3 U/kg with reduction to 0.

2 U/kg for GFR 2 test to assess relationship between the primary outcome and some of the binary nature secondary measures.

 Stratification will be used for analysis as needed.

 In that case, chi-square tests for overall and within relevant stratifications will be conducted.

 To assess the difference between continuous variables (such as hemoglobin A1C, bicarbonate, anion gap, Creatinine etc.

), t-test will be used for normally distributed data.

 Otherwise Mann-Whitney U test will be used.

 P-values at 95 % CI will be reported.

 Since it is a superiority trial, we will use one-tail test for significance.

 Insulin Degludec for the Management of Patient With Recurrent Diabetic Ketoacidosis@highlight

Given the longer half life of insulin degludec compared to glargine /levemir ,investigators believe that insulin degludec will reduce the rate of recurrent DKA.

 The investigator will randomize participants to control and intervention group.

 Control group will receive Lantus/Levemir and intervention group will receive degludec.

 The investigators will call participants monthly and see them in the clinic every three months.

The investigators will follow them for 1 year and evaluate if there will be a difference in rate of DKA in between these two groups.
