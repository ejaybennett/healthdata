(thirdQuint)VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, or T-cell Lymphoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the safety profile of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS.

 II.

 To estimate clinical response rate in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma overall and by disease type.

 III.

 To estimate progression-free and overall survival in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma overall and by disease type.

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination, and the biodistribution of virally infected cells at various times points after infection with VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS using planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging.

 II.

 To assess virus replication, viremia, viral shedding in urine and respiratory secretions, and virus persistence after systemic administration of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS.

 III.

 To characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS by way of measuring serum interferon-beta and also vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-real time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS.

 IV.

 Assess CD8+ T cell (both general and VSV-IFNbeta-NIS specific) and natural killer (NK) cell responses.

 V.

 Gene expression analysis pre- and post-virotherapy.

 VI.

 Assess presence of VSV in tumor and normal tissues subsequent to administration of intravenous (IV) VSV-IFNbeta-NIS.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

 Patients receive VSV-IFNbeta-NIS intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, and then undergo SPECT/CT 3-5 days later.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days, and then every 3 months for up to 1 year.

 VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, or T-cell Lymphoma@highlight

This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus carrying the human NIS and IFN beta genes (VSV-hIFNbeta-sodium iodide symporter [NIS]) in treating patients with multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma that has come back or does not respond to treatment.

 A virus, called VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS, which has been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill cancer cells without damaging normal cells.
