(fifthQuint)CD19 CAR T Cells in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CD19 Positive B-cell Lymphoma.

 In this single-center, open-label, nonrandomized, no control, prospective clinical trial, a total of 10 relapsed or refractory CD19+ B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) patients will be enrolled.

 CD19 CAR T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express anti-CD19 scFv TCR:4-1BB, will be administered by i.

v.

 injection in a three-day split-dose regimen: 10% on day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on day 2.

 Side effects of CD19 CAR T cells therapy will be monitored.

 The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of CD19 CAR T cells therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19 positive B-cell lymphoma.
