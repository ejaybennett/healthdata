(thirdQuint)Postpartum Opioid Prescribing Patterns and Patient Utilization.

 Opiate abuse is a national epidemic and has paralleled the increase in opioid prescriptions, with diversion of surplus medication playing a key contributing role.

 As the majority of reproductive age women in the U.

S.

 will experience childbirth, understanding opioid prescription patterns and patient opioid utilization in the postpartum period is critical.

 Postpartum women will be recruited during a 9-month period to take part in pre-hospital discharge and 2-4 week postpartum surveys to prospectively assess opioid medication use with regard to quantity of opioid tablets prescribed and quantity used, storage and disposal of unused opioids and satisfaction with pain control.

 Postpartum Opioid Prescribing Patterns and Patient Utilization@highlight

This study seeks to investigate the prescribing patterns and patient utilization of opioid pain medication in the postpartum setting.

 Postpartum women will be surveyed prior to hospital discharge and again at 2-4 weeks postpartum in order to assess the number of opioid tablets they used (in relation to the number prescribed), pain satisfaction, and storage/disposal of any remaining opioid tablets.
