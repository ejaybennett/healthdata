2 MR Perfusion and Diffusion@highlight

The objective of this study is to compare the diagnostic value of MR DSC-Perfusion (Perfusion Module), MR DWI (Diffusion Module) and MR DTI (Diffusion Module) in CARESTREAM Vue PACS ("investigational device") to the Olea Sphere PACS with Perfusion and DWI Modules ("predicate device").

 Therefore, there will be several separate objectives depending on the type of acquisition:
