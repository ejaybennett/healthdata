(thirdQuint)Nivolumab or Nivolumab/Ipilimumab Prior to Chemoradiation Plus Nivolumab With II/III Gastro/Esophageal Cancer.

 This is a Phase IB study assessing the safety of 2 cycles of induction (Arm A) nivolumab or (Arm B) 1 cycle of induction nivolumab plus ipilimumab prior to concurrent chemoradiation plus nivolumab before surgical resection in operable stage II/III esophageal/gastroesophageal junction cancer.

 Approximately 32 patients will be enrolled on study with 16 enrolled on Arm A and if no unexpected toxicities then an additional 16 patients will be enrolled on Arm B.

Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) or Anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) administration in the pre-operative setting and nivolumab combined with chemoradiation will be safe and feasible in patients with resectable distal esophageal/gastroesophageal junction cancer and will change cellular and molecular characteristics of the tumor microenvironment that will improve survival.
