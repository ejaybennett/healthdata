(fifthQuint)Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound in Predicting Treatment Response in Patients With Liver Cancer Receiving Transarterial Chemoembolization With Drug Eluting Beads.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate if contrast-enhanced ultrasound of hepatocellular carcinomas at one to two weeks and one month correlate with the clinical evaluation standard of a contrast-enhanced MRI at one month (the current clinical standard) in patients who have undergone transarterial chemoembolization with drug eluting beads.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Establish whether changes in quantitative blood flow parameters relative to baseline correlate with effective embolization.

 Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound in Predicting Treatment Response in Patients With Liver Cancer Receiving Transarterial Chemoembolization With Drug Eluting Beads@highlight

This pilot clinical trial compares the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound to contrast-enhanced magnetic response imaging (MRI), the current clinical standard, in predicting treatment response in patients with liver cancer receiving transarterial chemoembolization with drug eluting beads.

 Comparing results of diagnostic procedures before and after transarterial chemoembolization may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

 It is not yet known if contrast-enhanced ultrasound works better than contrast-enhanced MRI in predicting treatment response in patients with liver cancer.
