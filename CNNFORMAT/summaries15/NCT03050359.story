(firstQuint)Comparison of TAK-438 (Vonoprazan) to Lansoprazole in the Treatment of Duodenal Ulcer Participants With or Without Helicobacter Pylori Infection.

 The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-438.

 TAK-438 is being tested to treat people who have duodenal ulcers and also may or may not have Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection.

 This study will look at duodenal ulcer healing and also the elimination of HP in people who take TAK-438 versus lansoprazole.

 The study will enroll approximately 770 patients.

 Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - TAK-438 20 mg - Lansoprazole 30 mg HP+ participants will be asked to take a TAK- 438 tablet and a lansoprazole capsule twice daily in conjunction with bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for 2 weeks, followed up by a TAK-438 tablet and a lansoprazole capsule once daily for up to 6 weeks.

 HP negative (HP-) participants will be asked to take a TAK-438 tablet and a lansoprazole capsule once daily for up to 6 weeks.

 This multi-center trial will be conducted China, Korea, Taiwan and Philippines.

 The overall time to participate in this study is up to 10 weeks.

 Participants will make multiple visits plus final visit at 2 weeks or 4 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
