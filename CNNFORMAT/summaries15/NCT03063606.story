(thirdQuint)Behavioral and Pharmacologic Treatment of Binge Eating and Obesity: Specialist Treatment.

 Binge eating disorder (BED), the most prevalent formal eating disorder, is associated strongly with obesity and bio-psychosocial impairment.

 Improved treatments for patients with obesity and BED are needed that can produce sustained clinical outcomes and promote weight loss.

 This study (specialist treatment) RCT will provide new and novel findings from a controlled test, amongst non-responders to acute treatments, whether cognitive-behavioral therapy augments on-going blinded pharmacotherapy (naltrexone/bupropion or placebo) compared with on-going pharmacotherapy alone (without added cognitive-behavioral therapy).
