(fifthQuint)Rotational Thromboelastometry for the Transfusion Management of Postpartum Hemorrhage After Vaginal or Cesarean Delivery.

 Postpartum hemorrhage is increasing in incidence in the United States, renewing interest in targeted approaches to transfusion during cesarean delivery.

 ROTEM-based transfusion for PPH has been advocated as a mechanism to lower overall requirement of blood components transfused and lower the incidence of transfusion-associated pulmonary morbidity in a small study of women undergoing cesarean delivery.

 However, larger-scale randomized evaluation of this transfusion approach is warranted for women who experience hemorrhage after vaginal or cesarean delivery.

 A lower serum fibrinogen level (< 200 mg/dL) at the onset of PPH has a positive predictive value of 100% for progression to severe PPH.

 However, serum fibrinogen testing has a turnaround time of one hour and is therefore not useful for acute management of PPH.

 ROTEM provides point-of-care results that have been validated as surrogate markers for serum fibrinogen, within 10 minutes.

 However, whether ROTEM data alters empiric management of acute PPH is unknown.

 A comparison of transfusion management decisions and costs incurred for transfused products and transfusion-related morbidity (duration of hospitalization, intensive care unit, respiratory complications) will be performed.

 Rotational Thromboelastometry for the Transfusion Management of Postpartum Hemorrhage After Vaginal or Cesarean Delivery@highlight

The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM(R))-based transfusion protocol during postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) after vaginal or cesarean delivery.

 Maternal transfusion requirement, quantitative blood loss (QBL), need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and length of hospital stay will be evaluated.

 The utilization of ROTEM(R) for transfusion management will identify patients who develop early coagulation changes such as hypofibrinogenemia or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

 Our hypothesis is that earlier identification and directed therapy of such coagulation changes will lower overall transfusion requirement (packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, fibrinogen concentrate, cryoprecipitate, or other product), reduce the need for ICU admission, and shorten length of hospital stay.

 A cost analysis will be performed.
