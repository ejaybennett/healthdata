(thirdQuint)MILD Percutaneous Image-Guided Lumbar Decompression: A Medicare Claims Study.

 Using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) Medicare Research Identifiable Files (RIFs) containing all medical claims for 100% of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare fee-for-service program, claims-based patient history and demographics will be combined with longitudinal analyses.

 In this study, the control group will include all patients receiving interspinous process decompression (IPD) for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) with neurogenic claudication (NC).

 The treatment group will include all patients receiving MILD during the enrollment period.

 The date of the MILD and IPD procedure will serve as the index procedure date for 24-month follow-up.

 This study is exempt from IRB oversight (Department of Health and Human Services regulations 45 CFR 46).
