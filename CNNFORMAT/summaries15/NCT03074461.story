(firstQuint)Transverse Coloplasty vs.

 Side-to-end Anastomosis Following Low Anterior Resection (LAR): CSAR Trial.

 This study directly compares two neorectal reservoir-techniques, the transverse coloplasty and the side-to-end anastomosis, in low anterior resection in distal rectal cancer for the first time.

 Its focus is on the functional results.

 Besides stool frequency, the quality of life, safety of the procedures and the usage of stool modulating drugs is monitored in an 12 months-follow up regime.
