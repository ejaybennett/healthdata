(fifthQuint)Adrenergic System in Islet Transplantation.

 This study is designed to test the hypothesis that -adrenergic (neural) blockade will abolish insulin-mediated suppression of C-peptide, attenuating -cell glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia, and that -adrenergic (hormonal) blockade will have no effect.

 Glucose counterregulatory responses will be measured during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic-hypoglycemic clamps on three occasions with randomized, double-blind administration of the -adrenergic blocker phentolamine, the -adrenergic blocker propranolol, or placebo.

 The demonstration of neural rather than hormonal regulation of the transplanted islet cell response to hypoglycemia is critical for understanding the mechanism for protection from hypoglycemia afforded by intrahepatically transplanted islets.

 Glucose counterregulation has not been studied in type 1 diabetic recipients of extrahepatic islet transplantation.

 Comparison of glucose counterregulatory responses measured during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic-hypoglycemic clamps will be compared to those obtained from type 1 diabetic recipients of intrahepatic islet transplantation studied under the placebo condition above.

 Glucose counterregulation has not been directly compared between recipients of intrahepatic auto- and allo-islet transplantation.

 Direct comparison of glucose counterregulatory responses under the same experimental conditions is required to understand whether mechanisms other than the glucagon response may be important to the reported hypoglycemia affecting pancreatectomized recipients of islet auto-transplantation.

To determine the effect of sympathetic neural and hormonal (epinephrine) input on islet cell hormonal responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetic recipients of intrahepatic islet transplantation.

 We hypothesize that -adrenergic (neural) blockage will abolish insulin-mediated suppression of C-peptide, attenuating -cell glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia, and that -adrenergic (hormonal) blockage will have no effect.
