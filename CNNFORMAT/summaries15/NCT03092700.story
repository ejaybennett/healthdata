(fifthQuint)Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Dyspnoea and Emotional Cognition in COPD.

 The aim of the study will be to evaluate the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on dyspnoea emotional component and on emotional cognition.

 It will add a better understanding of the mechanisms of pulmonary rehabilitation on dyspnoea.

 Patients with COPD will be included before starting a pulmonary rehabilitation and be evaluated with questionnaires (including the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile, and quality of life questionnaires), emotional cognition (at rest and right after an endurance test, using some short movies sequences and pictures of faces expressing some well defined emotions) and smile production analysis.

 After having followed a pulmonary rehabilitation, the same evaluation will be realised and results will be compared before and after the intervention.
