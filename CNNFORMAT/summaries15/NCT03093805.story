(thirdQuint)Topical Vitamin D in Acute Graft Versus Host Disease of the Skin.

 Acute skin GVHD affects about one third of pediatric and adult transplant recipients.

 Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) affects 40-60% of adult patients who have undergone allogeneic HSCT.

 It is a major cause of non-relapse mortality and morbidity.

 Systemic prednisone is the first-line treatment for cGVHD; however, about one-half of all patients do not respond to this initial therapy, and there is no standard second-line therapy.

 Immunosuppressive therapy used for treatment of GVHD brings significant risk of infection, poorly affecting clinical outcomes.

 Vitamin D affects immunoregulation, fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis and endothelial cell function, and the investigators hypothesize that topical vitamin D application will have a positive effect on acute and chronic skin GVHD.

 The investigators hypothesize that topical vitamin D cream may restore normal cell function and decrease the use of steroid creams in acute GVHD of the skin.

 Topical Vitamin D in Acute Graft Versus Host Disease of the Skin@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Calcipotriene cream.

 This is a synthetic vitamin D3 derivative for topical use.

 It is used to treat grade 1-3 acute skin graft versus host disease (GVHD) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.

 Calcipotriene will be used as the exclusive topical therapy in addition to standard of care GVHD treatment prescribed for the study subject by the primary physician.
