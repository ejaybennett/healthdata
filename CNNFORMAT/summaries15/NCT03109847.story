(secondQuint)Metformin Hydrochloride in Mitigating Side Effects of Radioactive Iodine Treatment in Patients With Differentiated Thyroid Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine if treatment with metformin hydrochloride (metformin) inhibits radioactive iodine (RAI)-induced myelosuppression and induces faster recovery of white blood cell count to baseline values, the blood counts will be compared in the pre- and post-treatment samples.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess safety and tolerability of metformin treatment in subjects undergoing RAI treatment for differentiated thyroid cancer.

 II.

 To determine the effect of metformin treatment on symptoms of xerostomia, xerophthalmia and dysgeusia as assessed by the Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ), the modified Vanderbilt Head and Neck Cancer Symposium Survey (version 2.

0), University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTCQLQ)-Head and Neck (H&N)35.

 Metformin Hydrochloride in Mitigating Side Effects of Radioactive Iodine Treatment in Patients With Differentiated Thyroid Cancer@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies how will metformin hydrochloride works in mitigating the side effects of radioactive iodine treatment in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.

 Metformin hydrochloride may reduce the metabolic activity of cancer cell and of surrounding supportive tissues.
