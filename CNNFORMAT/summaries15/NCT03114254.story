(secondQuint)A Trial of Cabazitaxel Chemotherapy in Relapsed Locally Advanced &/or Metastatic Carcinoma of the Penis.

 First line treatment of penile cancer often combines Docetaxel, Cisplatin and 5Fluouracil (5FU) and there is currently no United Kingdom standard second line agent.

 Carbazitaxel has been shown to kill both taxane resistant and sensitive cells.

 JAVA-P is a phase two, single arm study of the use of carbazitaxel for relapsed, locally advanced or metastatic carcinoma of the penis.

 Seventeen patients will be recruited over two years, with adverse events and progression free survival being assessed.

 Results may indicate the need for larger studies to evaluate carbazitaxel as a first line agent.

 A Trial of Cabazitaxel Chemotherapy in Relapsed Locally Advanced &/or Metastatic Carcinoma of the Penis@highlight

An evaluation of the activity of cabazitaxel chemotherapy in relapsed cancer of the penis.

 Safety and tolerability will be monitored and survival will be assessed.

 It is hypothesised that cabazitaxel is useful in increasing progression free survival in relapsed penile cancer.
