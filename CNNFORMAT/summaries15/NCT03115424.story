(fifthQuint)Effect of GLP-1 Receptor Agonism After Sleeve Gastrectomy.

 A total of 75, non diabetic adults, scheduled for bariatric surgery at Mayo Clinic Rochester, will be enrolled.

 Of these, 25 will be scheduled for Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery (RYGB), while the remainder (50) will be scheduled for Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG).

 The study team will play no role in assignment of the surgical procedure.

 Following surgery, at month 3, subjects undergoing SG will be randomized to either Saxenda or placebo, subcutaneously once daily.

 Subjects randomized to Saxenda or placebo will take for the duration of the study (33 months).

 Follow up study visits for all subjects will be timed to coincide with the standard clinical follow up visits at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36.

 Effect of GLP-1 Receptor Agonism After Sleeve Gastrectomy@highlight

Observational studies suggest that bariatric surgery is the most effective intervention for weight loss.

 Comparative effectiveness of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) demonstrate that RYGB is significantly superior to SG in terms of weight loss and glycemic control.

 Both RYGB and SG increase GLP-1 concentrations which directly affect B-cell function.

 Data has shown that the postprandial rise in GLP-1 might affect feeding behavior after RYGB and to a lesser extent SG, where the increase in GLP-1 is less marked.

 In this study the investigators propose to randomize subjects undergoing SG to receive either placebo or Liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, to compare weight loss and CV risk factors.
