(firstQuint)Assessing Fitting Guides in Alcon Multifocal Contact Lenses.

 Randomization for this study will be implemented in 2 parts.

 First, each site will be randomized to a fitting guide (current or alternative) and will fit all subjects at their site using the assigned fitting guide.

 Second, subjects who currently wear monthly/weekly contact lenses will be randomized to either AIR OPTIX AQUA(R) Multifocal (AOA MF) or DAILIES(R) AquaComfort Plus(R) Multifocal (DACP MF) contact lenses.

 Subjects who currently wear daily disposable contact lenses will be fitted with DAILIES TOTAL1(R) Multifocal (DT1 MF) contact lenses.
