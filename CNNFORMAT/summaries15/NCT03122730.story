(thirdQuint)VentaProst Versus Conventionally-Administered Aerosolized Epoprostenol in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery With CPB.

 Part I: This part of the study is designed to demonstrate the dose equivalence between off-label aerosolized epoprostenol and VentaProst using a patient's hemodynamic parameters.

 Part II: This part of the study is designed to establish a dose response relationship of VentaProst to hemodynamic effect by dose escalation in patients who have had cardiac surgery with CPB.

The purpose of the Phase 2a study is to: 1) demonstrate that the estimated VentaProst dose is safe and equivalent in effect to a dose administered via epoprostenol aerosolization by the current off-label-use practice; and 2) demonstrate that an optimum effect can be rapidly obtained with VentaProst titration.
