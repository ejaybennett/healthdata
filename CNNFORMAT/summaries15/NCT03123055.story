(thirdQuint)A Study of B-701 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Treatment of Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cell Carcinoma.

 This is a Phase 1b/2 multi-center, open-label study to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of B-701 plus pembrolizumab in the treatment of subjects with locally advanced or metastatic UCC, who have progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy and who have not received prior immune checkpoint inhibitor or FGFR inhibitor-targeted therapy.

 The study consists of 2 parts: a Phase 1b lead-in phase enrolling 6 to 18 subjects and a Phase 2 dose expansion phase enrolling up to a total of 74 subjects.

 Subjects who discontinue B-701 may continue on study and receive pembrolizumab alone until disease progression, death, withdrawal of patient consent, or study termination.
