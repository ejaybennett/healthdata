(firstQuint)Establishing a Controlled Human Hookworm Infection Model at Leiden University Medical Center.

 Four volunteers will be exposed to 50 Necator americanus L3 larvae.

 Volunteers will be followed on a weekly basis until week 12 after infection.

 If volunteers develop a patent infection, defined by detectable egg production in stool by microscopy at any timepoint within week 9 to 12, they will be scheduled to donate faeces on request.

 Two years after infection or if volunteers do not excrete eggs detectable by microscopy on week 9 to 12, volunteers will be treated with a 3-day regimen of albendazole to abrogate the infection.

 Retreatment with albendazole will be given to volunteers who remain positive for hookworm after treatment.

 Six months after the treatment, volunteers will undergo their last visit.

Four healthy hookworm-naive volunteers will be exposed to 50 L3 Necator americanus larvae once and will retain infection for up to 2 years.
