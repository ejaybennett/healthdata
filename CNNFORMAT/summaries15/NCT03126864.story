(fifthQuint)Study of Adoptive Cellular Therapy Using Autologous T Cells Transduced With Lentivirus to Express a CD33 Specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CD33-Positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 Leukapheresis: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have T-cells collected from your blood.

 This will be done by a procedure called leukapheresis.

 For the leukapheresis procedure, you will visit the Apheresis Clinic at MD Anderson and will need to stay seated in a chair and keep both arms still for about 3 hours.

 During this process, your blood will flow into the machine and then directly back into your bloodstream through the second line.

 Blood will be drawn from 1 arm through a catheter (needle and tube) connected to the leukapheresis machine.

 Inside the machine, the white blood cells will be separated from the rest of the blood cells and collected in a sterile bag.

 Then, the rest of the blood cells will be returned through a catheter to your other arm.

 A blood thinner called citrate will be added to the blood as it enters the machine in order to lower the risk of your blood clotting in the machine.

 Your white blood cell sample will be sent to a lab so the genetically-changed T-cells can be grown in the lab.

 It will take up to about 4 weeks to change and grow enough CD33-CAR-T.

 If researchers cannot create enough T-cells for you in the lab, you may have more blood collected or you will be taken off study.

 This will be discussed with you.

 You may have other treatment for AML while you wait for CD33-CAR-T to be made.

 Study Groups: You will be assigned a dose level of genetically changed T-cells based on when you join the study.

 Up to 3 dose levels of T-cells will be tested and up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level.

 The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level.

 Each new group will receive a higher dose than the one before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.

 This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of T-cells is found.

 Pediatric patients and adult patients will be enrolled separately.

 This means that there will be up to 3 dose levels of up to 6 participants tested in pediatric patients and up to 3 dose levels of up to 6 participants tested in adult patients.

 Study Drug Administration: The days before you receive your T-cells will be referred to as negative days, the day you receive your T-cells is Day 0, and the days after you receive your T-cells will be positive days.

 Chemotherapy: On Days -5 through -3, you will receive fludarabine and on Day -3 you will receive cyclophosphamide.

 Both drugs will be given by vein over about 30 minutes each.

 This chemotherapy is not given to treat cancer.

 The purpose of this chemotherapy is to prepare your bone marrow and immune system to receive CD33-CAR-T cells.

 CD33-CAR-T Infusion(s): Before your infusion of CD33-CAR-T, you will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects.

 You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

 You will receive CD33-CAR-T in the hospital by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 0.

 During the infusion, your vital signs (including your temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate) will be measured every 15 minutes for the first hour, then every 30 minutes for the second hour, and then about 1 hour after that.

 After your CD33-CAR-T infusion, you will stay at the hospital for at least 7 days so you can be checked for any side effects.

 Length of Study: You will receive 1 infusion of CD33-CAR-T.

 You will not be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 You may withdraw from the study at any time; however it is not possible to withdraw from the T cell therapy after it has been given.

 After you receive your cell infusion, the cells cannot be taken back.

 Your active participation on this study will be over after Month 12.

 Study Visits: Up to 7 days before you receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 8 tablespoons ) will be drawn for routine tests and to learn how your immune system responds after receiving the T-cell infusion.

 This routine blood draw will include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.

 - You will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the disease.

 On Day 0: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 8 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to learn how your immune system responds after receiving the T-cell infusion.

 This routine blood draw will include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.

 - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for a replication competent lentivirus (RCL) test.

 This is a test to learn if you already have the type of virus in your blood that will be used to genetically change your cells.

 This test will be repeated throughout the study to make sure the virus used to genetically modify your cells does not start to grow.

 On Days 0-6, during your hospital stay after the T-cell infusion, the following tests and procedures will be performed at least 1 time each day or more often if the study doctor thinks that it is needed: You will have a physical exam.

 vBlood (about 8 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to learn how your immune system is responding to the T-cell infusion.

 On Day 7, at Weeks 2, 4, and 8, and at Months 3, 6, and 12: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (up to 10 tablespoons, depending on the visit) will be drawn for an RCL test, routine tests, and to learn how your immune system responds after receiving the T-cell infusion.

 At Month 6, part of this blood sample will be used for antibody testing.

 - You will have either a bone marrow aspirate or a bone marrow biopsy to check the status of the disease.

 You will not have this procedure on Day 7.

 Long-Term Follow-Up: For safety reasons, the FDA requires researchers to follow up with patients who receive infusions of stem cells treated with a gene transfer procedure for up to 15 years in order to understand any long term effects of the treatment.

 After you have received an infusion of the T-cells, you will be asked to sign a separate consent form for a long-term follow-up study named "Long-Term Follow-Up Study of Recipients of Gene Transfer Research Protocols" (Protocol 2006-0676).

 This is an investigational study.

 CD33-CAR-T is not FDA approved or commercially available.

 It is currently being used for research purposes only.

 The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

 Up to 39 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.

 Study of Adoptive Cellular Therapy Using Autologous T Cells Transduced With Lentivirus to Express a CD33 Specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CD33-Positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety and tolerability of 3 different doses of CD33-CAR-T cells (referred to throughout the consent as "T-cells") in patients who have CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that is relapsed (has come back) or refractory (has not responded to treatment).

 CD33-CAR-T is made by genetically modifying (changing) your T-cells (a type of white blood cell).

 T-cells are genetically changed to help target leukemia cells.
