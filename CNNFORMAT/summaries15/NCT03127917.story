(firstQuint)Effect of L-Citrulline on Vascular Function.

 This project employed a placebo controlled, double-blind, crossover trial.

 Participants were randomized to oral L-citrulline (6 g/day) or placebo (maltodextrin) for 14 days, and switched to the other treatment for another 14 days after washout.

 Peripheral vascular function was assessed under conditions of rest, leg exercise, and cognitive engagement.

 Gait performance was assessed using clinical walking tests.
