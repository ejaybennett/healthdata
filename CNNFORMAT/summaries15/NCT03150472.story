(fifthQuint)Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of the Ivory Dentin Graft Device.

 Device Description - Investigational Medicinal Product Ivory Dentin Graft is a bone graft material for the repair or augmentation of bone defects in dental procedures.

 It consists of sterile 300 - 1200 1/2m porous particles of hydroxyapatite which retain the natural form of the source porcine dentin.

 Ivory Dentin Graft is intended to be used as a bone graft material for the repair or augmentation of bone defects in dental procedures.

 OsteoBiol Gen Os.

 - Comparator control device A natural replicate of autologous bone, Gen-Os(R) conserves the same intimate structures (matrix and porous form) and presents a highly osteoconductive properties.

 Gen-Os(R) is gradually resorbable and provides support in bone neoformation helping to preserve the original graft shape and volume.

 Study Design The Ivory Dentin Graft study is a prospective, randomized, semi double blinded with blinded assessments study comparing patients grafted with Ivory Dentin Graft (study arm) and patients grafted with OsteoBiol Gen Os (control arm) for alveolar ridge preservation following tooth extraction.

 Study Population and Justification A total of 44 adult patients in 2 study groups scheduled to undergo at least one dental implant placement of mandibular premolar or molar are planned to be enrolled.

 The patients will be randomized into two treatment groups: One group is to be grafted with Ivory Dentin Graft while the second group will be grafted with OsteoBiol Gen Os, randomization ratio of 1:1 between the experimental and control group.

 Sample size Justification and Statistical Analysis Plan The rationale for sample size calculation is based on demonstrating non-inferiority in the study primary endpoint between the tested and the reference treatment groups.

 The calculations assume a difference of up to 30% between the treatments, which will be considered equivalent (non-inferiority).

 In a sample of 15 patients, a difference of up to 0.

30 (30%) in the proportion of responders between the treatment groups will be considered equivalent with 5% significance level and 80% statistical power.

 Assuming expected dropout rate of ~30%, 44 patients (22 per group) will be recruited in order to ensure final sample size of 30 study completers (15 per group).

 When the sample size in each group is 15 (total study population of 30 subjects), a two-group large-sample normal approximation test of proportions with a one-sided 0.

05 significance level will have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the test and the standard are not equivalent (the difference in proportions, paiT - pai, is 0.

30 or farther from zero in the same direction) in favour of the alternative hypothesis that the proportions in the two groups are equivalent, assuming that the expected difference in proportions is -0.

15 and the proportion in the standard group is 0.

50.

 The data will be analysed using the SAS (R) (SAS Institute, Cary North Carolina).

 Handling of Participant Withdrawals A patient discontinuing the study before grafting of Ivory Dentin Graft (Visit 2) can be replaced, at the discretion of the investigator, by another consenting patient.

 The discontinuing patient will be followed for safety.

 Each case of premature withdrawal will be properly recorded in the Screening Failure Log as deemed necessary.

 Patient Screening Prior to any study-related screening procedure, delegated study team members will approach potentially eligible adult patients who are waiting to be scheduled for tooth extraction and grafting for necessary titanium implant placement.

 Those who may be eligible will be offered the choice of undergoing screening to potentially enroll in the study.

 Patients who do not meet inclusion criteria or who are for any other reason determined to be unsuitable for inclusion in the study, or who decline to participate in the study, will be considered and recorded as "screening failure" and receive standard and appropriate treatment.

 Informed Consent The informed consent document will be signed and dated for screening and enrollment and each patient consenting will be documented in the patient medical binder.

 The patient will be given a copy of the consent form together with the study doctor's letter at the time of enrollment.

 The clinician will ask the patient about his plans and his willingness to attend all scheduled follow-up visits.

 Randomization will be done by Castor EDC web-software.

 The patients will be randomized into two treatment groups: One group is to be grafted with Ivory Dentin Graft while the second group will be grafted with OsteoBiol Gen Os, randomization ratio of 1:1 between the experimental and control group.

 TRIAL PROCEDURES After informed consent is obtained, a case record form including all aspects listed below will be recorded.

 Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and be treated according to standard treatment protocols for tooth extraction, grafting, implant placement, dental biopsy and dental radiographic procedures and with the standard protocol for local anesthetic.

 Visit 1: Screening and Enrolment, as part of pre-operative visit (2-4 weeks before grafting procedure ) The following assessments will be performed: Demographics, Medical history, Vital signs, Current medications, Physical examination.

 A CT scan will be performed prior to visit 2 in order to verify patient eligibility and graft procedure preparation Visit 2: Randomization and extraction socket graft filling by Ivory Dentin Graft or Gen Os after tooth extraction.

 The designated randomization groups (Ivory Dentin Group and Gen Os) will be: 1.

 Recorded in the patient CRF 2.

 Recorded (soft copy or hard copy) on the patient Dental CT- this will be used as source to verify correct grafting site.

 All patients will be operated by study delegated physicians using the same method).

 Socket debridement and cleaning: After exposure of the defect the sounding walls should be debrided by surgical curette and all granulation tissue removed.

 The extraction site will be graft filled either using Ivory Dentin Graft or OsteoBiol Gen-Os according to the respective Instructions for Use using either vial or syringe applicators with or without dental membrane.

 Only the graft performing sub-investigator and the study coordinator will be un-blinded to the patient allocation.

 All efforts and measures would be taken by the study team to keep the patient and blinded assessors blinded of allocation- semi double blinded study.

 Periapical x-ray imaging will be performed on each enrolled patient once completing the graft filling in order to validate the bone grafting procedure.

 The following assessments will be performed following the procedure: 1.

 Extraction socket grafting Physician usability Form 2.

 Study Patient Discharge form.

 Patients will be monitored for short-term follow-up (1 and 4 months following their extraction socket grafting procedure) and for long-term follow-up and will be evaluated for their medical and dental conditions.

 Implantation of titanium implants will be conducted 4 months following the grafting procedure at grafted site of each enrolled patient.

 Short-term Visit 3: Follow up 1 month following grafting procedure The patient will be asked to report any dental complication- all will be investigated by the sub-investigator using Visit 3 safety Follow Up Form.

 Periapical x-ray imaging will be performed In addition, the following assessments will be conducted by study investigator: - Physical examination - Vital signs A Computerized Tomography (CT) will be performed prior to visit 4 Visit 4: Follow up 4 months following grafting procedure and dental Implant placement (Short-term Termination visit) Prior to the procedure, the patient will be asked to report any dental complication.

 The following assessments will be conducted prior to device removal/ replacement by balloon gastrostomy: 1.

 Physical examination 2.

 Vital Signs d) Implant placement Physician usability Form e) Study Patient Discharge form.

 f) Short-term termination visit The alveolar bone strength (torque measurement) will be measured by torque measurement.

 Adequacy of bone graft (need for additional grafting at implant placement) will be evaluated by the study investigator based on the clinical examination, torque measurement and CT scan, and will be specified and justified in the Case Report Form.

 Patients will be monitored also for long-term follow-up (6 and 10 months, 2.

5 and 5 years following their extraction socket grafting procedure) and will be evaluated by the study nurse for their medical and dental conditions.

 Un-scheduled visit: The study investigator will instruct the patient to immediately contact the study team in case of: Implant failure, loose graft particles, loss of grafting material, graft site infection, insufficient healing of graft site, excessive bleeding and wound dehiscence.

 The patient must call the study nurse to schedule an un-scheduled visit which may only be performed by the principal Investigator.

 Data Monitoring and Quality Control The investigator, through an appointed Clinical Research Associate (CRA), will be responsible for implementing and maintaining quality assurance and quality control systems with written Standard Of Procedures to ensure that trials are conducted and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirement(s), including ISO 14155:2011.

 The investigator will be responsible for ensuring direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the hospital, and inspection by Israeli regulatory authorities.
