(fifthQuint)CD3/CD19 Depleted or CD3 Depleted/CD56 Selected Haploidentical Donor Natural Killer (NK) Cell Based Therapy for AML Patients Not in CR.

 This trial uses a Simon's two-stage design to estimate the complete remission rate at day +42 post NK cell infusion.

 The trial includes an initial randomized sub- study of 24 patients during stage 1 to choose which of the enriched NK cell products (CD3-/CD19- versus CD3-/CD56+) should be used to complete the trial based on successful in vivo NK cell expansion.

 This parameter is defined as 40% donor DNA and 40% of lymphocytes are NK cells at day 7 post infusion OR 20% donor DNA and 20% of lymphocytes are NK cells at day 14 post infusion.

 Twelve patients will be randomized to each product.

 Enrollment Plan: Stage 1: Enroll 24 patients with 1:1 randomization for NK cell processing (CD3-/CD19- versus CD3-/CD56+) Stage 2: Enroll an additional 17 patients using the optimal NK cell product identified during stage 1.

 If neither product achieves success at the end of stage 1, the study will stop and the platform redesigned.

 CD3/CD19 Depleted or CD3 Depleted/CD56 Selected Haploidentical Donor Natural Killer (NK) Cell Based Therapy for AML Patients Not in CR@highlight

This is a phase II trial designed to test the safety and efficacy (complete response [CR]) of related donor HLA-haploidentical NK-cell based therapy for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

 Patients with newly diagnosed AML who failed to achieve a complete remission (CR) after one or two standard induction attempts receive after a preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine a single infusion of CD3-/CD19- NK cells or CD3-/CD56+ NK cells followed by a short course of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) to facilitate NK cell survival and expansion.
