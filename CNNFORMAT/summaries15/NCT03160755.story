(fifthQuint)Motivation-Audit-Positive Psychology Intervention Study.

 This qualitative interview study will focus on the development of a novel positive psychology (PP) and motivational interviewing (MI) intervention that is adapted for patients with MetS.

 For this phase, participants will be primary care patients recruited through Massachusetts General Hospital's research opt-in program (Research Options Direct to You [RODY]).

 We will complete phone interviews with patients (n=20) with MetS within two weeks of enrollment in the study.

 In this project, we hope to do the following: 1.

 Identify, through qualitative research, deficits in positive emotional states in primary care patients with MetS.

 2.

 Examine potential links between positive emotional deficits and impaired health behaviors (low physical activity, unhealthy dietary patterns), as well as links between positive emotional states and successful health behaviors.

 3.

 Identify other barriers to health behavior completion, such as social support and neighborhood resources.

 4.

 Explore strategies to enhance positive emotional states in MetS patients and inquire about the utility of potential PP exercises in these patients.

 5.

 Ask participants for feedback about intervention delivery preferences (e.

g.

, session length, time of day, duration of intervention).

 6.

 Develop a preliminary PP-MI based group intervention using the above information.

 Motivation-Audit-Positive Psychology Intervention Study@highlight

Specific Aim #1: To identify, through qualitative research, deficits in positive emotional states (e.

g.

, positive affect, optimism) and associated barriers to completing health behaviors, like physical activity and healthy eating, in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS).

 Hypothesis: Participants will be able to complete semi-structured interviews, providing information about their positive emotional states, linking the presence of positive emotions to better adherence to health-related behaviors, and identifying additional barriers (e.

g.

, logistic, motivational) to completing such behaviors.
