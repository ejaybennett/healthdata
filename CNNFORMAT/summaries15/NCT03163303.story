(thirdQuint)Smoking Tobacco and Drinking Study.

 Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: (1) a Facebook-delivered intervention addressing tobacco use and heavy episodic drinking, tailored to readiness to quit smoking; or (2) a 3-month Facebook intervention targeting tobacco use.

 Both interventions will include 12 weeks of Facebook-based messages and activities tailored to participants' readiness to quit smoking.

 Assessments will occur at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up.

 Assessments will include measures on smoking and drinking patterns and thoughts about abstinence.

 All participants who report no past 7-day smoking will be asked to give biochemical verification of smoking status with saliva cotinine test kits that will be mailed to participants.
