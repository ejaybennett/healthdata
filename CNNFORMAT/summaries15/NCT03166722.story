(thirdQuint)Cerebral Regional Tissue Oxygen Saturation to Guide Oxygen Delivery in Preterm Neonates During Immediate Transition.

 Background The transition to life after birth is a complex physiological process where the neonate has to establish sufficient ventilation and changes from intra-uterine circulation to extra-uterine circulation take place.

 During these processes the neonate has to provide the brain with adequate perfusion and oxygen delivery to maintain normal cerebral tissue oxygenation and activity.

 If hypoxia and bradycardia both common events during immediate transition in preterm neonates occur, cerebral hypoxia-ischaemia may cause perinatal brain injury that is the major causes of mortality and long term neurodevelopmental impairment.

 Objectives The primary objective of the COSGOD Phase III trial is to examine, if it is possible to increase survival without cerebral injury in preterm neonates test (alpha: 0.

05, power: 80%).

 Intervention The premature infants will be randomised into experimental or control group.

 Both groups will have a near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device (left frontal), pulse-oximeter (right wrist) and electrocardiogram placed within three minutes after birth.

 In the study group, the cerebral tissue saturation, SpO2 and HR readings are visible, and the infant will be treated accordingly using a defined treatment guideline.

 In the control group, only SpO2 and HR will be visible, and the infant will be treated according routine treatment.

 Duration of intervention Monitoring will be started within 3 minutes after birth and the intervention will last during immediate transition period and resuscitation up to 15 minutes after birth.

 Follow up Thereafter, each neonate will be followed up for primary outcome to term date or discharge.

 Outcome measures The primary outcome is mortality and/or cerebral injury defined as any intraventricular bleeding and/or cystic periventricular leucomalacia.

 The secondary outcomes are neonatal morbidities.

The aim of the COSGOD Phase III trial is to examine, if it is possible to increase survival without cerebral injury in preterm neonates <32 weeks of gestation by monitoring the cerebral tissue oxygen saturation in addition to routine monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation and heart rate and specified clinical treatment guidelines during immediate transition period after birth (the first 15 minutes).
