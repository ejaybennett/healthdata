(firstQuint)Virtual Reality for Anxiety Management in Mechanically Vented Patients.

 Mechanically ventilated patients (those on a breathing machine) often experience heightened levels of anxiety and discomfort.

 This is usually treated by using sedative medications, however these drugs often have unintended side effects.

 This study will investigate the safety and feasibility of using relaxing virtual reality environments for reduction of anxiety in mechanically ventilated patients.
