(firstQuint)Clinical Study of the Medeon Biodesign XPro.

 This is a prospective multi-center, single arm study to assess the safety and performance of the XPro System compared to a historical control developed from published studies of two marketed competitive devices, Perclose ProGlide(R) and Prostar(R) XL (both from Abbott Vascular, Inc.

, Redwood City, CA, USA).

 The goal of the study is to show that XPro System is non-inferior to the competitors in efficacy and safety.

 Patients scheduled for percutaneous BAV, TAVR/TAVI, EVAR, or TEVAR procedures using an 8-18 Fr introducer sheath will be screened for study eligibility.

 Patients will be followed for 30 days post procedure.
