(fifthQuint)Volatile Organic Compounds as Markers of Acute Rejection in Lung Transplant.

 Prospective single-center study.

 A single visit, no follow-up.

 The visit will take place before or within five days from date of transbronchial biopsies (BTB).

 It will include a noninvasive collection of exhaled breath for VOC analysis.

 VOC analysis will be conducted using two types of devices: "electronic nose" and mass spectrometry.

 120 bi-lung transplanted patients will be enrolled and divided into two groups.

 - Group A, Acute rejection: 60 patients.

 Diagnosis of acute rejection retained on transbronchial biopsies or functional anomalies with the necessity of modifying the immunosuppressive regimen.

 - Group B, control: 60 patients.

 Patients without respiratory functional abnormality and normal transbronchial biopsy.

 VOC, detected by electronic nose and identified by mass spectrometry, will be compared between patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute rejection (group A) and patients without rejection (control group B) The duration of participation of each patient is 1 day.

 The duration of the inclusion period is estimated at 12 months from the first inclusion.

 The expected total duration of the research is 12 months.

 Volatile Organic Compounds as Markers of Acute Rejection in Lung Transplant@highlight

The aim of research is to identify markers of acute rejection by VOC analysis in exhaled breath of bilateral-lung transplanted patients.

 120 bi-lung transplanted patients will be divided into two groups : patients with acute rejection diagnosed on transbronchial biopsies and patients with no acute rejection.

 Exhaled breath will be collected for VOC analysis woth electronic nose and mass spectrometry.

 VOC profiles will be compared between the two groups of patients.
