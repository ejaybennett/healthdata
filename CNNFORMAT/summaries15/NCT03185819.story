(thirdQuint)Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 3 Fixed Doses of Intranasal Esketamine in Addition to Comprehensive Standard of Care for the Rapid Reduction of the Symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder, Including Suicidal Ideation, in Pediatric Participants Assessed to be at Imminent Risk for Suicide.

 This study will enroll participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) presenting with suicidal ideation who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide.

 The study will be conducted in 4 phases: a screening evaluation performed within 48 hours prior to Day 1 intranasal dose; a 25-day double-blind treatment phase (Days 1-25); an 8-week initial post-treatment phase (Days 25-81); and a subsequent phase to complete a full 6-month post-treatment follow-up (Days 81-200).

 Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, biomarker, and pharmacogenomic evaluations will be performed in the study at defined schedule.

 The duration of the participant's participation will be approximately 29 weeks.

The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a single (first) dose of 3 fixed doses of intranasal esketamine {28 milligram (mg), 56 mg, and 84 mg} compared with psychoactive placebo (oral midazolam) in rapidly reducing the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) including suicidal ideation in participants 12 to less than 18 years of age who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide.
