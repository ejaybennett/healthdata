.

 In this study pregnant women with a history of bariatric surgery, normal weight and obese pregnant women were invited to participate.

 Between the 24th and the 28th week of pregnancy an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), as well as an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was conducted.

 Three to six months after delivery the examinations were repeated.

 In addition the ectopic lipid content in the liver, heart and the muscle was measured with 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging three to six months post partum.

 The aim of this study was to compare the glucose metabolism during pregnancy between the three groups as well as to investigate the changes three to six months after delivery.
