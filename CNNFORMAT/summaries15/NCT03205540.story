(thirdQuint)Epidural Analgesia vs Adductor Canal Block in Bilateral TKA.

 Continuous epidural analgesia is effective postoperative pain control but it has some limitations in patients with hypotension, concurrent anticoagulants, technical difficulty, urinary retention.

 Adductor canal block is less invasive than continuous epidural analgesia.

 It provides effective analgesia for total knee arthroplasty and preserves quadriceps muscle strength.

 Epidural Analgesia vs Adductor Canal Block in Bilateral TKA@highlight

This study evaluates postoperative analgesic efficacy within 48 hours between epidural analgesia and single-shot bilateral adductor canal blocks in bilateral total knee arthroplasty.

 Half of participants will be received continuous epidural analgesia, while other half of participants will be received single-shot bilateral adductor canal blocks.
