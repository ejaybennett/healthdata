(fifthQuint)The Wise App Trial for Improving Health Outcomes in PLWH.

 Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to affect 1.

2 million Americans.

 Achieving viral suppression through adherence to antiretroviral (ART) therapy is a critical determinant of successful transmission prevention and long-term outcomes in HIV-infected patients.

 However only about 25% of persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US are virally suppressed, demonstrating the need for effective interventions that enhance ART adherence.

 mHealth is a tool that has proven useful in supporting behavior change, but most mHealth tools for PLWH have not been well-developed or evaluated.

 Given the dearth of useful and likeable apps, the need for improving medication adherence in PLWH, and the great promise of mHealth, the investigators propose to build and test a user-centered smartphone app linked to a smart pill box targeting ART adherence in PLWH.

 Self-report of medication adherence is often criticized since it typically overestimated adherence especially in unmasked trials.

 Current adherence assessments, such as patient recall, pill counts and pharmacy refill data, typically detect missed doses long after they occur.

 This study will use real-time, wireless monitoring strategies via the Wisepill dispenser, for measuring ART adherence.

 The Wise App Trial for Improving Health Outcomes in PLWH@highlight

The overall goal of this study is to design a user-centered design app linked to a smart pill box for people living with HIV (PLWH) and evaluate its effects in a randomized controlled trial.

 The proposed trial is scientifically significant in representing a principled and systematic effort to test the efficacy of a smartphone intervention linked to a smart pill box for antiretroviral (ART) adherence in PLWH in the United States (US).

 Guided by a strong theoretical framework building on earlier user-centered design work and integrating a real-time monitoring device, this work has the potential to improve ART adherence in PLWH and have a sustainable public health impact.
