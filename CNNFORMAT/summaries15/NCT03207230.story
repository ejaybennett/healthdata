(firstQuint)Multicenter Exploratory Study of Accelerometry in Dilated Cardiomyopathy.

 The study will evaluate the daily physical activity with the use of activity monitor, heart rate monitor and event monitor in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).

 These wearables track the heart rate, heart rhythm, tracks activity and step count.

 The VO2 peak will be measured via the exercise test.
