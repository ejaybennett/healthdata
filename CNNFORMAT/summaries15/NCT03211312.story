(thirdQuint)The Predictive Scoring Systems of Older People With Cardiac Diseases Undergoing Teeth Extraction Surgery.

 This study intends to investigate the relevant risk factors of perioperative complications or mortality in older patients with cardiac diseases undergoing teeth extraction surgery and this study aims to quantify the risk factors and then to establish the predictive scoring systems.

 We hope that the benefits will include less patients becoming seriously postoperative complications and mortality after teeth extraction surgery.

We also hope the information will help doctors understand the preoperative risks better and therefore make better informed decisions.

This may also reduce the overall cost of surgery for patients and hospitals.
