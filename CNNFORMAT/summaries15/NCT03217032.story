(thirdQuint)Gene Modified Stem Cells for Hemophelia A and B.

 Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are genetic bleeding disorders caused by the lack of ability to produce blood-clotting factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX), respectively.

 Individuals with hemophilia A or B suffer repeated bleeding episodes, which can cause chronic joint disease and sometimes even death due to the inability for blood to clot efficiently.

 The current treatment is intravenous infusion of clotting factor concentrates, either prophylactically or in response to bleeding.

 The procedure is life time long and expensive while still cannot achieve a cure of the disease from the source.

 Gene therapy is a novel medical technology that has been successfully demonstrated in a number of clinical studies for diseases such as cancer and genetic diseases.

 In this study, an advanced lentiviral vector system will be used to deliver a normal gene for human clotting FVIII or FIX into patients with hemophilia A or hemophilia B.

 This study is a Phase I/II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy for IV infusion of gene modified autologous hematopoeitic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells in patients with hemophilia A or hemophilia B.
