(thirdQuint)Treatment of Acute Pericarditis With Anakinra.

 Acute pericarditis is a clinical syndrome characterized by a profound inflammation of the membrane tissue that surrounds, supports and protects the heart.

 Acute pericarditis can be caused by a variety of infectious and non-infectious agents, but it most commonly either follows a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract or has no apparent cause.

 Acute pericarditis occurs rather abruptly in previously healthy individuals, generally a child or young adult.

 Most cases of acute pericarditis resolve within a few days with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

 However, patients experience severe chest pain and are at high risk for life-threatening complications involving the pericardium, such as pericardial tamponade.

 Acute pericarditis is diagnosed in 1 in 20 (5%) ED visits for chest pain.

 Anakinra (Kineret) has been shown to treat and cure refractory and recurrent pericarditis.

 This study is aimed at determining whether anakinra is also effective as first line treatment in acute pericarditis.
