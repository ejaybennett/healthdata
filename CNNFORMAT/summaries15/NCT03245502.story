(thirdQuint)The Effect of Blood Transfusion on Venoarterial PCO2 Difference in Cardiac Surgery.

 Preoperative creatinine values, demographic data, comorbidities will be recorded in ASA I-II elective coronary artery and valvular cardiac surgery patients.

 Intraoperative delta PCO2, lactate, ScVO2 will be recorded in several steps.

 The patients will be divided into two groups as Transfused, and Non-Transfused Groups observationally.

 The trend of delta CO2, lactate, ScVO2, postoperative creatinine values, postoperative complications and 28 days mortality will be compared.

 The Effect of Blood Transfusion on Venoarterial PCO2 Difference in Cardiac Surgery@highlight

Venoarterial CO2 difference(delta PCO2), lactate, central venous oxygen saturation(ScVO2) will be recorded in several steps in coronary artery bypass graft and valvular cardiac operations.

 The patients will be divided into two groups as Transfused, and Non-Transfused Groups observationally.

 The trend of delta CO2, lactate, ScVO2, postoperative creatinine values, postoperative complications and 28 days mortality will be compared.
