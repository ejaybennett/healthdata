(secondQuint)Neadjuvant Multi-agent Chemotherapy or Letrozole Plus Ribociclib in Luminal B/HER2-negative Breast Cancer.

.

 This is a parallel, two-arm, randomized 1:1, stratified by tumor size and nodal involvement, open-label, multicenter, exploratory study in postmenopausal women with primary operable HR+/HER2-negative Luminal B breast cancer according to PAM50 intrinsic subtype to evaluate the clinical benefit and biological effects of ribociclib combined with letrozole.

 The primary trial objective is to explore the clinical benefit of ribociclib plus letrozole versus chemotherapy.

 Luminal B patients will be randomized 1:1 to either letrozole plus ribociclib or chemotherapy.

Two weeks after the first administration of the assigned treatment, patients will undergo a biopsy to assess early biological response to treatment, at Ki67 protein and gene expression level.

 After finalization of the assigned neoadjuvant treatment, patients will undergo surgery.

 The primary endpoint, Residual Cancer Burden, will be centrally assessed.

 Baseline, Day 15 and post-treatment (surgical) primary breast tumor tissue samples should be available for each patient for molecular characterization A post-surgery visit will be performed within 28 days (7 days) from surgery, and will mark the end of the study for that patient.

CORALLEEN is a two-arm, randomized, multicentric study in postmenopausal women with primary HR+/HER2 negative Luminal B breast cancer that will explore if the combination of ribociclib with letrozole offers clinical benefit at least comparable to that of standard chemotherapy.
