(thirdQuint)sPLA2 in EBC During Acute Chest Syndrome.

 The purpose of this research study is to test the ease and effectiveness of collecting exhaled breath condensate (liquid) to measure levels of a biomarker, secretory phospholipases A2 (sPLA2) in people with sickle cell disease during an attack of acute chest syndrome.

 sPLA2 levels have been reported to be much higher in persons with acute chest syndrome and might be useful to diagnose and to evaluate the effects of therapy.

 Serial monitoring of plasma sPLA2 levels might lead to earlier or more accurate detection of acute chest syndrome and monitoring of its progression or improvement in patients with sickle cell disease.

 However, there is a significant inherent risk of frequent blood collection further dropping the blood (hemoglobin) levels of an already anemic patient.

 If sPLA2 can be measured in exhaled breath condensate, this non-invasive and well-tolerated sample collection might allow for serial monitoring of the enzyme without depleting the patient's already diminished blood supply.

 sPLA2 in EBC During Acute Chest Syndrome@highlight

Secretory phosholipases A2 (sPLA2) are significantly elevated in the plasma of sickle cell disease patients with acute chest syndrome (ACS), and similar enzymes have been measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), which is collected easily and non-invasively.

 The investigators hypothesize that sPLA2 will be measurable in EBC samples from sickle cell patients with acute chest syndrome.
