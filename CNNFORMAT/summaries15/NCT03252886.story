(thirdQuint)Videolaryngoscopy During CPR for Trauma Patients.

 Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is considered to be the best method of airway management during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

 However ETI during CPR is a highly skill-dependent procedure, then it should be attempted only highly trained physicians.

 Especially, cervical immobilization by neck collar in truamatic patients is a great obstacle to successful ETI during CPR.

 Because of technical difficulty in using direct laryngoscopy (DL), various types of videolaryngoscopy (VL) devices have been developed to overcome the problems of DL.

 VL may be more useful to perform ETI during CPR for trauma patients with cervical immobilization.

 This study tried to compare the success rate of endotracheal intubation (ETI), speed of ETI, incidence of complications, and chest compression interruptions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation for trauma patients with suspected neck injury between intubators using the DL and the VL in a real clinical setting.

 Videolaryngoscopy During CPR for Trauma Patients@highlight

This is a clinical study based on collected video-clip data of cardiopulmonary resuscitation for patients with suspected neck injury in multiple trauma between 2011 and 2015.

 The study aimed to compare all possible factors relating to ETI performance during CPR for truma patients between experienced video-laryngoscopy and direct- laryngoscopy users.
