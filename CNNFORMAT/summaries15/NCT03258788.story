(fifthQuint)A Translational Study Investigating PD-L1 Expression After Radiotherapy for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 The purpose of this prospective, multicentre, non-randomised translational study is to provide proof of feasibility of achieving paired biopsies for PD-L1 assessment in patients with NSCLC treated with palliative or radical radiotherapy.

 This is a non-CTIMP study.

 All participants will have a minimum of 1 mandatory biopsy (during radiotherapy [irradiated site]) and the potential to have a pre-treatment biopsy if archival biopsy does not meet the suitability criteria.

 Participants will have up to a maximum of 2 additional optional biopsies (during radiotherapy [within the RT field e.

g supraclavicular fossa node], [outside RT field e.

g.

 skin met]).

 Blood samples will also be taken on study at specified time points for immune monitoring (exploratory endpoints).

 The study will be carried out in two stages as follows: Stage 1: Following the enrolment of the first 15 evaluable participants, an interim analysis will take place by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC).

 The TSC will make a recommendation on whether recruitment should continue to the Trial Management Group (TMG).

 Stage 2: A further 15 evaluable participants will be recruited onto the study to achieve a total of 30 evaluable participants.

 A Translational Study Investigating PD-L1 Expression After Radiotherapy for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

Participants with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Performance Status (PS) 0-2, not suitable for concurrent Chemo-Radiotherapy (CTRT), will be treated with standard radiotherapy (radical or palliative).

 Archival tumour biopsies will be analysed for baseline Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.

 Some participants will have a biopsy before radiotherapy if the archive biopsy is not suitable.

 Participants will be required to undergo an additional mandatory biopsy of the irradiated site during the second week of radiotherapy.
