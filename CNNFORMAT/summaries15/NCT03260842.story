(firstQuint)Bio-Repository of High Risk Cohorts for the Early Detection of Pancreas Cancer.

 Observational study to collect bio-specimens from 2 separate patient cohorts identified to be at high risk for subsequent development of pancreas cancer.

 1.

 Patients diagnosed with a pancreatic cyst undergoing either endoscopic ultrasound or surgery.

 Bio-specimens collected include pancreatic cyst fluid and blood.

 These will be collected using a standard operating protocol within the NIH Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium.

 2.

 Patients defined as a high risk individual for pancreas cancer by family history and/or known genetic mutations.

 Bio-specimens collected include blood.

 This will be collected using a standard operating protocol within the NIH Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium.
