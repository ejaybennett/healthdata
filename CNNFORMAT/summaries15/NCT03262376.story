(thirdQuint)Minerals and Botanicals for Acute Stress.

 Botanicals in isolation or combined, will be administered with a mineral and vitamin complex to moderately stressed, healthy adults in a parallel groups fashion in this randomised placebo controlled trial.

 Oscillatory brain activity (EEG) during rest and performance on cognitive tasks of attention will be examined after treatment intake under conditions of acute laboratory stress.

 The effects of treatments on stress responses (cardiovascular, subjective and cortisol responses) will also be assessed.
