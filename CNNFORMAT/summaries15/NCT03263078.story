(firstQuint)Difference Between Inhalation Anesthesia and Total Intravenous Anesthesia.

 The purpose of this study is to compare the difference between total intravenous anesthesia to inhaled anesthesia in major surgery.

 The investigators will compare the hemodynamic datas which are collected from PiCCO-Technology hemodynamic monitoring and cerebral oxymerty which are collected from INVOS cent Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter.

The investigators hypothesize that total intravenous anesthesia provide more hemodynamic stability, less extravascular lung water index (EVLWI), lower anesthesia cost and fewer postoperative complication.
