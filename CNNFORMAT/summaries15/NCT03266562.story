(fifthQuint)Estrogen Receptor Expression in Breast Cancer - Assessed With Positron Emission Mammography.

 This pilot study will recruit up to 20 patients with newly diagnosed ER+ breast cancer who have recently undergone or are scheduled to undergo a clinically-indicated breast MRI examination and are scheduled for surgical excision of the breast cancer.

 All patients will undergo two PEM studies, one with F-18 FDG and the second with F-18 FES.

 As F-18 FES is not an FDA-approved radiopharmaceutical, this FES study will be performed under an investigator IND cross-referenced to the National Cancer Institute IND 79,005 for F-18 FES.

 A time interval of 6-8 hours will be required between performance of the F-18 FDG study and the F-18 FES study.

 All patients will have the 2 PEM studies within 30 business days of the clinically indicated MRI.

 See Study Schema shown below.

 Subjects must meet the following eligibility criteria: 1.

 Postmenopausal women, as defined by a.

 Lack of menstrual periods for 12 months b.

 For women with prior hysterectomy and age 1% of cells by immunohistochemistry) 3.

 Extent of disease confirmed, or to be confirmed, on a clinical contrast-enhanced breast MRI examination 4.

 Minimum size criteria for index cancer of 10 mm as measured on mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI.

 5.

 Planned surgical excision of the breast cancer at Mayo Clinic, Rochester Study participants will be consented prior to undergoing the PEM studies.

 The order in which the PEM and MRI studies are performed will NOT be randomized, and will be dictated by patient schedule.

 Co-registration of the PEM images from F-18 FDG and F-18 FES will be used to assess the heterogeneity of uptake of the F-18 FES relative to that of F-18 FDG.

 Heterogeneity of ER expression in the tumor will be determined by immunohistochemistry on the pathologic tissue and findings will then be correlated with the ratio of activity in the co-registered images of F-18 FES and F-18 FDG.

 An integrated interpretation of the MRI and PEM images will be performed to match lesions seen on the three scans and will be made available to the ordering physician and surgeon.

 Estrogen Receptor Expression in Breast Cancer - Assessed With Positron Emission Mammography@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to determine the correlation between the distribution of F-18 FES within ER+ breast tumors as seen on Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) images of the breast, and the distribution of cells stained ER+ within the tumor by immunohistochemistry (IHC) measurements at surgical pathology.

 The secondary aim is to determine if the correlation (or lack of) between F-18 FES uptake and F-18 FDG uptake as imaged by PEM, is an accurate representation of the heterogeneity of ER expression in the tumor.
