(secondQuint)PET/CT Imaging of uPAR-expression in Patients With Neuroendocrine Tumors Using 68Ga-NOTA-AE105.

 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 is a radioligand targeting urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), which is a promising imaging biomarker of tumor aggressiveness.

 A total of 120 NET patients will be subjected to a uPAR-PET/CT scan.

 Follow-up will be performed (from the time of the angiogenesis PET/ CT) at 6 months for disease specific survival (DSS) and a 1 year follow-up for PFS and OS.

 The uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 in tumor lesions will be quantified as Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax/SUVmean) and compared with PFS, DSS and OS (dichotomized above/below median SUVmax and analyzed by Kaplan-Meier).

The aim of this non-randomised, prospective study is to investigate the applicability and prognostic value of uPAR PET/CT with the radioligand 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).
