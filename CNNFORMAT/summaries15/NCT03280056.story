(fifthQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Repeated Administrations of NurOwn in ALS Patients.

 Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are potent survival factors for embryonic, neonatal, and adult neurons and are considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS.

 Delivery of multiple NTFs to the immediate environment of afflicted neurons in ALS patients is expected to improve their survival and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms.

 NTF-secreting mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC-NTF cells) are a novel cell-therapeutic approach aimed at effectively delivering NTFs directly to the site of damage in ALS patients.

 Participants meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized and will undergo bone-marrow aspiration.

 MSC of the participants randomized to the treatment group will be induced into MSC-NTF cells.

 Participants will undergo a total of three intrathecal (IT) transplantations with NurOwn(R) (MSC-NTF cells) or matching placebo at three bi-monthly intervals.

 Safety and Efficacy of Repeated Administrations of NurOwn in ALS Patients@highlight

This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated administration of NurOwn(R) (MSC-NTF cells) therapy, which is based on transplantation of autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), which are enriched from the patient's own bone marrow, propagated ex vivo and induced to secrete Neurotrophic factors (NTFs).

 The autologous NurOwn(R) (MSC-NTF cells) are back-transplanted into the patient intrathecally by standard lumbar puncture where neurons and glial cells are expected to take up the neurotrophic factors secreted by the transplanted cells
