(firstQuint)Identification of Biomarkers for Severe Pneumonia.

 First, we will collect serum samples from patients with pneumonia.

 Then we will identify biomarkers differentially expressed between non-severe pneumonia and severe pneumonia.

 We will further evaluate the prognostic value of these markers for pneumonia.

 Identification of Biomarkers for Severe Pneumonia@highlight

To identify the potential serum biomarkers with regard to the severity of pneumonia, and to further evaluate the prognostic value of these markers.
