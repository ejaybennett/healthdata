(thirdQuint)BioheartRapamycin Drug-Eluting Bioresorbable Coronary Stent System Clinical Study.

 This study is a prospective, multicentred randomized controlled trial, planning to enroll 430 subjects and randomize 1:1 to study group and control group.

 All subjects will accepte clinical evaluation at 1 month, 6 month, 9 month and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 year post procedure.

 All subjects will accepte angiographic evaluation at 1 year post procedure, and simutaneously 80 subjects (40 in study group and 40 in control group) will accepted OCT evaluation.

 To assess the efficacy and safety, the primary endpoint will be in segment late luminal loss at 1 year post procedure, the secondary endpoint is neointima coverage percentage of stent strut (%) at 1 year post procedure.
