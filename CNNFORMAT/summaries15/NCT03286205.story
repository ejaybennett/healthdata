(firstQuint)A Randomized Study to Compare the Dosing Schedule of INFeD in Anemic Patients.

.

 The purpose of this study is to establish which dosing schedule of INfed (Iron dextrose) is superior for the treatment of iron deficient anemia.

 The two dosing regimens under review are a low dose weekly or a larger dose given every three weeks.

 The primary research hypothesis is that a superior dosing regimen exists for INfed and can be shown by a 2gm/dl increase in HgB.

 The secondary research hypothesis is that INfed can be given at high dose without an increase in AE and/or SAEs frequency.
