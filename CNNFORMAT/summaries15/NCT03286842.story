(secondQuint)To Study Clinical Effectiveness and Safety of Olaparib Monotherapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients.

.

 The study (LUCY) is a phase IIIb, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness in a real-world setting of olaparib monotherapy in patients with confirmed germline Breast Cancer susceptibility gene (gBRCA1/2) mutations.

 This study will generate additional data to support other olaparib studies, which may help inform and guide clinical practice.

 Physician defined progression-free survival is the primary outcome measure.

 Overall Survival will also be assessed and the data will be statistically compared with that from an observational study to analyze the comparative life prolongation attributed to olaparib therapy in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2-ve), gBRCA1/2 mutation-positive metastatic breast cancer.

 Based on the prevalence of gBRCA1/2 mutations, it is estimated that up to 2500 patients may require screening in order to identify 250 patients.

 Patients will be administered two olaparib 150mg tablets in morning and evening of every day after a light meal.

 Dose reductions may be required for olaparib treatment related toxicities.

 Patients should continue to receive study treatment until documented physician-defined disease progression as assessed by the Investigator or unacceptable toxicity, or for as long as they do not meet any other discontinuation criteria.

 A positive benefit/risk profile is expected and no ethical issues are identified from exposing patients to olaparib within the planned clinical study.

This open label, multi-centre phase IIIb study will assess the effectiveness, benefits and potential harms in the use of olaparib monotherapy treatment for patients with HER2-ve metastatic breast cancer associated with Germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (gBRCA1/2) mutations.
