(secondQuint)Therapeutic Effect Of Luteolin Natural Extract Versus Its Nanoparticles On Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Line.

 This study is conducted to examine whether luteolin and nano-luteolin exert an inhibitory effect on tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line by inducing apoptosis, and to assess if nano-luteolin has more efficient apoptotic activity than luteolin on tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line.

 The primary outcome is apoptosis, while the secondary outcome is cell viability.
