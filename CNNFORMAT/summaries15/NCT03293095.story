(firstQuint)Functional Task Kinematic in Musculoskeletal Pathology.

.

 Musculoskeletal pathologies can affect bones, muscles, joints and other structures related to this system.

 These disorders are extremely common and can have an origin from autoimmune, inflammatory, traumatic, etc.

 The risk of developing this pathologies increases with age.

 The diagnosis could delayed by lack of information, expensive assessment or difficult execution.

 Currently, you can use a Smartphone to get the same information as sensors.

 In addition to Smartphone, 3D motion capture systems with a camera have been frequently used to analyse kinematics and are being integrated as a rehabilitation tool in patients.

 The use of Smartphones and 3D motion capture cameras would help to find fast and cheap assessment methods for professionals.

 Functional Task Kinematic in Musculoskeletal Pathology.

@highlight

The aim of this project is to create references values to patients with musculoskeletal pathology using functional tasks and measuring with a smartphone and video imaging (3D motion capture cameras).
