(fifthQuint)Effects of Diaphragm Muscle Therapy on Pain and Shoulder Movement in Subjects With Rotator Cuff Injuries.

 This study is a randomised controlled trial evaluating clinical effects of a diaphragm treatment, via manual release or active mobilization, comparing with a standard treatment of shoulder myofascial trigger points release.

 A description of the 3 groups of treatment: 1.

 - Experimental group 1: 3 diaphragm stretching techniques according to Chaitow, Ward and Ricard, performed by a physical therapist are employed in this experimental group during 10 minutes.

 The participants are situated in a seated, supine and side bending position.

 2.

 - Experimental group 2: diaphragm mobilization through active hipopressive gymnastic exercise according to Caufriez in two different postures.

 3.

 - Active comparator group: A ischemic compression technique in most painful myofascial trigger points in the infraespinatus and supraespinatus muscle during one minute each one.

 The shoulder flexion, abduction and external rotation range of motion will be assessed pre and postinterventions, as well as the pressure pain threshold with an algometer and the pain experienced by the individual in shoulder mobility with a Numerical Rating Scale.

 Effects of Diaphragm Muscle Therapy on Pain and Shoulder Movement in Subjects With Rotator Cuff Injuries@highlight

A randomised and controlled trial to people diagnosed with rotator cuff injuries who are divided into 3 groups of treatment: shoulder myofascial trigger points release, manual diaphragm release and diaphragm mobilization through hipopressive gymnastic exercise.

 The pain and range of shoulder movement are assessed before and after the treatment in all the participants.

 Hypothesis of the clinical study: the treatment of diaphragm muscle, via manual release or active mobilization, has impact on rotator cuff injury symptoms comparing with a standard treatment of shoulder myofascial trigger points release.

 Discussion: The relation between shoulder and diaphragm muscle, through innervation (phrenic nerve and brachial plexus), embryology and myofascial connections, could lead to include in clinical practice the examination and treatment of other structures besides shoulder girdle such as diaphragmatic region in rotator cuff injuries.
