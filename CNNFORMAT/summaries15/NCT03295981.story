(thirdQuint)Local Bisphosphonate Effect on Recurrence Rate in Extremity Giant Cell Tumor of Bone.

 The purpose of the clinical study is to investigate whether the local delivery of bisphosphonate (BP-loaded PMMA bone cement) as a surgical adjuvant can decrease the local recurrence rate of giant cell tumor of bone.

 The investigators will evaluate whether bisphonsphonate as a surgical adjuvant improves secondary outcomes, such as pain, function, fever, or wound complications.

 The hypothesis is that the local administration of bisphosphonate will decrease the recurrence rate of GCT compared to traditional aggressive intralesional curettage.

The purpose of the clinical study is to investigate whether the local delivery of bisphosphonate as a surgical adjuvant can decrease the chance of a giant cell tumor of bone coming back to the same location.

 The hypothesis is that the local administration of bisphosphonate will decrease the rate of the tumor returning compared to traditional aggressive surgical removal of the tumor.
