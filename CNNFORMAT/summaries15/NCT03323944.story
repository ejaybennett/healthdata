(thirdQuint)CAR T Cell Immunotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer.

 This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and feasibility of lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells in 3 cohorts with and without cyclophosphamide in a 3+3 dose escalation design.

 The trial will begin in Cohort 1 and progress to Cohorts 2 and 3 chronologically, depending upon dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment.

 Subjects will be enrolled serially, but infusions will be staggered to allow assessment of DLTs for determination of cohort progression, expansion, or dose de-escalation.

 Cohort 1 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^7 /m^2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

 Cohort 2 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^8 /m^2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

 Cohort 3 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^8 /m^2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0, following a flat dose of 1 gram/m^2 of cyclophosphamide administered 2-4 days prior to the huCART-meso cells (day -4 to day -2).

 The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level at which 0 or 1 subject among 6 subjects in one cohort experiences a DLT within the dose range specified.

 CAR T Cell Immunotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer@highlight

This study will evaluate an immunotherapy approach to pancreatic cancer, where patients' own immune cells are engineered to treat their cancer.

 Specifically, the study will determine the safety and feasibility of intravenous administration of transduced huCART-meso cells in patients with histologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with and without cyclophosphamide as lymphodepleting chemotherapy.
