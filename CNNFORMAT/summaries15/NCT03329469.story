(fifthQuint)The Value of CT-FFR Compared to CCTA or CCTA and Stress MPI in Low to Intermediate Risk ED Patients With Toshiba CT-FFR.

 Background: Coronary Computed Tomography Angiogram (CCTA) is a non-invasive imaging modality that has high sensitivity and negative predictive value for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD).

 The main limitations of CCTA are its poor specificity and positive predictive value, as well as its inherent lack of physiologically relevant data on hemodynamic significance of coronary stenosis, a data that is provided either by non-invasive stress tests such as myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) or invasively by measurement of the Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).

 Recent advances in computational fluid dynamic techniques applied to standard CCTA are now emerging as powerful tools for virtual measurement of FFR from CCTA imaging (CT-FFR).

 These techniques correlate well with invasively measured FFR [1-4].

 The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the incremental benefit CT-FFR as compared to CCTA in triaging chest pain patients in ED settings who are found to have obstructive CAD upon CCTA (generally > 30% and = 30% stenosis).

 General Study Design: This will be a prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the incremental benefit of virtual FFR measured from CCTA, compared to invasive FFR and CCTA alone for the detection of flow-limiting coronary stenosis, as defined by invasive FFR =2mm.

 1,142 consecutive patients who present to North Shore University Hospital Emergency Department (ED) for CCTA due to chest pain or angina over a two year period and meeting the study inclusion criteria are eligible for the study (Figure 1).

 The investigators will employ CCTA-appropriateness criteria to ensure proper selection of patients, derived from the Appropriate Use Criteria for Cardiac Computed Tomography published in 2010 and jointly authored by multiple societies including American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT), and American College of Radiology (ACR) [11].

 FFR-CT measurements will be performed following CCTA scan acquisition on software developed by Toshiba America Medical Systems, Inc.

 All eligible patients will undergo 320-slice multi detector CCTA and CT-FFR measurements.

 The severity of the stenosis will be determined on site by level III CCTA readers.

 Patients with borderline (50% - 70%) or positive CCTA (>70%) stenosis readings will undergo ICA with invasive FFR measurement in accordance with accepted guidelines and established practice standard.

 Those patients with invasively measured FFR= 2mm, or those who require revascularizations based on invasively estimated stenosis severity (for patients who are totally obstructed) will be considered to have flow-limiting obstructive CAD, while the rest will be considered to have non-flow limiting obstructive CAD (if also >50% stenosis on ICA).

 If stenosis severity turns out to be 50% obstruction.

 Patients with 0 to 49% obstructive disease and negative CT-FFR will be referred to optimal follow up care only.

 The Value of CT-FFR Compared to CCTA or CCTA and Stress MPI in Low to Intermediate Risk ED Patients With Toshiba CT-FFR@highlight

Coronary Computed Tomography Angiogram (CCTA) is a non-invasive imaging modality that has high sensitivity and negative predictive value for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD).

 The main limitations of CCTA are its poor specificity and positive predictive value, as well as its inherent lack of physiologically relevant data on hemodynamic significance of coronary stenosis, a data that is provided either by non-invasive stress tests such as myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) or invasively by measurement of the Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).

 Recent advances in computational fluid dynamic techniques applied to standard CCTA are now emerging as powerful tools for virtual measurement of FFR from CCTA imaging (CT-FFR).

 These techniques correlate well with invasively measured FFR [1-4].

 The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the incremental benefit CT-FFR as compared to CCTA in triaging chest pain patients in emergency settings who are found to have obstructive CAD upon CCTA (generally >= 30% stenosis).

 Invasive FFR and short term clinical outcomes (90 days) will be correlated with each diagnostic modality in order to evaluate positive and negative predictive value of each.

 Patients will undergo a CCTA, as part of routine emergency care.

 If the patient consents to participate in the study, the CCTA study will be assessed by Toshiba Software, to provide a computerized FFR reading, based on the CCTA study.

 If the noninvasive FFR diagnosis indicates obstructive disease, the patient will undergo cardiac catheterization with invasive FFR.

 As CCTA utilization increases, the need to train additional imaging specialists will increase.

 This study will assess the capability of FFR-CT to enhance performance on both negative and positive predictive value for less experienced readers by providing feedback based on CT-FFR evaluation.

 If the use of CT-FFR improves accuracy of CCTA, as compared to the gold standard, (Invasive FFR), use of CT-FFR can potentially enhance performance for less experienced readers.
