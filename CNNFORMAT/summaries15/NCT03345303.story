(secondQuint)Bortezomib in Intrahepatic Cholangiocellular Carcinoma.

 There's no standard second-line treatment for advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients.

 Previous study indicated high mutation/deletion rate of PTEN gene in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and poor prognosis of those patients with PTEN mutation/deletion.

 The investigators also found that the activity of proteasomes elevated in cholangiocarcinoma cells with PTEN mutation/deletion.

 So the investigators suppose proteasomes inhibitor could improve prognosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients with PTEN mutation/deletion.

 Bortezomib in Intrahepatic Cholangiocellular Carcinoma@highlight

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment of bortezomib in advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients.

Half of participants will receive bortezomib while the other half will receive best supporting care.
