(secondQuint)Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of Dupilumab in Patients 6 Months to <6 Years With Severe Atopic Dermatitis (Liberty AD PRESCHOOL).

 1.

 Part A (open-label, single-ascending-dose, sequential cohort phase 2 study): - Primary objective is to characterize the safety and PK of dupilumab administered as a single dose in pediatric patients, 6 months to less than 6 years of age, with severe AD.

 - Secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and immunogenicity of a single dose of dupilumab in patients 6 months to less than 6 years of age with severe AD 2.

 Part B (randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase 3 study): - Primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of multiple doses of dupilumab over 16 weeks of treatment when administered concomitantly with TCS in pediatric patients, 6 months to less than 6 years of age, with severe AD.

 - Secondary objective is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of multiple doses of dupilumab over 16 weeks of treatment when administered concomitantly with TCS in patients 6 months to less than 6 years of age with severe AD.
