(thirdQuint)Trial Investigating Alvimopan for Enhanced Gastrointestinal Recovery After Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.

 Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a surgical procedure to treat cancer that has spread to the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneal metastases).

 It is associated with a prolonged time for return of bowel function after surgery.

 Alvimopan is a drug used to speed up the time for return of bowel function after surgery.

 It works by blocking the opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, which normally slow down bowel function in patients receiving postoperative opioid pain medication.

 It has not previously been tested in patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of alvimopan to reduce the time to return of bowel function in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

 Half of the participants will receive alvimopan or and half will receive placebo immediately before and for up to seven days after surgery.
