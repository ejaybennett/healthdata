(firstQuint)Human Amniotic Epithelial Cell in Treatment of Refractory Severe Intrauterine Adhesion.

 Asherman's syndrome is an gynecological disorder caused by the destruction of the endometrium due to repeated or aggressive curettages and/or endometritis.

 As a result, there is a loss of functional endometrium in multiple areas and the uterine cavity is obliterated by intrauterine adhesions, which results in amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss.

 Transcervical resection of adhesion (TCRA) is the main treatment for Asherman's syndrome; so far the effect is usually poor in moderate to severe refractory cases.

 Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) are derived from human amniotic epithelium.

 hAECs retain the characteristics approximating to embryonic stem cells.

 Animal experiments have shown that the endometrial thickness and fertility of mice was significantly improved after intrauterine therapy with amniotic epithelial cells.

 To further explore the role of hAECs in Asherman's syndrome patients, this project will evaluate the safety of hAECs and find an effective treatment protocols.
