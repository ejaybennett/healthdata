(secondQuint)A Study of DKN-01 as a Monotherapy or in Combination With Paclitaxel in Patients With Relapsed/ Refractory Endometrioid Endometrial or Endometrioid Ovarian Cancer (P204).

 This study employs a "basket" design to concurrently investigate DKN-01 as monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel in patients with relapsed/refractory endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) or endometrioid ovarian cancer (EOC) (see Study Design for details).

 Thus, 4 distinct patient groups are being independently investigated: 1.

 DKN-01 monotherapy in relapsed/refractory EEC (Group 1) 2.

 DKN-01+paclitaxel in relapsed/refractory EEC (Group 2) 3.

 DKN-01 monotherapy in relapsed/refractory EOC (Group 3) 4.

 DKN-01+paclitaxel in relapsed/refractory EOC (Group 4).
