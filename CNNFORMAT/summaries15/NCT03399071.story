(fifthQuint)Study Title: Peri-operative Immuno-Chemotherapy in Operable Oesophageal and Gastric Cancer.

 Patients will receive chemo-immunotherapy consisting of FLOT chemotherapy (Folinic acid 200mg/m2 iv infusion day 1, Oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 iv infusion day 1, Docetaxel 50mg/m2 iv day 1, Fluorouracil 2600mg/m2 over 24 hours iv) and the PD-L1 inhibiting monoclonal antibody Avelumab.

 The safe dose of Avelumab in combination with FLOT will be established in a safety run-in phase with a standard 3+3 design, starting with the recommended dose of 10mg/kg iv Avelumab (dose level 0) in which a dose reduction to 7mg/kg iv (dose level -1) may occur.

 Four cycles of two-weekly chemo-immunotherapy will be administered before surgery and four further cycles post-operatively in patients who are fit enough to receive further chemo-immunotherapy after surgery.

 Resectional surgery will take place 4-8 weeks following the last dose of chemo-immunotherapy in patients who remain fit.

 Study Objectives: To evaluate the safety, efficacy and toxicities and to explore biomarkers of peri-operative chemo-immunotherapy with Avelumab and FLOT.

 Study Title: Peri-operative Immuno-Chemotherapy in Operable Oesophageal and Gastric Cancer@highlight

A single centre phase II trial of peri-operative chemo-immunotherapy in operable gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma (GOA).

 This trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of administering Avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, with cytotoxic FLOT chemotherapy for patients with operable GOA treated according to a peri-operative protocol.

 This trial is in 2 stages: the first stage will establish the safe and tolerated maximum administered dose (MAD) of Avelumab in combination with FLOT and the second stage will assess the efficacy of this combination therapy in achieving pathological complete response (pCR) and peri-operative safety.
