(fifthQuint)Recurrent Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes (Aim 1).

 The long-term goal of this project is to identify how recurrent hypoglycemia (HG) leads to the clinical syndrome of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) in type 1 diabetes (T1D).

 This study will test the hypothesis that recurrent HG in T1D leads to an upregulation in brain glucose transport and alterations in glutamatergic and GABAergic tone.

 The investigators will use MRS methodology that permits evaluation of cerebral cortex and hypothalamus in the same session to simultaneously evaluate the cerebral correlates/mediators of impaired awareness and impaired counterregulatory hormone responses (CRR).

 High MR data quality and reproducibility will be ensured by using high field MR scanners and technical advances (automated voxel placement, real-time voxel position, frequency, shim updates).

 Continuous glucose monitoring and actigraphy will be used to chronicle glucose variability and activity/exercise/sleep in the weeks before each experiment to assess the impact of these variables on IAH.

 Recurrent Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes (Aim 1)@highlight

This study will explore the cerebral mechanisms of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) in type 1 diabetics following exposure to experimental recurrent hypoglycemia (HG).

 To induce IAH, patients with T1D identified to have normal awareness of hypoglycemia (NAH) will undergo three 2-hour long hypoglycemic clamps.

 Neurochemical profiles will be measured by high field MRS before and after induction of IAH.

 Subject glycemic variability for 2 weeks and activity/sleep for 1 week before each study will be monitored as all factors have been shown to alter responses to HG.
