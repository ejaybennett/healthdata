(thirdQuint)Cisplatin Plus Radiotherapy vs Durvalumab Plus Radiotherapy Followed by Durvalumab vs Durvalumab Plus Radiotherapy Followed by Tremelimumab and Durvalumab in Intermediate Risk HPV-Positive Oropharyngeal SCC.

 This study is looking at whether a type of drug called durvalumab can be used with radiation during the initial treatment, (instead of cisplatin) and also afterwards as additional therapy.

 Durvalumab is an immunotherapy drug .

 It has been tested in many different types of cancers.

 Durvalumab works by allowing the immune system to detect the cancer and reactivate the immune response.

 This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die.

 Durvalumab has been shown to shrink tumours in animals.

 It has been studied in more than 5000 people, approved for use in other cancers and seems promising.

 This clinical trial will also test another type of immunotherapy drug called tremelimumab, which would also be given as additional treatment.

 Tremelimumab works in a different way to durvalumab to enhance the immune system reaction against cancer cells and may improve the effect of durvalumab.

 Tremelimumab may also help slow the growth of the cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die.

 It has been shown to shrink tumours in animals.

 Tremelimumab has been studied in over 1200 people, approved for use in other cancers and seems promising.

Sometimes, cancer patients receive an initial treatment, followed by additional treatment to lower the chance of cancer coming back.

 The standard or usual treatment for this type of disease is initially having radiation therapy at the same time as chemotherapy (with a drug called cisplatin), with no additional therapy afterwards
