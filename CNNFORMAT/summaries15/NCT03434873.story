(secondQuint)Effect of Motor Cortex Versus Sacral Magnetic Stimulation in Multiple Sclerosis Patients With Urinary Tract Dysfunction.

 Twenty Multiple sclerosis patients with lower urinary tract symptoms will be receiving repetitive magnetic stimulation on sacral roots.

 Another twenty Multiple sclerosis patient with lower urinary tract symptoms will be receiving repetitive magnetic stimulation on motor cortex.

 Treatment outcome will be assessed and compared between the two groups.

 Twenty trains of 50 stimuli at 5 Hz (train duration: 10 seconds) separated by a 40-second pause were delivered for a total of 1000 pulses (total duration: 16 minutes) once a day for four consecutive days for two weeks.

 Effect of Motor Cortex Versus Sacral Magnetic Stimulation in Multiple Sclerosis Patients With Urinary Tract Dysfunction@highlight

This work is intended to assess the effect of repetitive magnetic stimulation on the sacral roots versus repetitive magnetic stimulation on motor cortex in multiple sclerosis patients with the lower urinary tract dysfunction.
