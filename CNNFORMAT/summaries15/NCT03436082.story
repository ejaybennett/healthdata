(thirdQuint)Post-Market Surveillance With a Novel mHealth Platform.

 The plan is to pilot test a novel patient-led, smartphone-based mobile health platform (called Hugo) for real-world surveillance of outcomes in 60 total patients after medical device use.

 Research associates will be recruiting patients before they undergo a bariatric surgical procedure (either sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass) and catheter-based atrial fibrillation ablation.

 Patients will then be queried about specific symptoms related to their procedure.

 Patients will also be given syncable devices to use that will provide additional insights into their health and health outcomes.

 This pilot project will engage patients to report outcomes while also synchronizing data from their electronic health records and pharmacy accounts to ascertain the ability of emerging mobile health technologies to aid in post-marketing surveillance.
