(secondQuint)Study Evaluating CMP-001 in Combination With Atezolizumab in Subjects With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b study of CMP-001 administered IT and subcutaneously (SC) in combination with atezolizumab with or without low-level radiation therapy in subjects with advanced NSCLC.

 Each part of the study will follow a Simon 2-stage Optimal Design approach by enrolling 12 subjects in Stage 1 and continuing with enrollment of 23 additional subjects in Stage 2 only if there are at least 2 out of 12 responders (complete and partial responders based on RECIST v1.

1 criteria) in Stage 1.

 A safety run-in of 5 subjects treated with CMP-001 in combination with atezolizumab will be conducted in Part A only.

 After a 30 day dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period, the study will be conducted in two parts, run sequentially: Part A) Study of CMP-001 administered in combination with atezolizumab and; Part B) Study of CMP-001 administered in combination with atezolizumab preceded by low dose radiation therapy.

 If an acceptable safety profile is maintained, Part B of the study will commence after enrollment in Part A has ended, independent of the Part A response rate.

 Number of Subjects (planned): Part A A total of 5 subjects treated with at least one dose of CMP-001 and atezolizumab will be evaluated in the safety run-in period.

 Upon successful completion of the safety run-in period, an additional 7 subjects will be enrolled.

 If an acceptable safety profile is established and at least 2 responders out of 12 evaluable subjects are seen in Part A Stage 1, the study will enroll an additional 23 evaluable subjects in Part A Stage 2.

 A maximum of 35 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in Part A.

 Part B A total of 12 subjects will be enrolled in Part B Stage 1.

 If at least 2 responders out of the 12 evaluable subjects are seen in Part B Stage 1, the study will enroll an additional 23 evaluable subjects in Part B Stage 2.

 If an acceptable safety profile is established and at least 2 responders out of 12 evaluable subjects are seen in Part B Stage 1, the study will enroll an additional 23 evaluable subjects in Part B Stage 2.

 A maximum of 35 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in Part B.

 Total enrollment for the study (Parts A and B) will not exceed 70 subjects.

 Schedule Dosage and mode of administration: This study will evaluate two routes of administration of CMP-001 in combination with atezolizumab, with and without low-level radiation therapy.

 - Part A: CMP-001 will be administered SC once a week for 2 weeks (W1D1 & W2D1), then IT once a week for 3 weeks (W3D1, W4D1, & W5D1), followed by dosing every 3 weeks thereafter until discontinuation of treatment.

 The route of administration (i.

e.

 IT or SC) for CMP-001 beyond Week 5 will be determined by the accessibility of the tumor(s).

 - Part B: CMP-001 will be administered SC once a week for 2 weeks (W1D1 & W2D1), then IT once a week for 3 weeks (W3D1, W4D1, & W5D1), followed by dosing every 3 weeks thereafter until discontinuation of treatment.

 The route of administration (i.

e.

 IT or SC) for CMP-001 beyond Week 5 will be determined by the accessibility of the tumor.

 Part B will include low-level radiation therapy.

 The CMP-001 dose for both routes of administration (SC/IT) will be up to 5 mg.

 Atezolizumab will be administered per the approved label at a schedule of every 3 weeks starting at week 2.

 Duration of Treatment: Subjects will continue treatment with CMP-001 in combination with atezolizumab as long as they do not experience unacceptable toxicities in the opinion of the Investigator and the Investigator believes continued treatment is in the subject's best interest.
