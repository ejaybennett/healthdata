(firstQuint)Repeated Sweet Breakfasts and Subsequent Sweet Food Preferences and Intakes.

 Participants will be randomized to receive either sweet or non-sweet breakfasts for three consecutive weeks, and impacts on food preferences and intakes will be assessed at baseline, after 1 week, and after three weeks.

 Preferences for sweet and non-sweet foods will be assessed during two taste tests at each assessment time, where six different foods will be rated.

 Sweet and non-sweet food consumption will also be measured at two meals at each assessment time - breakfast and lunch.

 Identical buffet meals composed of sweet and non-sweet foods suitable for consumption at breakfast and lunch will be provided ad-libitum.
