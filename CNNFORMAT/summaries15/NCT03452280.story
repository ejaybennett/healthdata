(fifthQuint)Validation of the JADE wRAP, a Novel Blood Pressure Measurement Device, Using the Same Arm Sequential Method.

.

 The purpose of this study is to validate the JADE wRAP cent in adult patients (18 years of age) according to American National Standard, ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2:2013, Non-invasive sphygmomanometers - Part 2: Clinical investigation of automated measurement type.

 The study is intended to be a simple validation of blood pressure parameters only (Systolic and Diastolic).

 This study is not intended to yield any other special information.

 OBJECTIVES 1) To validate the JADE wRAP cent for systolic and diastolic blood pressures compared to the reference standard mercury sphygmomanometer.

 The data collected from this study is for internal purposes only and should assist in further developing the device and supporting platform to a beta stage.

 Validation of the JADE wRAP, a Novel Blood Pressure Measurement Device, Using the Same Arm Sequential Method.

@highlight

The JADE wRAP cent , a wrist worn cuff to measure blood pressure and its supporting software platform is currently at the final alpha prototype stage of development and is not intended for sale.

 There are minimal risks with using the JADE wRAP cent device; however, the likelihood of these risks has been reduced through design limitations on electrical power delivered to the device and of the pressure delivered to the cuff portion.

 Patients should experience little to no discomfort from the inflation of the JADE wRAP cent cuff.
