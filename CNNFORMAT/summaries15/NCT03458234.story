(secondQuint)RAD 1801: Pilot Study of Intra-Urethral Radiotransponder Beacon Guided Focal Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy.

 This study offers focal stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer by using an intra-urethral radiotransponder placed temporarily during each of the 5 radiotherapy treatments.

 The study aims to improve the risk-benefit ratio of therapy for early prostate cancer and potentially lessen symptom burden over time while also accessing early efficacy, late toxicity, and overall quality of life post-treatment.

 Patients will be followed for 24 months (2 years) with follow-up appointments at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.
