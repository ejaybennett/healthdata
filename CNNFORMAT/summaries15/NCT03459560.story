(secondQuint)Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease With Polypill Among Pars Cohort Participants.

 Cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction and stroke) are the most common cause of death and disability in Iran and account for nearly half of all-cause mortality in Iranians.

 Therefore, prevention of cardiovascular diseases is a top priority in countries with limited health system budgets such as Iran.

 Eighty seven to hundred percent of patients dying from Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) have at least one risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

 Therefore, risk factor modification might prevent death and is a main priority.

 Combination drug therapy has been proposed as a cost-effective measure to reduce modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

 It has been showed that combination drug therapy can potentially decrease ischemic heart events and strokes by 88 and 80 percent, respectively.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a fixed dose combination of enalapril, hydrochlorthiazide, atorvastatin and acetylsalicylic acid (PolyPill) on primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Iranian adults older than 50.

 The investigators have previously tested the same combination in a different setting (the PolyIran study).

 The current study enrolls participants of Pars cohort running in Fars province, southern Iran, aged above 50.

 The study is designed as a cluster randomized open-label trial.

 The study comprises two arms as follows: 2500 randomly selected participants receive PolyPill tablets once daily and minimal care (which consists of direct education and pamphlet on cardiovascular risk reduction, biannual follow-ups and BP measurements).

 2500 randomly selected participants receive only minimal care as described above.

 Arms are compared via a 2-armed open-labeled cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.

 Endpoints include major cardiovascular events (death and hospitalization).
