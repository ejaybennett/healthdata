(thirdQuint)3D Printed Models in Mohs Micrographic Surgery.

 1.

 To investigate if patient education with a 3 dimensional printed (3DP) Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) model and standardized script protocol increases patient understanding of MMS more than current standard of care (control group) at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center MMS Clinics.

 2.

 To investigate if patient education with a 3DP MMS model and standardized script protocol decreases perioperative patient anxiety during MMS more than current standard of care (control group) at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center MMS Clinics.

 3.

 To evaluate if patient satisfaction with a 3DP MMS model and standardized script protocol increases patient satisfaction during MMS more than current standard of care (control group) at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center MMS Clinics.

 3D Printed Models in Mohs Micrographic Surgery@highlight

Patients undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery frequently experience anxiety.

 It has been suggested that enhanced patient education prior to the procedure may decrease patient anxiety.

 The purpose of the study is to investigate if optimized patient education enhances patient understanding, decreases patient anxiety and increases patient satisfaction.
