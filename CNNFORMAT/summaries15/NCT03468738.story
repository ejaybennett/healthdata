(secondQuint)Investigation of the Transfusion Practices in Surgical Patients in Turkey.

 Patient Blood Management (PBM) is an evidence based multidisciplinary approach for the care of patients who may need blood transfusion.

 The aim of PBM is achieving better patient outcomes by focusing on the patients' own blood as a source.

 To date PBM is considered "good transfusion practice" and is being implemented in a growing number of countries.

 The Turkish Society of Anesthesiologists PBM Task Force is working on this subject since 4 years and has decided to conduct a benchmark study.

 Before starting a PBM program, the transfusion practices of clinicians working at diverse surgical fields; differences between current transfusion practices and PBM strategies; the areas for improvement and the obstacles that could prevent change should be identified.

 Data collection will also serve to identify the current situation as a reference and to control the achievement of the PBM's aim: improving clinical outcomes.

 The aim of this study is to describe the transfusion practices in patients undergoing major surgery in Turkey.

 The study evaluates i.

 The preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative transfusion rates of RBCs, FFP and platelets.

 ii.

 With which reasons the anesthesiologists decide to transfuse a patient (co morbidities of the patients, physiologic transfusion triggers, hemoglobin trigger, uncontrolled bleeding, on request from surgeon).

 iii.

 The relation of transfusion and the patients co-morbidity index, the P POSSUM score and SORT score; anesthesia methods; monitorisation methods (hemodynamic, coagulation); amount of bleeding; type of surgery; type of hospital.

 iv.

 The relation of transfusion and patient outcomes (unanticipated ICU admission, prolonged ICU stay, acute renal failure, thromboembolic event, ischemic event, acute respiratory distress, infection, all-cause mortality).

 Investigation of the Transfusion Practices in Surgical Patients in Turkey@highlight

The aim of the CeKATU study is to describe the transfusion practices in patients undergoing major surgery in Turkey.

 The transfusion rates of red blood cells (RBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets; the transfusion predictors and transfusion related patient outcomes are investigated.
