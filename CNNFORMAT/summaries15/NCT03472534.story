(firstQuint)A 21-Day Study to Evaluate the Skin Irritation Potential of CCP-020 (Diacerein 1%) Topical Ointment in Healthy Subjects Using a Cumulative Irritant Patch Test Design.

 This is a clinical study in-humans treated with CCP-020 (Diacerein 1%) topical ointment intended to determine the cumulative irritation potential of CCP-020 (Diacerein 1%) topical ointment treatment on normal human skin in healthy volunteers using a cumulative irritancy patch test (CIPT) design.

 Substances that come into contact with human skin need to be evaluated for their propensity to irritate with a reproducible, standardized, quantitative patch evaluation procedure that demonstrates the study material can be applied safely to human skin without significant risk of adverse reactions.

 Cumulative irritancy patch evaluation is a modified primary irritancy test, which can detect irritants that require multiple applications to cause a skin reaction.

 These reactions are due to direct damage to the epidermal cells and no immunologic (allergic) mechanism is involved.

 This procedure may detect so-called "fatiguing substances," which are mild irritants that cause more strongly positive reactions with successive multiple skin exposure.
