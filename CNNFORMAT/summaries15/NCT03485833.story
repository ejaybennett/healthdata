(secondQuint)End-expiratory and End-inspiratory Occlusion Tests to Predict Fluid Responsiveness.

 Patients with hypotension after anesthetic induction for cardiac surgery, who requires fluid resuscitation based on clinical judgement by the anesthesiologists are enrolled in this study.

 Patients are monitored by transesophageal echocardiography and FloTrac/Vigileo.

 Hemodynamic variables (heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean artery pressure, central venous pressure, stroke volume variation, cardiac index, velocity time integral of the aorta etc) are measured at baseline, after end-expiratory occlusion (EEO) test, after end-inspiratory occlusion (EIO) test, after passive legs raising test, and after fluid challenge respectively.

 Responders are defined by an increase in velocity time integral over 15% after infusion of 5ml/kg of crystalloid solution.

 End-expiratory and End-inspiratory Occlusion Tests to Predict Fluid Responsiveness@highlight

The purpose of the study is to verify the efficacy of using end-expiratory and end-inspiratory occlusion tests as an index of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients with cardiac surgery.
