(secondQuint)Using the Non Invasive Technology Magnetic Resonance Elastography for the Diagnosis of Liver Fibrosis Stage.

 Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver have led to improvements in diagnosis of chronic liver diseases.

 Detection and staging of liver fibrosis has become important; however, until about the last decade, it depended on an invasive liver biopsy.

 Liver biopsy is limited by high cost, low patient acceptance, interobserver variability during microscopic evaluation, sampling error, poor reproducibility, and, importantly, an invasive nature with a complication rate of 3% and a mortality rate of 0.

03%.

 With the emergence of elastography techniques, the need for liver biopsy has rapidly diminished for diagnosis of clinically significant liver fibrosis.

 Magnetic Resonance Elastography has gained increasing popularity in recent years, in large part due to its higher technical success and ability to overcome some of the weaknesses of ultrasound-based methods for assessing liver fibrosis.
