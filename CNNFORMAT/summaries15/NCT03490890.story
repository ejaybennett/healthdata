(firstQuint)Microwave Ablation in Ground Glass Nodules.

 GGO was common with the development of image.

 Treatments of GGO include radical surgery and irradiation.

 For patients who were poor candidate of surgery, image guided thermal ablation could be an alternative.

Radiofrequency ablation has been widely applied in the treatment of eary-stage non small cell lung cancer and those patients with GGO.

 However, up to date, no study had explored the microwave ablation in the treatment of GGO.
