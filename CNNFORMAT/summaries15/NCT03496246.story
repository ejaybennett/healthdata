(thirdQuint)Vitamin D Status in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a a chronic, relapsing-remitting systemic disease and it is increasing sharply with rapidly increasing proportion in developing countries.

, and the common medications are not effective for most patients.

The key underlying pathogenic mechanisms for both diseases is a dysregulated host immune response to commensal intestinal flora in genetically susceptible individuals.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, a secosteroid hormone whose active form, calcitriol or 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3 (1,25(OH)2D3) plays important roles in immune regulation, particularly involving the innate immune system, cell differentiation and intercellular adhesion, promotes the production of anti-microbial peptides, including -defensins and cathelicidins, the shift towards Th2 immune responses, and regulates autophagy and epithelial barrier integrity.

The relationship between vitamin D deficiency and IBD is bidirectional that vit D with its immunomodulatory effects influence IBD pathogenesis and activity and IBD itself can lead to vitamin D deficiency.

Vitamin D deficiency has associated with increased IBD activity scores, lower quality-of-life, an increased risk of IBD-related surgery and increased hospitalizations.

[4].

 Vitamin D downregulate powerful proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, which enhance the durability of anti-TNF therapy in IBD and its deficency has been found to be associated with earlier cessation of anti-TNF therapy( loss of response to biologic therapy.

 Vitamin D Status in Inflammatory Bowel Disease@highlight

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a a chronic, relapsing-remitting systemic disease.

 Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone that possesses immunomodulatory properties and has been demonstrated to potentially influence inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis and activity.
