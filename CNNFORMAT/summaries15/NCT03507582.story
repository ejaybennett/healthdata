(fifthQuint)Virtual Reality for Hemophilia.

 Patients with hemophilia A and B (HA/HB) are frequently treated with IV infusions of clotting factor concentrates to treat and prevent bleeding.

 Additionally they typically have at least yearly IV laboratory assessments.

 Pain and anxiety with needle related procedures particularly in children with hemophilia can lead to development of needle phobia, treatment avoidance and poor adherence to treatment regimens.

 Conventional virtual reality (VR) environments have been shown to reduce pain/anxiety in pediatric populations however in a clinical setting children with hemophilia have specific VR design needs that have not been addressed.

 Certain issues related to VR environments are related to the pediatric age range.

 These include the size and weight of VR headsets, the ease of donning and doffing headsets, and degree of engagement with VR environments.

 Hemophilia specific issues include the need for the VR experience to limit movement of the hands/arms to facilitate IV procedures, customization to prevent boredom/disengagement from repeated use and ability of clinical staff to trigger events via an orchestration dashboard that occur for the patients benefit at key times during IV procedures.

 Lastly, there are issues related to integration into a clinical setting.

 These include ability to integrate into clinical care without adversely affecting clinic flow, and infection control issues related to headset design.

 Virtual Reality for Hemophilia@highlight

Children with hemophilia are exposed to intravenous (IV) procedures that cause pain/anxiety and distraction methods can be employed to improve the patient experience.

 Three-dimensional virtual reality (VR) environments can reduce distress related to procedures.

 To be utilized in a clinical setting, however, these devices must address infection control concerns and fit pediatric patients.

 Additionally, for use in hemophilia care, environments should encourage a subject to keep their hands/arms still to facilitate procedures.

 Nursing orchestration of the VR environment via an iPad dashboard has the potential to increase feasibility and acceptance by patients, families and providers of the VR experience without disrupting routine clinical care.
