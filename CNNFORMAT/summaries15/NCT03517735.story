(firstQuint)Automated Postoperative Sedation After Cardiac Surgery.

 Automated sedation has the potential to improve patient care after cardiac surgery by adjusting drug doses to the minimum required for efficacy.

 Indeed, automated and continuous titration may avoid overdosing, improve hemodynamic stability and also decrease the mean time to tracheal extubation.

 Medsteer SAS developed a controller, EasyTiva device, allowing the closed-loop coadministration of propofol and remifentanil, guided by a Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor.

 Automated sedation is so facilitated by the BIS which permits continuous monitoring of electrocortical activity.

 This randomized monocentric trial compares the automated administration with manual intravenous administration of propofol-remifentanil for maintaining adequate depth of hypnosis (BIS 55-75) during sedation after cardiac surgery.
