(firstQuint)Early Detection of Pressure Induced Tissue Damage by Infrared Spectroscopy (ODP) Device.

 During pressure injuries formation early sub dermal bio signal appear.

 By applying infrared spectroscopy at a suspicions injury site on the human body and obtaining a reflected infrared light infrared allows to determine early formation of a pressure injury/.

The aim of this study is to demonstrate that infrared spectroscopy is able to detect pressure injuries at a very early stage
