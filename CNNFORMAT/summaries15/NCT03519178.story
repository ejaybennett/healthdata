(thirdQuint)A Safety, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic and Anti-Tumor Study of PF-06873600 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Endocrine Therapy.

 This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, multiple dose, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study of PF-06873600 administered as a single agent in sequential dose levels and then in combination with endocrine therapy.

 In Part 1A, successive cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of PF-06873600 and then in dose finding (Part 1B) with PF-06873600 in combination with endocrine therapy (ET).

 This study contains 2 parts, dose escalation with single agent (Part 1A) and then dose finding with PF-06873600 in combination with endocrine therapy (Part 1B) followed by dose expansion arms as a single agent and PF-06873600 in combination with endocrine therapy (Part 2).
