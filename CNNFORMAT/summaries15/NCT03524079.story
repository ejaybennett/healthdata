(firstQuint)Right Ventricle Morphology and Hemodynamics in BrS.

 All consecutive patients with suspected BrS-ECG pattern will perform an ajmaline testing (1mg/kg in 5 min).

 A total of 30 patients with positive testing and 30 patients with negative testing will be selected and enrolled.

 Patients will perform cardiac magnetic resonance and 3D echocardiography imaging to evaluate and compare morphological and functional characteristics of the 2 groups before and after ajmaline.

 Patients with positive testing will also perform a standardized programmed ventricular stimulation protocol.

 Right Ventricle Morphology and Hemodynamics in BrS@highlight

The study purpose is to evaluate the morphological and functional characteristics of the right ventricle before and after ajmaline in patients diagnosed with Brugada syndrome.
