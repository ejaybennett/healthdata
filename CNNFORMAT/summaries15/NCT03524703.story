(firstQuint)Short-term Effect of Chewing Gum in Patients With Mild-moderate Dysphagia After Anterior Cervical Fusion.

 Postoperative dysphagia is the most common complication of anterior cervical fusion surgery.

 Previous studies showed that chewing gum helped to improve swallow frequency and latency.

 However, its short-term effect on alleviating dysphagia symptom after anterior cervical surgery is still unknown.

 A randomized, parallel controlled, superiority trial is performed in patients with postoperative mild-moderate dysphagia.

 Dysphagia severity will be assessed using dysphagia short questionnaire (DSQ) score in the chewing gum group and control group during 7 days after surgery, and the changes in DSQ score between two groups will be compared, to estimate the effect of chewing gum on alleviating dysphagia symptom.
