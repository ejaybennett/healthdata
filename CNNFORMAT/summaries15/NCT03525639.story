(fifthQuint)CMR Evaluation of Myocardial Inflammation Persistence After Acute Myocarditis: Prognostic Relevance.

 Background and Significance: In patients with acute myocarditis (AM), spontaneous improvement can be observed in the majority of cases, but progression towards dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a not rare outcome (around 20% of patients) (Feldmann N Engl J Med 2000;343:1388-98).

 Differences in the course of the disease may reflect the course of the underlying viral infection.

 In a large series of patients with AM submitted to two endo-myocardial biopsies (EMBs) in few months, Kuhl demonstrated that viral clearance was associated with spontaneous ejection fraction (EF) improvement, while EF did not improve or even deteriorated in patients with viral and myocardial inflammation persistence (Kuhl Circulation 2005;111:887-93.

 Kuhl Circulation 2005;112:1965-70).

 However, repeated EMBs cannot be proposed in the clinical routine and, hence, non-invasive detection of the subgroup of patients with inflammation persistence should have important implications.

 Today, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is recognized as an accurate non-invasive imaging tool to diagnose acute myocarditis, because of its ability to detect myocardial inflammation and necrosis (Friedrich J Am Coll Cardiol 2009;53:1475-87).

 However, although the role of CMR parameters of inflammation and necrosis is well established in the diagnosis of AM, no study has investigated the potential value of these parameters in the assessment of inflammation persistence after the acute phase.

 The study hypothesis is that the assessment of early changes in CMR parameters at an additional CMR study may have great value in outcome prediction.

 Hypothesis: The persistence of a subtle myocardial inflammation is an important factor in determining a negative outcome in patients with acute myocarditis; moreover, CMR demonstrated to assess myocardial inflammation with high sensitivity and, hence, has the potentiality to follow the myocardial inflammation over time.

 The study hypothesis is that a short-term monitoring with CMR (1 month) may allow differentiating patients evolving towards a complete healing from patients with persistent myocardial inflammation, which may be at greater risk to progress toward DCM.

 Preliminary data: A previous study performed on patients with chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy demonstrated that the positivity of CMR parameters of necrosis (LGE) and inflammation (oedema) is significantly higher in patients with an active inflammation at EMB, compared to patients with borderline histological criteria (De Cobelli 2006 JACC;47:1649-54).

 These data suggest the possibility to detect with CMR the persistence of subtle myocardial inflammation after the acute phase in patients with myocarditis.

 Moreover, Wagner and Colleagues demonstrated, in a small group of patients, a correlation between CMR evidence of myocardial hyperaemia persistence 4 weeks after the onset of acute myocarditis and negative left ventricular (LV) remodelling 30 months later (Wagner A 2003 MAGMA;16:17-20).

 Materials and Methods: This is a prospective multicentre cohort study.

 80 patients with diagnosis of acute myocarditis (AM) will be enrolled.

 All patients admitted to Hospital with suspect of AM will be submitted to: collection of detailed anamnesis and physical examination, 12-lead ECG, laboratory exams, transthoracic echocardiography, coronary catheterization or coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography when an ischemic cause of symptoms need to be excluded and CMR imaging within 3-5 days.

 All patients with clinically or EMB confirmed diagnosis of AM will be enrolled and will undergo a second CMR study 1 month later.

 Percentage of change in global Relative Enhancement (gRE), T2-ratio and amount of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) between the two CMR studies will be assessed.

 All patients will undergo a clinical/instrumental follow-up including: CMR assessment of LV ejection fraction and end-diastolic volume after at least 1 year from diagnosis; registration of all-cause mortality, cardiac death and aborted cardiac sudden death in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

 Impact and Translational Implications: Myocarditis is characterized by significant heterogeneity of long-term evolution.

 CMR could play a key role in the non-invasive and early identification of patients with persistent myocardial inflammation, at high risk to evolve towards an irreversible post-myocarditis heart failure.

 Thus, CMR may help to design tailored management of patients.

 In this perspective, invasive characterization of damage mechanism and aetiology might be reserved to patients with CMR evidence of inflammation persistence.

 CMR Evaluation of Myocardial Inflammation Persistence After Acute Myocarditis: Prognostic Relevance@highlight

Patients with acute myocarditis (AM) usually experience spontaneous healing, but a considerable percentage of them evolve towards chronic long-term cardiac impairment.

 The evolution towards dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) occurs in a subtle manner, frequently after an initial recover that mimics complete healing.

 Differences in the course of the disease may reflect the course of underlying myocardial inflammation related to viral clearance or persistence and to the following autoimmune response.

 New cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) parameters are sensitive to myocardial inflammation and may have a prognostic role.

 The study hypothesis is that a short-term monitoring with CMR (1 month) may identify the subgroup of patients at high risk of progression towards DCM.

 The trend of CMR parameters during the first month will be compared with the subsequent outcome in 80 patients with AM.

 The results of this study will help to significantly improve management and outcome of patients with AM.
