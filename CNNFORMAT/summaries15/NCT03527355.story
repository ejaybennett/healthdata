(thirdQuint)Safety, Reactogenicity and Immunogenicity of Vi-DT;Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine.

 This study is carried out in healthy children aged 6 to 23 months at a single site.

 A total of 285 participants are enrolled, 114, 114 and 57 participants are randomized to either the single dose, two-dose Vi-DT regimens or placebo/comparator group, respectively within age strata.

 Three age strata is 6 to less than 9 months, 9 to 12 months and 13 to 23 months.

 The investigators allow the 9-12 months old children to receive Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine concomitantly with Vi-DT vaccine and descriptive analysis of immune response to MMR only and to MMR and Vi-DT vaccines are performed to assess the possible immunological interference with MMR vaccine.
