(thirdQuint)Effectiveness of Written Dietary Advice on Lipoproteins - a Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial.

 The Active Intervention Group will receive detailed dietary advice based on current evidence for food choices that improve LDL cholesterol levels.

 The information will contain motivational strategies, e.

g.

 "It's great that you want to improve your blood lipids! What are your three main reasons that you want to improve your blood lipids? What food choices suit you? How low can you go?" Participants will receive a table of ten suggested healthy food choices and be instructed to mark for each day a certain food change has been made.

 The Control Group will receive similar advice and motivational strategies, with the one difference being the dietary advice, that will focus on Triglycerides instead of LDL cholesterol.
