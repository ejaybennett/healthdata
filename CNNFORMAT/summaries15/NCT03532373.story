(thirdQuint)Testing of a Tool to Elicit Patient Preferences for CTS.

 The investigators will measure decisional conflict in 150 new patients being evaluated for CTS with the tool compared to 150 patients being evaluated for CTS with standard care.

 Those patients randomized to receiving the tool will use it to identify their preferences for certain attributes of care.

 Patients will then be presented with their preference data and the surgeon will have a discussion with the patient regarding CTS.

 Surgeons will have their standard discussion with the patients randomized to the standard care group (no tool).

 The tool will be operationalized on a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant data platform, such as Qualtrics, and no identifiable data will be collected.

 De-identified data will be shared from study cites with our team at Stanford.

 This data will be backed up on a computer encrypted by Stanford.

 Testing of a Tool to Elicit Patient Preferences for CTS@highlight

This study will complete a randomized controlled trial to quantitatively measure patient decisional conflict (Decisional Conflict Scale) in 150 patients treated for CTS with the tool compared to 150 patients treated with standard care.

 The investigators hypothesize patients treated for CTS will have lower decisional conflict with the tool.
