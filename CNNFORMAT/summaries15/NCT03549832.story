(thirdQuint)Comparative Study of Two Regiemns in Management of Sofosbuvir/Daclatasvir Failure.

 HCV management with new DAAs is now promising.

 However, many cases reporting treatment failure either non-responder or relapse to HCV treatment with Sofosbuvir/ Daclatasvir.

 retreat those patients is challenging.

 So, we aimed to Study the efficacy and safety of Sofosbuvir /Simeprevir/ Daclatasvir/Ribavirin versus Sofosbuvir /ombitasvir/ paritaprevir/ritonavir/ribavirin in the management of hepatitis C patients who failed to prior Sofosbuvir/ Daclatasvir regimens in a multicenter open-labeled randomized trial.
