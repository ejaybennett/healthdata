(secondQuint)Investigating Memory in Healthy Subjects Using Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation.

 Associative memory refers to remembering the association between two items, such as a face and a name or a word in English and the same word in another language.

 It is not only important for learning, but it is also one of the first aspects of memory performance that is impacted by aging and by Alzheimer's disease.

 For decades, neuroscientists have investigated associative learning and memory and ways to accelerate and enhance associative learning and memory.

 Transcranial Direct Current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and painless electrical stimulation technique that has demonstrated to accelerate learning and improve memory in some studies.

 To investigate whether it is possible to improve associative memory using tDCS, the performance in a Verbal Paired-Associate memory task of 4 groups targeting different areas will be compared.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether we can improve associative memory performance in healthy subjects, by applying transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) during a verbal paired-associate learning task
