(fifthQuint)Lum-Iva-biota: Exploring the Respiratory Mycobiota and Microbiota Profile in French CF Patients Taking Lumacaftor-Ivacaftor.

 Lung disease in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is related to structural and/or functional defects of chloride channel CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transport Regulator).

 These anomalies are associated with different classes of genetic mutations (class I to VI).

 The most common mutation is p.

Phe508del class II (40% of homozygous and 70% heterozygous patients), it is responsible for the phenylalanine deletion at position 508 with improper intracellular processing of CFTR with less than normal amounts of CFTR protein at the apical cell membrane.

 Over the last 20 years the CF patient outcome has been mainly improved using symptomatic treatments.

 More recently, new therapeutic strategies targeting directly CFTR defects have been developed.

 Initially potentiators which correct functional defects of CFTR (class Mutations 3 and 4) were studied.

 Then, correctors that target CFTR production were also developed.

 These molecules demonstrated substantial effect.

 In 2015, the American company VERTEX - producing already KALYDECO (IVACAFTOR, VX-770) potentiator molecule that is recommended for the treatment of CF patients aged 6 y, with mutation altering the channel regulation (class III mutations) as G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549Nou S549R) - was allowed by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for producing and using LUMACAFTOR-IVACAFTOR in clinical trials to manage CF patients over 12 years and having two p.

Phe508del mutations.

 ORKAMBI represents the combination of two molecules (LUMACAFTOR + IVACAFTOR) respectively correctors and potentiator of CFTR.

 This EMA authorization follows the results of two international studies (TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT) based on more than 1,000 CF patients showing that patients under LUMACAFTOR-IVACAFTOR compared to the group taking placebo have: 1.

 A moderate improvement in lung function (FEV1) at 24 weeks of 4.

3 to 6.

7%, 2.

 A significant reduction in lung exacerbations (bronchitis) up - 39%, 3.

 An increase in body mass index (BMI).

 These results confirm that LUMACAFTOR-IVACAFTOR may represent the first medicine to treat the whole underlying cause of CF in people ages 12 and older who have two copies of the p.

Phe508del mutation.

 They complete the decrease or disappearance of pulmonary colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (including mucoid phenotype isolates) observed under IVACAFTOR alone (KALYDECO treatment), even if the impact on fungal flora (or mycobiota) has not been described up to date.

 As LUMACAFTOR-IVACAFTOR impacts chloride secretion through CFTR at the apical site of lung epithelial cells, with an expected improvement in secretion hydration and mucociliary clearance, it should modify the whole pulmonary microbial flora, including fungal microbiota (mycobiota) of CF lungs; this newly modified flora being expected achieving the characteristics of the "healthy type" in terms of flora composition, richness and diversity.

 In 2016, the French patients homozygous for the p.

Phe508del mutation and older than 12 years were treated with this molecule association and were closely monitored according to criteria established by the working group "New Therapeutic Approaches" of the French Society Cystic fibrosis.

 This study was a phase IV observational trial for a period of 1 year.

 In this context, the team aims at initiating a comprehensive monitoring of the lung mycobiota and microbiota evolution under LUMACAFTOR-IVACAFTOR.

 This project is directly linked to the monitoring of homozygous p.

Phe508del patients who begin treatment with LUMACAFTOR-IVACAFTOR in France (in agreement with the working group "New Therapeutic Approaches" of the French Society Cystic Fibrosis, and the working group "Fungal Risks in CF").

Phe508del mutations.

 Since 2016, the French patients homozygous for the p.

Phe508del mutation and older than 12 years are able to be treated with this new association LUMACAFTOR-IVACAFTOR and were closely monitored according to criteria established by the working group "New Therapeutic Approaches" of the French Society Cystic fibrosis.

 This study was a phase IV observational trial for a period of 1 year.

 In this context, the team aims at initiating a comprehensive monitoring of the lung mycobiota and microbiota evolution under LUMACAFTOR-IVACAFTOR treatment.

 This project is directly linked to the monitoring of homozygous p.

Phe508del patients who begin treatment with LUMACAFTOR-IVACAFTOR in France.

 The pro- and eukaryotic microbiota analysis is based on the secondary use of sputum samples associated with several clinical data of CF patients under LUMACAFTOR-IVACAFTOR and follow-up during the 1st year of LUMACAFTOR-IVACAFTOR therapy.

 According to the French law, Lum-Iva-Biota project is a non-interventional study.

 It aims at demonstrating that changes in the hydration of pulmonary secretions related to LUMACAFTOR-IVACAFTOR therapy promote a change in the lung mycobiota and microbiota profile which may achieve the characteristics of the "healthy type" (in terms of composition, richness and diversity).
