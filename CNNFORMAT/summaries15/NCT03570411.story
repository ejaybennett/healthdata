(fifthQuint)Evaluating the Clinical Utility of the T-SPOT.

CMV Assay for the Prediction of CMV Reactivation Among Pediatric Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Cell Transplant.

 T-SPOT response will be measured using the results from the T-SPOT.

CMV blood test in both HCT recipients and HCT donors.

 A blood sample for the T-SPOT.

CMV blood test will be collected from the HCT donor prior to transplant.

 Blood specimens will be collected for the T-SPOT.

CMV blood test from HCT recipients over the course of 6 months, starting weekly at Day +1, biweekly starting at Day +45, and monthly starting at day +120.

 HCT recipient participant demographic and clinical characteristics will be collected at enrollment.

 Additional clinical information will be abstracted from the HCT recipient participants medical record during the study follow-up period.

 This will include information related to transplant history and outcome, infections, antimicrobial exposure, chemotherapy, and laboratory values related to infectious diseases and immunosuppression.

 The feasibility of the T-SPOT.

CMV spot count test will be evaluated once the first 30 participants enrolled on study reach day +90.

 If 75% of patients have at least 1 evaluable samples after engraftment (> 75,000 per microtiter wells), we will proceed with enrollment.

 If more >25% of patients have all their samples deemed not evaluable due to insufficient mononuclear cell count (<75,000 per microtiter wells) the study will be stopped and concluded as not feasible.

CMV Assay for the Prediction of CMV Reactivation Among Pediatric Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Cell Transplant@highlight

The ability to distinguish allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) recipients at risk for cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation from those who are not is central for optimal CMV management strategies.

 Measuring this cell mediated immunity has been proposed as a potent tool to predict those patients at highest risk of CMV reactivation and disease.

 This study will evaluate the ability of the T-SPOT.

CMV test to predict Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) pediatric recipients.

 Primary Objectives: To evaluate feasibility of T-SPOT.

CMV spot count test in allo-HCT pediatric recipients.

 To evaluate association of T-SPOT.

CMV spot count in the first sample collected after patient has engrafted with subsequent CMV reactivation in allo-HCT pediatric recipients.

 Secondary Objectives: To evaluate the correlation between T-SPOT.

CMV spot count in donors with subsequent recipient CMV spot count.

 To explore the relationship between recipient T-SPOT.

CMV spot counts and subsequent CMV infection related morbidity and treatment outcomes among pediatric all-HCT recipients.
