(thirdQuint)Effect of Sodium Glucose co Transporter 2 Inhibitor ( SGLT2) on Proteinuria in Diabetic Patients.

 Diabetic nephropathy involves progressive stages including glomerular hyperfilteration , microalbuminuria , overt proteinuria and a decline in glomerular filteration rate leading to end stage renal disease.

 Despite all the available interventions available for diabetic patients including tight glycemic control , and blood pressure control , using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonist renal disease remains prevalent and progress in these patients.

 The newer therapy of diabetes is the use of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor as it has the potential of renoprotection in patients with diabetic nephropathy just as ACEI and ARBS to reduce glomerular hyperfilteration .

This action may reduce albuminuria.

 Effect of Sodium Glucose co Transporter 2 Inhibitor ( SGLT2) on Proteinuria in Diabetic Patients@highlight

Diabetes Mellitus is the leading cause of end stage renal disease.

 As proven by many studies , controlling proteinuria can delay the progression to end stage renal disease.

This work will study the effect of sodium glucose co transporter 2 inhibitor , a new antihyperglycemic drug , on proteinuria and to compare its effect with the effect of classic antiproteinuric drugs as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor , aspirin and statins.
