(thirdQuint)A 42-day Parallel Group Safety Study of Revefenacin and Formoterol, Administered in Sequence and as a Combination, in Subjects With COPD.

 The primary objective of the study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of once-daily revefenacin inhalation solution when dosed sequentially with twice-daily formoterol inhalation solution (PERFOROMIST(R)) compared to PERFOROMIST(R), in a population of patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD over 21 days.

 The secondary objective of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of dosing a mixture of revefenacin inhalation solution and formoterol compared to dosing a mixture of placebo and formoterol in a population of patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD over 21 days.

 The study intends to enroll approximately 120 subjects across 12 sites in the United States.
