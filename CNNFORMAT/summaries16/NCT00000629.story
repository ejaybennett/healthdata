(fifthQuint)The Effects of Valproic Acid on Zidovudine Glucuronidation and Pharmacokinetics in HIV-Infected Patients.

.

 Preliminary studies using human liver tissue have shown that valproic acid inhibits the metabolic inactivation of zidovudine (AZT), which may prolong the plasma half-life of AZT and thus prolong the duration of the drug's effects in the body.

 Six asymptomatic HIV-infected patients are treated with AZT orally every 8 hours on days 1 through 4, then with a single dose on day 5 (after 8 hours of fasting), followed by pharmacokinetic sampling.

 On days 6 through 9, patients receive AZT orally every 8 hours in combination with valproic acid (lowest dose in the first 5 patients and a higher dose in patients 6 and 7) orally every 8 hours.

 On day 10, AZT and 1 of the 2 doses of valproic acid are given orally as single doses, followed by pharmacokinetic sampling.

 AZT is continued alone orally every 8 hours on days 11 through 14, then resumed at the patient's usual dose beginning on day 15.

 Per 03/09/92 amendment, dosing schedule may be modified slightly to accommodate patients with scheduling conflicts.

 The Effects of Valproic Acid on Zidovudine Glucuronidation and Pharmacokinetics in HIV-Infected Patients.

@highlight

Primary objective: To study the pharmacokinetic interaction between zidovudine (AZT) and valproic acid in asymptomatic HIV-infected patients, characterizing AZT's oral bioavailability, plasma elimination half-time, plasma levels, and urinary excretion of AZT, 5'-O-glucuronide (GAZT), and 3'-amino-3'-deoxythymidine (AMT).

 Secondary objective: To establish the safety of short-term administration of AZT and valproic acid in combination with regard to hematologic parameters and liver function in asymptomatic HIV-infected patients.

 Preliminary studies using human liver tissue have shown that valproic acid inhibits the metabolic inactivation of zidovudine (AZT), which may prolong the plasma half-life of AZT and thus prolong the duration of the drug's effects in the body.
