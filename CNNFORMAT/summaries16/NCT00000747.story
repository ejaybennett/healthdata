(fifthQuint)An Open-Label, Pilot Study to Evaluate the Development of Resistance to Nevirapine (BI-RG-587) in HIV-Infected Patients With CD4 Cell Count >= 500/mm3.

 The anti-HIV agent nevirapine is associated with rapid emergence of resistance when administered alone or in combination with zidovudine to HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts <= 400 cells/mm3.

 In persons with less advanced HIV disease and less viral burden, the emergence of resistance may be delayed, thus permitting evaluation for beneficial effect in a population where there is currently no established therapy.

 Ten patients receive nevirapine daily for 12 weeks.

 After 12 weeks of therapy, patients in whom resistance was not evident at week 4 and who have an adequate safety profile continue receiving nevirapine for an additional 12 weeks.

 Clinical and immunological assessments are performed at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24.

 Virological assessments are performed at week 24 only.

 If 50 percent of patients develop resistance at any time, the study is discontinued.

 An Open-Label, Pilot Study to Evaluate the Development of Resistance to Nevirapine (BI-RG-587) in HIV-Infected Patients With CD4 Cell Count >= 500/mm3@highlight

Primary: To evaluate the rate of development of resistance to nevirapine in HIV-1 infected individuals.

 To evaluate safety of nevirapine in HIV-1 infected individuals with CD4 counts greater than or equal to 500 cells/mm3.

 Secondary: To evaluate the effect of nevirapine on surrogate markers.

 The anti-HIV agent nevirapine is associated with rapid emergence of resistance when administered alone or in combination with zidovudine to HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts <= 400 cells/mm3.

 In persons with less advanced HIV disease and less viral burden, the emergence of resistance may be delayed, thus permitting evaluation for beneficial effect in a population where there is currently no established therapy.
