(thirdQuint)Diagnosis and History Study of Patients With Different Neurological Conditions.

 Objective: This protocol is a screening protocol, which allows for evaluation of patients and families where neurological conditions are present for enrollment into other studies.

 It is also a teaching and training instrument for the MNB fellows, allowing them to gain expertise in the evaluation and treatment of patients.

 Finally, it will be used to screen healthy volunteers to create a pool of potential future HV matches for HMCS protocols.

 Study population: The following population groups may participate: - Subjects with neurological disorders who are 2 years old or older, - Family members who are 2 years old or older of people with a neurological disorder - Healthy volunteers who are 18 years old or older.

 - National Institutes of Health (NIH) employees (other than those employed by HMCS in NINDS) may participate.

 Design: The goal is to screen patients with neurological conditions and family members of patients with neurological conditions for enrollment in additional research protocols.

 No investigational treatments will be administered on this protocol and the NIH physicians will be playing a consultative role to the patient s primary physician.

 We will also screen healthy volunteers to create a pool of potential future HV matches for other HMCS protocols.

 Outcome measures: This is a natural history screening protocol to evaluate patients with neurological disorders and their family members, and to screen healthy volunteers for to create a pool of potential future HV matches other HMCS protocols.

 Therefore, there is no outcome measure.
