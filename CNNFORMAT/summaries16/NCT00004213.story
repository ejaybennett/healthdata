(thirdQuint)3-Aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde Thiosemicarbazone in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the effects of 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP) in patients with solid tumors by evaluating the safety and tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for Phase II studies, pharmacokinetics, and tumor response.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

 Patients receive 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP) IV over 2 hours on days 1-5.

 Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of 3-AP until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

 Patients are followed for 4 weeks or until recovered.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone in treating patients who have solid tumors that have not responded to previous treatment.
