(secondQuint)Phase I Study of Adenoviral Vector Mediated Gene Transfer for Ornithine Transcarbamylase in Adults With Partial Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency.

 PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

 Patients undergo a femoral arterial placement of a hepatic intraarterial catheter.

 Patients then receive adenoviral vector mediated gene transfer intravascularly over 30 minutes.

 Cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of adenoviral vector until the maximum tolerated dose is determined.

 Patients are followed at 3, 5, 7, 8, 15, and 29 days, at 2 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.

 Completion date provided represents the completion date of the grant per OOPD records.

 Phase I Study of Adenoviral Vector Mediated Gene Transfer for Ornithine Transcarbamylase in Adults With Partial Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency@highlight

OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the safety, feasibility, and potential efficacy of intravascular adenoviral vector mediated gene transfer in the liver in adults with partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.
