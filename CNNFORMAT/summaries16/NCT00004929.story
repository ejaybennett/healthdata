(secondQuint)Vaccine Therapy Plus QS21 in Treating Patients With Progressive Prostate Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine if immunization with glycosylated MUC-2 antigen with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) conjugate plus immunological adjuvant QS21 induces an antibody, helper T cell, and/or cytotoxic T cell response against glycosylated MUC-2 in patients with progressive prostate cancer.

 II.

 Determine the safety of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

 III.

 Determine the effect of glycosylated MUC-2 antigen with KLH conjugate on the T cell response against MUC-2 and by skin testing in these patients.

 IV.

 Assess the post immunization changes in prostate specific antigen levels and other objective parameters of disease including radionuclide bone scan and/or measurable disease in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive vaccination with glycosylated MUC-2 antigen with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously (SQ) plus immunological adjuvant QS21 SQ on weeks 1-3, 7, 15, and 27 for a total of 6 vaccinations.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or until disease progression.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-15 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
