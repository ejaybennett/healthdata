(fifthQuint)Framingham Cycle V Offspring-Spouse Nutrition Studies.

 DESIGN NARRATIVE: The data collection efforts and cross-sectional analyses were carried out among approximately 3800 males and females during the scheduled 1991-1994 Cycle V Framingham Offspring/Spouse study.

 The secular trend and longitudinal analyses also included data that were collected during the Cycle III Offspring/Spouse studies in 1984-88.

 Of particular interest were dietary variables which play a major role in serum total cholesterol and lipoprotein regulation.

 Additional dietary variables which were associated with major cardiovascular risk factors ((elevated) blood pressure, glucose (in)tolerance, (excess) body weight or physical (in)activity, and smoking) or that may predict CHD endpoints were included in the analyses.

 The potential confounding effects or interactions between dietary and risk factor variables were considered.

 Separate analyses were carried out in males and females.

 The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.

 Framingham Cycle V Offspring-Spouse Nutrition Studies@highlight

To examine the associations between diet, nutrition and coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence over seven years using the Cycle V Framingham Offspring/Spouse examination ; to examine the cross-sectional associations between dietary variables and major cardiovascular disease risk factors, to examine changes in dietary behaviors and their determinants over seven years; and to characterize the influences of dietary behavior changes on risk factor status between 1984-88 and 1991-94.
