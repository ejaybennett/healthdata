(thirdQuint)Eflornithine to Prevent Skin Cancer in Patients With Previously Treated Early Stage Skin Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Compare the rate of new skin cancer in patients with previously treated stage 0, I, or II basal or squamous cell skin cancer treated with eflornithine (DFMO) vs placebo.

 II.

 Determine whether inhibition of TPA-induced ornithine decarboxylase activity serves as an intermediary marker for response to DFMO in these patients.

 III.

 Determine whether inhibition of skin polyamine levels serves as an intermediary marker for response to DFMO in these patients.

 IV.

 Assess the long term toxic effects of this treatment in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral placebo daily for the first 4 weeks.

 Patients who comply with taking 80-100% of placebo are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

 Arm I: Patients receive oral eflornithine (DFMO) daily.

 Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo daily.

 Treatment continues for 3-5 years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients who develop skin cancer during study undergo surgical excision and continue treatment on the arm to which they were originally randomized.

 Patients are followed every 6 months through year 5.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 334 patients (167 per arm) will be accrued for this study over 2 years.

 Eflornithine to Prevent Skin Cancer in Patients With Previously Treated Early Stage Skin Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer.

 The use of eflornithine may be an effective way to prevent the recurrence of or further development of skin cancer.

 PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of eflornithine in preventing skin cancer in patients who have previously received treatment for early stage skin cancer.
