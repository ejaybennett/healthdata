(thirdQuint)Chloroquinoxaline Sulfonamide in Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the efficacy of chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide in patients with platinum-refractory small cell lung cancer.

 II.

 Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide IV over 1 hour once a week for 4 weeks.

 Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed until death.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide in treating patients who have small cell lung cancer that has not responded to platinum-based chemotherapy.
