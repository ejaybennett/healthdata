(thirdQuint)Isoflavones & Lycopene in Localized Prostate Ca:Prior to Radical Prostatectomy.

 OBJECTIVES: - Compare the effect of isoflavones vs lycopene prior to radical prostatectomy on intermediate biomarkers (e.

g.

, indices of cell proliferation and apoptosis) in patients with localized prostate cancer.

 - Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on increases in plasma levels and tissue levels of these agents in these patients.

 - Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on changes in surrogate markers of disease progression (e.

g.

, prostate-specific antigen levels) in these patients.

 - Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on changes in serum steroid hormones, estradiol, and free testosterone in these patients.

 - Compare the magnitude of these changes in patients treated with these nutritional supplements vs patients in the control group.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to disease stage (stage I vs stage II) and presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 7 treatment groups.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 87 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.

 Isoflavones & Lycopene in Localized Prostate Ca:Prior to Radical Prostatectomy@highlight

RATIONALE: Eating a diet rich in isoflavones, compounds found in soy foods, or lycopene, a substance found in tomatoes, may keep prostate cancer from growing.

 Giving isoflavones or lycopene before surgery may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer.

 PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of isoflavones with that of lycopene before surgery in treating patients who have stage I or stage II prostate cancer.
