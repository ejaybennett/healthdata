(firstQuint)HER-2 Protein Vaccine in Treating Women With Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety of HER-2 protein AutoVac cent in women with breast cancer.

 Secondary - Determine the ability of this drug to bypass the tolerance to the HER-2 self-protein by raising HER-2 antibodies in these patients.

 - Determine the kinetics of the immune response to HER-2/neu in patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

 Patients receive HER-2 protein AutoVac cent intramuscularly at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 10 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed for up to 6 weeks.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 months.
