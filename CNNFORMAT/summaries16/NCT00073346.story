(firstQuint)Treatment of Compulsive Hoarding.

 Compulsive hoarding is a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that is characterized by excessive acquisition of possessions, difficulty discarding possessions, and excessive clutter.

 This condition is resistant to both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions that are effective in treating other symptoms of OCD.

 This study will determine the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating compulsive hoarding symptoms.

 This study consists of three phases.

 In Phase 1, data from previously conducted pilot studies will be revised and expanded.

 In Phase 2, the revised data will be used to develop and implement a treatment manual for compulsive hoarding.

 During this phase, treatment will be flexibly applied to allow for variations in treatment duration and choice of techniques.

 During Phase 3, participants will be randomly assigned to either CBT or a wait-list control, followed by active treatment for a fixed duration.

 Therapist adherence and competence will be assessed through audiotaped therapy sessions.
