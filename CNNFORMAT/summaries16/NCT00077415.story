(thirdQuint)3-AP and Gemcitabine as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the objective response rate in patients with stage III or IV recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with 3-AP (Triapine(R)) and gemcitabine as second-line therapy.

 Secondary - Determine the response duration, median time to progression, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

 - Determine the effect of 3-AP (Triapine(R)) on gemcitabine pharmacokinetics and cellular uptake into peripheral mononuclear cells in patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to participating center.

 Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine(R)) IV over 4 hours and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15*.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 NOTE: *For course 1 only, gemcitabine is administered alone on day 1 and in combination with 3-AP (Triapine(R)) on days 8 and 15.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-31 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.

5-21 months.

 3-AP and Gemcitabine as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 3-AP and gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Giving more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving 3-AP together with gemcitabine as second-line therapy works in treating patients with recurrent stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
