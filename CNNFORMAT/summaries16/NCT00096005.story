(fifthQuint)Tanespimycin and Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (tanespimycin) and bortezomib in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas (Accrual for Lymphoma Patients Closed as of 11/27/09).

 II.

 Determine changes in biomarkers (e.

g.

, HSP70, client proteins, and ubiquitination of proteins) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor specimens from patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas (Accrual for Lymphoma Patients Closed as of 11/27/09) treated with this regimen.

 III.

 Determine responses in patients treated with this regimen.

 IV.

 Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

 Patients receive tanespimycin intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11.

 Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tanespimycin and bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 Once the MTD is determined, at least 12 additional patients are treated as above* at the MTD.

 NOTE: *Bortezomib is not administered on day 1 of course 1 only.

 Patients are followed at 3 months.

 Tanespimycin and Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas@highlight

This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving tanespimycin together with bortezomib in treating patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas.

 (Accrual for lymphoma patients closed as of 11/27/09) Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as tanespimycin, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth.

 It may also increase the effectiveness of tanespimycin by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug.

 Combining tanespimycin with bortezomib may kill more cancer cells.
