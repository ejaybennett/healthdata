(fifthQuint)Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma Undergoing Autologous Stem Cell Transplant.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the efficacy of CC-5013 (lenalidomide) in prolonging time to disease progression in patients with multiple myeloma after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine if CC-5013 will increase the complete response (CR) rate in patients with multiple myeloma following ASCT.

 II.

 To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with multiple myeloma who have undergone ASCT and who then are randomized to either CC-5013 or placebo.

 III.

 To determine the feasibility of long-term administration of CC-5013 to multiple myeloma patients who have undergone ASCT.

 OUTLINE: PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL (PBSC) MOBILIZATION: Mobilization of autologous PBSC will be performed according to institutional guidelines.

 AUTOLOGOUS PBSC TRANSPLANTATION (PBSCT): Patients receive melphalan intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day -2 or -1 or over 2 days on days -3 and -2 or -2 and -1.

 Patients undergo autologous PBSCT on day 0.

 Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 maintenance treatment arms.

 (Note: As of 12/17/09, no more patients will be randomized between lenalidomide and placebo.

 Patients who have not been randomized as of 12/17/09 will be assigned to lenalidomide.

) ARM I: Beginning between day 100-110, patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily.

 ARM II: Beginning between day 100-110, patients receive placebo (PO) once daily.

 In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

 Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma Undergoing Autologous Stem Cell Transplant@highlight

This randomized phase III trial studies lenalidomide to see how well it works compared to a placebo in treating patients with multiple myeloma who are undergoing autologous stem cell transplant.

 Giving chemotherapy before a peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps kill any cancer cells that are in the body and helps make room in the patient's bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow.

 After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored.

 More chemotherapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant.

 The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy.

 Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.

 Giving lenalidomide after autologous stem cell transplant may be an effective treatment for multiple myeloma.
