(thirdQuint)Treating Nicotine Dependence in Schizophrenic Individuals: Effectiveness of Bupropion - 1.

 Past research on the use of the NTP, atypical antipsychotics, and bupropion in schizophrenic individuals to aid in smoking cessation has been encouraging.

 The purpose of this study is to compare bupropion SR to a placebo to determine its effectiveness when used in combination with an NTP to help schizophrenic individuals quit smoking.

 Participants in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be randomly assigned to receive either the NTP (21 mg/day) and placebo or the NTP and bupropion SR (300 mg/day).

 Participants will begin taking one pill each day of bupropion SR (150 mg/day) or placebo at the start of the second week of the study.

 After three days, the dose of bupropion SR or placebo will increase to 2 pills each day.

 Participants will continue this dosing regimen until the end of Week 10.

 Throughout the 10-week study, participants will receive weekly group therapy.
