(fifthQuint)Skin Cleansing With Chlorhexidine to Decrease Hospital Acquired Infections.

 Patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit at John H Stroger Hospital are randomly assigned to Unit A or B.

 Unit B was randomly selected as the intervention unit.

 For 6 months, all patients in Unit B will be bathed with the 2% CHG Antiseptic Cloth system and all patients in Unit A will receive soap and water baths.

 After this 6 month period, there will be a 2 to 4 week washout period and the interventions will cross over, with Unit A receiving Chlorhexidine baths and unit B receiving soap and water for 6 months.

 Each week, two randomly selected patients will have cultures of the inguinal area, neck/subclavian region, and endotracheal aspirates.

 A comparison of the colonization of the skin and sputum will be done between the two intervention groups.

 Daily infection surveillance will be done on all patients in the intensive care unit.

 A comparison of blood stream infections, clinical sepsis, and other nosocomial infections will be done between the two intervention groups.

 Skin Cleansing With Chlorhexidine to Decrease Hospital Acquired Infections@highlight

Patients in the intensive care unit are at risk for many infections because the severity of illness and the procedures necessary to care for them.

 This study is designed to look at a change in bathing procedure as a method to reduce infections.

 Currently, patients at John H.

 Stroger Hospital are cleansed with soap and water.

 However, preliminary data from a previous study at Rush University Medical Center showed that a chlorhexidine (CHG)-impregnated cloth (2% CHG Antiseptic Cloth system, Sage Products, Inc.

) decreased skin bacteria and may lessen bacteria in the blood stream.

 The 2% CHG Antiseptic Cloth system is a non-irritating, no-rinse, cleansing and moisturizing product that contains 2% chlorhexidine gluconate.

 The goal of this proposed study is to further evaluate the effectiveness of the 2% CHG Antiseptic Cloth system compared with soap and water in cleansing the skin and preventing bacteria from entering the bloodstream.
