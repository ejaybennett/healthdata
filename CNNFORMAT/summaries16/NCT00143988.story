(firstQuint)Heart Rate and Blood Pressure Response During Exercise and Sexual Activity in Normotensive and Hypertensive Volunteers.

 Physical exertion will be measured by a standardized treadmill test.

 Sexual activity will be performed in the study subject's home with his/her spouse or regular partner.

 Each study subject will wear a blood pressure and heart rate monitor at home during their sexual activity and will be asked to complete a one page diary upon completion of the activity.

 Normotensive and subject with mild hypertension will be studied to determine if hypertensive subjects have a relatively greater increase in their blood pressure during either physical exercise or sexual activity.
