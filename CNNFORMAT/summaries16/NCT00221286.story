(fifthQuint)Efficacy and Safety of PegIFN +/- FTC / TDF to Treat Chronic Hepatitis B in HIV-Coinfected Patients.

 Even though the generated data on standard interferon for the treatment of chronic HBV-infection in HIV-coinfected patients appears not promising at the moment, it is however the only treatment with a curative intention.

 Trials with pegylated interferon in the treatment of chronic HBV-infection in monoinfected patients with pegylated interferons showed higher efficacy than standard of care and when compared to historic data higher efficacy compared to non-pegylated interferon.

 This suggests in parallel a higher efficacy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in HIV-coinfected as well.

 At the same time, analysis suggested a further benefit when pegylated interferon therapy was prolonged beyond 24 weeks to 48 weeks as the elimination of HBV-DNA from serum appeared to continue beyond 24 weeks.

 Looking again at data from chronic hepatitis C infection, it is well known that the elimination kinetics of HCV-RNA in HIV-coinfected patients is slower compared to HCV-monoinfected patients, clearly suggesting rationale to offer 48 weeks pegylated interferon for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B to HIV-coinfected patients as well.

 Parallel to the above said there are several other factors suggesting a positive effect of a combination treatment with nucleoside / nucleotide analogues active against HBV and interferon.

 Therefore patients in need for antiretroviral therapy with CD4-cells above 200/ mu l will be randomized to either PegIFN as part of a combination treatment with FTC and TDF or to FTC / TDF combination therapy alone.

 Patients receiving HAART will also receive a third active antiretroviral HIV-drug, either a non-nucleoside analogue (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI), at the choice of the investigator.

 A non-divergent antiretroviral therapy solely based on nucleoside analogues will not be allowed in this trial.

 The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy (HBV-DNA copies/ml, loss of HBe-Ag, HBe-seroconversion) and safety (adverse events, serious adverse events) of PegIFN for 48 weeks, to that of PegIFN for 48 weeks plus TDF and FTC containing HAART, to that of TDF and FTC containing HAART for 72 weeks.

 Efficacy and Safety of PegIFN +/- FTC / TDF to Treat Chronic Hepatitis B in HIV-Coinfected Patients@highlight

The efficacy of pegylated interferons in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has shown superior results to standard of care in patients only infected with hepatitis B.

 The efficacy of pegylated interferon for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in HIV-coinfected patients is not known at present.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of pegylated interferon in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in HIV-infected individuals.

 Apart from evaluating the efficacy of pegylated interferon therapy in this setting as such, i.

e.

 in patients without present or future need of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV-infection, there is a second purpose of this study, to investigate whether combination treatment of HBV-infection may be superior to pegylated interferon therapy alone.

 Therefore patients without need of HAART are offered pegylated interferon alfa-2a over 48 weeks.

 Patients who require HAART are offered emtricitabine / tenofovir DF containing HAART over 72 weeks PLUS pegylated interferon alfa-2a over 48 weeks vs.

 emtricitabine / tenofovir DF containing HAART over 72 weeks WITHOUT pegylated interferon-alfa-2a.
