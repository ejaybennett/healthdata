(thirdQuint)Effect of Exercise on Blood Coagulation in Persons With Chronic Spinal Cord Injury.

 Regular moderate intensity physical exercise decreases platelet aggregability as a consequence of increasing levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and reducing levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).

 In addition, the exercise-associated improvement in the lipid profile and reduction in fat mass may decrease platelet aggregability and blood coagulation, as well as increase fibrinolysis.

 Thus, it can be hypothesized that physical exercise training has a powerful beneficial impact on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis.

 Although, regular exercise has been shown to reduce the incidence of CVD and death or causes a regression of symptoms in able-bodied individuals, this salutary effect of prolonged (months) exercise in persons with SCI has not been documented.

 The present study will evaluate the effects on hemostasis of exercise training in persons with chronic SCI.

 The effect of exercise on hemostasis will be determined in persons with SCI, a population appreciated to have an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

 It is anticipated that this study will ultimately increase our understanding of CVD in this group, and it will eventually help reduce the occurrence of premature macrovascular disease.

 Effect of Exercise on Blood Coagulation in Persons With Chronic Spinal Cord Injury@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if exercise affects the clotting of blood (hemostasis).

 The effect of exercise on hemostasis will be determined in persons with spinal cord injury, a population reported to have an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

 It is expected that this study will increase our understanding of CVD in persons with SCI, and it will eventually help reduce the occurrence of premature heart disease.
