(fifthQuint)A Phase 1-2 Trial of Cetuximab in Combination With Oxaliplatin, Capecitabine, and Radiation Therapy Followed by Surgery for Locally-advanced Rectal Cancer.

 Part of the treatment plan for this study is surgical removal of the tumor that is planned to occur 6 to 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy (XRT).

 This study consists of 2 distinct phases (Phase 1 and Phase 2).

 In Phase 1, the objectives are to 1.

 Assess dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and 2.

 Determine a maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) The Phase 1 endpoints are assessed on an initial cohort of patients after the completion of the chemo-radiotherapy regimen at defined timepoints that precede surgery.

 Phase 2 is the efficacy assessment portion of this study.

 In Phase 2, the objective is to accrue an expansion cohort.

 Efficacy assessments for phase 2 are to be assessed across all study participants at the time of, or after, surgery, as measured by the pathologic response rate; downstaging; and survival at 5 years from the start of treatment.
