(fifthQuint)Busulfan, Melphalan, and Thiotepa in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant for Hodgkin's or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the therapeutic efficacy of a myeloablative preparative regimen comprising busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation in patients with Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 - Determine the toxic effects of this preparative regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: - Myeloablative preparative regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -8 to -6, melphalan IV over 15-30 minutes on days -5 and -4, and thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2.

 - Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation: Patients undergo PBSC transplantation on day 0 followed by filgrastim (G-CSF) IV over 30 minutes beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.

 - Intrathecal chemotherapy: Patients with a history of treated Central Nervous System (CNS) disease or at high-risk for CNS relapse receive methotrexate and cytarabine intrathecally (IT) for 2 doses each within 10 days prior to transplantation and 4-6 doses each beginning on day 32 post-transplantation.

 - Consolidation therapy: Patients with residual bulk disease at 80-100 days post-transplantation that is > 2.

5 cm by CT scan may undergo local radiotherapy to residual scar/disease provided it can be encompassed in a single radiation port and the volume of lung to be irradiated is 20%.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly for 1 month, monthly for 6 months, every 3 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Chemotherapy, such as busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa, may destroy cancerous blood-forming cells (stem cells) in the blood and bone marrow.

 Giving the patient their healthy stem cells will help their bone marrow make new stem cells that become red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa work in treating patients who are undergoing an autologous stem cell transplant for Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
