(firstQuint)Quality of Life of Children With Sickle Cell Disease Who Are Getting Chronic Transfusions With a Lifeport.

 There is a paucity of research that focuses specifically on quality of life (QoL) among patients with sickle cell.

 This study aims to explore the QoL of children who are receiving chronic transfusion therapy (CTT) using a Lifeport device, which allows them to undergo erythrocytapheresis, rather than standard transfusion therapy.

 Erythrocytapheresis is less time consuming and is associated with less iron overload than conventional transfusion therapy; however, little is known about the implications for the child's QoL.

 This study will explore QoL from the child's perspective.

This study is being done to see what impact having a Lifeport device has on quality of life for children with sickle cell who are getting chronic transfusions, from the child's perspective.
