(firstQuint)Argatroban Stroke Treatment - A Pilot Safety Study.

 All patients with acute ischemic stroke who qualify for IV rt-PA under accepted guidelines, and who have an occluded middle cerebral artery documented on TCD, receive standard dose IV rt-PA and a bolus and 48 hour infusion of argatroban aimed at prolonging the aPTT 1.

75 X baseline.

 Follow up CT scanning and TCD every 30 minutes for 2 hours and then daily will determine the incidence of hemorrhage, recanalization and reocclusion, and serial neurological exam will determine the clinical outcome.

 For patients without temporal windows, a baseline CT-Angiogram (CTA) demonstrating arterial occlusion can also be enrolled.

 In those patients, a follow-up CTA (24-36 hours) will be performed.

Is the combination of low doses of argatroban in combination with rt-PA safe, and does it increase recanalization in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
