(fifthQuint)The Study to Compare SMART Nitinol Stent and Balloon Angioplasty.

 The study population will consist of 120 symptomatic peripheral vascular disease patients with SFA occlusions.

 The disease will consist of symptomatic, de novo or restenotic occlusions (5 - 22 cm) on diagnostic imaging.

 The occlusions must not extend beyond the proximal popliteal artery.

 For the purpose of this protocol, no lesion within 3 cm of the upper part of the patella may be treated.

 At least one calf vessel must be patent.

 Reference vessel diameter must be >= 4.

 The Study to Compare SMART Nitinol Stent and Balloon Angioplasty@highlight

This is a multi-center prospective, randomized, two-arm study evaluating performance of the Cordis SMART cent Nitinol Stent System compared to balloon angioplasty.

 Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis.

 It is anticipated that a total of 120 patients will be entered into the study.
