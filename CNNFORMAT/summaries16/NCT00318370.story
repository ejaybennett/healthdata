(secondQuint)Effectiveness of MORAb-003 in Women With Ovarian Cancer Who Have Relapsed After Platinum-Based Chemotherapy.

 MORAb-003 is a monoclonal antibody that has the potential to be an effective agent against epithelial ovarian cancer (including primary fallopian tube and peritoneal adenocarcinoma) either alone or in combination with other drugs.

 MORAb-003 works by a different mechanism from other cancer therapeutics and has been shown to be well tolerated.

 This study allows the opportunity to determine if MORAb-003 can work either as a single agent 1.

 to treat a CA125-only relapse, or 2.

 in combination with standard platinum and taxane chemotherapy to treat a symptomatic relapse, and 3.

 to prolong a second response to chemotherapy.
