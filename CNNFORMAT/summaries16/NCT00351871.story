(firstQuint)Influence of Marker of Insulin Resistance Upon Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Treatment Responses to PEG Intron and Rebetol Therapy.

 The relationship between HCV and IR is an evolving one.

 This study will allow a more formal evaluation of this relationship.

 Four hundred patients will be treated using weight based Peg Intron and Rebetol.

 Clinical and biochemical data related to IR will be collected to determine if any such factors can predict who will have a sustained virological response.

 To evaluate patients for insulin resistance, the HOMA score (the product of the fasting insulin level and blood glucose level), waist circumference, and body mass index will be measured.
