(secondQuint)A Study of Meditation as a Treatment for Epilepsy.

 Individuals who have uncontrolled epilepsy commonly experience disability, depression, anxiety and injuries from seizures.

 For such individuals, ideal treatments should improve quality of life through control of seizures and improved emotional state.

 Meditation with cultivation of emotional balance is known to improve emotional state and may also benefit seizure control in some individuals.

 In this study, individuals with uncontrolled epilepsy will receive detailed training in meditation to determine whether the training leads to improvements in seizure control and various measures of emotion and quality of life.
