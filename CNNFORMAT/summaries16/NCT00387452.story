(fifthQuint)Exercise and Cardiovascular Control During Upright Tilt in Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes.

 1.

 PURPOSE: Older adults with diabetes faint frequently, due to an impairment in the cardiovascular control mechanisms (arterial baroreceptor function, autonomic nervous system function and cerebral autoregulation) that prevent syncope.

 The purpose of this study is to examine the ability of different intensities of aerobic exercise to reverse these impairments.

 2.

 HYPOTHESES: a) Aerobic or strength training will improve the compensatory cardiovascular responses that prevent syncope in older adults with Type 2 diabetes.

 Aerobic training will: - increase arterial baroreflex sensitivity - increase heart rate variability (marker of autonomic nervous system function) - decrease cerebrovascular resistance - improve cerebral autoregulation during upright tilt.

 b) There will be relationship between the improvement in compensatory cardiovascular responses and aerobic or strength training.

 c) The majority of the benefits of aerobic or strength exercise on the above parameters will with which training, allowing for the design of more practicable training prescriptions than that used in a research setting.

 Exercise and Cardiovascular Control During Upright Tilt in Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes@highlight

Older persons with diabetes have a harder time maintaining blood pressure when standing up.

 When blood pressure drops when standing up, fainting may occur.

 This study will see how regular exercise can improve the ability of the body to keep blood pressure up when standing.

 We want to see how this improvement varies with different types of exercise.

 The types of exercise that we will be studying are aerobic (running or cycling on a stationary bike) and strength training (weight lifting).
