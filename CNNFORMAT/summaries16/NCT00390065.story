(fifthQuint)Follow-Up at 6 Years of a Cohort of Children Born Very Prematurely.

 Utilization of nitric oxide therapy in the neonatal period has been related to a trend towards short term improvements in respiratory and neurological outcome at 28 days postnatal age or 36 weeks postconceptional age.

 A two year follow-up in children treated soon after birth with NO in the neonatal period, suggests that a significant improvement in neurodevelopmental outcome might occur.

 No long term evaluation on respiratory outcome has yet been done.

 This study aims to evaluate respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcome at 6 years of age in children born very prematurely, some of them having had Nitric Oxide as a rescue treatment for respiratory distress syndrome.

Utilization of nitric oxide (NO) therapy has been related to a trend towards short term improvement in very premature infants.

 A two year follow-up of children treated soon after birth with NO in the neonatal period, suggests that a significant improvement in neurodevelopmental outcome might occur.

 This study aims to evaluate follow-up at 6 years, in respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcome, of children born very prematurely, some of them having been treated with nitric oxide in the neonatal period.
