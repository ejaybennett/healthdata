(secondQuint)Dehydroepiandrosterone Administration in Women With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or Primary Sjgren's Syndrome.

 Fatigue and reduced general well-being are frequent complaints in patients with the chronic autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS).

 Uncontrolled studies suggested that the administration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may improve such complaints.

 The aim of our randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study is to examine the effect of daily oral 200 mg DHEA on fatigue, well-being, and functioning in women with SLE or pSS.
