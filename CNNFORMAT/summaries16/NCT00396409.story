(secondQuint)Efficacy/ Safety of Omalizumab in Patients With Seasonal Allergic Asthma and Seasonal Allergic Rhinoconjunctivitis.

 This was an open-label extension period of the previously randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to demonstrate the benefit of pre- and co-seasonal combination therapy with anti-IgE (omalizumab) and specific immunotherapy (Depigoid) in patients with seasonal allergic asthma and co-morbid seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

 During the open-label period, all patients received Depigoid monotherapy for two follow-up seasons every 4 weeks, 26 injections in total.

 The extension period was performed to evaluate the influence of omalizumab on the follow-up treatment with Depigoid in seasonal asthma.

 This study was a follow-up to the core IGE025ADE03 study, in which patients received omalizumab treatment.

 In this follow-up study, no patient received omalizumab.
