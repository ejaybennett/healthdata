(thirdQuint)Further Acute Research of a Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator (S-ICD) System.

 The objectives of this study are to further evaluate the S-ICD system's ability to identify and terminate induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients acutely with an S-ICD emulator and parasternal electrode during the implant procedure of a standard transvenous ICD.

 The active emulator is not a powered medical device and all elements of the test system are removed following the testing.

 This acute intra-operative protocol will test the ability of the electrode and emulator to appropriately convert the arrhythmia and allos an assessment of post shock pacing.

 Further Acute Research of a Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator (S-ICD) System@highlight

The purpose is to further evaluate the operation, safety, and feasibility of a subcutaneous implantable defibrillator (S-ICD) system in patients who require an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)for treating ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

 The S-ICD electrode and pulse generator emulator will be briefly implanted and tested during the standard implantation procedure of an ICD, but then the S-ICD system will be removed entirely.
