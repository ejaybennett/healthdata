(thirdQuint)An Open-Label Trial of Duloxetine for the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

 IBS is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and abdominal bloating for which no organic cause can be determined.

 Duloxetine has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of depression as well as in several pain syndromes including diabetic peripheral neuropathy and fibromyalgia.

 We hypothesize that it will be a safe and efficacious treatment for the symptoms of IBS, in particular abdominal pain.

 We plan to study 15 male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 years who have had gastrointestinal symptoms at least 2 days/week for greater than six months and who have been diagnosed with IBS by a physician.

 During the 12-week study, subjects will receive open-label duloxetine titrated up to 60mg/day.

 Subjects will be asked to complete a total of ten study visits during the 12-week study period.

 All study visits will be conducted at McLean Hospital.

 An Open-Label Trial of Duloxetine for the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome@highlight

We hypothesize that duloxetine treatment will be associated with improvement in symptoms of IBS, particularly abdominal pain, in individuals without comorbid major depressive disorder.

 During this 12-week, open-label, outpatient study, male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 years who have been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) will be treated with open-label duloxetine.
