(fifthQuint)Adaptation Dose of Enoxaparin in Moderate Renal Failure Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome.

 Included patients will be those hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome with indication of enoxaparin treatment.

 A same initial dose of 1 mg/kg will be administrated to all patients.

 According to creatinine clearance, the next doses (every 12 hours subcutaneously) will be adjusted with a 25% dose reduction if creatinine clearance is comprised between 30 and 50 ml/min.

 After the fourth dose, the anti-Xa plasma levels (main endpoint) will be measured at peak (between 3 and 5 hours after dose administration).

 Residual values of antiXa will also be measured before the fifth dose administration (secondary criteria).

 The objective is to demonstrate a bio-equivalence of efficacy on the anti-Xa values obtained in patients with moderate rela failure compared with patients with creatinine clearance higher than 50 ml/min.

 Thrombotic and bleeding events will be recorded during hospitalisation.

 140 per-protocol evaluable consecutive patients will have to be obtained: 70 with creatinine clearance higher than 50 ml/min and 70 patients with creatinin clearance between 30 and 50 ml/min.

 Adaptation Dose of Enoxaparin in Moderate Renal Failure Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome@highlight

The objective of the VALIDE study is to validate that a 25% dose reduction of enoxaparine in patients with moderate renal failure (creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 ml/min) and hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome provides at steady state a similar anti Xa level in plasma compared to that obtained in patients without renal failure and receiving the usual dose of 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours.

 140 per - protocol patients are planned to be included.
