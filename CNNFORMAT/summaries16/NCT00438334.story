(fifthQuint)Real-World Benefit From Directional Hearing Aids.

 Subjects- 105 subjects were recruited for participation in this study, thirty-five in each of three hearing loss groups.

 Subjects were assigned to the three groups according to the severity of their hearing losses.

 Group 1 (mild) subjects exhibited normal sloping to moderately severe SNHL, with Pure Tone Averages (PTAs) at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz of less than 35 dB HL.

 Group 2 (moderate) consisted of subjects with mild sloping to moderately severe SNHL with PTAs of 35 to 50 dB HL.

 Group 3 (severe) subjects exhibited moderately-severe, sloping to severe-profound SNHL, with PTAs of greater than 50.

 All subjects had sloping hearing loss defined as at least a 20 dB average difference between 3000 Hz and 500 Hz.

 (Due to subject drop-out, the final data consisted of 32 subjects in the mild group, 33 in moderate group, and 29 in the severe group) Hearing status was assessed by means of audiometric pure-tone and speech recognition testing in a group of previous hearing aid users.

 Normal middle ear function was verified by means of immittance measures.

 All subjects exhibited absence of significant air-bone gap at any frequency ( azimuth.

 Uncorrelated noise was delivered from the seven bipolar loudspeakers (Definitive Technologies BP-2X) spaced equally about the listener [approximately 25, 76, 128, 180, 232, 284, 335].

 The use of bipolar loudspeakers allowed for a more diffuse source position in comparison to standard, front-firing loudspeakers.

 All speakers were equidistant (1.

5m) from the subject's head.

 Speech and noise levels were controlled using a Pentium IV class computer and an eight-channel level controller (Ashly VCM-88).

 Hearing aid fitting protocol: Hearing aid gain was determined using the National Acoustics Laboratory-Revised (NAL-R) prescriptive targets and verified using real-ear (Fonix 6500) measurements.

 Hearing aid frequency-gain parameters were adjusted so that the measured real ear aided response matched the target response as closely as possible for octave frequencies from 500 to 4000 Hz for both omnidirectional and directional modes.

 The matches to target are reported in the results.

 The processing strategy of the experimental hearing aids was set as output compression to match each subject's previous hearing aids.

 Targets were matched for a 65 dB SPL composite noise input.

 A real ear saturation response was obtained with a 90 dB SPL broadband input to ensure that high-level stimuli did not exceed listener discomfort levels, and the hearing aid output was adjusted accordingly.

 In order to maintain a double-blind experiment, the hearing aid programming, fitting, and real ear measurements were performed by one investigator who recorded how the hearing aid was set (omnidirectional or directional) for each visit.

 This investigator kept these data until the subject completed all aspects of the study.

 Furthermore, the investigator who programmed and fit the hearing aids was not involved in further data collection with that subject.

 Since all subjects were previous users of binaural amplification, a brief orientation to the use of the experimental hearing aids should be sufficient.

 Subjects were issued a remote control with a volume control and three program buttons.

 Program 1 was set with the default setting (directional or omnidirectional).

 In order to ensure subject safety, an omnidirectional program was included in program two across both conditions; however, subjects were instructed only to use program two in situations where it was necessary to hear sounds from all angles equally (e.

g.

 crossing the street in traffic, etc.

).

 Program three on the remote control was set to mute, so that subjects could use only the first two programs.

 Subjects were be given identical instructions for both settings (omnidirectional and directional) and the investigator who gave the instructions did not know which setting was currently in the subject's hearing aids.

 Subjects were told that the hearing aids are likely to work best in noise if they could position themselves so that the signal of interest is in front of them and the interfering noise behind.

 Subjects were instructed on cleaning, care, battery usage, and volume control adjustment.

 Subjects were asked to wear the experimental hearing aids as much as possible during waking hours, minimally 6 hours/day.

 Subjects were asked to log their daily hearing aid use on a log sheet that will be provided to verify that they met the 6 hour/day.

 Additionally, subjects recorded how much time each day was spent in each of the two programs.

 Subjective measures: PHAB- The investigator who administered the subjective measures was masked as to the experimental settings of the hearing aids.

 All subjects completed the Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (PHAB) questionnaire for each condition: unaided, previous aid, experimental directional, and experimental omnidirectional.

 The PHAB is a 66-item inventory that was developed for research usage to generate a measure of hearing aid benefit.

 Subjects completed the 66 items once for unaided listening and once for each aided condition.

 The test instrument was scored based on the benefit provided for aided versus unaided conditions.

 SADL- All subjects completed the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Living (SADL) questionnaire for each of the three aided conditions.

 The SADL was designed to quantify satisfaction with hearing aids.

 This scale consists of 15 items in four subscales: positive effects of amplification, service and costs, negative features, and personal image.

 Subjects respond to questions about their general opinions of wearing hearing aids.

 For the current study, the 3 questions on cost and service were omitted, because the subjects did not pay for the hearing aids, only wore the experimental hearing aids for one month before completing the survey.

 Preference questionnaire- At the conclusion of a subject's involvement in the study, he/she was asked which hearing aid was preferred for quiet and noisy environments as well as if she/he had an overall preference for any of the three hearing aid conditions.

 Real-World Benefit From Directional Hearing Aids@highlight

Directional microphone hearing aids have been shown to provide benefit for individuals with hearing loss in a number of laboratory experiments.

 However, few studies have investigated the real-world, subject-reported benefit from these hearing aids, and even fewer have examined directional hearing aid benefit across varying degrees of hearing loss.

 This study will summarize data from a three-year, multi-faceted study of directional hearing aid benefit.

 Ninety four subjects were divided into three hearing loss groups (normal-to-moderate, mild-to-moderately-severe, and moderate-to-profound).

 These subjects were then fit with experimental hearing aids set to either directional or omnidirectional mode to determine if significant differences were present in hearing aid outcomes (both subjective and objective).

 Both subject and experimenter were blinded to the hearing aid settings.

 Following one month of use in each experimental setting, subjects completed: probe microphone measurements, speech understanding in noise testing, use questionnaires, subjective benefit scales, and satisfaction scales.

 At the conclusion of the study, subjects rated their preferences for the experimental settings in quiet, noise and overall.

 Both objective measures, as well as subjective data, were analyzed across hearing aid and hearing loss conditions.
