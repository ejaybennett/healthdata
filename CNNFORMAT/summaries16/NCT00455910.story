(fifthQuint)Thalidomide at Low Dose for the Treatment of Patient With Myelodysplastic Syndromes - THAL-SMD-200.

 Thalidomide: First part of the trial: 82 patients at 200mg/day given at bedtime x 12 weeks, decreased to 100mg/day if grade 1 or 2 side.

 Stopped temporally for 1 week if grade 3 or 4 side effects.

 Then reintroduced at the same dose.

 If side effects again, definitively stopped.

 Responses evaluated at 12 weeks according to IWG criteria for the erythroid lineage At week 12: - If no Hematological improvement (HI): increased to 300mg/day for 8 weeks and then eventually to 400mg/day for 8 weeks more, if no HI.

 - If Hematological improvement (HI): continued at the same dose.

 Second part of the trial: 30 patients treated at 50mg/day x 12 weeks.

 Responses evaluated at 12 weeks according to IWG criteria for the erythroid lineage At week 12: - If no Hematological improvement (HI): increased to 100mg/day for 8 weeks and then eventually to 200mg/day for 8 weeks more, if no HI.

 - If Hematological improvement (HI): continued at the same dose.

 Thalidomide at Low Dose for the Treatment of Patient With Myelodysplastic Syndromes - THAL-SMD-200@highlight

The GFM previously conducted a dose-escalating phase II trial of thalidomide in MDS with a minimum dose of 200mg/d and a maximum dose 800mg/d.

 Responses were evaluated according to IWG criteria at week 16 and thalidomide continued up to week 56 in responders.

 82% patients received at least 8 weeks of treatment and were evaluable.

 59% had hematological improvement, mainly on the erythroid lineage (Increase of Hemoglobin).

 Most responses were observed at low doses and between 4 and 8 weeks.

 The objectives of this trial (Thal-SMD-20) are to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of lower doses thalidomide in low risk MDS patients with transfusion-dependant anemia.
