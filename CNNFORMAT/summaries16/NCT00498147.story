(thirdQuint)Determining Rates of Cardiovascular Complications Among Patients of a Managed Diabetes Care Program.

 The DECIDE study will identify whether cardiovascular complication rates (the composite rate of myocardial infarction (MI), Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), stroke, carotid endarterectomy, peripheral revascularization, and peripheral amputation) are lower in patients who participate in managed diabetes care by ADEC in comparison to provincial and national rates.

 Comparison statistics will be provided by the Institute of Evaluative Sciences (ICES) Atlas 2003 and other Diabetes studies such as the 2005 DICE study.

 Complications such as nephropathy and retinopathy will be documented, along with hospitalization rates and all cause mortality.

 Clinical outcomes relevant to diabetes management such as blood pressure and lipids will also be compared.

 Determining Rates of Cardiovascular Complications Among Patients of a Managed Diabetes Care Program@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to identify whether cardiovascular complication rates are lower in patients who participate in managed diabetes care, in comparison to provincial and national rates.

 This study will involve an electronic medical record (EMR) chart audit, augmented by a manual review of hospital and other pertinent medical records, as necessary.
