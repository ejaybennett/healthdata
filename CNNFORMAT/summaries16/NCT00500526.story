(thirdQuint)Effects of Singing in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

 Thirty COPD patients in stable clinical conditions are going to be randomized in two groups: the first one is going to have singing classes for six months; the other one is going to have classes of general manual arts for a similar period of time.

 The patients of both groups are going to perform spirometry, measurements of maximal respiratory pressures and answer the health related quality of life questionnaires SF-36 and Saint George's before the beginning of practice and after 6 months.

Both singing and manual arts practices are going to be administered one hour a week by specialized teachers.

 Effects of Singing in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the practice of singing for a long period of time on pulmonary function data, quality of life, and dyspnea sensation of patients with COPD in stable clinical conditions.

 As singing is a type of respiratory training, the study hypothesis is that singing would improve maximal respiratory pressures, dyspnea sensation, and overall quality of life of these patients.
