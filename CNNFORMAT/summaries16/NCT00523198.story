(fifthQuint)Correlation Salivary Cortisol and Free Serum Cortisol to Total Serum Cortisol in MICU Septic Shock.

 Free serum cortisol is considered the active hormone.

 In patients with septic shock only the total serum cortisol level is available, however, the free cortisol level can be normal despite a low total cortisol level due to changes in the serum protein.

 The hormone can be replaced improperly in these patients and contribute to poor outcome in septic shock.

 We are studying adult MICU patients with septic shock who are not receiving corticosteroid replacement.

 This study does not include any intervention.

 In-hospital or 28-day mortality are registered in all the patients.

 Correlation Salivary Cortisol and Free Serum Cortisol to Total Serum Cortisol in MICU Septic Shock@highlight

The purpose of the study is: - to correlate salivary cortisol to free serum cortisol (as salivary cortisol is considered to be almost complete free cortisol) and, - to correlate free serum cortisol to total serum cortisol levels Both in patients with septic shock (severe sepsis requiring vasopressors).

 We believe that: - total serum cortisol does not correlate with free serum cortisol in patient with septic shock and, - that salivary cortisol correlates with free serum cortisol and can be used to determine the level of free serum cortisol.
