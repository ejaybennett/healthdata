(thirdQuint)Effect of Epoetin Alfa on Hemoglobin, Symptom Distress, and Quality of Life in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy.

 This study was an open-label (patients and investigators knew what treatment was being given), randomized (patients were assigned to a treatment group by chance) study of lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or multiple myeloma patients.

 This study addressed the clinical and patient-management consequences of treating mild to moderate anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) between 10 and 12 g/dL).

 The design of the study compared the effect of treating higher Hb levels to current standard of care criteria on Hb levels, transfusion requirements, and patient reported outcomes (quality of life, health care resource utilization, and productivity).

 Patients were randomized according to their Hb levels.

 Two entry criteria were specified during the course of the trial.

 Initially, patients were enrolled with Hb levels >= 11 g/dL and then randomized to receive 1) Immediate epoetin alfa treatment or 2) Observed after Hb levels fell below 11 g/dL.

 Epoetin alfa treatment was provided to the Observed group if and when Hb levels fell below 9.

0 g/dL.

 Slow recruitment of patients in to the study resulted in a protocol amendment.

 Subsequently, if a patient presented with a Hb between 10 and 12 g/dL, the patient was randomized to the Immediate or to the Observed groups.

 Patients presenting with Hgb > 12 g/dL but otherwise eligible, were not randomized until Hb dropped to 1.

0 g/dL, the dose was increased to 60,000 U sc qw.

 If at any time, the Hb rose above 15 g/dL on 2 consecutive evaluations, PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) was stopped until the Hb dropped to below 13 g/dL and then resumed.

 Effect of Epoetin Alfa on Hemoglobin, Symptom Distress, and Quality of Life in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy@highlight

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of epoetin alfa treatment on hemoglobin (Hb) response, quality of life (QoL), health care resource utilization and patient productivity when epoetin alfa was administered during chemotherapy to patients with mild anemia or after waiting until patients became moderately anemic.

 Patients with lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or Multiple Myeloma (MM) were studied.
