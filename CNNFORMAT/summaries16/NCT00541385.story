 Falciparum Malaria Pediatric Patients.

 The need for safe and efficacious anti-malarial treatments for infants and children is huge given that they are the major group affected by acute uncomplicated malaria.

 There are relatively few paediatric formulations of artemisinin combination therapies.

 In addition to the tablet formulation of pyronaridine artesunate (PA) (PYRAMAX), Shin Poong Pharm Co is developing a paediatric dosing form presented as a granule formulation, packed in appropriate aluminium sachets each containing 60mg pyronaridine tetraphosphate and 20mg artesunate.

 This Phase III study is designed to demonstrate that the efficacy of PA granule formulation, as assessed in terms of PCR-corrected APCR, is above 90% and subsequently to compare (non-inferiority) the efficacy and safety of PA granule formulation to Coartem(R) crushed tablets in infants and children.
