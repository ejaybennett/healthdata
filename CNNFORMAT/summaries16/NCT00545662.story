(secondQuint)Study of Citicoline for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury (COBRIT).

 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability.

 In the United States alone approximately 1.

4 million sustain a TBI each year, of which 50,000 people die, and over 200,000 are hospitalized.

 Despite numerous prior clinical trials no standard pharmacotherapy for the treatment of TBI has been established in either the acute or post acute setting.

 Citicoline is a naturally occurring endogenous compound.

 This compound offers the potential of employing neuroprotection, neuro-recovery and neurofacilitation to enhance recovery after TBI.

 The primary goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of citicoline compared to placebo on functional and cognitive outcome in participants with traumatic brain injury.
