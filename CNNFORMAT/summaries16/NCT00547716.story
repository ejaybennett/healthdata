(fifthQuint)Use of Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Fish Oil) in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Infection.

 Hepatic steatosis may be present in up to 66% of cases of chronic Hepatitis C infection.

 Previous studies have reported steatosis to be an independent predictor of treatment failure in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.

 The pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in chronic Hepatitis C infection has not been fully elucidated.

 Hepatic steatosis is a manifestation of excessive triglyceride accumulation in the liver.

 Hypertriglyceridemia may benefit from Omega-3 fatty acid (fish oil supplements) which, by reducing VLDL production can lower the serum triglyceride concentration by as much as 50 percent or more.

 The treatment of chronic hepatitis C results in an average sustained viral response rate of 54%-63%.

 We have found response rates of around 50% on treatment of patients.

 We hypothesize that by giving omega-3 fatty acids along with interferon therapy for patients with Hepatitis C, we may be able to increase the treatment response rates.

 Thus, the purpose of the study is to look at the effect of omega 3 fatty acids on early and sustained viral response rates in patients with chronic HCV infection.

 Use of Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Fish Oil) in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Infection@highlight

Hepatitis C virus infection is the most common blood-borne infection in the United States and is a leading cause of chronic liver disease affecting 130 million people around the world.

 It is estimated that 1.

6% of the US population may be affected by Hepatitis C infection.

 The only recommended treatment that has been approved for your condition is the use of interferon and ribavirin.

 In patients with chronic Hepatitis C, there tends to be an accumulation of fat in the liver.

 Fatty liver has been associated with failure of treatment.

 The accumulation of fat in the liver has been blamed on a particular type of fat called triglycerides.

 Fish oil, by reducing a type of fat called VLDL, can lower the triglyceride concentration by as much as 50 percent or more.

 This study seeks to determine if the administration of fish oil along with standard treatment to patients with Hepatitis C will increase the treatment response rates.
