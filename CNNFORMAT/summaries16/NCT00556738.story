(fifthQuint)Intrapulmonary Percussive Ventilation (IPV) Versus Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation (nCPAP) in Transient Respiratory Distress of the Newborn.

 - Principal Objective: To show that IPV ventilation can decrease the duration of transient respiratory distress as well as the risk of complications.

 - Secondary Objective: Comparison between the two groups regarding: Length of oxygen therapy, complications (pneumothorax, pulmonary infections), need for intensive care hospitalization - Study design: Open, prospective randomized trial.

 - Inclusion criteria: Neonates with gestational age 35 weeks and weight 2000g, caesarean section, respiratory distress syndrome (modified Silverman score > 5, SpO2 < 90%), management within 20 minutes after birth.

 - Exclusion criteria: clinical thoracic retraction, congenital lung malformation, meconium aspiration, neonatal infection, other congenital malformations.

 - Study plan: After the screening evaluation and written consent document, neonates will be randomized into two groups: nCPAP ventilation or IPV.

 During the 6 hours after randomization, clinical data will be monitored: cardiac and respiratory frequency (CF -RF), saturation (SaO2), oxygenotherapy, Silverman Score.

 Then, neonates will be supervised 3 days after normalization of the respiratory distress.

 - Number of subjects: 100 (50 in each group).

 Intrapulmonary Percussive Ventilation (IPV) Versus Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation (nCPAP) in Transient Respiratory Distress of the Newborn@highlight

During caesarean section, transient respiratory distress which occurs frequently (3%) with possible complications are at present managed by non invasive nasal continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (nCPAP) associated with oxygen therapy.

 Intrapulmonary Percussive Ventilation (IPV) is a non-invasive ventilatory mode used in some intensive care units to treat some respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn with a good tolerance, but without evaluation in prospective studies
