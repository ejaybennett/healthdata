(firstQuint)The Effect of Valproate on Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Severity.

 In Finland, 90% of subjects with opioid dependence are dependent on benzodiazepines too.

 Concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines has increasingly caused deaths.

 Benzodiazepine withdrawal treatment usually comprises gradual drug discontinuation.
