(thirdQuint)Ph II Bevacizumab + Etoposide for Pts w Recurrent MG.

 Exploratory, single-arm, ph II study designed to assess anti-tumor activity of combinatorial regimen consisting of Etoposide + Bevacizumab among patients with RMG.

 Primary endpoint of study is probability of progression-free survival at 6 months.

 Important secondary objective is to further assess safety of Etoposide & Bevacizumab for patients with recurrent malignant glioma.

 If study demonstrates that combinatorial regimen of Etoposide + Bevacizumab is associated with encouraging anti-tumor activity among patients with RMG, further assessment of regimen in additional phase II & possibly phase III studies, will be considered.
