(firstQuint)The Role of Nitric Oxide Synthase in Circulating Progenitor Cell Function.

 To determine if a correlation exists between EPC function and eNOS-dependent NO production in EPCs from populations with high versus low cardiovascular risk: 1.

 High and low cardiovascular risk subjects will be identified based on age or history of cardiovascular disease.

 Endothelial function will be measured by ultrasound.

 2.

 EPCs will be isolated from peripheral blood of these subjects.

 EPC function will be assessed by measuring adhesion to endothelium, migration, proliferation, and differentiation, and compared to their expression and activity of eNOS.

 The Role of Nitric Oxide Synthase in Circulating Progenitor Cell Function@highlight

Our main hypothesis is that EPC function is impaired in some populations with high cardiovascular risk as a result of reduced eNOS-dependent NO production.
