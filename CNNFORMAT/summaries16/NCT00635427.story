(secondQuint)An Open-Label Extension Study of GA-GCB ERT in Patients With Type 1 Gaucher Disease.

 Type 1 Gaucher disease, the most common form,accounts for more than 90% of all cases and does not involve the CNS.

 Typical manifestations of type 1 Gaucher disease include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bleeding tendencies, anemia, hypermetabolism, skeletal pathology, growth retardation, pulmonary disease, and decreased quality of life.

 Gene-Activated(R) human glucocerebrosidase (GA-GCB,velaglucerase alfa) is produced in a continuous human cell line using proprietary gene-activation technology and has an identical amino acid sequence to the naturally occurring human enzyme.

 GA-GCB contains terminal mannose residues that target the enzyme to the macrophages-the primary target cells in Gaucher disease.

 This study was designed to determine the long-term safety of GA-GCB in men, women, and children with Type 1 Gaucher disease.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of every other week dosing of Gene-Activated(R) human glucocerebrosidase (GA-GCB, velaglucerase alfa) intravenously in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease.
