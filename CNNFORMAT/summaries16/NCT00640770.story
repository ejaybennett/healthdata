(thirdQuint)Comparing Angioplasty and DES in the Treatment of Subjects With Ischemic Infrapopliteal Arterial Disease.

 This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study to be conducted in 18 centers in Europe.

 A total of 200 subjects will be entered into the study and will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either balloon angioplasty or the CYPHER SELECTTM + Coronary and Infrapopliteal Stent for infrapopliteal use in subjects with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (Rutherford 3, 4, or 5).

 All subjects will undergo a repeat angiography at 12 months to assess the primary endpoint of In-Segment Binary Restenosis.

 Follow-up visits are scheduled at 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months.

 Comparing Angioplasty and DES in the Treatment of Subjects With Ischemic Infrapopliteal Arterial Disease@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to compare the performance of the CYPHER SELECTTM + Sirolimus-eluting Balloon-expandable Coronary and Infrapopliteal Stent over balloon angioplasty in de novo and restenotic native below the knee tibioperoneal, anterior and/or posterior tibial and/or peroneal arterial lesions in a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical study.
