(secondQuint)Trial of Preoperative Hepatic and Regional Arterial Chemotherapy (PHRAC) to Prevent Postoperative Liver Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer.

 We administered FUDR, MMC and Oxaliplatin as preoperative hepatic and regional arterial chemotherapy (PHRAC) to patients with Stage II or Stage III colorectal cancer without apparent liver metastasis based on a thorough preoperative evaluation.

 The study endpoints were disease-free survival, overall survival, and liver metastasis-free survival as evaluated by intent-to-treat analysis.
