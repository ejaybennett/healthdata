(secondQuint)A Phase I Study to Evaluate the Oral Absorption of Nepadutant in Infants.

 This trial aims to evaluate the oral adsorption of nepadutant (0.

1 or 0.

5 mg/Kg given as one single dose as oral solution) in infants divided in three age strata (from 6 to 24 weeks old).

 Oral absorption is evaluated by measuring the amount of nepadutant in the urine output collected during the 24 hours after oral administration with special diapers.

 Safety and tolerability of the drug will be evaluated by monitoring any changes in signs/symptoms at medical examination and vital signs during the fist 4 hours post-dose in the Hospital site and then by the parents at home up to 24 hours and 1 week post nepadutant administration.
