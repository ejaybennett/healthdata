(secondQuint)Observational Study of Optical Correction for Strabismic Amblyopia in Children 3 to <7 Years Old.

 This study will evaluate the effectiveness of refractive correction alone for the treatment of previously untreated strabismic or combined-mechanism amblyopia in children 3 to = 2 lines from spectacle-corrected baseline acuity in 9 (75%; 95% CI = 43% - 95%) of the 12 patients with strabismic amblyopia and in 9 (69%, 95% CI = 39% - 91%) of the 13 patients with combined-mechanism amblyopia.

 Mean change from baseline to maximum improvement was 2.

2 +- 1.

8 and 2.

6 +- 2.

0 lines, respectively.

 These results are similar to those of Stewart and colleagues who reported visual acuity improvement averaging 3.

0 lines in 16 children with strabismic amblyopia and 1.

9 lines in 31 children with combined-mechanism amblyopia.

 Although our results support the suggestion of Stewart et al.

 that strabismic amblyopia can improve with spectacle correction alone, they are not conclusive because both studies had small numbers of patients.

 Also, our classification of strabismus was based on alignment without refractive correction.

 Thus, a larger controlled study is needed to confirm or refute these findings in patients with strabismic and combined-mechanism amblyopia.

 The ideal study design to answer the question of whether spectacles alone can significantly improve amblyopic eye visual acuity in strabismic children is a randomized trial with a control group who does not receive optical correction.

 However, most pediatric eye care providers would be reluctant to randomize esotropic children with hyperopic refractive error to a control group of no optical correction because of the likelihood of some children having accommodative esotropia, which would necessitate that hyperopic spectacles be prescribed.

 The number of esotropic amblyopes without an accommodative component is sufficiently few to make a randomized trial not feasible.

 Therefore, we have chosen to perform an observational study with a large number of children with pure strabismic and combined-mechanism amblyopia in order to evaluate the effect of refractive correction in this population of patients.
