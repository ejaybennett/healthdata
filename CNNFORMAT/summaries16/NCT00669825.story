(firstQuint)Study of ALV003 in Healthy Adult Volunteers and Subjects With Well-Controlled Celiac Disease Following a Gluten-Containing Meal.

 ALV003-0812 (the FED study) is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of the study drug, ALV003, administered at one of four different dose levels, and following a test meal containing a small amount (1 gram) of gluten.

 ALV003 has been demonstrated to proteolyze (assist with the digestion of) various forms of gluten (gluten flour, wheat bread) in laboratory studies and in animals.

 Celiac disease has been estimated to affect 1% of the population of the United States, is related to gluten, and has a wide range of clinical manifestations including chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, malabsorption, and bone disease.
