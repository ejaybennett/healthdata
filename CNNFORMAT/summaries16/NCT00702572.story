(secondQuint)Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, Bevacizumab and Vorinostat for Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 Since the regimen of bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel has become a standard regimen for the treatment of advanced non-squamous NSCLC, new studies in this patient population will have to include this as a reference arm.

 Addition of a fourth anti-cancer agent has now become the new strategy to improve the outcome for advanced non-squamous NSCLC.

 Since the regimen of Vorinostat, Carboplatin and Paclitaxel is already in advanced stage of development it is important to study the safety and tolerability of Vorinostat in combination with the three-drug regimen of Bevacizumab, Carboplatin and Paclitaxel.

 Therefore, we will evaluate Vorinostat when administered in combination with the regimen of Carboplatin, Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab for patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

The primary objective of the study is to establish the phase II recommended dose of Vorinostat when administered in combination with the regimen of carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab for patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lunc cancer.
