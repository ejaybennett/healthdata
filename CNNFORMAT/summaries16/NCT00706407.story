(fifthQuint)Uro-NIRS Clinical Study.

 This is a study of the fully integrated Uro-NIRS:UDS device (Laborie Triton or Laborie Dorado and Urodynamix's Non-Invasive Urodynamics device - Uro-NIRS), to confirm the results using the fully integrated Uro-NIRS:UDS device as compared to the stand-alone URO-NIRS device and UDS device.

 The study will evaluate male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and female subjects with over-active bladder (OAB).

 The Uro-NIRS unit uses near infrared light at 3 different wavelengths to measure changes in haemoglobin and cytochrome from the detrusor muscle from the human bladder wall.

 This process is similar to what is used for cerebral and muscle oxygenation monitoring (e.

g.

, pulse oximetry).

 Previous clinical feasibility studies have identified the correlation between the changes in haemoglobin and cytochrome and the pressure values obtained during urodynamics procedures and uroflow procedures.

 For this study the Uro-NIRS results specifically will not be used by the urologist/nurse to guide in patient management and treatment decisions, but rather will only be used to collect measurements from the patient.

 The Uro-NIRS sensor patch will be adhered to skin surface where their bladder is located.

 The study will be conducted by the two principal investigators at the two clinical study sites who will collectively enrol a minimum of 50 subjects, with a minimum of 35 male subjects and a maximum of 15 female subjects.

 The study enrolment objective is to equally enrol male subjects into three categories: unequivocal, obstructed and unobstructed.

 Female subjects shall all have OAB.

 Uro-NIRS Clinical Study@highlight

The purpose of this experiment is to confirm the results of previous testing of Urodynamix's Uro-NIRS device.

 Together Urodynamix and Laborie have created a device that includes standard Laborie medical equipment and the experimental Urodynamix device.

 Collectively this integrated device is considered an investigational device, and the results from this study may be used to support a submission to the US Food and Drug Administration for the approval of the integrated device.

 This research is being done because we want to test the ability of the integrated Laborie and Urodynamix device to provide a non-invasive method to provide additional information to assist with the diagnosis of or treatment plan of patients suffering from urinary problems.

 The current technologies rely solely on the measurement of internal pressures of the bladder, which involves the insertion of catheter into the subject's urethra.
