(thirdQuint)PharmacofMRI of Anxiolytic Medications (Pregabalin).

 Increased amygdala and insula activity have been implicated in neurobiological models of anxiety.

 Using fMRI, the anxiolytic medication, lorazepam, has previously been found to decrease activation in these areas during the processing of emotional stimuli.

 This study aims to replicate those results but by using a different medication, pregabalin.

 An eventual aim of this study, in combination with future studies, is to evaluate the utility of fMRI as a tool to identify anxiolytic function in both established and novel compounds that may be used to treat anxiety.

The purpose of this study is to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy controls to examine the acute effects of certain anxiolytic medications on brain function.

 In this case, the medication pregabalin will be used.

 The investigators hypothesize that pregabalin (at doses of 50 mg and 200 mg, versus placebo) will yield a reduction in amygdala and insula activity (in a dose-dependent fashion) during emotion processing using fMRI.
