(secondQuint)Safety, Tolerance, Pharmacokinetics and Activity of HE3286 in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.

 This is a Phase I/II, open label, dose ranging study of the safety, tolerance, and anti-inflammatory activity of HE3286 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

 Patients will receive study treatment (one of three open label doses) in addition to their current stable dose of methotrexate.

 Safety (via monitoring of vital signs, physical examination changes, ECG results, laboratory results, and adverse events), pharmacokinetics profiles (of HE3286 and methotrexate) and anti-inflammatory activity will be assessed over a treatment period of 29 days.
