 A sample of the subject's bone marrow tissue will be collected and sent to a laboratory where it will be processed to form cells.

 The new cells are transplanted into the tooth socket after the tooth has been removed.

 The researchers are testing to see if these cells (TRC) will help form bone.

 The research will also determine if the implant the subject receives will be more stable in the area with new bone growth.
