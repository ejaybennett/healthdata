(thirdQuint)Cervical Spinal Cord Stimulation for the Prevention of Cerebral Vasospasm.

 Continuous stimulation of the cervical spinal cord for 14 days after electrode implantation (within 3 days after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage).

 The single-arm single-institution non-randomized prospective study evaluates effects of cervical spinal cord stimulation on prevention of cerebral arterial vasospasm.

 The patients are followed for 12 months after completion of stimulation.

 Cervical Spinal Cord Stimulation for the Prevention of Cerebral Vasospasm@highlight

The study investigates safety, feasibility and effectiveness of cervical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in prevention of cerebral arterial vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).

 It is postulated that 2 week long stimulation of the cervical spinal cord using an implanted epidural electrode will prevent or decrease severity of cerebral arterial vasospasm following aSAH.
