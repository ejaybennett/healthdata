(thirdQuint)Genistein in Treating Patients Undergoing External-Beam Radiation Therapy for Bone Metastases.

 OBJECTIVES: - To determine whether genistein is safe when administered in combination with palliative external beam radiotherapy in patients with osseous metastases.

 - To determine the time to pain relief, duration of pain relief, and degree of pain relief in patients treated with this regimen.

 - To determine the incidence of pathologic fractures in patients treated with this regimen.

 - To determine the effect of this regimen on quality of life measures in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy once daily on days 1-10.

 Patients also receive oral genistein once daily on days 1-60.

 Patients complete pain and quality-of-life questionnaires periodically.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 30 days.
