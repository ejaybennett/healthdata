(thirdQuint)Anatomical Right Posterior Sectionectomy of the Liver by IOUS-Guided Finger Compression.

 A novel technique for the demarcation of the resection area by means of IOUS-guided finger compression to accomplish a right posterior sectionectomy is described.

 Dissection or encirclement of the sectional pedicles for resection area demarcation is thus avoided.

 Ten patients underwent this technique successfully without mortality or major morbidity.

 IOUS-guided finger compression of sectional portal pedicle feeding the right posterior section is a feasible, safe, and effective method.

 Anatomical Right Posterior Sectionectomy of the Liver by IOUS-Guided Finger Compression@highlight

The use of intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) allows us to perform new conservative hepatectomies.

 The investigators previously reported the systematic subsegmentectomy by IOUS-guided finger compression for segments 2-3, which is currently applied for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)on cirrhosis.

 The investigators herein describe a novel technique, which consists in the systematic right posterior sectionectomy by IOUS-guided finger compression.
