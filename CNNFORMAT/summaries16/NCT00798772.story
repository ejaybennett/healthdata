(fifthQuint)Micronutrients and Antioxidants in HIV Infection.

 Background: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the prognosis of persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but is expensive and potentially toxic.

 Micronutrient deficiencies occur even in early stages of HIV infection and increase risk of morbidity, disease progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and mortality, but the role of micronutrient antioxidant supplements in medical management of HIV/AIDS is not clear.

 Objective: To determine if supplementation of untreated asymptomatic HIV-infected persons with a broad-spectrum micronutrient and antioxidant preparation will reduce the rate of decline of CD4 T lymphocyte count, or delay emergence of documented CDC-defined AIDS-defining illness, or start of ART compared to 100% recommended daily allowance (RDA) multivitamins and minerals, and is safe.

 Study design: A prospective, randomized, controlled, double blind clinical trial of supplementation of 218 untreated asymptomatic HIV-infected adults with a micronutrient and antioxidant preparation or identical appearing RDA multivitamins and minerals for two years, with quarterly follow up in clinic for assessment of time from baseline to CD4 count cent Asymptomatic HIV-infected adults at least 18 years of age cent CD4+ cells 375 and 750 cells/mm3 cent No previous ART (excluding less than seven days and perinatal transmission prophylaxis) Study intervention: Oral supplementation with a broad spectrum micronutrient and antioxidant preparation (n=109) or identical appearing RDA multivitamins and minerals (n=109).

 Primary outcome: Time from baseline to CD4+ cell count cent Non-AIDS related adverse events cent Tolerance of and adherence to study medication cent Time from baseline to CD4+ cell count cent Time from baseline to emergence of documented CDC-defined AIDS-defining illness cent Time from baseline to start of ART cent Serial quarterly lymphocyte measures: absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), CD4+, CD8+, and CD3+ cell counts, CD4%, CD8%, CD4:CD8 cent Serial quarterly HIV RNA plasma viral load cent Serum chemistries: Glucose, BUN, creatinine, total protein, C-reactive protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin cent Serum micronutrient levels: Carotene (quarterly) and vitamin B12 (quarterly), folate (six monthly) and vitamin D (25-OHD, six monthly) cent Quality of Life measures: MOS HIV, EuroQol, and Health Utilities Index (HUI) Statistical analysis: Analysis of the primary outcome by intention-to-treat will compare time from baseline to primary outcome.

 Interim analyses are planned once 100 participants are followed for one year.

 Micronutrients and Antioxidants in HIV Infection@highlight

Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes decline in immunity or the ability to fight infection and progresses to acquired immunodeficiency disease (AIDS).

 Anti-HIV drug treatment has improved the prognosis of persons with HIV infection, but is expensive and potentially toxic.

 Low micronutrient levels occur in the blood even in early stages of HIV infection and increase risk of a poorer prognosis, but the role of micronutrient and antioxidant supplements in medical management of HIV/AIDS is not well defined.

 The proposed clinical trial aims to assess if supplementation of untreated HIV-infected adults with a micronutrient and antioxidant preparation can delay decline in immunity or disease progression or start of anti-HIV drug treatment compared with supplementation with standard multivitamins.

 If the findings are positive, the study has implications for health and health care savings.
