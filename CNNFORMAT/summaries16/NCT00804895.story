(secondQuint)Cluster Headache Cortivazol Injection (CHCI).

 Cluster headache is characterized by unilateral attacks of severe periorbital pain accompanied by autonomic symptoms and restlessness.

 Though patients may respond to the standard prophylactic treatment of verapamil, some are refractory and continue to suffer from numerous attacks, with a limit of two doses of subcutaneous sumatriptan per day.

 Some patients also have contra-indications to standard prophylactic or acute treatments.

 Other preventive treatments like systemic steroids, lithium and methysergide may cause significant side effects.

 We intend to show the efficacy of occipital nerve injections with cortivazol, in adjunct to verapamil, in cluster headache patients.

 We expect a diminution of attack frequency over two weeks, with a protocol of three injections separated by two or three days each.

 Tolerance and safety will be examined.
