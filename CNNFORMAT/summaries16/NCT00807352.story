(firstQuint)The Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale for Children; A Prospective Multi-Center Evaluation.

.

 The role of triage in the Emergency Department (ED) is to assign high priority to patients who need urgent care while identifying patients that may be able to wait safely.

 The Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) is a triage tool constructed from a consensus of experts that is universally used in Canada.

 Until now, there has been no evaluation of the validity of the tool for children in a clinical context.

 Also, its inter-rater reproducibility has not been evaluated.

 The expected implementation of a revised version of the Canadian triage tool in 2008 would be an ideal moment to evaluate its validity and reproducibility.

 Specific objective: 1.

 To evaluate the validity of the CTAS for children visiting a pediatric ED and 2.

 To measure the inter-rater agreement for nurses using the CTAS in these settings.
