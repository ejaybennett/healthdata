(secondQuint)Correlation Between Skin Carotenoid Levels and Previous History of Skin Cancer.

 There has been experimental and clinical research evaluating association of different carotenoids and incidence of malignancies, including Non- Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC).

 An easy and inexpensive way to determine which subjects would benefit from supplementation with carotenoids or retinoids could be the measurement of skin carotenoid levels.

The least invasive way to perform it is through Raman spectroscopy which is a technique that uses a laser light that can be used to quantify carotenoids on the skin.

 We will compare the skin carotenoid levels of subjects with previous history of SCC or BCC and subjects without history of previous NMSC.

 Correlation Between Skin Carotenoid Levels and Previous History of Skin Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the difference of skin carotenoid levels between subjects with previous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), subjects with previous basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and a control group.
