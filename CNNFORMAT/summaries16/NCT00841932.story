(secondQuint)Performing Fractional Flow Reserve Without Anticoagulation During Diagnostic Catheterization.

 An experienced interventional cardiologist can perform FFR in a brief period of time.

 This procedure can safely be performed without anticoagulation, thereby lowering the associated procedural risks by avoiding the bleeding and groin complications that may occur with anticoagulation.

 Performing FFR without anticoagulation may also decrease facility costs as femoral artery closure can be performed using standard protocols for a diagnostic procedure, instead of standard protocols for an interventional procedure when a patient has been anticoagulated.

 Performing FFR without anticoagulation does not increase risk of injury to the coronary artery or thrombus in the coronary artery.

 Performing Fractional Flow Reserve Without Anticoagulation During Diagnostic Catheterization@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of performing fractional flow reserve (FFR) of the myocardium without using anticoagulation by performing a retrospective review of 100 consecutive patients who have undergone this procedure during diagnostic catheterization.
