(thirdQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Fondaparinux for the Prevention of Venous Blood Clots in Patients With a Plaster Cast or Other Type of Immobilization for a Below-knee Injury Not Needing Surgery.

 The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux sodium 2.

5 mg (1.

5 mg in patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 mL/min) once daily versus Low-Molecular Weight Heparin (nadroparin 2850 anti-Xa IU, 0.

3 mL, once daily), with respect to the occurrence of venous thromboembolism, death and bleeding complications in patients requiring rigid or semi-rigid immobilization for at least 21 days and up to 45 days because of isolated nonsurgical below-knee injury.

 Treatment will be continued up to complete mobilization, e.

g.

 plaster cast or brace removal, for a maximum of 45 days.

 The study will be a European, multicentre, randomized, open-label, controlled, two-parallel-group, phase III study in 1350 male and female patients 18 years of age or older, presenting with at least one additional major risk factor for VTE.

 After randomization (Day 1), subjects will receive subcutaneously, once daily, either fondaparinux or nadroparin up to complete mobilization.

 After cast or brace removal, a systematic, bilateral compression ultrasound will be done in all patients.

 Patients will be contacted five weeks ( one week) after complete mobilization.

 All suspected venous thromboembolic events, including asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis, all deaths, and all bleeding events (with the exception of certain types of minor bleeding events defined in the protocol) will be reviewed by an independent adjudication committee blind to treatment assignment.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux in comparison with a heparin (nadroparin) in preventing deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the leg veins), whether symptomatic or detected by ultrasound, and pulmonary embolism (blood clots that migrate to the lungs) in patients with leg injuries below the knee that require a cast or other type of immobilization but not surgery.
