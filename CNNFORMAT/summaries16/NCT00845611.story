(firstQuint)Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) - A*2402 Restricted Peptide Vaccine Therapy in Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer.

 URLC10 has been identified as cancer specific molecules especially in non small cell lung cancer using genome-wide expression profile analysis by cDNA microarray technique.

 In a prior study, it has been shown that URLC10 are upregulated in esophageal cancer and gastric cancer and other cancer.

 The investigators identified that peptides derived from these proteins significantly induce the effective tumor specific CTL response in vitro.

 According to these findings, in this trial, the investigators evaluate the safety, immunological and clinical response of URLC10 peptide vaccine in the patients with gastric cancer.

 Patients will be vaccinated once in one week to the eighth vaccine and will be vaccinated once in two weeks from the ninth vaccine.

 On each vaccination day, the URLC10 peptide (1mg) mixed with Montanide ISA 51 will be administered by endodermic injection.

The purpose of this study it to evaluate the safety and immune response of peptides (URLC10) emulsified with Montanide ISA51 in treating patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent gastric cancer.
