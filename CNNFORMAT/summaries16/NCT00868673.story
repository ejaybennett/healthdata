(secondQuint)The Role Of Fructose and Uric Acid In the Development of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome.

 Overweight and obesity are now considered a growing public health problem in Mexico and worldwide.

 This epidemic has been attributed to dietary fructose consumption.

 Although experimental models have demonstrated a role of fructose in the development of obesity, metabolic syndrome and kidney disease, data in human models is lacking.

 The purpose of this study is to determine if a low fructose intake could have an impact on the components of the metabolic syndrome.

 The primary endpoint will be to determine the impact of low fructose on weight loss.

 Secondary endpoints will evaluate the impact of low fructose diet on blood pressure and cardiovascular biochemical profile.

 If fructose is a causal pathway to obesity and metabolic syndrome, it may represent an important target to mitigate this important health problem.

The purpose of this study is to determine if a low fructose intake could have an impact on weight loss, uric acid levels and the components of the metabolic syndrome (glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin resistance, high blood pressure).
