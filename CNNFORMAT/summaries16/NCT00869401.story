(fifthQuint)Dasatinib or Placebo, Radiation Therapy, and Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme.

 This trial includes a phase I dose-escalation study and a double-blind randomized phase II trial for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

 Phase I will be a cohort of 3 dose-escalation trial of dasatinib in combination with radiation and concomitant temozolomide.

 Patients receive concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cycle one.

 Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy 28-42 days post cycle one treatment.

 Patients receive only dasatinib post cycle 8 treatment until progressive disease, unacceptable adverse events or refusal.

 Phase II will be a randomized trial with two treatment arms.

 Patients will be randomized at the time of registration at a ratio of 1:2 respectively to either standard therapy arm (continuous daily placebo prior, during and after standard radiotherapy/temozolomide followed by temozolomide.

 For more information please see the Arms section.

 The primary objectives are listed below.

 Primary Objectives: 1.

 To establish a maximum tolerated dose of dasatinib combined with radiation and temozolomide in this patient population (Phase I) 2.

 To determine the efficacy of dasatinib in combination with radiotherapy and concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, and compare it with the standard of care approach in the treatment of these patients consisting of radiotherapy and temozolomide, followed by adjuvant temozolomide (Phase II) Patients are followed for 5 years post treatment.

 The study permanently closed to accrual on January 31, 2014.

 Dasatinib or Placebo, Radiation Therapy, and Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme@highlight

Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 It may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.

 Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the best dose of dasatinib and to see how well it works compared with a placebo when given together with radiation therapy and temozolomide in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.
