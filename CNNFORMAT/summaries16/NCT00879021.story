(firstQuint)Study of Pregabalin in the Prevention of Central Neuropathic Pain in Acute Spinal Cord Injury.

 Pregabalin is one of the few agents that have demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of central NeP in SCI.

 Research is now proving that it is possible to prevent the development of pain in certain conditions.

 Pregabalin has been proven effective in this area with post surgical pain.

 Therefore, after traumatic SCI there may be a small window of time where we could prevent the development of NeP by administering an agent like Pregabalin.

 Objective: To test the hypothesis that pregabalin is an effective treatment in preventing post-spinal cord injury neuropathic pain.

 Design: double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized, trial Setting: Spinal cord injury program, neurosurgery and tertiary care rehabilitation center Subjects: 30 patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury Method: Pregabalin will be offered to patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury pain in a double blind crossover, placebo control design.

 Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures will be the development of Neuropathic Pain and intensity of pain Secondary outcome measures will be Ashworth's Scale for spasticity and ASIA motor and Sensory Scores.

 Results: To be determined.

 Conclusion: To be determined.

 Study of Pregabalin in the Prevention of Central Neuropathic Pain in Acute Spinal Cord Injury@highlight

This research study will test to see if people who receive pregabalin after their spinal cord injury will develop less nerve damage pain than people who do not receive it.
