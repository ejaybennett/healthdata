(secondQuint)Protective Analgesia for Postoperative Pain Relief Following Day Case Oral Surgery.

 The aim of the study was to demonstrate and improve postoperative pain experience using protective analgesia for patients undergoing oral surgery under day case general anaesthesia.

 The primary objective was to investigate the efficiency of protective analgesia using combined effects of sustained release ibuprofen and bupivacaine nerve block in attenuation of postoperative pain following impacted third molar surgery under day case general anaesthesia.

 The secondary objective was to document the safety and tolerability profile of conventional release versus sustained released ibuprofen with bupivacaine block in subjects undergoing impacted third molar surgery under day case general anaesthesia.
