(thirdQuint)Growth Factor Levels in the Blood of Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Epithelial Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - To determine whether there is a dose-dependent increase in TGF-beta following radiotherapy in patients with epithelial cancers.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood sample collection prior to treatment, 24-72 hours after the first fraction of radiotherapy, and at the end of radiotherapy.

 Patients will also be asked for a weekly blood sample, but this is optional.

 Samples are analyzed to compare pre- and post-treatment TGF-beta levels.

 Growth Factor Levels in the Blood of Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Epithelial Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Measuring levels of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in the blood of patients with epithelial cancers (head and neck, lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate) may help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment with radiation therapy.

 PURPOSE: This research study is measuring levels of TGF-beta in patients with epithelial cancers who are undergoing radiation therapy.
