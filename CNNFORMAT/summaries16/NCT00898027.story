(thirdQuint)Effect of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors on Magnesium Homeostasis in Patients With Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effects of EGFR inhibitors on magnesium homeostasis in patients with cancer.

 OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

 Patients undergo blood and urine sample collection at baseline and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks during treatment.

 After finishing treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 weeks.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and urine in the laboratory from patients with cancer receiving epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors may help doctors understand the effect of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors on magnesium levels in the body.

 PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at the effect of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors on magnesium homeostasis in patients with cancer.
