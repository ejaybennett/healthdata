(fifthQuint)PSA Levels and Biopsy Samples After Implant Radiation and Hormone Therapy in Patients With Stage I or Stage II Prostate Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - To analyze biopsy results at 36 months after permanent iodine I 125 implantation therapy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy for patients with untreated intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

 OUTLINE: Patients received luteinizing hormone releasing-hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy and permanent iodine I 125 implantation on protocol JUSMH-BRI-GU05-01.

 Patients undergo blood sample collection and tissue biopsy for biomarker/laboratory analysis at 36 months after receiving brachytherapy and releasing-hormone agonist therapy.

 PSA levels and biopsy results are compared.

 PSA Levels and Biopsy Samples After Implant Radiation and Hormone Therapy in Patients With Stage I or Stage II Prostate Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with prostate cancer after receiving implant radiation therapy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer and help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

 PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at PSA levels and biopsy samples after undergoing implant radiation therapy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy in patients with stage I or stage II prostate cancer.
