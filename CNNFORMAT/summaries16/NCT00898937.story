(secondQuint)Gene Expression in Tumor Tissue From Women Undergoing Surgery for Breast Cancer or Core Biopsy of the Breast.

 OBJECTIVES: - Assess tumor gene expression information from women undergoing surgery for breast cancer or core biopsy sampling of the breast.

 OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

 Tumor tissue is collected and analyzed for tumor gene expression by DNA microarray analysis for research studies.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
