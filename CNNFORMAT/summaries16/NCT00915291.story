(firstQuint)Evaluating Effectiveness of Educational Intervention to Help Physicians Address Inappropriate Patient Requests for Direct-to-Consumer Advertised Prescription Medications.

 Since changes in FDA regulation direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA), pharmaceutical companies have expended increasing resources to market their products to the public.

 This has led to increased awareness of diseases and potential treatments, but it has also created more public demand for medications that may not be appropriate for a patient's clinical presentation.

 This study aims to provide physicians with the knowledge and skills required to help them address inappropriate DTCA medication requests from patients.
