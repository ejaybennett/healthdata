(thirdQuint)Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics Study of EGT0001474 in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes.

 EGT0001474 is a compound that may inhibit the effect of other compounds in the body known as sugar transporters.

 The use of EGT0001474 may enhance the elimination of glucose from the blood by increasing the amount of urine produced.

 This would help prevent an abnormal decrease in blood sugar (hypoglycemia) both during fasting and after meals without increasing insulin secretion (which may result in weight gain or an abnormal increase in blood sugar known as Type 2 diabetes).

 Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics Study of EGT0001474 in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (how much of the drug gets into the blood and how long it takes the body to get rid of it) of single doses of EGT0001474 given to patients with Type 2 diabetes.

 The study will also evaluate how EGT0001474 affects the amount of glucose produced by the body in the urine.
