(thirdQuint)Experience of Pain During Oocyte Retrieval- a Comparison Between Two Aspiration Needles.

 Although the patient is sedated and local analgesia has been given, transvaginal oocytes retrieval with ultrasound guidance can still cause a lot of pain, both during and after the procedure.

 To reduce the pain, some clinics prefer to use needles as thin as 0.

8 mm (outer diameter, OD).

 A disadvantage with these needles is the increased aspiration time.

 Therefore a new needle has been developed that has the possibility to reduce pain without a large increase in aspiration time.

 The needle has a 50 mm long tip with an outer diameter of 0.

9 mm.

 The remaining part of the needle is 300 mm long with an outer diameter of 1.

4 mm.

 Experience of Pain During Oocyte Retrieval- a Comparison Between Two Aspiration Needles@highlight

The purpose of the study is to compare the pain experience between the patients that have had their transvaginal oocytes retrieval with ultrasound guidance performed with reduced single lumen needle (Vitrolife Sweden AB, Gothenburg) with the patients that have had follicle aspiration needle, 1.

4 outer diameter (Vitrolife Sweden AB, Gothenburg), during the procedure.
