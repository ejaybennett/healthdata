(secondQuint)Vitamin D3 Supplementation and the T Cell Compartment in Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

 In several studies, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) incidence and disease activity has been related with vitamin D status.

 We observed that RRMS patients who remained relapse free before blood collection had a better vitamin D status than patients who experienced relapses (Smolders et al.

 Mult Scler 2008;17:1220-1224).

 Since vitamin D3 is a potent promotor of T cell regulation in vitro (Smolders et al.

 J Neuroimmunol 2008;194:7-17), we hypothesised that a promotion of Treg function in MS patients might underlie its association with MS disease activity.

 In a cohort of RRMS patients, we observed a positive correlation of Treg function with vitamin D status (Smolders et al.

 PLoS ONE 2009;4:e6635).

 Furthermore, vitamin D status correlated positively with a Th1/Th2-balance which was more directed towards Th2.

 In the present study, we will assess whether treatment of RRMS patients with vitamin D3 promotes T cell regulation.

 In the present study, RRMS patients will be supplemented with vitamin D3, and regulatory T cell tests will be performed before and after supplementation.

In patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), the investigators observed a positive correlation between regulatory T cell (Treg) function and vitamin D status.

 The present goal is to assess whether Treg function improves on supplementation with vitamin D3.
