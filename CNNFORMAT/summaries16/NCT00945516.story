(secondQuint)Newly Designed Fully Covered Metal Stent for the Benign Biliary Stricture.

 Benign biliary strictures (BBS) are usually managed with plastic stents, whereas placement of uncovered metallic stents has been associated with failure related to mucosal hyperplasia.

 Fully covered self-expanding metal stent(FCSEMS) placement was reported as a useful method for BBS.

 However, stent migration was a frequent complication of CSEMS placement.

 Recently, flared end FCSEMS was developed to decrease stent migration, and anchoring CSEMS was newly developed.
