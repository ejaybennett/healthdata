(thirdQuint)Study of Blood and Urine Samples in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Localized Prostate Cancer Treated With Hormone Therapy and Radiation Therapy.

 ICORG 06-15.

 OBJECTIVES: - Detect changes in serum and urine proteomic profiles that predict outcome in patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer treated with hormonal therapy and radiotherapy.

 - Identify prognostic and biochemical markers of early disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Identify unique protein expression and temporal alterations, in these profiles, that facilitate understanding of the factors predicting relapse or toxicity.

 - Identify molecular signatures that allow identification of targets for therapeutic intervention.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive induction hormones* (bicalutimide and releasing-hormone agonist) for approximately 4 months prior to starting radiotherapy.

 Patients then receive radiotherapy consisting of 74 Gy up to a maximum of 81 Gy to the prostate gland per standard treatment.

NOTE: * Patients receiving short-term hormonal treatment for 4-8 months are eligible to participate in the trial.

 Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline, and periodically during and after induction therapy for proteomic analysis.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for up to 3 years.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and urine from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying blood and urine samples in patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer treated with hormone therapy and radiation therapy.
