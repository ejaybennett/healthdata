(secondQuint)Effect of Thiamphenicol on EAAT2 and Other Biomarkers From Nasal Biopsied Tissue.

 Thiamphenicol has been proposed to increase the levels of the excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) in the nervous tissue.

 This study evaluated the ability of two weeks of treatment with thiamphenicol to increase EAAT2 in a nasal biopsy as a surrogate of brain nervous tissue.

The purpose of this study is to determine if two-weeks of dosing with thiamphenicol is safe and is able to change the levels of certain pre-specified biomarkers in nervous tissue taken from the nasal passages.
