(secondQuint)Pilot Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Carvedilol in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.

 Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) will be treated with carvedilol for 24 weeks.

 During this time, carvedilol will be titrated from an initial dose of 3.

125mg BID to a maximal dose of 25mg BID.

 At the start and end of the study, we will obtain cardiac MRI, 6 minute walk distance, brain natriuretic peptide (serum), echocardiogram, and functional class assessment.

 Our primary outcome is a change in right ventricular ejection fraction with cardiac MRI.
