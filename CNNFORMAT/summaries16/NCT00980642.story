(secondQuint)Accuracy of the Drager Dual-sensor Temperature Measurement System.

 We will include patients undergoing general anesthesia or regional anesthesia.

 The temperature recorded by Draeger dual-sensor monitoring system will be obtained at 5-minute interval.

 Accuracy of the Drager Dual-sensor Temperature Measurement System@highlight

Our primary hypothesis is that the Draeger dual-sensor temperature monitoring system, used at the forehead, is sufficiently accurate compared to tympanic, bladder or esophageal temperature and oral temperature for routine clinical use during hypothermic conditions, as well as during fever.
