(thirdQuint)Bendamustine as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the time to progression in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer treated with second- or third-line bendamustine.

 Secondary - To determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 - To determine the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive bendamustine IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-8 weeks.

 Bendamustine as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well bendamustine works as second- or third-line therapy in treating patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer.
