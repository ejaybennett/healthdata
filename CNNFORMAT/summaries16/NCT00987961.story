(secondQuint)Linking Hospitalized Injection Drug Users to Buprenorphine.

 In this randomized controlled trial, medically hospitalized opioid dependent patients will be assigned to a "treatment as usual" group, where they will receive a detox regiment of Suboxone during their hospital stay, or a "linkage" group, where they receive a maintenance course of Suboxone during their hospital stay, and appointment post-discharge with an outpatient Suboxone clinic/provider and a Suboxone prescription to use between discharge and this appointment.

 Study interviews are completed at baseline, and 1, 3- and 6-months post-baseline.

 Primary outcomes are opioid use and HIV risk behavior.

 Linking Hospitalized Injection Drug Users to Buprenorphine@highlight

This study tests whether starting Suboxone (buprenorphine) during a medical hospitalization, and then providing an appointment (a "link") for after discharge to maintenance buprenorphine in an outpatient setting will reduce HIV risk behavior in individuals who inject opioids.
