(fifthQuint)Augment Injectable Bone Graft Compared to Autologous Bone Graft in Foot and Ankle Fusions.

 Musculoskeletal problems are pervasive throughout the population in all age groups and in both sexes.

 Half of Americans will need services for fractures at some point in their lifetime according to a widely published article presented at the 2003 annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS).

 Many musculoskeletal problems, such as fractures and non-unions require bone graft to ensure adequate bone healing.

 One of the most widely used options for bone graft is autologous bone however; clinical difficulties have been associated with ABG (autologous bone graft).

 Most of these difficulties result from the harvest of the bone graft, including increased operative time, hospital stay and cost, increased blood loss, post-operative pain, risk of infection and/or fracture.

 The morbidity associated with ABG and its limited amount available to be harvested has directed surgeons to look for a better alternative for a chemotactic, mitogenic, and angiogenic bone graft substitute as an alternative for fracture augmentation to accelerate healing (St.

 John et al, 2003).

 Currently, there are no generally accepted alternatives to ABG for fusion procedures of the foot or ankle.

 In order to demonstrate a product's effectiveness, it is necessary to show equivalence to autogenous bone graft in terms of safety and effectiveness.

 The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of Augment cent Injectable Bone Graft (Beta-TCP/ Bovine Collagen matrix + rhPDGF-BB) in facilitating equivalent mean time to union as ABG in this foot and ankle fusion model.

 Our hypothesis is that the intraoperative application of Augment cent Injectable Bone Graft (Augment cent Injectable) in foot and ankle fusion procedures will demonstrate at least equivalent efficacy to that of the gold standard of autogenous bone graft while avoiding the trauma and sequelae associated with an additional surgical procedure.

 Augment Injectable Bone Graft Compared to Autologous Bone Graft in Foot and Ankle Fusions@highlight

Study Objective: To demonstrate equivalent clinical and radiologic outcomes as "gold standard" (ABG) in a representative clinical model (foot and ankle fusions) Study Hypothesis: Augment cent Injectable is an equivalent bone grafting substitute to autologous bone graft in applications as shown by superiority analysis for safety and non-inferiority analysis for effectiveness Study Rationale: Evaluate a fully synthetic bone graft material to facilitate fusion in conditions or injuries requiring bone graft in a representative clinical fusion model and thus the opportunity to provide equivalent union rates as ABG without necessitating an additional invasive procedure to harvest the graft
