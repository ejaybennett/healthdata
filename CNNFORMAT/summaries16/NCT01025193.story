(fifthQuint)Desensitization With Belimumab in Sensitized Patients Awaiting Kidney Transplant.

 Approximately one third of patients awaiting kidney transplant at our transplant center have significant levels of antibodies in their blood leading to a longer wait time for a kidney transplant and death.

 Antibodies in the blood may be due to prior transplants, pregnancy, or blood transfusions.

 These antibodies sensitize a patient and make it more difficult for the patient to get a compatible kidney transplant.

 The measure of these antibodies is called panel reactive antibodies (PRA) and can range from 0-100%, with 100% being most sensitized.

 The waiting time for patients with a PRA in the range of 20%-79% is over 5 years as compared to patients with low PRA (0%-19%) which is 3-4 years.

 Patients with a PRA greater than 80% are likely to be granted extra points to increase the chances of transplantation.

 Antibodies in these patients may be due to prior transplants, pregnancy, or blood transfusions.

 To date, no trials with belimumab have been performed in patients with pre-existing antibodies awaiting kidney transplantation.

 This study is undertaken to assess the effectiveness and safety of using belimumab to normalize antibody levels in sensitized patients awaiting kidney transplantation.

 It is hoped that decreasing these antibodies will decrease the waiting time on the kidney transplant list, and allow the patient to become compatible with a donor kidney for transplant.

 Desensitization With Belimumab in Sensitized Patients Awaiting Kidney Transplant@highlight

If subjects are listed for kidney transplant and are considered sensitized, this means they have a high amount of antibodies in their blood that could react to a kidney transplant offered for them.

 Antibodies are protein substances made by the body that fight anything that the body considers as a threat to it, such as infection or a kidney transplant.

 Sensitization may be due to prior transplants, pregnancy, or blood transfusions.

 Being sensitized can increase the subject's kidney transplant waiting time as it is more difficult to find a suitable kidney transplant for them that their antibodies will not react to.

 The purpose of this research study is to see if giving the investigational drug belimumab up to one year pre-transplant can de-sensitize the subjects, or decrease the amount of antibodies in their blood.

 This may help make the subjects eligible to receive a kidney transplant more quickly.

 If after receiving belimumab, the subjects are compatible with a donor kidney offered and are medically suitable for transplant at that time, a kidney transplant will be performed.
