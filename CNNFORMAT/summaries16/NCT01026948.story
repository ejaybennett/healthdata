(fifthQuint)Feasibility and Acceptability of the Combination of Propess and AN24 Monica for Outpatient Labour Induction (PRAM).

 Inclusion criteria Women with singleton pregnancy and cephalic presentation booked for induction of labour with unfavourable cervix (Bishop score 3 in 10 minutes and lasting 45 seconds or more 4.

 rupture of membranes 5.

 Pessary falling out Women will be provided with the contact number for the Induction Suite (staffed 24/7), and they may contact the Induction Suite staff by telephone for reassurance at any time.

 The Monica AN24 monitoring will upload data to the central data base every 30 seconds via Bluetooth technology.

 The fetal heart rate and uterine activity pattern will be displayed on the PC monitor situated on the Induction Suite.

 This will be reviewed periodically by an experienced midwife as per standard hospital practice for women undergoing cervical ripening.

 Women will be told to return to the hospital in case of: 1.

 Evidence of uterine hypertonus defined as a single contraction with duration of at least 2 minutes 2.

 Evidence of uterine tachysystole defined as at least 6 contractions in 10 minutes for 2 consecutive 10 minute periods 3.

 Non reassuring/pathological fetal heart rate (FHR) 4.

 In case of regular uterine contractions (at least 3 in 10 minutes) the patient will be contacted by the midwife and asked if the contractions are painful.

 If the patient refers the contractions as non painful, home monitoring will be continued.

 Whilst the participant is at home, should a situation arise that the staff believes requires removal of the pessary (Propess), they will telephone the participant and instruct her to remove and dispose of the insert, and request that she should immediately return to the hospital.

 The staff member evaluating the situation will also determine whether emergency transport is required, i.

e.

, ambulance, or whether car/taxi is acceptable.

 At 24 hours, assuming none of the above reasons for returning to hospital has occurred; women will be asked to return to hospital for removal of pessary and further assessment.

 Further management will be according to the standard hospital protocol for failed induction.

 Provided that the FHR signal from the Monica AN24 device is adequate, the device will be used for monitoring throughout the first stage of labour.

 In the second stage of labour a standard cardiotocogram (CTG) monitoring will be added.

 If at any point of the labour the signal is considered inadequate, standard cardiotocogram (CTG) monitoring will be provided.

 After birth, cord blood will be collected for analysis of lactates, cardiac enzymes, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and reactive protein C.

 These results will not be disclosed to the clinicians and will not influence subsequent management.

 Women will also be asked to give consent (optional) for one neonatal electrocardiogram (ECG) recording before hospital discharge if feasible.

 Women will also be asked to participate in a face to face interview after birth to determine their views on the outpatient care.

 This interview will be arranged by a member of the Qualitative Team after discharge from hospital and take place either at home or at hospital depending on the woman's wishes.

 Feasibility and Acceptability of the Combination of Propess and AN24 Monica for Outpatient Labour Induction (PRAM)@highlight

In order to confirm the feasibility of home monitoring with Monica AN 24, a licensed portable device for measuring fetal and maternal electrocardiogram (ECG), and the feasibility of inpatient monitoring with Monica AN 24 in patients with Propess (a vaginal licensed drug delivery system used for induction of labour), we will perform a pilot study that will include 20 women in each arm.

 Feasibility of monitoring with Monica AN 24 both in hospital and at home will be confirmed in a pilot study.

 The success will be defined as at least 10 minutes of continuous satisfactory trace in any given hour in at least 80% of the patient.

 A main study will then be conducted to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the Propess and Monica AN24package of care for women undergoing induction of labour.

 The research questions are: 1.

 Is outpatient induction with continuous monitoring technically feasible? 2.

 Does the Propess and Monica AN24 care package of care provide adequate clinical information in line with the UK National Institute of Clinical Evidence (NICE) Guideline for Induction of labour? 3.

 Is outpatient induction a concept that appeals to women? 4.

 What do women consider to be the advantages and disadvantages of this package of care? 5.

 What would women consider to be positive and/or negative outcome in future clinical trials of outpatient induction? 6.

 Do fetuses with abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns have evidence of subclinically impaired cardiac function (feasibility study)? 7.

 Do elevated concentrations of white blood cell components in the umbilical cord blood at birth influence fetal electrocardiogram (feasibility study)?
