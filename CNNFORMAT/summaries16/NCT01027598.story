(thirdQuint)Randomized, Double-Blind Trial of Erlotinib/Pazopanib or Erlotinib/Placebo in Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.

 Erlotinib is the current treatment standard for second- or third-line therapy of advanced NSCLC.

 Since angiogenesis inhibitors have also shown activity in NSCLC, the simultaneous inhibition of the EGFR and VEGF pathway may improve the efficacy of therapy.

 In a recently reported Phase III trial (Hainsworth et al.

 2008), the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib improved the Progression- Free-Survival (PFS) vs.

 erlotinib alone when given as second-line therapy in NSCLC (3.

4 months vs.

 1.

7 months, respectively; HR 0.

63).

 Pazopanib also inhibits the angiogenesis pathway, and may have advantages over bevacizumab including: (1) inhibition of other potentially important targets, including PDGFR; and (2) more convenient oral administration.

 Randomized, Double-Blind Trial of Erlotinib/Pazopanib or Erlotinib/Placebo in Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

This randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase II trial will compare the combination of erlotinib with pazopanib (providing concurrent EGFR and VEGFR inhibition) with erlotinib alone in the second- or third-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC.

 This study will be conducted though the Sarah Cannon Research Consortium, a community-based clinical trial network.
