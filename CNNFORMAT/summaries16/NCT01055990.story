(fifthQuint)Basic and Clinical Research on Applying Blood Fix to Treat Critical H1N1 Patients.

 Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus was identified as a significant cause of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States.

 It rapidly spread to many countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic on June 11, 2009.

 Antiviral drugs, such as oseltamivir or zanamivir, may be effective in treating cases of swine flu, but large-scale immunization is an essential approach of controlling the pandemic.

Although preliminary evidence from a matched case-control study suggests some protection from the 2008-9 trivalent inactivated vaccine against pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009, particularly severe forms of the disease.

 A vaccine against H1N1 is expected to be the most effective tool for controlling influenza A (H1N1) infection.

In response to the pandemic, novel vaccines against the virus strain A/California/07/2009(H1N1) have been developed and recently were approved for vaccination among specific populations in China.

The primary safety objective of this study is to assess the safety of split- virion inactivated H1N1 vaccine without adjuvant when administered at the 15 ug dose.

The primary immunogenicity objective is to assess the hemagglutinin antibody and neutralizing antibody response following split- virion inactivated A(H1N1) vaccine without adjuvant.

 Participants 148 healthy persons age 18-60 years who have no history of novel influenza H1N1 2009 infection or novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination.

 This is an observational, Phase II study in healthy males and non-pregnant females, aged 18-60 years.

This study is designed to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated influenza H1N1 virus vaccine after approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration.

Following immunization, safety will be measured by assessment of adverse events through 21 days.

 Immunogenicity testing will be hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays and microneutralization (MN) assays on serum obtained on the day 0,7 and 21 after vaccination.

In addition, we will take clinical researches on applying blood fix to treat critical H1N1 patients and collect blood of healthy persons who are inoculated with H1N1 vaccines to cure critical H1N1 patients and further observe the effectiveness and safety, for the purpose of working out a new weapon against H1N1.

 According to the Blood Donation Law of the People's Republic of China, the blood donation shall follow principle of voluntary.

The donors should be healthy persons inoculated with specific H1N1 vaccine and their titer of H1N1 hemagglutination inhibition antibody must be 1:320 or more than after examination (the kit shall be provided by the WHO) by Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

 Basic and Clinical Research on Applying Blood Fix to Treat Critical H1N1 Patients@highlight

The 2009 flu pandemic is a global outbreak of a new strain of influenza A virus subtype H1N1, commonly known as swine flu, that was first identified in April 2009.

 Large-scale immunization is an essential approach of controlling the pandemic.

Vaccines are now becoming available for protection against pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 infection in some countries.

In response to the pandemic, novel vaccines against the virus strain A/California/07/2009(H1N1) have been developed and recently were approved for vaccination among specific populations in China.

 However, the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines is of prime concern to the authorities and the public.

This report details the findings of a observational clinical trial of the safety and immunogenicity of a influenza A (H1N1)2009 monovalent vaccine.

 The virus of Swine Flu H1N1 that outbroke in 2009 is sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors (Oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) but have drug resistant to adamantanamine derivatives (amantadine and Flumadine), therefore neuraminidase inhibitors are recommended for antiviral therapy against Swine Flu H1N1, effect of which is evidence by the data that such drugs do modify the symptoms and decrease the death rate of H1N1 in America and Mexico.

 However, clinically, the investigators have encountered that this virus can infect resistant strains of Oseltamivir, which urges for a more effective treatment plan.

 In view of above situations, seeking for an effective measures against H1N1 flu should be a top priority and will benefit human life and economy globally.

 This Topic will take the classic strategy of passive immunity to perform basic and clinical researches on applying blood fix to treat critical H1N1 patients and collect blood of healthy persons who are inoculated with specific H1N1 vaccines to cure critical H1N1 patients.
