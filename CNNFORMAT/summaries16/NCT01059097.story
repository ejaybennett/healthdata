(thirdQuint)Effect of Surgeon Volume on Outcome of Pancreaticoduodenectomy.

 Objectives: To define the independent impact of surgeon volume on outcome after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) in a single high-volume institution.

 Summary Background Data: The impact of surgeon volume on PD outcome is still controversial.

 So far, data available are from retrospective multi-institutional reviews, considering in-hospital mortality as the only outcome variable.

 Methods: Prospectively collected data on 610 patients who underwent PD from August 2001 to August 2009 were analyzed.

 Cut-off value to categorize high and low-volume surgeons (HVS and LVS, respectively) was 18 PD/year.

 Primary endpoint was operative mortality (death within 30-day post-discharge).

 Secondary endpoints were morbidity, pancreatic fistula (PF) and length of stay.

 Demographic, clinical, and surgical variables were recorded.

 Effect of Surgeon Volume on Outcome of Pancreaticoduodenectomy@highlight

The independent impact of surgeon volume on outcome of patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy in a high-volume Institution was assessed.

 A significant reduction of pancreatic fistula rate was found in the high-volume surgeon group in comparison with low-volume surgeon group.

 However, no difference between groups was found in mortality, major complications, and hospital stay.
