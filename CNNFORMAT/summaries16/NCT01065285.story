(firstQuint)Vaccination Against Influenza in Autoimmune Diseases.

 This prospective study concentrates on patients with vasculitis, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue diseases.

 Patients responding to the inclusion criteria, will receive vaccine against seasonal influenza then, 3 weeks later, vaccine against H1N1 influenza.

 According to the results of ongoing trials a second injection of H1N1 vaccine has been scheduled 3 weeks later.

 At each consultation a blood sample will be taken to evaluate immunogenicity of vaccination.

 Two additional consultations have been scheduled: one month after the last vaccine administration and at 6 month, in order to evaluate the occurrence of late side effects.
