(firstQuint)Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction- Bioabsorbable Screw.

 This study will combine the use of survey response, MRI, and x-rays of the knees in Dr.

 Spindler's ACL reconstructed patients in order to examine long term healing of two types of bioabsorbable screw.

 We will use a 2-4 yr time point to look at patient reported symptoms of pain and swelling from the surveys and use the x-rays and MRIs to look at absorption of the screw, healing of the graft, and body reactions to the screw.
