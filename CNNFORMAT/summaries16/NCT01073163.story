(firstQuint)Study to Assess the Effect of Treatment With Bendamustine in Combination With Rituximab on QT Interval in Patients With Advanced Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) or Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL).

 This study was originally conducted as a substudy in a subset of patients enrolled in the phase 3 study C18083/3064/NL/MN (NCT00877006) who were randomly assigned to treatment with bendamustine in combination with rituximab (BR) and who satisfied additional eligibility criteria related to cardiac function.

 The objective of the substudy was to obtain results to assess the effect of bendamustine treatment on cardiac polarization and any potential changes in the QT interval (corrected by the Fridericia method [QTcF]).

 After a period of time, the substudy was amended to be a separate stand-alone study to ensure that an adequate number of patients were included.

 Patients were treated for 6, and up to 8, cycles in the stand-alone study, and efficacy and safety were also assessed.

 In addition, a requirement to assess the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine and rituximab when used as combination therapy was added to the objectives, to determine the potential for drug interaction between bendamustine and rituximab.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of treatment with bendamustine on cardiac repolarization as reflected by the rate-corrected QT interval by the Fridericia method (QTcF).
