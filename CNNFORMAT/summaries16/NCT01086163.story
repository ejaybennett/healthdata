(fifthQuint)Effects of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Platelets in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease With Hypertriglyceridemia.

 In terms of incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and economic costs, coronary artery disease represents a number 1 public health concern.

 Omacor(R)/Lovaza(R) is an effective, and very safe mix of PO-3A, and the drug is currently approved by the Federal authorities for the drug management of post-infarction patients with high blood triglycerides.

 Despite significant progress in the prevention and treatment of vascular disease in the Western World in the past two decades, national statistics indicate that the incidence and prevalence of heart disease has been increasing steadily.

 Given the growing length of CAD progression, it is pertinent that many more patients will yield extra benefit from Lovaza(R) on top of aggressive antiplatelet regimens and statin due to severity of their vascular disease.

 Therefore, mild antiplatelet properties of PO-3A will be a highly desirable and attractive commodity of this medication.

 We believe that Omacor(R)/Lovaza(R) is ideally positioned for the chronic management of CAD as a safe, efficient, and "gentle" agent with no harmful interactions with statins or aspirin.

 Also considering low clinical incidence of aspirin-induced interactions with other classes of drugs, Lovaza(R) may fit nicely into a standard cocktail for diabetes, hypertension, depression, arrhythmias, and heart failure management of CAD patients, which will expand the drug utilization.

 However, platelet-related effects of Lovaza(R) on top of aspirin and statin in patients with stable coronary disease are not known, but may be important due to the high incidence of aspirin resistance and heavy burden of thrombin activation in such patients.

 We have a large pool of patients with documented CAD (300-350/annum), and we will be able to enroll relatively large amount of quality patients fast.

 The investigators believe that Omacor(R)/Lovaza(R) is ideally positioned for the chronic management of CAD as a safe, efficient, and "gentle" agent with no harmful interactions with statins or aspirin.

 The investigators hypothesize that addition of Omacor may add mild antiplatelet protection for CAD patients.

 The study objectives are: - To assess the ex vivo effects of Omacor(R) on platelet function in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

 - To compare ex vivo platelet-related effects after 7 and 14 days of therapy with Omacor and statin combination versus statin alone in patients with chronic stable coronary heart disease.

 - To establish the relation of changes in platelet activity (if any) with the lipid profile to prove an additional benefit of Omacor(R) on top of statin and aspirin.
