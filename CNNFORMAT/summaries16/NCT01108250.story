(secondQuint)LOC387715/HTRA1 Variants in Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy in a Korean Population.

 This is a cross-sectional case-control study.

 One hundred Korean patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and 100 control subjects were genotyped for the LOC387715 (rs10490924) and the HTRA1 gene polymorphism (rs11200638).

 LOC387715/HTRA1 Variants in Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy in a Korean Population@highlight

This study is to investigate whether variants in the LOC387715 locus and the HtrA serine peptidase 1 (HTRA1) gene within the 10q26 locus are associated with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and whether they are associated with clinical patterns including angiographic phenotype in a Korean population.
