(secondQuint)Comparison of Iodine + Isopropyl Alcohol Versus Iodine + Antimicrobial Sealant for Skin Preparation.

 Patient's skin flora is a major source of pathogens, and microbial contamination of the surgical site is a likely precursor of SSI.

 A variety of skin products may be used, including iodophors, alcohol-containing products, and clorhexidine gluconate.

 Despite these perioperative tactics, bacteria continue to survive at the skin level and migrate to contaminate the wound.

 A microbial sealant (InteguSEAL(R), Kimberly-Clark) that uses cyanoacrylate to seal endogenous skin flora has demonstrated to reduce wound contamination.

 The efficacy of the microbial sealant in preventing SSI has been tested in cardiovascular surgery and open inguinal hernia repair, with a reduction on SSI rate when compared to standard skin preparations.

 This cyanoacrylate has not been tested in oncologic surgeries.

 Comparison of Iodine + Isopropyl Alcohol Versus Iodine + Antimicrobial Sealant for Skin Preparation@highlight

The purpose if this study is to determine whether a microbial sealant (iodine + cyanoacrylate) [InteguSEAL(R), Kimberly-Clark] reduces surgical site infections when compared to iodine and isopropyl alcohol (povacrylex in isopropyl alcohol) [Duraprep(R)] in oncologic surgery.
