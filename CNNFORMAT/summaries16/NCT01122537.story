(thirdQuint)Characterization and Differential Diagnosis of Postneurosurgical Meningitis.

 Besides description of characteristics of patients with postneurosurgical patients, we also will investigate the usefulness of prolonged cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture, and profiles of blood and CSF inflammatory markers for the differential diagnosis of meningitis.

 CSF culture will be extended upto 2 weeks.

 Serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, CSF adenosine deaminase levels will be monitored and analyzed for the differential diagnosis of meningitis.
