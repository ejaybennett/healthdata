(fifthQuint)A Study to Demonstrate the Efficacy and Tolerability of Ferrous Bisglycinate Chelate in Iron Deficiency Anaemia and to Compare These With Those of Ferrous Ascorbate.

.

 Rationale Iron deficiency is the most common form of malnutrition globally.

 In India, nearly 70% of women are estimated to be iron deficient.

 Iron deficiency anemia (IDA, Hb 12gm/dl after 8 weeks of treatment with ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 tablet daily, ferrous bisglycinate chelate 2 tablets daily and ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet daily.

 4.

 To compare the % incidence of gastrointestinal side effects during 8 weeks treatment with ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 tablet daily, ferrous bisglycinate chelate 2 tablets daily and ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet daily.

 Study Design This will be a multicentre, randomized, laboratory-blinded, parallel-group study.

 It is projected that the study will randomize 270 women (90 subjects in each treatment arm) with iron deficiency anaemia (Hb 6-9 gm/dl + serum Ferritin 1/2g/l) to either ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 tablet/day, ferrous bisglycinate chelate 2 tablets/day or ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet/day for 8 weeks.

 At fortnightly visits, blood will be collected for Hb (to evaluate efficacy), adverse events will be documented (to evaluate tolerability), the investigational drugs will be dispensed and reasons for non compliance will be recorded.

 The total study duration consists of an 8-week treatment period and will involve 6 clinic visits.

 Study Endpoints/Assessments Primary Endpoint(s) Rise of haemoglobin from baseline to 8 weeks in each ferrous bisglycinate chelate group (1 tablet daily and 2 tablets daily).

 Secondary Endpoint(s) 1.

 The difference in the average change in Hb from baseline to 8 weeks with ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 and 2 tablets daily, and ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet daily.

 2.

 The difference in the average rate of rise of Hb during 8 weeks of treatment with ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 tablet daily, ferrous bisglycinate chelate 2 tablets daily, and ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet daily.

 3.

 The difference in proportion of patients who achieve a target Hb 12gm/dl after 8 weeks of treatment with ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 tablet daily, ferrous bisglycinate chelate 2 tablets daily, and ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet daily.

 4.

 The difference in % incidence of gastrointestinal side effects during 8 weeks treatment with ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 tablet daily, ferrous bisglycinate chelate 2 tablets daily and ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet daily.

@highlight

Iron deficiency anaemia (Haemoglobin, Hb 1/2g/l) to either ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 or 2 tablets/day, or ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet/day for 8 weeks.

 At fortnightly visits, blood will be collected for Hb (to evaluate efficacy), adverse events will be documented (to evaluate tolerability), the investigational drugs will be dispensed and reasons for non compliance will be recorded.

 Study endpoints: The primary endpoint is defined as the rise of Hb from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment in each ferrous bisglycinate chelate group (1 tablet/day and 2 tablets/day).

 The secondary endpoints include the difference in the average change in Hb, difference in the rate of rise of Hb, difference in the proportion of patients who achieve a target Hb 12gm/dl and difference in the % incidence of gastrointestinal side effects during 8 week therapy with 2 dosing regimens of ferrous bisglycinate chelate (1 tablet/day and 2 tablets/day) and ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet/day.
