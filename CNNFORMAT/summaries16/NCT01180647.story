(secondQuint)Extended-Release Naltrexone for Opioid Relapse Prevention Following Release From Jail.

 This protocol randomizes persons soon-to-be-released from a large urban jail to treatment with extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), a full opioid antagonist that prevents the activity of heroin and other opioids.

 Investigators at NYUSOM and NYC DOHMH will recruit heroin dependent persons from NYC jails who are soon-to-be-released, not accessing opioid agonist pharmacotherapy, with lowered tolerance due to incarceration, and extremely likely to relapse and risk accidental overdose at release.

 All N=40 participants receive a two-session, individual psychosocial intervention, Motivational Interviewing.

 Half (n=20) will be randomized to pre-release treatment with XR-NTX.

 Immediately and one month following release, participants will be offered continued psychosocial and medication-assisted treatment (naltrexone, buprenorphine, or methadone) at Bellevue Hospital, including a second XR-NTX dose among XR-NTX arm participants.

 The primary outcome is relapse to sustained opioid use during the first 30 days post-release.

 We hypothesize an XR-NTX arm will report significantly lower rates of sustained opioid relapse following release.

 Extended-Release Naltrexone for Opioid Relapse Prevention Following Release From Jail@highlight

This pilot study's primary aim is to compare rates of sustained opioid relapse, defined as self-reported opioid use >50% (>15 of 30) of days during the first 30 days following release from jail, among persons treated with XR-NTX pre-release vs.

 controls not receiving XR-NTX.
