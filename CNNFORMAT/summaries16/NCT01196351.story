(firstQuint)Activity at Ventilation Threshold on Appetite and Food Intake in Boys.

 The effect of exercise (EXR) on short-term food intake (FI) and subjective appetite was investigated in normal weight (NW), overweight (OW) and obese (OB) boys were randomized into 4 treatments.

 Each boy consumed either a non-caloric sweetened control (CON) or GLU drink after either exercise (EXR) or sedentary activity.

 Subjects exercised at their ventilation threshold (VeT).
