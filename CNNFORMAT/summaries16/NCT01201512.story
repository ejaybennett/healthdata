(secondQuint)CONDOR Temporomandibular Muscle and Joint Disorders (TMJD) Survey.

 The overall goal of this project was to collect data to be used in preparing an application for a Clinical Trial Planning Grant and then in designing a subsequent Phase III clinical trial.

 The ultimate goal of this series of research projects is to determine the most practical approach to conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate initial intervention for patients with painful temporomandibular muscle and joint disorders (TMJD) using NIDCR's Collaboration of Networked Dental and Oral Health Research (CONDOR) group consisting of three dental Practice-Based Research Networks: The Dental Practice-Based Research Network (DPBNR), Northwest Practice-Based Research Collaborative in Evidence-based Dentistry (PRECEDENT), and Practitioners Engaged in Applied Research and Learning (PEARL).
