(firstQuint)Cost-effectiveness Study of miRview Mets in Patients With Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP).

 Thousands of patients are diagnosed each year with metastatic cancer; however, about 3-5% of them are diagnosed with Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP).

 In order to identify the optimal treatment plan for individual patients with CUP, the primary tumor site must be identified.

 Patients undergo a wide range of costly, time-consuming, and inefficient tests to identify the primary site of origin, often to no avail.

 In this era of targeted therapies, the accurate diagnosis of the primary tumor can be crucial.

 miRview cent mets is a new molecular diagnostic tool that identifies the tissue-of-origin of metastatic tumors, with 90% sensitivity.
