(secondQuint)Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for Suicidal Ideation.

 Evidence suggests that depression in general, and suicidal ideation in particular, results from a dysfunctional regulatory pathway involving prefrontal cortical governance over limbic activity.

 Repeated daily non-invasive stimulation of the prefrontal cortex with TMS would theoretically strengthen and reset this cortical control pathway and reduce suicidal ideation and restore healthy circuit behavior.

 The aim of the current study is to assess the efficacy of TMS therapy in the treatment of suicidal ideation in patients with depressive episode(s) and either PTSD or mild TBI or both.

 It is hypothesized that participants who receive repetitive TMS (Group 1) relative to sham treatment (Group 2) three times daily over three days will evidence more improvement in suicidal ideation from baseline to the end of day 3.

 Participants will be followed for six months following treatment to assess safety and long-term efficacy of TMS.

 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for Suicidal Ideation@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is effective in the treatment of suicidal thinking in individuals with a depressive episode and either posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), history of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), or both conditions.
