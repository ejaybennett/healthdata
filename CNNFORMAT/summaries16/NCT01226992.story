(fifthQuint)Oral Vancomycin Followed by Fecal Transplant Versus Tapering Oral Vancomycin.

 The proposed trial is a single-centre, phase II/III, open, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial.

 To have an evaluable population of 114 participants and assuming a 20% loss to follow-up, approximately 146 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either approximately 2 weeks of oral vancomycin followed by a single fecal transplant via enema (hereon referred to as the "fecal transplant arm") or a 6-week taper of oral vancomycin (hereon referred to as the "vancomycin taper arm").

 The 2 weeks of vancomycin pre-treatment in the fecal transplant arm will allow for a fecal transplant donor to be screened for potentially transmissible infectious diseases (clinically and through blood and stool tests), in order to ensure appropriateness and safety of donation.

 If patients fail treatment during the follow-up period of 120 days, they will be offered the opportunity to cross over to the alternate treatment arm.

 Those who cross over will be followed for an additional 120 days from the second intervention.

 Participants will be assessed clinically for recurrence in CDI symptoms and adverse events at the following time points after the intervention: 4 days, 7 days, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks.

 All recurrences of CDI symptoms will be investigated with C.

 difficile laboratory testing to confirm the etiology of these symptoms.

 Analysis will be intention to treat.

 An interim analysis may take place after completion of follow-up of 30 patients.

 This interim analysis is meant to establish the safety and feasibility of the study, not measure efficacy.

 Although there were no formal sample size calculations to assess safety of the procedure, with a sample size of 70 participants, an adverse event rate, for example of 2.

5%, can be detected with a probability of 0.

83 for the fecal transplantation group.

 Oral Vancomycin Followed by Fecal Transplant Versus Tapering Oral Vancomycin@highlight

Recurrent CDI is a growing problem with few treatment options that provide lasting effect.

 Fecal transplantation has been shown in several case series to be successful in controlling recurrent CDI.

 The current study is a non-blinded, randomized controlled trial comparing fecal transplantation with a 6 week taper of oral vancomycin for the treatment of refractory CDI.

 Approximately 146 patients will be enrolled over one year.

 Participants in the study will be followed for 120 days, and will be given the opportunity to cross over to the alternative intervention arm if a relapse in symptoms occurs.

 The primary outcome measure will be recurrence of toxin-confirmed CDI within 120 days of starting the intervention.

 Secondary outcomes include: early recurrence of symptoms within 14 days, relapse within 120 days (same strain of C.

 difficile), attributable mortality, hospitalization and serious adverse events.
