(fifthQuint)Dietary Essential Fatty Acid Regulation of Omega-3 HUFA Metabolism; Satiety and Body Composition.

 Objective To evaluate the effects of lowering the dietary nutrient linoleic acid (LA) as a controlled variable on: 1) tissue accretion of omega-6 and omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA); 2) bioactive endocannabinoids derived from the omega-6 HUFA arachidonic acid (AA); 3) insulin sensitivity; 4) satiety and hunger; and 5) body composition.

 Modifications in dietary LA will be offset with reciprocal changes in the nutrient oleic acid (OA) to maintain equivalency of calories and nutrients.

 Study Population Up to 180 overweight, but otherwise healthy pre-menopausal women volunteers (aged 18 through 50) with body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 35 kg/m(2), will be enrolled.

 With the anticipated dropout rates described in Section 7.

4, we anticipate that 84 of these subjects will be randomized to study diets, and 64 subjects will complete the 12 week diet phase.

 Three Group Comparative Analysis A total of 84 subjects will be randomized to one of 3 healthy and nutritionally complete diets that differ only in the fatty acid composition of added visible oils.

 All foods will be provided through the NIH metabolic kitchen, with subjects visiting the kitchen daily Monday through Friday to obtain foods.

 Each Friday, subjects will carry home foods packed for their weekend meals.

 Baseline testing battery will include: 1) blood composition of omega-6 and omega-3 HUFA; 2) endocannabinoid, eicosanoid, and docosanoid derivatives of omega-6 and omega-3 HUFA; 3) insulin function assessment; 4) body composition assessment; 4) functional satiety assessment; and 5) self-reported measures of satiety, hunger and affective states.

 The full baseline testing battery will be repeated after 84 days of randomized treatment.

 An abbreviated testing battery will be performed after 28 and 56 days of randomized treatment.

 A subset of participants will undergo additional inpatient testing in the 24-hour metabolic chamber as described in Section 3.

 The remaining subjects will remain ambulatory throughout the study.

 Participants will be advised to continue their usual medical care and medications throughout the study.

 24-Hour Metabolic Suite Study A subset of 8 participants in each of the 3 groups will undergo the usual testing battery and additional metabolic testing in the metabolic suite at 0, 28, and 84 days.

 The additional testing will include pre- and post-prandial endocrine hormone assessment.

 36-Week Continuation (Gradient Dose Replacement) Sub Study At completion of the 84 day (12 week) study, participants in the low LA group (Group B) will have the option of continuing their study diets for another 252 days (36 weeks).

 Continuing subjects will consume be randomized to either: 1) the same low LA (1 en%) diet.

; or 2) the same baseline diet with a graded dose escalation of LA, with the addition of 1 en% of LA every 6 weeks.

 In this manner, LA will increase incrementally from 1 en% to 8 en% over the 36 week period.

 During the continuation phase, the abbreviated testing battery will be completed after 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 weeks, and the full testing battery will be repeated after 36 weeks.

 Outcome Measures A Primary Dependent Variables The primary outcomes will be the proportion of omega-6 HUFA in total HUFA (%omega-6 in HUFA) and two endocannabinoids derived from omega-6 AA, 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and N-Arachidonoylethanolamine (Anandamide or AEA).

 Secondary Dependent Variables Secondary outcome measures will include blood concentrations of the omega-6 HUFA Arachidonic Acid (AA); the omega-3 HUFA Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA); the rates of change in %omega-6 in HUFA, AA, EPA, DHA, 2-AG and AEA over time; adipose and muscle tissue fatty acid composition; endocrine hormones; gene expression profiles; psychometrics; functional satiety; 24-hr energy metabolism and substrate utilization; and body composition, as follows: Omega-6 and omega-3 HUFA and total fat content will be measured in adipose and muscle tissue biopsies.

 Other endocannabinoid, eicosanoid and docosanoid derivatives of omega-6 and omega-3 HUFA will be measured in plasma via mass spectrometry.

 Endocrine hormones will be measured in fasting and postprandial states in the 24-hour metabolic suite.

 Psychometric outcomes will include self-reported measures of satiety and affective states.

 Functional satiety will be assessed via buffet-style food array testing.

 Body composition outcomes will include DEXA, 3T MRI, anthropometric measurements and bioelectrical impedance.

 Genotyping will also be performed to assess for interactions between selected gene variants and effects of the intervention.

 Dietary Essential Fatty Acid Regulation of Omega-3 HUFA Metabolism; Satiety and Body Composition@highlight

Background: - Rates of obesity have increased dramatically in recent decades, and researchers are investigating how changes in diets and physical activity have contributed to this increase.

 To understand how weight might be controlled, it is important to learn what kinds of dietary changes can affect hunger and might lower body weight.

 Essential fatty acids, for instance, are an important part of a healthy diet, but researchers have not yet determined the ideal amount of essential fatty acids that people should eat.

 By studying how different diets affect body chemistry and hormone levels in women who are overweight or obese, researchers hope to be able to determine better diets or treatments to help people reach and maintain an optimum healthy weight.

 Objectives: - To examine how certain fats in the diet affect body metabolism, hormones, and weight regulation.

 Eligibility: - Healthy women between 18 and 50 years of age who are overweight or obese (body mass index between 25 and 35).

 Design: - This study has an initial screening visit and three phases.

 All participants will be involved in the first two phases of the study, and some participants will be involved in the third phase.

 - Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, in addition to blood and urine tests and questionnaires about eating habits and other diet factors.

 - Phase 1: Participants will have three visits to the National Institutes of Health over a 4-week period.

 At the visits, participants will have blood and urine tests, complete questionnaires, and have other tests including brain and body imaging studies.

 Participants will then be assigned to one of three study diets.

 - Phase 2: Participants will have a 12-week diet phase, with all foods supplied by the study researchers.

 Participants will keep a daily log of food and beverage intake, and will have three testing sessions with procedures similar to those performed in Phase 1.

 - Phase 3: Participants assigned to a particular study diet (one-third of all participants) will be given the option of continuing the diet for an additional 36 weeks (9 months), with food consumption, monitoring, and testing procedures similar to those performed in Phase 2.
