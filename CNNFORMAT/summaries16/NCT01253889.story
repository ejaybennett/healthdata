(secondQuint)Sweetheart Study: Oral Glucose for Reducing Stress During Echocardiographic Assessment in Infants in the NICU.

 One hundred and four infants were randomized to one of four groups during a single np-ECHO examination, at the discretion of the medical team.

 Randomization to soother and water (Control) with and without facilitated tucking or to soother and 25% glucose (Intervention) with or without facilitated tucking will be determined by generating randomly permuted sequential blocks of four and six allocation numbers.
