(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Alogliptin Used in Combination With -glucosidase Inhibitor in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes in Japan.

 Both insulin hyposecretion and insulin-resistance are considered to be involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme.

 DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion.

 It is expected that inhibition of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

 In Japan, -glucosidase inhibitors are widely used as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 Because alogliptin has a different mechanism of action compared to -glucosidase inhibitors, the study evaluated the efficacy and safety of alogliptin combined with an -glucosidase inhibitor in type 2 diabetic patients with uncontrolled blood glucose while taking a -glucosidase inhibitor and receiving diet and/or exercise therapies.

 To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the concomitant use of alogliptin and an -glucosidase inhibitor, subjects who participated in the present study could enter a long-term extension study SYR-322/OCT-003 (NCT01263509) that was planned separately.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin, once daily (QD) combined with an -glucosidase inhibitor taken three times daily (TID) in type 2 diabetic patients with uncontrolled blood glucose.
