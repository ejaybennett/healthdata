(secondQuint)A Study to Compare the Bioequivalence of 50-mg Tapentadol (CG5503) Dose Administered as Two 50-mg Tablets Relative to One 100-mg Tablet.

 This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center, randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), 2-way crossover study (participants may receive different interventions sequentially during the trial).

 All participants will receive a single 100-mg dose of tapentadol (CG5503) during 2 periods, in randomized order, as two 50-mg TRF tablets and one 100-mg TRF tablet.

 All participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 possible treatment sequences and receive both of the following treatments, 1 in each period: Treatment A: two tapentadol (CG5503) ER 50-mg TRF tablets, administered as a single oral dose under fasted condition Treatment B: one tapentadol (CG5503) ER 100-mg TRF tablet, administered as a single oral dose under fasted condition Each period will be separated by 7 - 14 days.
