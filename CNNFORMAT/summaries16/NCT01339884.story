(thirdQuint)A Study of Resveratrol as Treatment for Friedreich Ataxia.

 Resveratrol shows promise as an agent for the treatment of Friedreich ataxia due to its antioxidant properties, neuroprotective effects, and ability to increase frataxin levels in vitro and in vivo.

 This clinical pilot study aims to determine the effect of two doses of resveratrol (1g/day and 5g/day) taken for 12 weeks, on frataxin levels in individuals with Friedreich ataxia.

 Additional outcome measures include the effect of resveratrol on markers of oxidative stress, clinical measures of ataxia , and cardiac parameters (including relative wall thickness and left ventricular mass index).

The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of two doses of resveratrol taken for a 12 week period, on frataxin levels in individuals with Friedreich ataxia.

 This study will also measure the effect of resveratrol on markers of oxidative stress, clinical measures of ataxia, and cardiac parameters.
