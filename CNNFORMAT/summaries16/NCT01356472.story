(thirdQuint)Linezolid Alone or Combined With Carbapenem Against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) in Ventilator-associated Pneumonia.

 Linezolid is the only commercially available oxazolidinone, the first new class of antibiotic to be developed in the last three decades.

 Although it is predominantly bacteriostatic, linezolid has good in vitro and in vivo activity against MRSA .

 However, several studies did not show that linezolid was superior to any of glycopeptides in treatment of MRSA pneumonia.

 Moreover, combination therapy against MRSA is argued when several in vitro and in vivo studies showed synergy between linezolid and carbapenem or fosfomycin or rifampicin, while vancomycin and linezolid in combination should be avoided.

 our study is aim to investigate the activity of linezolid, alone and in combination with carbapenem against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) patients.

 Linezolid Alone or Combined With Carbapenem Against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) in Ventilator-associated Pneumonia@highlight

As previous studies showed that the synergy between linezolid and carbapenem in vitro and in vivo (animal studies), our study is aim to investigate the activity of linezolid, alone and in combination with carbapenem against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) patients.
