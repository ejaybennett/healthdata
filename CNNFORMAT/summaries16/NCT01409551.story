(firstQuint)Video-assisted Hyperthermic Pleural Chemoperfusion vs Talc Pleurodesis for Refractory Malignant Pleural Effusions.

.

 The study compares prospectively two groups of patients with refractory maignant pleural effusion.

 Group A consists of patients undergoing video-assisted hyperthermic pleural chemoperfusion (with a pump machine) and group B includes patients undergoing bed-side tube thoracostomy and talc slurry pleurodesis.
