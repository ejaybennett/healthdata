 ADT induced Osteoporosis Prostate cancer is a common malignancy in Australian men.

 In men with localized disease at the time of diagnosis, baseline PSA level, tumour stage and Gleason grade can be used to help stratify into risk categories.

 Men with high risk disease are defined by an absence of metastatic disease using conventional imaging, and any one of the following: a presenting PSA of >20, Gleason grade 8-10 disease on histology, or stage T3-4 disease.

[1] Such men are often treated with a combination of radiotherapy to the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes, in conjunction with a course of adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) of between 18-36 months.

[2] Recent literature suggests that the greatest benefit from adjuvant ADT comes from the first 4-6 months of treatment, and although there is measurable benefit from prolonging the course of ADT, it follows the law of diminishing returns with progressively smaller benefit per unit of increased treatment time.

[3] This is important, in that if cumulative toxicities are being inflicted by prolonging the treatment, there is likely to be a duration where the harm of further treatment will start to outweigh the shrinking disease control benefits.

 With greater clinical experience of the use of adjuvant ADT, there has become a better awareness of the toxicities associated with this treatment.

 Accelerated loss of bone mineral density has long been recognized as a complication of being hypogonadal.

 There is now good evidence that this leads to an approximately 7% higher risk of fractures for men with prostate cancer managed with ADT.

[4] Osteoporotic fractures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and a high proportion of patients who suffer them never fully regain their pre-fracture level of functioning.

 There are Australian guidelines for the management of osteopaenia / osteoporosis for men managed with ADT.

[5, 6] They recommend monitoring of bone mineral density (BMD) using annual DEXA scanning, supplementary Vitamin D with Calcium, and the use of bisphosphonate therapy for men with prevalent minimal trauma fracture or baseline BMD T-Score 2 Gy) is particularly effective at maximizing tumour effect.

 Newer technologies such as image guided RT (IGRT) which ensures more accurate delivery of the RT, and intensity modulated RT (IMRT) which reduces unwanted radiation dose to adjacent normal structures are now in clinical use in Australia.

 They both have been used in phase 2 trials of Hypofractionated RT (HypoRT), with results for efficacy and late toxicity comparable to those reported in the literature for conventionally fractionated cohorts.

[34, 35] There have been two small RCTs recently reported comparing HypoRT and conventionally fractionated populations, both showing no increased toxicity with the HypoRT, and better bNED.

[36, 37] One of these focused mainly on high-risk men and included ADT, similar to the patient population eligible for PROCITT.

[36] 4.

 Radiotherapy Volume When defining the RT treatment volume for a man with PC, traditional thinking has been to treat the prostate alone.

 However, for a local treatment modality such as RT or surgery, it is important to appreciate the natural patterns of spread of the disease.

 For instance, there are good consensus guidelines for patients with head and neck cancer to help radiation oncologists to know who are most likely to benefit from elective treatment of their cervical neck lymph nodes.

 This is because, despite the neck being negative at the time of diagnosis, surgical neck dissection series have helped to inform decision aids regarding the chance of a clinically normal neck harbouring sub-clinical disease.

 Nomograms have been constructed from large surgical PC cohorts to help define the risk of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle involvement and lymph node involvement based on initial clinical parameters.

 Trying to treat all patients with the progressively larger treatment volumes required to include these areas would potentially increase toxicity without a high chance of improving efficacy.

 However, if a threshold risk level of 15-25% were required prior to including each elective target volume, we would aim to apply such treatments to patients most likely to benefit.

 Such concepts are already beginning to enter into consensus guidelines,[1, 38] and clearly represent a promising avenue of investigation.

 Of all of these expanded treatment volumes, only Whole Pelvic Radiotherapy (WPRT) has been investigated in men with PC in RCT.

[39] Neither RCT found a significant benefit for the use of WPRT.

 However, many practice changing RCTs have used WPRT on all patients.

[2, 40-42] One of the reasons for this discrepancy is likely to be that entry criteria for the largest WPRT RCT estimated a 15% risk of pelvic lymph node involvement.

[39] Later work has shown that this only corresponded to a 2% pathological risk of nodal involvement.

 This emphasizes the need to use validated decision tools to select appropriate treatments.

 5.

 Duration of neoadjuvant ADT Often adjuvant ADT is given prior to commencing RT.

 This is known as neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT).

 There is no clear guidance on what duration to give this for, although 3-6 months is a common approach.

 Results from an Australian randomized trial have shown 6 months of NAT to result in superior survival than 3 months.

[43] Intuitively, it would seem that some patients would benefit from a shorter duration of NHT than others depending on their tumour response.

 There has been some preliminary work looking at an adaptive approach for this, where RT is started once a maximal PSA response has been achieved.

[44] This has been shown to be feasible and effective in the phase 2 setting.

 PROstate Cancer Imaging, Treatment and Toxicity (PROCITT)@highlight

This is a single centre prospective observational noninterventional study of men with histological confirmed prostate cancer, high risk disease and not positive for metastatic disease planned to receive Radiotherapy and 18 months of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT).

 Although ADT improves the chance of cure, it can also have many side effects.

 One of these is bone mineral density loss.

 When this is advanced, it is called osteoporosis.

 Men with osteoporosis have a higher chance of getting fractures of bones such as the hip and spine.

 Currently, the best way to measure for osteoporosis is to do a bone mineral density scan using a DEXA scanner.

 The primary objective of this study is to see if baseline Magnetic Resonance Imager (MRI) and a Computer Tomogram (CT) combined with clinical factors predicts which men are at greater risk of accelerated ADT induced bone mineral density loss than baseline DEXA scanning alone.

 The data from the patients will be used to construct a model predicting annual rate of bone loss based on baseline imaging, clinical and biochemical characteristics.

 Secondary aims for this study are as follows: - Evaluating the feasibility, toxicity (acute and late) and efficacy (5 year biochemical control by the Phoenix definition)of multimodality therapy with hypofractionated radiotherapy (giving a larger dose of radiotherapy over a shorter time 5 1/2 weeks compared with a standard 8 week approach).

 Although used overseas, this 5 1/2 week regimen has not been used widely in Australia, and we would like to see if we gain similar results here as have been reported from the US.

 - Feasibility and efficacy of a risk adapted duration of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy.

 Usually, ADT is given for between 19 months before radiotherapy is started but there is no agreement as to which duration is best.

 This trial aims to tailor the duration of ADT prior to radiotherapy based on blood PSA test results.

 - Prognostic value of circulating tumour cells (CTCs).

 This is a blood test which can detect cancer cells in the blood which has been used for patients with metastatic cancer.

 The presence of CTCs in men with prostate cancer correlated with poorer overall survival.

 Potentially, high risk prostate cancer patients with CTCs detected may represent a very high risk group and could therefore warrant treatment intensification.

 - To correlate bone marrow changes on MRI with changes in blood counts and patient reported fatigue.

 Measuring bone marrow may help in predicting not just which patients are at risk of losing bone faster but also of becoming anaemic, and suffering fatigue.

 A correlation may better explain some of the toxicities associated with ADT.

 - Implementation of a nomogram based radiotherapy target delineation algorithm.

 This trial aims to use a decision making tool called a nomogram to help tailor the area to treat in a more standard way.
