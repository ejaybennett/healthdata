 Laparoscopy-assisted Proximal Gastrectomy Versus and Laparoscopy-assisted Total Gastrectomy@highlight

The choice of surgical strategy for patients with proximal gastric cancer is controversial mainly because proximal gastrectomy is infamous for high rates of reflux symptoms and anastomotic stricture.

 but there are no prospective randomized trials until now.

 The primary end point of this study is whether the rate of reflux esophagitis is different or not between LAPG and LATG.

 Through this study, we
