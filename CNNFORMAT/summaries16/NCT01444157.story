 Family and Coping Oriented Palliative Homecare Nursing Aimed at Advanced Cancer Patients@highlight

When facing life threatening illness such as advanced cancer palliative care is needed to improve quality of life of patients and their families through the prevention and relief of suffering.

 Palliative care at an early stage prevents the development of problems and symptoms, but time, resources and experience are needed in the primary care sector in Denmark to deal with the problems families experiencing life with advanced cancer are facing.

 The aims of this study are to test, evaluate and further develop interventions that can help identify and assess problems, resources and opportunities of families experiencing life with advanced cancer, and on this background to help the families cope with their situation in cooperation with healthcare professionals to an extent where the family's quality of life increases, their physical and psychosocial problems are relieved, their symptoms of anxiety and depression are reduced, family satisfaction with health professionals are increased and acute readmissions to hospital are prevented.
