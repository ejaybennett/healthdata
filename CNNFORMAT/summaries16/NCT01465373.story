(firstQuint)Vaginal Progesterone Versus Progesterone in Oil in Donor Egg Recipient In Vitro Fertilization Cycles Utilizing Vitrified Donor Eggs.

 The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical pregnancy rate of micronized progesterone (Endometrin, Ferring Pharmaceuticals) compared to progesterone in oil injections in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) donor egg recipients.

 The secondary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of freezing/vitrification of donor eggs.

 Effectiveness of vitrification will be evaluated by egg thaw/survival, fertilization, and implantation rates.
