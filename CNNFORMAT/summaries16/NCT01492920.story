(fifthQuint)Acetyl-L-Carnitine Hydrochloride in Preventing Peripheral Neuropathy in Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer, or Fallopian Tube Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride (ALC) in preventing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in patients with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the effect of ALC on chemotherapy-induced fatigue based upon the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Fatigue scale.

 II.

 Evaluate the effect of ALC on sensory peripheral neuropathy as measured with the first 4 items of the FACT/Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-Neurotoxicity (Ntx) subscale (FACT/GOG-Ntx_4 subscale).

 III.

 Evaluate the effect of ALC on the health-related quality of life as measured by the FACT-Ovarian (O) trial outcome index (TOI).

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to planned dosage of paclitaxel ( 150 mg/m^2), and age ( 6 years of age).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride (ALC) orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 (during chemotherapy treatment).

 ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-21 (during chemotherapy treatment) (maximum of 8 courses).

 In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients also complete questionnaires comprising the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Fatigue scale, the FACT-Gynecologic Oncology Group Neurotoxicity subscale (FACT/GOG-Ntx_4 subscale), and the FACT-Ovarian trial outcome index (FACT-O TOI) at baseline, prior to courses 3 and 5, within 4 weeks after completion of treatment, and then at 3 months after completion of treatment.

 Acetyl-L-Carnitine Hydrochloride in Preventing Peripheral Neuropathy in Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer, or Fallopian Tube Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy@highlight

This randomized phase III trial studies how well acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride works compared to a placebo in preventing peripheral neuropathy in patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer undergoing chemotherapy.

 Acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride may prevent or lessen peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy.

 It is not yet known whether acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride is more effective compared to a placebo in preventing peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy.
