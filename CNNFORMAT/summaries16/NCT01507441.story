(thirdQuint)Studying DNA in Samples From Younger Patients With Down Syndrome and Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treated on COG-AAML0431 Clinical Trial.

 OBJECTIVES: - To identify new genetic abnormalities associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients with Down syndrome through whole-genome sequencing.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Extracted DNA and RNA from cryopreserved specimens are analyzed for genomic sequencing, gene mutation, and microarray analysis.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood, tissue, and bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 PURPOSE: This research trial studies DNA samples from patients with Down syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia treated on COG-AAML0431 clinical trial.
