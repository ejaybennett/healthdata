(thirdQuint)Immune Monitoring and CNI Withdrawal in Low Risk Recipients of Kidney Transplantation.

 Kidney transplantation is a treatment option for people with kidney disease.

 However, there is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it functioning for a long time.

 Transplant recipients take immunosuppression (anti-rejection) drugs to prevent their body from rejecting the new kidney.

 These drugs are used to prevent the immune system from attacking the transplanted kidney.

 All anti-rejection medications have unwanted side effects.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of slowly removing tacrolimus, a CNI.

 Immune Monitoring and CNI Withdrawal in Low Risk Recipients of Kidney Transplantation@highlight

The study will compare how well transplanted kidneys work and the response of people's immune systems as tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), is withdrawn.

 In addition, this research study will evaluate whether reducing immunosuppression can decrease some of these side effects while still preventing rejection of the kidney.
