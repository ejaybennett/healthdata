(thirdQuint)Monitoring and Modifying Atherosclerosis in Psoriasis Patients Study.

 Psoriasis is a common disease characterized by skin lesions and systemic inflammation with or without arthritis.

 Patients with psoriasis have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease than healthy subjects, and this may be related in part to the inflammatory nature of their disease.

 This study is intended to help provide explanations for the increased cardiovascular disease risk in psoriasis and to assess whether this risk can be reduced by biologic anti-inflammatory therapies prescribed to resolve skin lesions and arthritis.
