(thirdQuint)Acromegaly Combination Treatment Study.

 The study will begin when the combination of Sandostatin LAR or Somatuline and pegvisomant is first administered.

 Study visits will occur every 4 weeks from the start of the study.

 However, for subjects who cannot make every study visit due to distance, the study team will facilitate monthly blood draws at their local Quest laboratory facility.

 After the 24 weeks of combination therapy, subjects with a controlled IGF-1 will then start Pegvisomant monotherapy at the same dose that they attained normalization in combination therapy.

 IGF-1 levels, liver function test, and blood glucose will be performed monthly.

 An MRI will be performed at the conclusion of the 48 week treatment period.

 Acromegaly Combination Treatment Study@highlight

In this study the investigators will evaluate whether combination low dose somatostatin receptor ligand (SRL) and weekly or daily Pegvisomant will attain equivalent control of serum IGF-1 levels, compared to combination high dose SRL and weekly Pegvisomant.

 Lower doses of therapy will greatly reduce cost of acromegaly therapy.
