(fifthQuint)A Trial Assessing the Effectiveness of Text Messages in Improving Continuation of Birth Control.

 Hypothesis.

 A personalized text messaging program providing trustworthy, reliable information and support to female adolescents initiating a birth control method, will improve adherence and correct use of the method and so reduce unwanted pregnancies.

 Methods.

 Female adolescents aged 15-19 year olds attending Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center (MSAHC) for initiating a birth control method will be asked if they are interested in participating in the trial.

 The Intervention Group.

 Upon initiation of a birth control method patients will be signed up to the text messaging platform.

 Via this program they will receive personalized messages regarding their chosen method of birth control.

 Participants will receive 3 messages during the initial 3 weeks, 2 messages per week in weeks 4-8 and then one message a week thereafter for a period of 12 months.

 They will be signed up for reminders to take/change their method (as appropriate) and have access to a Healthcare Provider to ask questions via text message that they may have regarding their method.

 Participants will be reminded (via text message) to attend the clinic for a birth control refill (if necessary) at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

 The Control Group.

 Participants randomized in to the control group will have standard care.

 This is the usual counseling by the Health Care Provider or Health Educator.

 Patients in the intervention arm will also receive this standard care.

 A Trial Assessing the Effectiveness of Text Messages in Improving Continuation of Birth Control@highlight

This study is a randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness in a series of educational text messages in improving continuation of a birth control method in comparison to the 'standard counseling', when girls initiate a new method of birth control.

 Girls aged 15-19 year olds who are attending for a reproductive health visit and who own a working cell phone will be approached and asked if they would like to participate.

 Following completion of a baseline questionnaire and consultation for initiation of a new birth control method they will be randomized to receive either the intervention or standard counseling.

 If randomized to the intervention they will receive 3 messages per week for the initial 3 weeks, 2 messages per week for the following 5 weeks and then one message per week thereafter.

 Messages will be tailored to the birth control method the participant has initiated.

 At 4 months all participants will be contacted via telephone and asked to complete a questionnaire regarding continuation of use.
