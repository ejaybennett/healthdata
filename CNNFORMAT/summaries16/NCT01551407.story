(secondQuint)Detection of Bladder Tumors After 30 Min Instillation of Hexvix.

 This study is an open, prospective, within patient, controlled, multi-center, Phase IIa study in patients with bladder cancer.

 The bladder of all patients will be instilled with 50 mL Hexvix(R) 8 mM solution and evacuated after 30 minutes.

 After bladder evacuation, the bladder will be examined under white light cystoscopy using the Karl Storz flexible videocystoscope.

 Tumors visible under white light will be mapped.

 Then the bladder is evaluated with blue light and lesions seen by blue light will be mapped.

 Biopsies of all visible tumors will be taken using both white and blue light prior to resection of all lesions.
