(fifthQuint)Phase I Study of mPEG-R-Crisantaspase Given IV.

 Planned sample size: Up to 36 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the study: a maximum of 30 subjects for the dose escalation phase and up to a maximum of 12 patients in the expansion phase.

 Inclusion criteria consists of: Patients with any relapsed or refractory hematological malignancy, for which standard curative or life prolonging treatment does not exist, or is no longer effective or tolerable.

 For the following hematological malignancies, patients must have received at least: Low rade NHL: 3 prior lines of therapy, ALL, aggressive NHL and other hematological malignancies: 2 prior lines of therapy, Aged 18 to 50 years and ECOG performance status of 1, 1 or 2.

 All patients will be treated with Asparec once every two to four weeks for two IV administrations infused in 60 minutes.

 Patients without Disease Progression may receive additional administrations, each administration starting at least 14 days but no later than 28 days after the previous Asparec administration.

 Phase I Study of mPEG-R-Crisantaspase Given IV@highlight

This study is an open label, multicenter study with a dose escalation of Asparec(R) administered once every two to four weeks for two administrations.

 The primary objective of this study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose following one single dose of Asparec when administered in a population of patients with relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies, as measured by Dose Limiting toxicities.

 There are secondary objectives which are to evaluate the safety of Asparec and to determine the PK profile as assessed by measurement of plasma L-asparaginase enzymatic activity following single and repeated doses of Asparec.

 Patients response rate will be evaluated and Anti-Asparec antibodies will be measured.
