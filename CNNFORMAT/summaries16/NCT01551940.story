(fifthQuint)Toxin Treatment for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Related Sialorrhea.

 The patient will benefit from an ultrasound guided injection of botulinum toxin A (Botox(R)) or placebo (NaCl 0.

9 %) and will be followed up in consultation at 4, 12, 16 (if reinjection) and 24 weeks.

 He will be contacted by telephone in 2 and in 8 weeks (percentage of decrease of functional embarrassment, percentage of decrease of salivary secretion rate).

 He can be able to benefit in the open label phase of a botulinum toxin type A injection at the 12-week follow up if he estimates that first injection was not effective or if the efficiency of the first injection began to become blurred.

 After the 6 months of the study, the patient will benefit again from the usual follow-up as advised by the French consensus conference in November, 2005.

 Toxin Treatment for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Related Sialorrhea@highlight

Evaluation of the decrease of the secretion of saliva in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by a local ultrasound-guided bilateral injection of botulinum toxin type A in parotids and submandibular glands.

 The investigators want to demonstrate 1 month after the injection, by a multicenter French randomized double blind study, an improvement of at least 25 % of the functional embarrassment due to saliva, estimated with a visual analogue scale, a decrease of the quantity of saliva and a decrease of the embarrassment for the main caregiver.
