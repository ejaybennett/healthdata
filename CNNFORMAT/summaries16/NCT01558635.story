(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Cardioblate CryoFlex Surgical Ablation System in Subjects With Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Requiring Mitral Valve Surgery.

 Introduction: Among the cardiac arrhythmias, Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in the general population and represents an increasing problem worldwide.

 Management strategies for AF include combinations of various treatments, including surgery.

 Cox et al.

 developed the surgical Maze procedure to restore sinus conduction to the AV node and to restore effective, synchronized bi-atrial contraction.

 In an effort to address the observed challenges and make this treatment available to more subjects, modifications of the Maze pattern and new lesion patterns have being developed and tested.

 Devices using new technologies, like cryothermia, were developed in an effort to reduce the time required to make the lesion pattern.

The Cardioblate(R) CryoFlex cent Surgical Ablation System has been successfully used for the surgical ablation of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation.

 The system utilizes cryothermia to create the linear lesions of the surgical Maze-III procedure.

 Purpose: To provide clinical evidence showing that the Cox Cryo Maze III procedure is effective and safe in subjects with longstanding persistent AF undergoing mitral valve repair or replacement.

 Study objective: The study objectives were to characterize the safety and efficacy of the Medtronic Cardioblate CryoFlex Surgical Ablation System when used to treat subjects with longstanding persistent AF requiring concomitant mitral valve repair or replacement.

Studies have shown that taking drugs to stay out of AF has limited success.

 This research is designed to study heart rhythm after surgical therapy, namely by measuring if there are benefits to having surgery to treat Atrial Fibrillation (AF) with the Cardioblate CryoFlex Surgical Ablation System.

 The system is approved and commercially available with CE mark.

 The purpose of this study is to support evidence that the Cardioblate System is safe and effective to treat AF.
