(thirdQuint)Registry AutoLog Lipid Removal and Blood Component Characterization.

 Since the in house data strongly suggest that the Medtronic AutoLog is uniquely high performing in lipid removal in-vitro, the Registry AutoLog Lipid Removal and Blood Component Characterization is initiated to determine if the AutoLog system is successful in removing lipids in vivo as it is in-vitro.

 Therefore, it is expected that the lipid amounts after washing will be less than 10 mg/dl.

 The study is designed as a multi-center, non-randomized, non-interventional, post market release study (a registry).

 The study has a single arm, without controls, as it is descriptive in nature.

 Registry AutoLog Lipid Removal and Blood Component Characterization@highlight

The purpose of this study is to show the success of the AutoLog System in removing lipids to less than 10mg/dl in vivo.

 The Autolog registry has two objectives: 1.

 to determine the lipid removal capabilities of the Medtronic AutoLog System.

 2.

 to obtain in vivo data on blood component removal and washing capabilities of the Medtronic AutoLog System.
