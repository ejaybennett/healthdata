(firstQuint)The Influence of Amitriptyline on Learning in a Visual Discrimination Task.

 Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is considered critical to the consolidation of procedural memory - the memory of skills and habits.

 Many antidepressants strongly suppress REM sleep, however, and procedural memory consolidation has been shown to be impaired in depressed patients on antidepressant therapy.

 As a result, it is important to determine whether antidepressive therapy can lead to amnestic impairment.

 We thus investigate the effects of the anticholinergic antidepressant amitriptyline on sleep-dependent memory consolidation in 32 healthy men in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized parallel-group study.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether 75 mg amitriptyline affect the sleep dependent consolidation of procedural memory (visual discrimination task, Karni-Sagi-paradigm).
