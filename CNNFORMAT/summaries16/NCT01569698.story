(fifthQuint)Modalities of Renal Replacement Therapy in Pediatric Acute Kidney Injury.

 In children, there are limited data on extra renal replacement therapy.

 Pediatric studies are often retrospective, or often limited to specific disease processes or specific extra renal therapy.

 The lack of large studies including different usual modalities in pediatrics limits any formal recommendation on use in relation to patient outcomes, including renal recovery and mortality.

 Some of the issues that need consideration are the choice of dialysis modality (including Intermittent Hemodialysis, Continuous Renal Replacement Therapies, and Peritoneal Dialysis), the indications for and timing of dialysis intervention, the dose of dialysis and their effects on outcomes from acute kidney injury in children.

 This study will supply important data about pediatric acute extra renal replacement therapy, including the epidemiology of pediatric acute kidney injury leading to extra renal replacement therapy, the variety of the treatment modalities, and their effects on the course of the disease.

 Modalities of Renal Replacement Therapy in Pediatric Acute Kidney Injury@highlight

Limited prospective data is available to compare morbidity and mortality between renal replacement modalities in pediatric acute renal failure.

 In the absence of clear standard of care, the choice of the extra renal replacement therapy modality is subject to clinical judgement, practical aspects, and costs.

 This study will supply important data about usual modalities of pediatric acute extra renal replacement therapy and their impact on patient outcome and renal recovery.

 An obvious next step will be to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the different strategies.
