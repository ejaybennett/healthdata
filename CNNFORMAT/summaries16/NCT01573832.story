(thirdQuint)Integrated Client Care Project Trial: Wound Care Evaluation.

 The researchers are interested in finding out whether the intervention ("integrated care") helps to improve patient outcomes.

 A randomized control trial of wound care clients in Ontario CCACs will show the effects of the intervention (integrated care) versus "usual care" clients.

 The researchers will also examine the financial system costs associated with providing "integrated care" to clients versus "usual care".

 The researchers expect to answer the research question of whether there is difference in patient outcomes between "integrated care" versus "usual care clients.

" The researchers also would like to formulate a response for whether there will be financial system cost difference between "integrated care" and "usual care" clients.

 The goal of this evaluation is to help decision-makers in the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC), in the Community Care Access Centres (CCACs) and among provider organizations to improve the quality of care and patient outcomes for wound care clients, by evaluating innovations in the delivery of care.
