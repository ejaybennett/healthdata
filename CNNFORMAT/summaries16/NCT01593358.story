(firstQuint)Venous Obstruction in Neurodegenerative Disorders Research Registry.

 This research registry will observe the venous obstruction in neurodegenerative disorders.

 This will provide data that will allow researchers to classify abnormal valve and venous morphology, distinguish vessels which are more responsive to treatment, determine groups who respond more favorably to treatment, and overall evaluate the outcomes of venous angioplasty in various neurodegenerative disorders that involve venous obstruction.
