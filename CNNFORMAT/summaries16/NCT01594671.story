(thirdQuint)Tranexamic Acid for Unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty.

 Objectives: 1.

 Principal: To assess if the topical and intravenous tranexamic acid reduce less or at least than 20% the blood losses with respect to the habitual haemostasia in patients, after unilateral total knee arthroplasty.

 2.

 Secondary: To assess the treatment safety.

 To perform a cost- analyses.

 Methods: Randomized, multicentre, open and parallel clinical trial with three comparative groups: Topical tranexamic acid, Intravenous tranexamic acid and habitual haemostasia.

 In all patients, a single drainage of 8mm will be inserted in the joint, and it will remain closed during one hour after the closure of the skin.

 N of participant centres: 2.

 Random allocation will be centralised in "Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau".

 Main outcome: Total blood loss (mL) in the post-operative period collected by the habitual drain system ).

 Secondary outcomes: Total blood loss (mL)and hidden blood calculated by Nadler's formula.

 Proportion of patients with blood transfusion, complications of surgery wound, haemoglobin pre and post-operative, units of blood transfused, post-operative mortality, days of hospital stay, safety of interventions assessed.

Direct cost analysis.

 Substudy: Pharmacokinetic study.

 The first 24 patients included in "Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau" for tranexamic acid (12 topical- 12 intravenous) to determine: 1.

 Plasmatic concentrations of tranexamic acid 2.

 In topical and intravenous tranexamic acid administration determine the absorption rate and drug bioavailability by these routes: maximum plasma concentration, time to reach Cmax, AUC, and half-life.

 Tranexamic Acid for Unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty@highlight

Total knee arthroplasty is often associated with excessive postoperative bleeding due to increased fibrinolysis.

 Hence, the objective of the proposed of this multicentre study is to determine the peri-operative bleeding comparing the application of topical and intravenous tranexamic acid with the habitual surgical haemostasis.
