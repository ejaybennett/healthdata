(thirdQuint)Radiation Exposure During Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography Between Prone and Left Lateral Decubitus.

 The radiographic-fluoroscopic system manufactured by Siemens Model POLYSTAR was used for ERCP procedure at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital.

 Dose Area Product (DAP) manufactured by PTW Model DIAMENTOR E, a transmission ionization chamber was attached to X-ray collimator to record the dose-area (cGy.

cm2) in order to determine the entrance surface air kerma (ESAK, mGy) of the patients at two positions (prone and left lateral) while the Kodak Portal Pack for localization imaging was placed on the patient's couch to determine the exposed area (cm2) on the surface of the patient.

 TLD was attached at five positions, left eye, thyroid, left forearm, lower abdomen and left leg of the medical staff during ERCP procedure.

 Radiation Exposure During Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography Between Prone and Left Lateral Decubitus@highlight

The objective of this study is to evaluate the radiation dose to patient at two positions (prone and left lateral) and to medical staff during Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure using dose area product (DAP) meter and thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD).

 Data were recorded on 20 patients at prone position and 20 patients at left lateral position.
