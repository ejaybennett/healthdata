(fifthQuint)Quiting Marijuana Use: Self-report Study of Quitting Straegies and Withdrawal Symptoms.

 Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug in the world, yet relatively little is known about users who try to quit without formal treatment (so-called spontaneous quitting).

 This study will use two self-report questionnaires to collect information on the socio-demographic characteristics, marijuana use history, most difficult marijuana quit experience, and marijuana craving from a convenience sample of 1230 adult, non-treatment-seeking marijuana users.

 The questionnaires take 45-60 minutes to administer.

 Data will be analyzed for patterns and correlations among the characteristics of the quit attempt, including any withdrawal symptoms, quitting strategies used, and its success.

 The marijuana craving data will be analyzed to evaluate the validity of this measure of marijuana craving.

 There are no direct benefits to subjects from study participation.

 The scientific benefit is an improved understanding of spontaneous quitting of marijuana use, which may lead to improved interventions for marijuana users in the future.

 There are no physical risks to subjects.

 There are risks of anxiety or embarrassment while taking the questionnaire and of loss of confidentiality of sensitive information collected about subjects.

 Quiting Marijuana Use: Self-report Study of Quitting Straegies and Withdrawal Symptoms@highlight

Background: - Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug in the world, yet relatively little is known about users who try to quit without formal treatment ( spontaneous quitting).

 Studies have suggested that there are some common strategies that many individuals use in spontaneous quitting, such as changing one s lifestyle or identity, reminding oneself of negative consequences, support from family and friends, and religion.

 However, more research is needed to determine potential treatment strategies for marijuana use.

 Objectives: - To identify strategies used to help with marijuana quitting among non-treatment seeking adult marijuana users.

 - To identify withdrawal symptoms experienced during marijuana quitting and their relationship to the quitting strategies used and the outcome of the quit attempt.

 - To evaluate whether subgroups of marijuana users differ in their experience of marijuana quitting.

 Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have made at least one attempt to quit marijuana use.

 Design: - The study will consist of one visit of approximately 1 to 2 hours.

 - Participants will fill out three questionnaires.

 The questionnaires have different types of questions, and will ask about background and lifestyle, marijuana use and craving patterns and behaviors, and difficulties in previous attempts to quit using marijuana.
