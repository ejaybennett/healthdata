(firstQuint)Effects of Glucose-fructose Drinks During Training on Lactate Transport.

 The study will enroll 24 healthy male volunteers.

 After baseline assessment of lactate transport and endurance performance, subjects will be randomized to either a 3-week intervention arm in which they will train with glucose-fructose intake during training, or to a control arm (water during training).

 After this 3-week intervention, lactate transport and endurance performance will be assessed again.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether glucose-fructose intake during training increases lactate transport and oxidation and improve endurance performance.
