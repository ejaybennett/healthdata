(secondQuint)A Phase 1 Study to Investigate the Mechanism of Action of Ipragliflozin.

 This study will consist of 2 parts.

 In Part A the effect of ipragliflozin on the glucose homeostasis will be investigated and in Part B we will investigate the effect of exposure of ipragliflozin on UGE and plasma glucose levels.

 Part A This part will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2- period, 2 treatment crossover design in healthy subjects and in T2DM subjects who are drug naive or washed out for metformin prior to admission to the clinical site.

 Part B This part will be an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2 treatment crossover design in T2DM subjects stratified by baseline HbA1c levels (6.
