(thirdQuint)Docetaxel Lipid Microsphere (DT-LM) for Injection in Chemotherapy Patients.

 Docetaxel (currently marketed as Taxotere(R)), given by intravenous or intraperitoneal injection, has contributed significantly to the treatment of a variety of malignancies, such as ovarian, breast, gastric, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as head and neck cancer and some other cancers.

 In the preclinical, DT-LM showed reduced toxicity (especially myelosuppression)and comparable therapeutic efficacy.

 In clinic, it is believed that DT-LM will offer fewer side effects to the patient at similar doses, and possibly greater effectiveness when used at higher doses.

 DT-LM could not only avoid the serious hypersensitivity reactions caused by Tween 80, but also be stable, safe and convenient for clinical administration.

 This study is designed to determine the following: - The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of DT-LM.

 - The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel following intravenous administration of DT-LM.

 - Any anti-tumor effects of DT-LM.

 Controlled trial is also carrying out to reveal the differences in safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between DT-LM and Taxotere.

 Docetaxel Lipid Microsphere (DT-LM) for Injection in Chemotherapy Patients@highlight

Docetaxel Lipid Microsphere (DT-LM) is a novel proprietary delivery system of docetaxel developed by Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.

 In this Phase I study, the DT-LM was evaluated for the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in patients with advance solid tumors.

 It was also evaluated for pharmacokinetic and anti-tumor effects of DT-LM compared to commerical docetaxel.
