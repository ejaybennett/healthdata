(secondQuint)Efficacy of Proficiency-based Versus Free Laparoscopic Training in Cholecystectomy on a Virtual Reality Simulator.

 Virtual reality simulators are widely accepted tools to familiarize surgical novices with the principles of laparoscopy without jeopardizing patient safety.

 However, access to a Virtual reality simulator and initial instruction alone followed by free training of the surgical novice may not be sufficient to achieve the training goals efficiently.

 The aims of this study are to determine if proficiency based laparoscopic training on the Simbionx LAP Mentor cent with external formative assessment using peer group derived benchmarks is superior to free training with self-assessment using the simulated laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure with different endpoints (time to extract the gallbladder, serious complications, safe cautery and instrument pathways) as outcome parameters.

 Efficacy of Proficiency-based Versus Free Laparoscopic Training in Cholecystectomy on a Virtual Reality Simulator@highlight

Virtual reality devices are widely accepted tools to familiarize surgical novices with the principles of laparoscopy.

 Free Virtual reality training will be tested against basic training and efficacy assessed in a randomized controlled trial of surgical novices.
