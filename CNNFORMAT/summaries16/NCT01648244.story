(thirdQuint)The Use of a Computer Program to Help Primary Care Providers Treat Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.

 The CADS software integrates the patient's home blood glucose data with appropriate laboratory data (e.

g.

 A1c, liver function, kidney function), demographic data (age, gender), current and previous medications, and active/inactive medical diagnoses.

 The software makes a recommendation about what medication changes are appropriate with potential alternates.

 Providers with their patients are block randomized into CADS or "Usual Care" for 1 year.

 The Use of a Computer Program to Help Primary Care Providers Treat Patients With Type 2 Diabetes@highlight

The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of CADS by primary care providers (PCPs) for their patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) changes the quality of care relative to a "usual care" group in terms of objective outcome measures of glycemic control (e.

g.

, A1c, mean blood glucose, frequency of hypoglycemic episodes) and in terms of subjective ratings by patients.
