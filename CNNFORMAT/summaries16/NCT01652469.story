(fifthQuint)Testing of Drugs Erlotinib and Docetaxel in Lung Cancer Patients Classified Regarding Their Outlook Using VeriStrat.

.

 Goals of the study: 1.

 Explore the predictive ability of the VeriStrat signature, by testing for interaction between treatment arms (Arm A: erlotinib vs Arm B: docetaxel) and VeriStrat status (VSG vs VSP) using as outcome progression free survival.

 2.

 Explore whether treatment with erlotinib provides progression free survival benefit as compared to docetaxel in the VSG group.

 3.

 Compare progression free survival in the two treatment arms (Arm A: erlotinib vs Arm B: docetaxel) in the VSP group.

 4.

 Explore the prognostic ability of the VeriStrat signature by testing for an overall difference in progression free survival between the two VeriStrat groups (in case of no significant interaction).

 5.

 Explore the predictive ability of the VeriStrat signature using the secondary measures of clinical efficacy including overall survival, objective response rate, and disease control rate.

 6.

 Compare overall survival, objective response rate and disease control rate between treatment groups separately in the VSG and VSP groups.

 7.

 Explore the prognostic ability of the VeriStrat signature by testing for an overall difference in overall survival, objective response rate and disease control rate between the two VeriStrat groups (in case of no significant interaction).

 8.

 Assess the safety and the tolerability of the two treatments separately in each VeriStrat group and overall.

 Recruitment period: 18 months Sample Size: 500.

 Testing of Drugs Erlotinib and Docetaxel in Lung Cancer Patients Classified Regarding Their Outlook Using VeriStrat.

@highlight

Using a laboratory test (VeriStrat), patients with relapsed squamous cell lung cancer are assigned to two strata, VSG (VeriStrat Good) and VSP (VeriStrat Poor).

 They are then randomized between an EGFR-TK inhibitor (erlotinib) and chemotherapy (Docetaxel).

 It is hypothesized that the VeriStrat test results are able to predict the benefit of treatment with erlotinib vs docetaxel.

 This would suggest a significant improvement in progression-free survival for VSG patients when treated with Erlotinib, and no significant improvement in VSP patients who receive the same treatment.
