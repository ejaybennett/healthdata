(thirdQuint)A Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Safety Study With AOP LDLA202, ONO LDL50 and Esmolol in Healthy Volunteers.

 A single centre prospective, randomized, double blind study consisting of a local safety Pilot Phase and a triple-cross-over Main Study Phase.

 In the pilot phase, 3 subjects will be administered a bolus with AOP LDLA202 vs.

 placebo (0.

9% saline) simultaneously (same vein on the other body side).

 Following treatment of the first subject per cohort and assuming no safety concerns arise, second and third subjects will be treated in safety intervals of at least 3 hours between doses in individual subjects.

 On Day 3 after dosing a safety follow-up assessment will be done and all adverse events will be reported to the sponsor's medical monitor.

 Assuming no safety concerns arise, the sponsor's medical monitor will give green light for conduct of the Main Treatment Phase in writing.

 In the main phase, 12 subjects will be treated with AOP LDLA202, ONO LDL50 and esmolol.

 Three doses per subject and day (=treatment period), all administered via big superficial veins, are planned with at least 1 hour observation period after each bolus injection.

 Each subject, if confirmed eligible, will complete three treatment periods in total in the main phase of the study.

 ECG, blood pressure, local tolerability and adverse events will be monitored.

 A Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Safety Study With AOP LDLA202, ONO LDL50 and Esmolol in Healthy Volunteers@highlight

The study consists of a Pilot Phase (to assess safety and the local tolerability of highest AOP LDLA202 dose versus placebo) and a Main Treatment Phase (to compare PK, PD and safety and tolerability of AOP LDLA202, ONO LDL50 and esmolol bolus administrations by measurement of blood concentrations of landiolol, esmolol and their metabolites, and by monitoring ECG, blood pressure and adverse events).
