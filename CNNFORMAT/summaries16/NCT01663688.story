(fifthQuint)Data Collection Study of the Nidek Optical Coherence Tomography RS-3000 for 3D Measurements of the Eye.

 This is a prospective, open-labeled, multi-center clinical study.

 After qualifying examination of a subject, 3D retinal measurement in the proximity of the optic disc and the macula are carried out for eligible subjects with normal eyes using an investigational three-dimensional eye imaging photography device called the Nidek Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) RS-3000.

 The primary objective of this clinical study is to develop age-specific normal ranges for the thickness of the retina and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) etc.

 using the Nidek Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) RS-3000 with normative database.

 The secondary objective is to evaluate any adverse events found during the clinical study.

 Data Collection Study of the Nidek Optical Coherence Tomography RS-3000 for 3D Measurements of the Eye@highlight

The purpose of this clinical study is to collect and evaluate the data from eye scans using an investigational three-dimensional eye imaging photography device called the Nidek Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) RS-3000.

 OCT stands for Optical Coherence Tomography, a technique that uses invisible wavelengths of light to make detailed images of the tissues at the back of the eye.

 These images provide information that physicians may use to help diagnose eye conditions and/or to monitor changes in the eye during treatment.
