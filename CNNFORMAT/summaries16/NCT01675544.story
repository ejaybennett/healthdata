(secondQuint)PRospective Evaluation of Electrocardiographic Voltage Changes and Six Minute Walk Test for Predicting Readmissions in Heart Failure (PREEMT-HF Study).

 Primary Objective Determine the ability of EKG voltage changes and pre discharge 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) to predict repeat heart failure hospitalization (HFH) in patients admitted with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF).

 Secondary Objectives 1.

 Determine the ability of EKG voltage changes and pre discharge 6-MWT) to predict a composite of 1 year mortality and HFH in patients admitted with ADHF.

 2.

 Determine the ability of proportionate pulse pressure, orthostatic blood pressure changes and pre discharge inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter by portable ultrasound to predict HFH and mortality.

 PRospective Evaluation of Electrocardiographic Voltage Changes and Six Minute Walk Test for Predicting Readmissions in Heart Failure (PREEMT-HF Study)@highlight

Purpose of the study: To identify whether Electrocardiographic QRS voltage changes (between admission and pre-discharge) and pre discharge 6- minute walk test in patients admitted with acute heart failure can identify patients at risk for recurrent admissions for heart failure.
