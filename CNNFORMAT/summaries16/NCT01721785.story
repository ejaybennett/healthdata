(firstQuint)Diagnostic Value of Novel MR Imaging Techniques for the Primary Staging and Restaging of Rectal Cancer.

 Rectal cancer is a common form of cancer, and the treatment stratification depends on tumour and nodal stage as determined on MRI.

 Unfortunately, the information provided by standard T2-weighted MRI is not sufficient to accurately assess nodal involvement and tumour response after neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

 Additional functional information is required for reliable (re)staging.

 Diffusion-weighted imaging and gadofosveset-enhanced MRI are two new imaging techniques that have all shown great potential in rectal cancer staging.

 In order to provide definite evidence there is a need for a multicenter study with a large patient population.

The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical value of the novel MRI-techniques DWI and gadofosveset-enhanced MRI for the management of rectal cancer patients.
