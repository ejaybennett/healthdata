(fifthQuint)A Phase I/II Study Afatinib/Carboplatin/Paclitaxel Induction Chemotherapy In HPV-Negative HNSCC.

.

 This is a phase I/phase II prospective multicenter trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of afatinib with induction chemotherapy in primary unresected patients with HPV-negative locally advanced SCC stage III or IVa/b of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx.

 The primary endpoint is overall response rate after the completion of induction chemotherapy.

 Eligible patients will begin with a 14 day lead-in period with afatinib alone.

 This will be followed immediately by 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC 6 IV, paclitaxel 175mg/m2 day 1, and afatinib as a continuous daily dosing.

 Each cycle is repeated every 21 days.

 All patients will receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy beginning 2-3 weeks after the completion of the second cycle of induction chemotherapy (Refer to Study Schema in page 8 of the protocol).

 During the period of induction chemotherapy, a complete history and physical (including weight) and tumor assessment by physical examination on Day 1 of each cycle will be performed and documented.

 Complete blood count with differential and a comprehensive metabolic profile will be performed weekly.

 After completion of induction chemotherapy, reassessment with blood work, physical exam, CT/MRI of neck and nasopharyngolaryngoscopy will be performed.

 After the completion of CRT, the patient will have a MRI, CT, or FDG PET approximately 12 weeks after CRT.

 Follow-up will be standard of care from this point onwards.

 Physical exam, blood work and AE assessments will also be frequently performed during entire treatment.

Trial Objectives: The objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of afatinib with induction chemotherapy in primary unresected patients with locally advanced, HPV-negative, stage III or IVa/b HNSCC including oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx.

 Primary Objective Phase I The primary objective of the phase I portion of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended phase II dose of daily oral afatinib that is safe in combination with carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 175mg/m2 q 21 days as an induction regimen.

 Primary Objective Phase 2 The primary objective of the phase 2 portion of the trial is to estimate the objective tumor response rate and toxicity with induction therapy in patients treated on the afatinib dose determined in Phase I.

 Secondary Objectives The secondary objective of phase II is to estimate: 1) the overall response to entire treatment after completion of CRT, 2) progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 2 years, and 3) overall survival (OS) at 2 years.
