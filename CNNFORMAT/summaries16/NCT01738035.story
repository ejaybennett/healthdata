(thirdQuint)The Effect of Nefecon in Patients With Primary IgA Nephropathy at Risk of Developing End-stage Renal Disease.

 NEFECON is an add-on treatment to other medications for nephropathy symptoms and kidney function, including ACEI and/or ARBs.

 Rigorous blood pressure control will be achieved over a 6-month Run-in Phase in which ACEI and/or ARB will be dosed to target a blood pressure of 0.

5 g/g OR urine protein 0.

75 g/24hr will be eligible for randomization and entry into the treatment phase of the trial.

 Patients will remain on their ACEI and/or ARB dosing regimen for the duration of the trial.

 Patients entering the treatment phase will be administered NEFECON (8 mg/day OR 16 mg/day) OR placebo for a phase of 9 months.

 A 3-month follow-up phase will follow on from the treatment phase, of which the first 2 weeks will be used to taper the dose of those patients that received 16 mg/day dosing to 8 mg/day, with the placebo and 8 mg/day groups receiving placebo to retain blinding.

 The Effect of Nefecon in Patients With Primary IgA Nephropathy at Risk of Developing End-stage Renal Disease@highlight

The objective of the study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of two different doses of NEFECON in the treatment of patients with primary IgA nephropathy (IgAN) at risk of developing end-stage renal disease, under rigorous blood pressure control with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and/or angiotensin II receptor I blocker (ARB).
