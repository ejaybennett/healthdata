(secondQuint)Comparison Between Cyclophosphamide and Combination of Methotrexate + Calcineurin Inhibitor for GVHD Prophylaxis.

 We propose a study in which 150 patients will receive graft versus host disease prophylaxis with cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on day +3 and day +4 after bone marrow transplantation, and 150 patients will receive the usual combination of methotrexate and calcineurin inhibitor.

 The study was designed to last for 4 years.

 The primary endpoint is the rate of patients alive, in remission and without immunosuppression, one year after transplant.

 The assignment for each arm of the study will be done through simple randomization.

 Comparison Between Cyclophosphamide and Combination of Methotrexate + Calcineurin Inhibitor for GVHD Prophylaxis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether cyclophosphamide post bone marrow transplant increases the rate of patients alive, in remission and without immunosuppression, one year after transplant, when compared with the combination of methotrexate and calcineurin inhibitor
