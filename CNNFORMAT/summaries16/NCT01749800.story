(secondQuint)Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation and Motor Training in Traumatic Brain Injury Survivors.

 We plan to explore the use of GVS on the severity of attention span deficits and motor training delivered using a spring-based robot.

 We intend to carry out the study in a small cohort of traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors (20 subjects).

 Subjects with attention span deficits but no significant motor impairments will solely undergo a cognitive test of attention with/without GVS.

 Subjects with both attention span deficits and significant motor impairments will undergo a cognitive test of attention and robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation with/without GVS.

The overall goal of the proposed project is to perform a preliminary study to assess the potential effects of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) on the outcomes of a cognitive test of attention and the outcomes of robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation.
