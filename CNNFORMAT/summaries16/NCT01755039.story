(thirdQuint)Course and Complications of Invasive Out-of-hospital Ventilation.

 Background: There has been arise in a number of patients requiring long term ventilation both in the in-hospital as well as the out-of-hospital setting.

 Despite this, little is known about the subsequent political course of this patients following hospital discharge.

 Interventions: This is an observational prospective study over a period of one year in a sample of 50 to 70 invasively ventilated patients living either in a nursing home specialized in the care of ventilated patients or at home.

 If an emergency fulfils more than one criterion in the protocol, every applicable criterion was marked.

 The data will be analyzed using non-parametric descriptive statistics.
