(fifthQuint)Effects of Intensive Robot-assisted Therapy in Patients With Subacute Stroke.

 Subacute stroke participants will be recruited from the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and then were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups: RT with higher-intensity group, RT with lower-intensity group, and conventional intervention group.

 Assessments on sensorimotor impairments (Fugl Mayer Assessment, Motor Status Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale, Myoton, Muscle Metabolism, Box and Block Test, and Revised Nottingham Sensory assessment) and functional performance (Functional Independence Measure, Motor Activity Log, ABILHAND Questionnaire, Adelaide Activities Profile, EQ-5D-5L, and accelerometer) take about 40 minutes to complete.

 Evaluation of brain reorganization using functional magnetic resonance image and movement patterns by kinematic analysis take about 1 hour for each examination.

 Blood samples of the patients (12 ml.

) will be collected to examine the physiological markers (ie, inflammation-related markers, oxidative stress markers, and erythrocyte deformability) before and after intervention.

 Total 24 ml blood will be collected in this study.

 Except for the blood taking, all the examinations are non-invasive.

 Effects of Intensive Robot-assisted Therapy in Patients With Subacute Stroke@highlight

Robot-assisted training (RT) devices developed to date have a significant impact on stroke rehabilitation.

 Several research groups have developed the robotic devices and examined their efficacy on improving upper limb function after stroke.

 All these robotic devices have been applied in stroke rehabilitation and their efficacy are evaluated, but the scientific evidence for the mechanisms of RT-induced recovery, the optimal treatment intensity, and the impact on physiological responses is still lacking.

 This trial is to examine (1) the immediate effects of treatment intensity in RT on sensorimotor impairments and functional performance in patients with subacute stroke; (2) the long-term benefits of treatment intensity in RT by conducting a 6-month follow up evaluation; and (3) the effects of RT on cortical/movement reorganization as well as on the physiological markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and erythrocyte deformability.

 These overall findings will help better understanding of the efficacy of RT on functional outcomes, brain and movement reorganization, and physiological markers.
