(fifthQuint)Exploratory THS 2.

1 Biomarkers of Exposure Study.

 This study intends to evaluate the levels of selected biomarkers of exposure to selected HPHC and of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzymatic activity, as compared to smokers continuing smoking CC ad libitum, after 5 days of ad libitum use.

 Additional parameters will be explored, such as: cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) enzymatic activity, nicotine pharmacokinetics, product evaluation and safety, marker of platelet function, and HST.

 After screening, subjects will be admitted to the clinic for 9 days, including the Day of Admission, 2 days of baseline during which all subjects will continue to smoke their usual CC for a 5-day exposure after randomization.

 After leaving the clinic on the Day of Discharge, the subjects will be followed up for safety over a period of 7 days.

 All subjects will receive smoking cessation advice at screening, at Day of Admission and at Day of Discharge.

 This clinical study will be conducted in compliance with International Conference on Harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use (ICH Good Clinical Practice), the Declaration of Helsinki as amended in 2008, and the applicable regulatory requirements.

 Exploratory THS 2.

1 Biomarkers of Exposure Study@highlight

The goal of this exploratory study is to evaluate the effect of a candidate modified risk tobacco product (MRTP), THS 2.

1, on selected biomarkers of exposure to harmful and potentially harmful smoke constituents (HPHCs), compared to conventional cigarettes (CC).

 The subjective effects (urge to smoke and withdrawal symptoms) which are related to the use of this product will be explored.

 Initial information on safety and on some biological effects when using THS 2.

1 will be collected.

 Human Smoking Topography (HST) will be explored.
