(thirdQuint)Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir in HIV-1-Exposed Newborn Infants at Risk of Acquiring HIV-1 Infection.

 This study will evaluate the safety and PKs of RAL given to HIV-1-exposed newborn infants at risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection.

 The study also seeks to determine the appropriate dosing regimen of RAL that can be safely given to infants in the first 6 weeks of life.

 The study will enroll 50 mother-infant pairs.

 Mothers will be followed until discharge from the labor and delivery unit, and infants will be followed for 24 weeks after birth.

 Infants will be assigned non-randomly to 1 of 2 cohorts.

 Each cohort will include two groups of infants: a RAL-naive group including infants born to mothers who did not receive RAL before delivery, and a RAL-exposed group including infants born to mothers who received at least one dose of RAL within 2 to 24 hours before delivery.

 A minimum of 12 infants will be enrolled into Cohort 1.

 All infants in Cohort 1 will receive RAL as oral granules for suspension as a single dose within 48 hours of birth, in addition to standard of care ARV drugs for PMTCT, and a second dose of RAL at 7 to 10 days of life.

 A minimum of 20 infants will be enrolled into Cohort 2.

 Within Cohort 2, RAL will be started within 48 hours of birth in the RAL-naive infants and between 12 and 60 hours of birth in the RAL-exposed infants.

 Both the RAL-naive and the RAL-exposed infants in Cohort 2 will receive RAL for 6 weeks, in addition to standard of care ARV for PMTCT.

 Dosing will be determined based on analyses of data generated from Cohort 1 and from other studies.

 Study visits for infants in Cohorts 1 and 2 will occur at study entry through Week 24 and include a medical history, physical exam, blood draw, and, at select study visits, PK samplings.

 Note: As of January 2017, enrollment and follow-up to Cohort 1 (RAL-exposed and RAL-naive groups) and enrollment to Cohort 2 (RAL-naive group) are complete.

 Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir in HIV-1-Exposed Newborn Infants at Risk of Acquiring HIV-1 Infection@highlight

This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of raltegravir (RAL) given to HIV-1-exposed newborn infants at risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection.

 (Pharmacokinetics are the various interactions between a drug and the body.

) This study will also evaluate the appropriate dose of RAL to give to an infant to prevent the infant from getting HIV infection from its mother.
