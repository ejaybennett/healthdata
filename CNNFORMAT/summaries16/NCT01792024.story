(secondQuint)MR-Guided Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the oncologic efficacy of laster interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) with primary endpoint of undetectable cancer on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsy of treatment zone at 3 months following treatment.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate oncologic efficacy at 12 months following treatment based on biopsy of the treatment zone.

 II.

 To determine treatment-related safety and toxicity.

 III.

 To longitudinally assess urinary and sexual function in the year following treatment.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo MR-guided LITT.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 12 months.

 MR-Guided Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well magnetic resonance (MR)-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy works in treating patients with prostate cancer.

 Laser therapy uses intense, narrow beams of light to cut and destroy tissue and may help treat prostate cancer
