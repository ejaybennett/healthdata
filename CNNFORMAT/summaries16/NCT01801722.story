(secondQuint)Using NT-proBNP to Detect Chronic Heart Failure in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

 Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COPD were examined regarding chronic heart failure.

 1.

 An interview regarding symptoms: breathlessness, orthopnoea, night cough, nocturia, walking distance.

 2.

 Physical examination: weight and height, heart and lung auscultation, blood pressure measurement after 5 minutes' rest in the sitting position and the presence of peripheral oedema.

 3.

 Electrocardiography.

 4.

 Natriuretic peptide- NT-proBNP (Immulite 2500, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics AB Sweden).

 5.

 Patients with the NT-proBNP level of > 1200 pg/ml were referred for echocardiography to assess left ventricular function.

 Using NT-proBNP to Detect Chronic Heart Failure in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease@highlight

The aim of the present study was to evaluate if the analysis of NT-proBNP might be used as an initial step for the diagnosis of chronic heart failure in patients with COPD in primary health care, and to select patients for a further examination by echocardiography.
