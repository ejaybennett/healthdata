(fifthQuint)Prospective Study Using Hybrid PET/MRI to Evaluate Men With Suspected Recurrence Following Treatment for Prostate Cancer.

 The study will be a non-randomized, prospective study of men with suspected local recurrence of prostate cancer post-prostatectomy or radiation with negative bone and CT scans.

 Hybrid PET/MRI using 18F-FCH will be obtained and a consensus staging report generated for the attending clinician.

 Clinical management questionnaires completed by the study investigator will be obtained pre and post imaging in order to gauge the impact of the hybrid imaging on clinical decision making.

 Prospective Study Using Hybrid PET/MRI to Evaluate Men With Suspected Recurrence Following Treatment for Prostate Cancer@highlight

Evaluate the impact of hybrid 18F-Fluoro-choline (18F-FCH) PET/MRI imaging on the clinical management of men with suspected recurrent prostate cancer post prostatectomy or radiotherapy.

 We hypothesize that hybrid imaging incorporating 18F-FCH PET/MRI imaging will be feasible and will lead to changes in management decisions among men being re-staged for suspected prostate cancer recurrence post-surgery or radiation who are potentially eligible for local salvage therapy.
