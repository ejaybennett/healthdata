 A Study to Assess CLn BodyWash for Reducing Skin Fauna in Patients With Hand Eczema@highlight

The primary objective of this protocol is to acquire pilot data for a larger study to test the following hypothesis: Treatment of the hands of patients with chronic hand dermatitis/atopic dermatitis with CLn BodyWash, a novel gel wash cleanser currently marketed as a cosmetic product containing a dilute concentration of less than 0.

01% sodium hypochlorite and less than 0.

005% concentration as it is lathered, will result in a statistically significant reduction in the number of skin fauna present on the hands of these patients compared to treatment of such patients with traditional wash used clinically such as Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser.
