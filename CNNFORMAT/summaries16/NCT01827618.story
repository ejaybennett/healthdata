(firstQuint)Neoadjuvant Rapamycin in Patients Undergoing Radical Cystectomy.

 This is a presurgical clinical trial which aims to understand the biologic activity of TORC1 inhibition and safety in patients with bladder cancer.

 In this presurgical setting, paired PMBCs and tumor tissue is evaluated before and after exposure to rapamycin to address target specificity, drug delivery, physiologic effects on tumor growth and apoptosis, and correlation of biomarkers with clinical activity.
