(secondQuint)The Effects of Fiber Fortified Foods to the Diets of Chronic Kidney Disease Patients.

 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients may consume lower than recommended amounts of dietary fiber due to typical dietary habits, dietary restrictions, and uremic symptoms.

 A progressive decline in kidney function causes an acculmulation of uremic molecules that contribute to further progression of the disease and reduced quality of life.

 In an effort to evaluate the impact of added fiber on blood urea nitrogen, kidney function and quality of life in patients presenting with a moderate to severe decline in kidney function (eGFR 50 mL/min/1.

73 m2), a single blind, six week dietary intervention, clinical trial will be conducted.
