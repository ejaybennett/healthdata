(fifthQuint)Prevention of Gastric Ulcer Bleeding by Using "Computer-alert" in General Practice.

 The background of the study is that NSAIDs and Aspirins increase the risk of peptic ulcer bleeding.

 On average 1-2% of patients using NSAID and Aspirin will develope gastric ulcer bleeding.

 But for patients with one or more risk-factors, the risk increases to 9% per 6 months.

 The mortality in this case is 10-15%.

 Approximately 3200 patients are admitted to the hospital with bleeding ulcer annually in Denmark.

 Danish investigations have shown that 80% of all peptic ulcer bleedings admitted to hospital are related to the use of NSAID or Aspirin.

 The consumption of NSAID and Aspirin is large.

 A third of people over 60 are treated within a year with these preparations.

 The risk of developing gastric ulcer related to NSAID and Aspirin can be reduced by concomitant therapy with antacids.

 Several studies have shown that only 20-30% of patients with risk-factors receive ulcer preventive medicine.

 Prevention of Gastric Ulcer Bleeding by Using "Computer-alert" in General Practice@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate if a computerised decision-support tool used in general practice, can reduce the frequency of peptic ulcer bleeding related to the use of NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal-antiinflammatory-drug) and ASA( Acetylsalicylic acid) .

 On the basis of "The Danish general medical database" it is possible to develope a computerised decision-support tool, which enables the general practitioner (GP) in a "pop-up" window to get information on each patients risk-factors, when prescribing NSAID and aspirin to a patient at risk.

 This will give the general practitioner the oppurtunity to choose a different type of preparation or prescribe ulcer-preventive medicine at the same time.

 The decision-support tool will be tested in a randomized trial among general practitioners.

 The aim is to reduce the occurence of peptic ulcer bleeding.

 The expected outcome is a reduction in half of the total numbers of peptic ulcers.
