(fifthQuint)Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy.

 Radiotherapy is not considered standard of care practice for patients for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma despite the tumour's inherent radiosensitivity.

 The major challenge has been improving radiation delivery without exceeding dose limits of the surrounding normal liver.

 Recent technological advances with tumour localization and targeting, imaging, treatment planning and delivery have allowed for safe delivery of radiation with tumorcidal effect and minimal treatment-related toxicity.

 This study has three specific aims: 1.

 To develop, validate, and quality test HDR Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) Gated RapidArc technique for application in human liver tumours.

 And furthermore, to test whether HDR SBRT Gated RapidArc can be efficiently and safely delivered to a very large patient population previously ineligible for any therapy (HCC patients with tumours >5cm).

 3.

 To determine if 11C-choline/18F-FDG CT-PET or perfusion CT imaging (that characterize changes in tumour proliferation, glycolysis, and vasculature, respectively) can provide practical non-invasive biomarkers of tumour response, local tumour control, or normal tissue toxicity.

 4.

 To determine if immunologic studies of pre- and post-treatment blood samples can provide biomarkers of tumour response, local and systemic tumour control, or triggers for normal tissue toxicity.

Respiratory-gated, volumetric-modulated arc therapy will be used for the clinical development of high dose rate Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) in inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

 These treatments should enhance local control, progression-free survival and potentially overall survival in HCC patients.

 The investigators will also examine the mechanism of tumour and microenvironmental response to high dose radiation, and search for potential biomarkers to optimize and individualize therapy.

 Pre-treatment and follow-up PET/CT imaging with 11C-choline, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and CT perfusion will examine in-vivo changes in proliferation, glycolysis, and the tumour vasculature, respectively, and blood samples will look for immunologic biomarkers of tumour response.
