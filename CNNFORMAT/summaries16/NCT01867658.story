(thirdQuint)Progel Pleural Air Leak Sealant (PALS) in Video and Robotic Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery.

 This is a prospective, open label, multi-center clinical study designed to assess the safety of the Progel(R) PALS product, including the Extended Applicator Spray Tip, when used in Video Assisted and Robotic Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery.

 The study will treat approximately 105 evaluable subjects at up to 15 U.

S.

 sites.

 All subjects will provide informed consent prior to enrollment in the study.

 Patients who have met the initial screening criteria and who have a visible pleural air leak which requires treatment with a sealant, after standard closure techniques are used (standard sutures, staples or devices supplied by the hospital for thoracoscopic surgery) will be eligible for study participation.

 If the subject is treated, the surgeon will utilize Progel(R) PALS to the same sites originally treated with standard technique.
