(firstQuint)Study Comparing the Pharmacokinetics of FTD as a Component of TAS-102 With FTD Alone.

 This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, parallel, 2-group study evaluating the PK of FTD as a TAS-102 component compared with FTD alone in patients with advanced solid tumors (excluding breast cancer).

 Patients will be randomized to receive a single dose of TAS-102 or FTD during the PK contribution phase and will receive continuing cycles of TAS-102 during the extension phase.
