(fifthQuint)Allogeneic Adipose Tissue-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells for the Induction of Remission in Ulcerative Colitis.

 Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) may be a therapeutic option in diseases associated with severe inflammation or auto-immune diseases, due to their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties.

 A number of clinical trials are being conducted worldwide testing th efficacy of MSC, mainly isolated from bone marrow, for different conditions, such as Graft Versus host Disease, refractory Crohn's Disease, ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, type I Diabetes Mellitus, or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

 Usually, the route of administration of the cells in these studies is intravenous.

 Local injection of MSC for fistulizing Crohn's Disease has proven efficacious.

 Endoscopy is a routinary technique for the evaluation of gastrointestinal and colonic conditions.

 The purpose of our study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of the intracolonic injection by using a colonoscope of allogeneic adipose tissue-derived MSC in patients with moderate active ulcerative colitis.

The aims of our study are to evaluate the feasibility and safety of endoscopic injection of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells in human subjects with moderate active ulcerative colitis, assessing the absence of adverse events associated to the investigational drug, and to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment to induce remission of moderate active ulcerative colitis, by improvements in disease activity index, quality of life index, and endoscopic index.
