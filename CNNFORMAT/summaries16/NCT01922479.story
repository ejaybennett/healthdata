(fifthQuint)Pilot Study of Ferric Carboxymaltose to Treat Iron Deficiency in Asians With Heart Failure.

 Heart failure (HF) is a major global public health issue which also affects Asia.

 Singapore National Registry of Disease data shows a 9.

4% rise in public hospital HF admissions from 2008 to 2009 (4140 to 4530).

 Anaemia (low blood Haemoglobin level) is a common co-morbidity in HF, ranging from 14% to 56% in outpatient registries and clinical trials.

 Anaemia exacerbates the basic symptoms of HF of dyspnea and exercise intolerance, thereby reducing quality of life (QoL).

 However, recent approaches aimed at improving and normalizing Haemoglobin have been unsuccessful (STAMINA-HeFT, RED-HF).

Novel approaches are required to address this problem.

 Iron deficiency (ID) is a well-understood cause of anaemia.

 ID without overt anaemia may be present in HF patients.

 The study by Jankowska (2010) of 546 systolic HF patients had a 37% prevalence of ID, regardless of Haemoglobin level.

 This was associated with reduced peak oxygen consumption, high ventilatory response, impaired exercise capacity, and depressive symptoms in HF patients.

 ID was a strong independent predictor of death, heart transplantation, and poor clinical outcome in chronic HF.

The Ferinject Assessment in Patients with Iron Deficiency and Chronic Heart Failure (FAIR-HF) study showed significant improvement in 6MWT, NYHA class, and overall QoL score in HF patients treated with IV iron in the form of Ferric Carboxymaltose (FCM).

Unpublished preliminary data from the ongoing Nation-wide Singapore study on Heart Failure (SHOP) indicates that the observed point prevalence of ID is approximately 60% with a significant and direct correlation with exercise performance.

To date, no studies exist of FCM in an Asian HF population.

 We hypothesise that IV Iron repletion therapy using FCM in Asian patients with HF and ID will improve outcomes including exercise capacity (measured by 6MWT), quality of life (measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ amp; VAS), NYHA functional class, and rate of HF hospitalization.

 Primary Aim To determine the effect of IV iron repletion therapy compared to placebo on exercise capacity change as assessed by the 6MWT at the 4th and 12th week after administration of IV FCM in subjects with recent acutely decompensated heart failure and iron deficiency.

 Secondary Aims To assess the effect of IV FCM compared with placebo on change in QoL assessments (KCCQ amp; VAS).

To assess the effect of IV FCM compared with placebo on change in NYHA Functional Class.

To assess the effect of IV FCM compared with placebo on the rate of HF Hospitalization.

To assess the safety and tolerability of IV FCM compared to placebo.

 Hypothesis We hypothesise that IV Iron repletion therapy using FCM in patients with HF and ID will improve outcomes including exercise capacity (measured by 6MWT), quality of life (measured by KCCQ amp; VAS), NYHA functional class, and rate of HF hospitalization.

 Pilot Study of Ferric Carboxymaltose to Treat Iron Deficiency in Asians With Heart Failure@highlight

Heart failure (HF) is a major global public health issue which also affects Asia.

 Data from the National Registry of Disease in Singapore shows a 9.

4% rise in HF admissions in public hospitals from 2008 to 2009 (4140 to 4530).

 Anaemia (low blood Haemoglobin level) is a common problem occurring in HF, ranging from 14% to 56% in outpatient registries and clinical trials.

 Anaemia exacerbates the basic symptoms of HF of dyspnea and exercise intolerance, thereby reducing quality of life (QoL).

 However, recent approaches aimed at improving and normalizing Haemoglobin have been unsuccessful.

Novel approaches are required to address this problem.

 Iron deficiency (ID) is a well-understood cause of anaemia.

 ID without overt anaemia may be present in HF patients.

 A recent study by Jankowska et al published in 2010 of 546 HF patients showed a 37% prevalence of ID, regardless of Haemoglobin level.

 This was associated with worse outcomes including impaired exercise capacity.

 The presence of ID indicates a higher likelihood of deteriorating and dying early.

 A landmark study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (The Ferinject Assessment in Patients with Iron Deficiency and Chronic Heart Failure (FAIR-HF) study) showed that HF patients who were treated with IV iron in the form of Ferric Carboxymaltose (FCM) had better outcomes, including improved exercise capacity, overall function, and quality of life.

 There is a lack of contemporary data on ID in HF patients in Asia, including data on treatment with this novel IV iron FCM.

 Hypothesis We hypothesise that treating ID in HF patients in Asia using FCM will improve outcomes including exercise capacity, quality of life, overall functional status, and the need to be hospitalised for complications arising from HF.
