(thirdQuint)Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety Between Two Antiretroviral Regimens, in HIV-1-infected Treatment-nave Subjects With Low CD4 Counts.

 Principal objective To evaluate the virological efficacy and safety at week 48 of 2 regimens atazanavir/ritonavir (ATZ/r) 300/100 mg or darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) 800/100 mg, each in combination with a fixed-dose of tenofovir/emtracitabine in HIV-1 treatment-naive subjects with CD4 counts below 200 mu L.

 Secondary objectives - Proportion of subjets with virologic efficacy at week 24 - Proportion of subjects with confirmed virologic failure at week 24 or later - Proportion of patients with virologic mutations - Evaluate the virologic effect in seminal fluid - To evaluate immunological response over time up to week 48 - To assess plasma and seminal pharmacokinetics of the drugs in the treatment regimen at week 4, 24, and 48 - Correlate the pharmacokinetic properties of the drugs with virologic outcome in plasma and semen at week 4 and 48 - Correlate the free fraction (not bound to protein) of atazanavir and darunavir in plasma and semen to virologic outcome - Evaluate the relationship of bilirubinemia with atazanavir - Change from baseline in fasting lipids, fasting glucose and insulin over time in the 2 arms - Compare adherence patient satisfaction and sexual behaviour between the regimens Methodology This is a 48 week, multicentre, prospective, open label, phase IV, randomized.

 non comparative, study.

 Inclusion criteria - Male or female, aged > 18 years of age.

 - HIV-1 infection determined by a positive ELISA and confirmed by Western blot - Plasma HIV-RNA > 1 000 c/mL - CD4+T cell count 50 cp/mL at week 24 or later confirmed by a second HIV RNA at least 14 days after the first test - Development of resistance mutations in subjects who have virologic failure testing at 24 weeks or later tested by a genotypic resistance test - Evaluate the virologic effect in seminal fluid at baseline, W4 and W48 by change in HIV RNA concentrations in semen over time - To evaluate immunological response over time up to week 48 in the 2 arms by CD4 cell count ( W-4, W2,W4, W12, W36 and W48), differenciation and activation in T CD4 ( W2,W4, W12, W24 and W48); Change in lymphocyte subset reconsistution at week 48 compared to baseline.

 ; Change in immunolgic markers of inflammations at weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 48 - To assess plasma and seminal pharmacokinetics of the drugs in the treatment regimen at week 4, 24, and 48 through residual concentrations ( C min) of antiretroviral drugs at W4, W24, and W48 - Atazanavir and darunavir (plasma and seminal) drug concentrations and coorelation with adverse clinical and laboratory events.

 - Evaluate the relationship of bilirubinemia with atazanavir pharmacokinetics (Cmin) - Evolution of lipid, glucose and insulin parameters from baseline to weeks 24 and 48 - Adherence to regimen, patient satisfaction and sexual behaviour between the regimens at W2,W24 and W48 mesured by ( mettre ref) - Evolution of anthropomorphic measurements from baseline to weeks 24, 48.

 Substudies Brief description (2 lines maximum) and person in charge of the substudy - Immunologic substudy ( Pr Brigitte Autran) : Change in immunolgic markers of inflammations at weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 48 and change in lymphocyte subset reconsistution at week 48 compared to baseline.

 - Pharmacologic substudy ( Dr Gilles Peytavin) : To assess plasma and seminal pharmacokinetics of the drugs in the treatment regimen at week 4, 24, and 48 through residual concentrations ( C min) of antiretroviral drugs at W4, W24, and W48 - Virologic substudy ( Dr Anne Genevieve Marcelin) : Evaluate the virologic effect in seminal fluid at baseline, W4 and W48 - Behaviour substudy ( Dr France Lert) : Compare adherence patient satisfaction and sexual behaviour between the regimens at W2,W24 and W48 Estimated enrolment: 120 subjects (60 per group) randomly assigned 1:1.

A phase IV, prospective, multicenter , randomized open label, 48 weeks study to evaluate the antiretroviral efficacy and safety of atazanavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir, each in combination with a fixed dose of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate- emtricitabine in HIV-1-infected treatment-naive subjects with CD4 counts below 200 mu L.
