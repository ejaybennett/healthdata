(thirdQuint)Crossover Feasibility Study of Portable AP Device With Zone-MPC and HMS and Adapted I:C and Basal Insulin.

 The study consists of an evaluation of the Artificial Pancreas device system during two 24-27.

5-hour closed-loop phases in an outpatient/hotel environment.

 Prior to the closed-loop phases, each subject will undergo a 7-day data collection period consisting of his or her usual free-living conditions along with 3 meals of known carbohydrate content.

 Data from the insulin pump, a continuous glucose monitoring sensor (CGM), diet and exercise records will be collected during this period.

 These data from this 7-day period will be analyzed in order to come up with adapted basal insulin infusion rates and bolus insulin to carbohydrate (I:C) ratios.

 Crossover Feasibility Study of Portable AP Device With Zone-MPC and HMS and Adapted I:C and Basal Insulin@highlight

The purpose of this trial is to assess the performance of an Artificial Pancreas (AP) device using the Portable Artificial Pancreas System (pAPS) platform for subjects with type 1 diabetes using an insulin pump and rapid acting insulin.

 This proposed study is designed to compare closed-loop control with or without optimization of initialization parameters related to basal insulin infusion rates and insulin to carbohydrate (I:C) ratios for meals and snacks.
