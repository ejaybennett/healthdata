(secondQuint)68Ga-Citrate PET of Healthy Volunteers.

 Six healthy male volunteers are recruited in this study.

 Gallium-68 citrate radiopharmaceutical is intravenously injected as a bolus and whole-body distribution kinetics are studied by dynamic whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography.

 During imaging, serial venous blood samples are drawn, plasma is separated and radioactivity is measured by gamma counter.

 Immediately after imaging session, urine is voided and radioactivity is measured by gamma counting.

 As a final point, radiation dosimetry due to single Gallium-68 citrate injection is determined.

 68Ga-Citrate PET of Healthy Volunteers@highlight

This study investigates whole-body distribution kinetics of intravenously administered Gallium-69 (68Ga) citrate by positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT).

 Thereafter, radiation dosimetry of 68Ga-citrate PET/CT will be determined.
