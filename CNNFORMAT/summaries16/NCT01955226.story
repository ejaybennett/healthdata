(thirdQuint)CHG Dressings in Children With Central Lines.

 In this prospective, randomized, cohort study, we plan on enrolling all patients 2 months to 18 years of age admitted with a central venous catheter expected to be in place for > 48 hours.

 Patients will be randomized to either receive 1) Tegaderm CHG clear dressing or 2) standard clear Tegaderm IV dressing.

 All central line care will remain uniform between the two groups as dictated by the central line maintenance bundle currently directing central line care in our children's hospital.

 Study completion will occur at the time of central line removal or discharge from the hospital, whichever comes first.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether Tegaderm CHG clear dressing reduces the number of unscheduled central catheter dressing changes compared to standard clear Tegaderm IV dressing in pediatric patients between the ages of 2 months to 18 years with central venous access.

 Secondarily, we will monitor contact skin irritation and central line associated blood stream infections.
