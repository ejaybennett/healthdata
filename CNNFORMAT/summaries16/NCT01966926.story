(thirdQuint)Self-Weighing Instruction Feasibility Study.

 This study tested the feasibility of assigning participants to daily or weekly weighing, monitored adherence to weighing instructions, and tracked additional behavioral and psychosocial indicators over a period of six months.

 It was hypothesized that there would be no differences in mood or adherence between daily versus weekly weighing conditions.

 Knowledge about the benefits of frequent self-weighing may shape public health recommendations for regular weighing as a weight reduction or obesity prevention strategy.

 Self-Weighing Instruction Feasibility Study@highlight

Scant data have been reported on the effects of weight self-monitoring during weight control.

 The purpose of this pilot project was to consider the questions: Is it possible to assign participants to engage in daily weight self-monitoring, and are there differential effects on mood of daily versus weekly weighing?
