(fifthQuint)Biological Evaluation of Dietary Supplement Liposomal Glutathione.

 Additional information about this dietary supplement: - Glutathione is an antioxidant naturally produced in our body.

 Glutathione protects the brain and other organs from oxidative stress.

 - Low glutathione is associated with high oxidative stress, which has been linked to aging and many illnesses.

 Schizophrenia is a mental illness that doctors still do not fully understand.

 Individuals with schizophrenia often have low levels of glutathione.

 - Glutathione can be supplied through dietary supplement.

 However, if taken plainly, it easily breaks down in our gut.

 - Scientists have now found a way to wrap glutathione in tiny drops of oil particles called liposomes.

 That way, the gut cannot break it down so it is absorbed into our body.

 Once inside the body, our cells can take in the liposomes and use the glutathione to reduce oxidative stress.

 - Liposome-wrapped glutathione is not a drug or medicine.

 Biological Evaluation of Dietary Supplement Liposomal Glutathione@highlight

Low levels of antioxidant molecules such as glutathione have been found in people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

 However, oral glutathione is not well absorbed because the compound is mostly broken down in the gastrointestinal system.

 Liposomes are tiny droplets of oil particles that encapsulate and protect the glutathione.

 In this study we will evaluate a liposomal formulation of glutathione for tolerability and to examine if this formulation serves the function of increasing glutathione in the brain and body.
