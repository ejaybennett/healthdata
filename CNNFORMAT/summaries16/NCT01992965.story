(firstQuint)Effect of Real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring on Glucose Control and Outcomes of Critically Ill Patients.

 Real-time continuous glucose monitoring system has shown great accuracy and feasibility in critically ill patients.

 However, its impact on glucose control and outcomes has nearly unknown.

 Thus, Investigators designed this study to evaluate the effect of real-time continuous glucose monitoring system on glucose control and outcomes of critically ill patients.
