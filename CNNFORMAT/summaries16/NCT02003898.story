(firstQuint)Post Approval Study of the TS Feature With the 530G Pump System Supplemented With Commercial Patient Data.

 The evaluation of Threshold Suspend(TS) feature is conducted by two sub-studies: 1) Multi-Center Trial; 2) Commercial Data Evaluation.

 Multi-center trial is initiated to observe the Threshold Suspend (TS) feature with a sensor-augmented insulin pump (Medtronic MiniMed(R) 530G insulin pump) in patients 16 and older with insulin requiring diabetes over a period of one year.

 In addition, additional data from commercial use will be analyzed/summarized to support the Multi-center trial as the enrolled population is lower (N=426) than the anticipated N=1000 subjects.
