(secondQuint)Open Label Trial of PEG-IFN, RBV & TVR vs.

 PEG-IFN & RBV Alone in Tx of HCV-1 in HIV-1 Co-infected Patients (CHAT).

 In this study, we will compare two treatment options for hepatitis C in patients who also have HIV infection, to see if there are any differences in the numbers of patients treated who successfully got rid of the hepatitis C virus when the treatment was complete.

 We will also compare how well the two treatment options are tolerated by the patients taking them.
