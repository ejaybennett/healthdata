(firstQuint)Clinical Evaluation of Sutures in Periodontal Surgery.

 Forty patients participated in this prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial.

 Vertical mattress sutures were used following resective periodontal surgery performed by one operator.

 Four suture materials were selected for evaluation: 5-0 silk; 5-0 polypropylene; 5-0 polyglycolic acid (PGA), and 4-0 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).

 Seven days after the surgical procedure, the surgeon assessed suture loosening and removed the sutures.

 A blind researcher clinically evaluated erythema and edema.
