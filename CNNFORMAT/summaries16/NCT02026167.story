(secondQuint)Spinal Cord Injury Collaborative Care Study.

 Individuals with SCI were treated by a care manager who worked in collaboration with the participant's physician to decrease pain, decrease depression symptoms, and/or to increase physical activity.

 This was done by collaborating on current treatments to make sure that they are being as effective as possible and by providing non-pharmacological treatments.
