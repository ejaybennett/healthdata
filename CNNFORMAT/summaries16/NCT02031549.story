(firstQuint)Prospective Observational Correlation of Sperm Assay Results With Blastocyst Formation.

 A "SpermComet" assay will be used to characterize DNA fragmentation of surplus sperm samples remaining after in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles.

 We will investigate potential correlation between these assay results and the outcomes of IVF cycles that used those sperm samples.
