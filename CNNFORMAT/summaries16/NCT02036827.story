(secondQuint)The Effect of Deep Neuromuscular Blockade on Postoperative Shoulder Tip Pain After Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy.

 Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the gold standard treatment for gall bladder disease.

 However, 30-50% of patients suffer from shoulder tip pain, which might arise from diaphragm stretch due to pneumoperitoneum.

 In the previous pilot study, working intra-abdominal space was increased in the condition of deep neuromuscular blockade.

 And thus investigators hypothesized that the depth of neuromuscular blockade can affect insufflation pressure and intra-abdominal volume, which result in the severity of diaphragm stretch and postoperative shoulder pain.

 In addition, the depth of neuromuscular blockade can alter pulmonary compliance.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there is any difference in incidence of shoulder tip pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy between the groups with moderate neuromuscular block and deep neuromuscular block.
