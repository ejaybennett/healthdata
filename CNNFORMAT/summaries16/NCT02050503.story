(fifthQuint)Intranasal Transmucosal Fentanyl Pectin for Breakthrough Cancer Pain in Radiation-induced Oropharyngeal Mucositis.

 An open, non-randomized study design was used to assess the titration, safety and efficacy of intranasal fentanyl in pectin for the treatment of secondary breakthrough pain in patients with confirmed tolerance of opioid therapy for chronic pain secondary to radiation-induced mucositis.

 The study plans to include 30 evaluable patients from multiple centers throughout the country.

 The trial comprises a screening period, an open titration period, and an open-label treatment period in which at least 12 breakthrough pain episodes are to be treated.
