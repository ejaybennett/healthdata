(thirdQuint)FLT-PET/MRI for Early Response Monitoring to Novel Cancer Therapeutic Agents.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this pilot imaging study is to determine the feasibility of FLTPET/MR imaging for early prediction of treatment response in patients undergoing antiangiogenic cancer treatment.

 The study will assess PET/MRI test-retest reproducibility and compare baseline PET/MRI with PET/MRI after initiation (within 2-4 weeks) of antiangiogenic therapy.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: - To compare early changes in PET biomarker (FLT) tumor uptake with treatment response assessed at completion of therapy (prediction of treatment response).

 - To compare changes in MRI signal intensities (multi-parametric MRI) with treatment response assessed at completion of therapy.

 - To compare results from multi-parametric MR imaging with FLT tumor uptake.

 - To assess combinations of quantitative PET and MRI metrics.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo FLT-PET/MRI twice at baseline and once within 4 weeks after start of treatment.

 FLT-PET/MRI for Early Response Monitoring to Novel Cancer Therapeutic Agents@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine (FLT)-positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) in measuring early response in patients with metastatic solid tumors receiving treatment that blocks blood flow to the tumor.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as FLT-PET/MRI, may help measure a patient's response earlier during treatment.
