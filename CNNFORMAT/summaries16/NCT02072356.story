(thirdQuint)Radiolabeled Glass Beads in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Cannot be Removed by Surgery.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Provide oversight to treatment with TheraSphere to eligible patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the liver who are not surgical resection candidates.

 II.

 Evaluate patient experience, toxicities and overall survival associated with TheraSphere treatment.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres intra-arterially (IA) on day 0, and may receive a second dose within 30-90 days of initial treatment.

 Patients may receive additional treatment 4-12 weeks after initial treatment at the discretion of the study physician.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-6 weeks and annually for 2 years.

 Radiolabeled Glass Beads in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Cannot be Removed by Surgery@highlight

This clinical trial studies radiolabeled glass beads (yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres) in treating patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

 Internal radiation therapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells.

 Using radiolabeled glass beads to kill tumor cells may be an effective treatment for liver cancer.
