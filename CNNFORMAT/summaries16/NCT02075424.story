(firstQuint)Descriptive Study of Biological Stress and Perceived Stress at the Center 15.

 Sample description : qualitative variables be expressed as percentages, numbers and 95% confidence intervals Quantitative variables will be expressed as means, standard deviations or medians, range, interquartile intervals Description of biological stress : it will be described by calculating the difference between the observed peek or peeks of cortisol ans the cortisol level measured at rest (means, standard deviations or medians, range, interquartile intervals) Description of perceived stress : the AVS will be described in terms of means and standard deviation Comparison of the peek-delta/base level of cortisol in the 3 different workstations of the call center operators according to the non parametrical Kruskall Wallis test.

 Same for the lengthof service of the call operator, the severity of the call and the status of the doctor The AVS score (perceived stress) will be compared to the peek-delta/base level of cortisol (biological stress) thanks to the Spearmann correlation coefficient.
