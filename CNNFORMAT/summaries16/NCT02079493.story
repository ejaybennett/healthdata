(firstQuint)Prospective Functional Outcome Study of the Knee.

 This study aims to use up to 75 patients at 3 centers to determine a baseline short-term postoperative physical function status of patients undergoing a total knee arthroplasty through patient and clinically based assessments.

 The KOOS score will collect data on the patient's physical function, stiffness, and pain.

 The BERG balance, TUG, and TUDS tests will be used quantitatively to assess the patient's ability to conduct activities of daily living like walking for an extended period of time, standing from a seated position, and maintaining balance while performing a series of actions.
