(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Brigatinib (AP26113) in Participants With Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)-Positive, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Previously Treated With Crizotinib.

 The drug being tested in this study is called Brigatinib (AP26113).

 This study will look at the efficacy of Brigatinib.

 The study enrolled 222 patients.

 Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups: - Brigatinib 90 mg - Brigatinib 90 mg -180 mg All participants will be asked to take tablet, orally once daily until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.

 Participants in Brigatinib 90 mg - 180 mg received 180 mg with a 7-day lead-in at 90 mg.

 This multi-center trial was conducted worldwide.
