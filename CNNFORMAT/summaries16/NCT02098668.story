(firstQuint)Mathematical Model for the Human Menstrual Cycle, Endocrinological Diseases and Fertility Treatment-PAEON.

 From hormonal measurements throughout 1-2 menstrual cycles in women with and without endocrinological pathology a mathematical model of the human menstrual cycle will be generated.

 The model will serve to predict development of the cycle including ovulation as well as to better understand the pathophysiology of endocrinological disorder.

 In a second step current treatment protocols for fertility treatment will be integrated into the model in order to optimize treatment outcome.
