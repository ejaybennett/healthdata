(firstQuint)Mechanism of Microbiome-induced Insulin Resistance in Humans (Aim 1).

 We will test the hypothesis that a high fat diet given to lean, normal glucose tolerant subjects will modify gut microbiome composition and enhance intestinal permeability, which will increase plasma LPS concentration, induce an inflammatory response in peripheral tissues (skeletal muscle), and impair insulin signaling and sensitivity.

 Also we will test the hypothesis that the inflammatory response and insulin resistance caused by high fat ingestion can be ameliorated by administering - a synbiotic (Bifidobacterium longum R0175 and oligofructose) which protects the intestinal epithelial barrier and decreases intestinal translocation of LPS; and - sevelamer, an agent which sequesters lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the gastrointestinal tract limiting its translocation into the circulation.

 Mechanism of Microbiome-induced Insulin Resistance in Humans (Aim 1)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of high fat consumption on the intestinal microbiome, metabolic endotoxemia, and insulin action, in lean normal glucose tolerant subjects.
