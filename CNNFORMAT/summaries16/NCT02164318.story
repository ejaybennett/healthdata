(fifthQuint)Effects of Exercise and Improved Nitric Oxide Bioavailability on Arteriovenous Fistula Maturation.

 This project will examine if enhancing Nitric Oxide (NO) bioavailability increases the rates of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation in end stage renal disease patients requiring vascular access for hemodialysis.

 To enhance NO bioavailability the study team will utilize a program of forearm exercise training, application of nitroglycerin ointment or both.

 Following entry into the study, approximately 4 weeks prior to surgery subjects will undergo a series of non-invasive tests of vascular function in the arm of fistula creation.

 Following this vascular function testing, subjects will follow the intervention treatment for 4 weeks.

 After 4 weeks of intervention treatment and prior to surgery, the vascular function analysis will be repeated to determine if the interventions had an effect on arm vascular function.

 Surgery to create the AVF will follow the second vascular function analysis.

 A discard sample of the vein used to create the AVF and a blood sample will be collected during surgery to assess potential biologic differences between intervention groups.

 The interventions will be continued until 4 weeks following surgery.

 Subjects will be followed to determine if the AVF matured and was successfully used for dialysis.

This project will examine if enhancing Nitric Oxide (NO) bioavailability increases the rates of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation in end stage renal disease patients requiring vascular access for hemodialysis.

 To enhance NO bioavailability the study team will utilize a program of forearm exercise training, application of nitroglycerin ointment or both.

 Goals of this study are (A) to measure if recruited subjects can tolerate the intervention protocols, and determine if dependent variable measures, including surgery outcome, and measurement of physiologic and biologic markers, can be obtained; (B) To measure subject compliance and adherence rates for each of the intervention arms and testing visits; (C) To examine which intervention or combination of interventions demonstrates the strongest preliminary effects in order to estimate power for a pivotal intent to treat trial; and (D) explore group differences in clinical vascular markers and biologic markers in vein tissue.
