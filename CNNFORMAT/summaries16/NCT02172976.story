(thirdQuint)Randomized Multicenter Phase II/III Study With Adjuvant Gemcitabine Versus Neoadjuvant / Adjuvant FOLFIRINOX for Resectable Pancreas Carcinoma.

 This is a phase II/III randomized multicenter study.

 Patients with resectable pancreatic carcinoma will be randomized in Arm A (surgery plus adjuvant gemcitabine, 6 cycles) or Arm B (6 cycles FOLFIRINOX neoadjuvant, 6 cycles FOLFIRINOX adjuvant).

 Primary endpoint is the overall survival, secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, perioperative morbidity and mortality, rate of R0 resections, tolerability and feasibility of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX and others.

In this multicenter study, patients with resectable pancreatic carcinoma will be treated with (a) surgery followed by 6 cycles gemcitabine or (b) 6 cycles FOLFIRINOX followed by surgery followed by 6 cycles FOLFIRINOX.

 The overall survival between both therapies will be compared as well as other parameters.
