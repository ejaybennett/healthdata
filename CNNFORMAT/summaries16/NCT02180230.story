(secondQuint)Immediate Function of NobelSpeedy Shorty and Brnemark System Mk III Shorty Implants in Daily Use.

 The primary endpoint was the change in marginal bone levels (in mm) from the time of implant insertion to follow-up visits (3, 6, 12, 36 and 60 months).

 Further endpoints were: - cumulative survival rates of the implants - soft tissue parameters (papilla index, bleeding on probing) - plaque formation.
