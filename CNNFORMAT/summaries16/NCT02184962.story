(fifthQuint)Periodontal Disease and Post-menopausal Osteoporosis.

 81 active periodontal sites from 31 postmenopausal women aged 45-70 years with chronic periodontitis were studied.

 Samples of gingival crevicular fluid were collected by paper strips and ELISA test was conducted to determine the total concentration of RANKL, OPG, and then obtain the values of the RANKL / OPG ratio.

 We analyzed 66 samples of gingival crevicular fluid obtained from active periodontal sites of 17 patients with osteopenia / osteoporosis and 15 samples gingival crevicular fluid obtained from active periodontal sites obtained of 14 controls patients with normal osseous condition.

 Statistical analyzes were computed and analyzed using Graphpad Software.

 To determine if the data correspond to a normal distribution the D'Agostino-Pearson test was used.

 The values of cytokines (RANKL and OPG) and its ratio (RANKL / OPG) were compared using Mann-Whitney Test t U.

 Analysis Spearman correlation and linear regression for statistic was also performed to determine whether there was any relationship between the variables analyzed.

 It was considered as statistically significant p value 0.

 Periodontal Disease and Post-menopausal Osteoporosis@highlight

The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of RANKL and Osteoprotegerin, and their relationship in gingival crevicular fluid of post-menopausal women with osteoporosis/osteopenia and chronic periodontitis simultaneously and evaluate the effect that the use of bisphosphonates in periodontal disease.

 Study hypothesis: "The osteoporosis / osteopenia in postmenopausal women patients with periodontal disease affect the ratio RANKL / OPG in gingival crevicular fluid samples favoring osteoclastogenesis processes "
