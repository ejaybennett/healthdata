(firstQuint)Clinical, Physiological and Prognostic Implication of Microvascular Status.

 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR), index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR), and coronary flow reserve (CFR) will be measured in stable angina patients before coronary intervention.

 Relationship between angiographic characteristics of patients and FFR, IMR, CFR will be analyzed.

 Comparison of risk factors and prognosis between parameters will be also analyzed.

 This study will evaluate that which parameter is correlate with disease severity and risk factors of patients.

 Clinical, Physiological and Prognostic Implication of Microvascular Status@highlight

There are several physiologic parameters in evaluating cardiovascular disease.

 This study will reveal which parameter is the most proper value in predicting disease severity and risk factors of patients.
