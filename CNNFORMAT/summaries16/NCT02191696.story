(firstQuint)Observational Study of ICD and Pacemaker Sensing in the Presence of IMED-4 Operation.

 The implanted CRM device will have shock therapy and rate sensor temporarily deactivated or placed in magnet mode during the time the IMED-4 is activated.

 The IMED-4 will be activated for a time not to exceed 15 minutes.

 During the time the IMED-4 is active, the CRM device programmer will print the voltage sensing of the implanted lead in real-time.

 The printout will be examined for the presence of far-field sensing artifacts.
