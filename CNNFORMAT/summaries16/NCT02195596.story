(fifthQuint)Effects of Exercise on Cognitive Performance of Patients With Alzheimer-type Dementia.

 Pilot Study.

.

 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an intervention that combines high intensity aerobic exercise with strength (AAAD) on general cognitive performance of patients affected by mild Alzheimer's disease (AD).

 DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial in two parallel groups: SCOPE: 2 health center of Basque Health Service , in coordination with its reference neurology services.

 PARTICIPANTS: 80 patients with mild AD.

 INTERVENTION: Both groups receiving standard drug treatment.

 The intervention group also receive a supervised EEAA program, while the control group receive a similar intervention at low intensity.

 Patients are followed up over 1 year.

 Three blind measurements are made repeatedly : baseline, at 6 and 12 months.

 MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure is change in cognitive performance that is measured in a blinded way with the cognitive section of the ADAS scale (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale) at 0, 6 and 12.

Secondary Outcomes: Global cognitive performance (Neuropsychological battery TBR-B),neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI), ADL (Blessed),functional capacity (Test of 6-minute walk), cardiorespiratory Test, muscular strength (hand dynamometer and trunk); PREDICTORS AND CONFOUNDING VARIABLES: baseline cognitive performance, previous physical activity, medication, age, sex, APOE, schooling and cognitive reserve.

 ANALYSIS: We compared the two groups in terms of observed mean changes from baseline in ADAS measurement and other variables, intention to treat, using longitudinal mixed effects models for repeated measures at 6 and 12 months.

 Effects of Exercise on Cognitive Performance of Patients With Alzheimer-type Dementia.

 Pilot Study.

@highlight

A program that combines high intensity aerobic exercise (<85% of Heart Rate Reserve) with resistance, progressive and moderate intensity intervals, carried out in primary care, is effective in terms of a smaller increase in respect to the baseline measurement in the total score of the ADAS cognitive section (Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive section),in the control group that receives an intervention similar to low intensity (30-40% of Heart rate reserve).

 We Expect a difference of at least 3 points between the means of the increments between the intervention and control group.
