(firstQuint)Study of 18 mg Selincro As-needed Use, in the Treatment of Patients With Alcohol Dependence in Primary Care.

 635 patients are planned (total number of patients) with 475 patients treated with Selincro(R) (Cohort A) and 160 patients not treated with Selincro(R) (Cohort B) to determine the reduction in alcohol consumption in patients with alcohol dependence.

 Cohort A will comprise patients who maintain a high drinking risk level (DRL, defined by World Health Organization (WHO) as >60g alcohol/day for a man or >40g alcohol/day for a woman), or above, in the period between the Screening and Inclusion Visits.

 Cohort B will comprise patients who reduce their alcohol consumption in the period between the Screening and Inclusion visits, that is, patients who do not maintain at least a high DRL at the Inclusion Visit (and are therefore not eligible for treatment with nalmefene according to the SmPC).
