(fifthQuint)Compare the Efficacy of Different Antiplatelet Therapy Strategy After Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery.

 The study is designed to show the superiority of ticagrelor and ticagrelor plus aspirin as compared with aspirin monotherapy respectively for the 1-year primary efficacy end point of vein graft patency.

 The primary comparison includes two separate parts.

 One is to demonstrate T+A better than A and the other is T better than A.

 One year rate of vein graft patency in the aspirin group is estimated as 80%.

 The assumed rate of ticagrelor plus aspirin is 90%.

 With a two-sided alpha level 0.

05 and 80% power, 199 grafts to each group are required.

 On the other hand, if we assume the rate of ticagrelor monotherapy has the 1-year vein graft patency rate of 87%, under the same two-sided 0.

05 alpha 441 grafts in each arm will offer 80% power to show the superiority of ticagrelor along for the primary efficacy end point.

 Combined the above two assumptions, if the allocation rate is 1:1:1, this study needs to recruit 1,323 grafts in total (441 in each) to achieve the pre-specified power for both the two comparisons (T+A vs.

 A and T vs.

 A).

 The principle investigator assumes that the average number of the vien grafts in one patient is 2.

7-3.

0.

 With this assumption, 500 patients are to be recruited, which will provide us a total of 1350 - 1500 grafts.

 According to the above, this study will be a confirmatory clinical trial to the primary endpoint.

The study population will include all patients undergoing elective CABG.

 Consent and randomization will occur before surgery.

 Total 500 patients undergoing elective CABG will be randomly assigned into three groups with 1:1:1 ratio(167 patients per group) in this open-label study.

 All the enrolled patients will stop oral antiplatelet drugs according to local protocol before the surgery.

 Within the first 24 hours after surgery, study medication should be restarted and continued for 12 months.

 Arm A will restart oral antiplatelet drugs by giving aspirin 100mg qd, Arm B will also restart oral antiplatelet drugs by giving ticagrelor 90mg bid plus aspirin 100mg qd and Arm C will also restart oral antiplatelet drugs by giving ticagrelor 90mg bid.

 Treatment will continue for 12 months, at which time patients will undergo a multislice computed tomography angiography to assess vein graft patency.

 This study is designed to show the superiority of ticagrelor and ticagrelor plus aspirin as compared with aspirin monotherapy respectively for the 1-year primary efficacy end point of vein graft patency.
