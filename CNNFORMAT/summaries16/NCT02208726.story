(fifthQuint)The Effect of Picricum Acidum and Phosphoricum Acidum Homaccord on Perceived Levels of Anxiety in University Students.

 This study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, conducted over a two-week period at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) Health Clinic, Doornfontein Campus.

 Thirty university students, aged between 18 and 45 years, will be recruited into the study by means of advertisements placed on the campus with relevant permission given.

 Participants will attend an initial consultation and will be requested to sign a Participant Information and Consent form, complete the Participant Information Sheet, and a Remedy Symptom Questionnaire to determine inclusion into the study.

 Participants' vital signs will be measured.

 Participants will then receive a 16ml vial of either the Picricum acidum and Phosphoricum acidum Homaccord pillules, or a placebo (unmedicated sucrose pillules), which will be randomized and dispensed by the UJ Homeopathic Dispenser.

 Participants will be requested to take 5 pillules in a daily dose for 14 days, commencing 21 days before and ceasing 7 days prior to the start of examinations.

 The State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory (STAI) and the Anxiety Symptom Score Card will be completed 21 days prior to the first academic examination, as well as on the last day of taking the medication.

 Data will be collected and analyzed by Statkon, using the Shapiro-Wilk test, the Mann-Whitney test and the Wilcoxon signed ranks test.

 The outcome of this research may show that the Homeopathic Picricum acidum and Phosphoricum acidum Homaccord has a positive effect in alleviating anxiety in university students, allowing for further studies in the field.

 The Effect of Picricum Acidum and Phosphoricum Acidum Homaccord on Perceived Levels of Anxiety in University Students@highlight

Increased levels of stress and anxiety are experienced by many students.

 Stress can have a negative influence on academic outcome and performance, as well as on the student's mental health.

 Conventional treatment options for anxiety include counseling, as well as anxiolytics and antidepressants, which may have various adverse effects.

 Picricum acidum and Phosphoricum acidum are homeopathic remedies that may be helpful in alleviating anxiety in students; however there has been no research done to date to show their efficacy for this condition.

 The aim of this study is to determine the effect of Picricum acidum and Phosphoricum acidum Homaccord on perceived levels of anxiety in university students, by means of the State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory and Anxiety Symptom Score Card.
