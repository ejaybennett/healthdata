(fifthQuint)Nutrition and Lifestyle Study Cohort of Gastric Cancer in China.

 Background - Gastric cancer incidence is increasing at an alarming rate in China.

 Recent studies reported that nutrition status and lifestyle factors such as dietary pattern, obesity, physical activity, depression, diabetes, aspirin use and vitamin supplement were associated cancer risk.

 Yet, the influence of nutrition and lifestyle factors on gastric cancer outcome (i.

e.

 recurrence and survival) in gastric cancer survivors is largely unknown.

 And there is currently no large cohort studies investigated the impact of these factors on gastric cancer outcomes in China.

 Objectives - Our study aims to evaluate the impact of nutrition status and lifestyle factors such as dietary pattern, tea consumption, obesity, physical activity, depression, diabetes, aspirin use and vitamin supplement on gastric cancer outcome (disease-specific survival, disease-free survival and overall survival).

 Settings and methods - The study will recruit approximately 50,000 participants with gastric cancer from 12 public hospitals in China after informed consent.

 Appropriate questionnaires will be utilized to evaluate nutrition status and lifestyle factors such as dietary pattern, tea consumption, obesity, physical activity, depression, diabetes, aspirin use and vitamin supplement.

 The association of disease-specific survival, disease-free survival and overall survival with these factors will be evaluated.

 Impact - To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large cohort, systematically investigation of the impact of nutrition status and lifestyle factors on gastric cancer outcome.

 When complete, our investigation would supply a systematical and precise understanding of the impact nutrition status and lifestyle factors on cancer out come in China.

 Nutrition and Lifestyle Study Cohort of Gastric Cancer in China@highlight

China has the largest gastric cancer patients population all over the world.

 Recent reports concluded nutrition status and lifestyle factors were associated with gastric cancer risk, however, the influence of nutrition and lifestyle factors on cancer outcome in gastric cancer survivors is largely unknown.

The investigators will explore the impact of nutrition status, life style, dietary pattern, obesity, physical activity, depression, diabetes, aspirin use and vitamin supplement on gastric cancer outcome.

 The investigators will recruit approximately 50,000 patients as a prospective study cohort.

 During follow up, the investigators will explore the association of these factors with disease-specific survival, disease-free survival and overall survival of patients.

 The investigators believe that this project will facilitate the establishment of domestic nutrition and lifestyle data of gastric cancer of China, and the improvement of the quality of clinical management of patients with gastric cancer.
