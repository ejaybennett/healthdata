(firstQuint)Comparison of Laryngeal Mask and I-gel to Laryngoscope by Novice Operators in Simulated Difficult Airway.

 This study compares the insertion success rate and insertion time among the proceal laryngeal mask airway, i-gel, and tracheal tube.

 Following a short lecture, airway novices try to insert proceal laryngeal mask airway, i-gel, and tracheal tube into manikin with difficult laryngoscopy scenarios.

The use of laryngeal mask airway or i-gel to manage airway may improve success rates, especially in difficult situations more than tracheal intubation.
