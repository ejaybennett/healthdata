(thirdQuint)Study Of Weight Development Over Time.

 The investigators will ask all subjects that have previously been examined at the investigators laboratory (from 1992 and forward) in studies of adipose tissue function if they are interested to participate in a new study.

 The minimal follow up time is 7 years.

 Saved blood samples and samples from old fat biopsies will be analyzed together with samples from new examinations.

 The investigators plan to examine the subjects in the same way as performed at the baseline examinations.

 This includes estimation of total body fat using bioimpedance, venous blood samples for determination of insulin, glucose and lipids, subcutaneous fat biopsies with determination of fat cell size/number, lipolysis/lipogenesis as well as analysis of adipokine secretion.

 In selected patients, baseline examinations included DEXA-measurement (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) for determination of body fat distribution as well as hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.

 In these cases, the same type of examinations will be repeated at their follow up visits.

 Study Of Weight Development Over Time@highlight

The investigators will study the influence of fat cell size/number and adipose function on weight development over very long time periods (years).

 By comparing fat biopsies obtained at baseline and after >7 years, the investigators will determine the association between adipose morphology/function and changes in weight or development of cardiometabolic complications (e.

g.

 insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension).
