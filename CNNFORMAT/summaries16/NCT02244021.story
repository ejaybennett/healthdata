(firstQuint)BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN as Pre-ASCT Induction Therapy in R/R HL Patients Non Responding to IGEV.

 Brentuximab vedotin emerged as active single-agent in the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL.

 Some patients don't reach a complete response after salvage treatment with IGEV (ifosfamide, gemcitabine, vinorelbine) and remain PET positive so the idea is to treat this subset of patients with brentuximab vedotin with the aim of achieving a complete remission before transplant.
