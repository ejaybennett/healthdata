(thirdQuint)Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy for Ovarian Cancer.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of our protocol under the hypothesis that it may improve patient survival with low rates of morbidity and mortality.

 In these settings, CRS will be followed by an short-course regimen of intra-operative HIPEC for patients with stage III-IV EOC.

 Advanced CRS will be performed with standard peritonectomy procedures and visceral resections directed towards complete elimination of tumors from the abdominopelvic cavity.

 HIPEC will be performed according to the closed-abdomen technique using CDDP (25 mg/L of perfusate/m2, total limit of 240mg) or CDDP plus Doxorubicin (15mg/L) for 30 minutes, with an intra-abdominal target temperature of 41-43C.

 Perfusate (2L/m2, ranging from 4L to 6L) will be circulated using an extracorporeal circulation device (Performer HT; RAND, Medolla, Italy) at a flow rate of 700 ml/min.

 Systemic chemotherapy will include the standard combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel as neo-adjuvant plus adjuvant regimens.

 A fast-track recovery strategy has also been applied to improve patient outcomes.

This is a phase II open label, single arm clinical trial on safety and efficacy exploring an short-course regimen of intra-operative Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) for patients with advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) undergoing fast-track Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT).
