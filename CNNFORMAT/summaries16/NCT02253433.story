(fifthQuint)The Houston HIIT-BAC for African Americans.

 The study hypothesis is that the addition of a holistic, home-based environmental exposure reduction and asthma control intervention to enhanced in-clinic care will result in statistically significant improvements in key measures of health and quality of life among Houston-area African-American adults with poorly controlled asthma.

 This is a pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial that compares the effectiveness of a customized, holistic, patient-centered, home-based environmental intervention for improving asthma control (the "intervention") with enhanced clinic-based care (enhanced "usual care").

 Both arms receive identical in-clinic care, including information from a detailed exposure history, asthma education, assessment for allergies, and a customized asthma self-management plan developed using motivational interviewing.

 The intent of the study is to assess-real-life effectiveness of the interventional arm in patients with complex asthma.

 The Houston HIIT-BAC for African Americans@highlight

The purpose of this study is to improve the health of African-American adults who have poorly controlled asthma.

 The study will compare a home-based exposure reduction and asthma control intervention to enhanced in-clinic care that includes a standard clinical appointment as well as information from a detailed exposure history, asthma education, assessment for allergies, and a customized asthma self-management plan developed using motivational interviewing.

 The interventional group receives enhanced in-clinic care, as well as a customized home-based environmental exposure assessment and multicomponent exposure reduction and asthma control intervention (five home visits over approximately 12 months).
