(fifthQuint)Study of ES414 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.

 Stage 1 - Dose Escalation: The dose escalation stage of the study will test weekly doses of 0.

2 mcg/kg to 300 mcg/kg over 9 dose levels (cohorts).

 Cohorts 1 to 3 consist of single patients and Cohorts 4 - 9 will consist of a minimum of 3 patients; an additional 3 patients may be added to the cohort if adverse events possibly related to ES414 or dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) occur.

 The next dose cohort will only enroll after the patient(s) in the current dose cohort have completed the first cycle of dosing (4 weeks) with no significant adverse events or DLTs.

 Six patients will be enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and this dose will be used for Stage 2.

 Stage 2 - Expansion: The continuous intravenous infusion MTD dose regimen will be further examined in 2 expansion cohorts; the first cohort are patients that have received prior chemotherapy, such as docetaxel for mCRPC, and the second cohort are those that have not received prior chemotherapy for mCRPC.

 Serum samples will be collected for serial PK assessment for ES414 drug levels and antibody formation.

 Response will be assessed every 2 months during the first 6 months of treatment and then every 3 months until progression of mCRPC, intolerable side effects, or withdrawal of consent.

 Study of ES414 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer@highlight

The study will be conducted in 2 Stages.

 The primary objective of Stage 1 of the study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ES414 administered intravenously to patients with mCRPC.

 Secondary objectives are to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), immunogenicity, cytokine response, and clinical activity of ES414.

 The primary objective of Stage 2 of the study is to evaluate the clinical activity of ES414 in patients that have or have not received prior chemotherapy.

 Secondary objectives are to further characterize the safety profile, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of ES414.
