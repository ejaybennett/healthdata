(firstQuint)Nitrate Supplementation; Source.

 Oral ingestion of nitrate (NO3-) has been shown to increase plasma nitrate and nitrite levels.

 Significant lowering of pulmonary oxygen uptake during exercise, as well as significantly lower blood pressure values at rest have been observed after supplementation with nitrate.

 However, no study has yet described a direct comparison between different nitrate-rich beverages with respect to the bioavailability of nitrate/nitrite and the possible hemodynamic effects.

 Based on the gaps in current literature, our main goal will therefore be to gain further insight into the effects of nitrate supplementation with different sources on plasma nitrite levels.

The main aim of the current study will be to compare the effects of ingesting different nitrate-rich sources on plasma nitrite concentrations.
