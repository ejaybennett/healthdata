(secondQuint)Effects of a Bakery Product Enriched With Fibre and L-carnitine on Insulin Resistance in Patients With Metabolic Syndrome.

 Conceivably, different biochemical changes in insulin-mediated signalling pathways may contribute to an impaired insulin-mediated glucose transport and metabolism that eventually results in insulin resistance and the clinical features of metabolic syndrome.

 According to this, both compounds -L-carnitine and dietary fiber- interacting by different mechanism of action could improve glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.

 However, the health beneficial effects of the combination of both compounds are not shown and confirmation of the functionality of such products must be accomplished by conducting the appropriate studies intervention nutrition.

 Effects of a Bakery Product Enriched With Fibre and L-carnitine on Insulin Resistance in Patients With Metabolic Syndrome@highlight

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a bakery product enriched with dietary fibre and L-carnitine on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in overweight patients with or without metabolic syndrome.
