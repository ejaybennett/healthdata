(firstQuint)Select Embryos by Time-lapse System for Single Embryo Transfer.

 The embryos of patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment is cultured to blastocyst stage and observed by TLI.

 The association of embryo cleavage patterns/timing parameters and good-quality blastocyst rates are evaluated by logistic regression and to establish a hierarchical embryo selection.

 The value of the selection process is assess by single embryo transfer (SET) on Day 3.

 Select Embryos by Time-lapse System for Single Embryo Transfer@highlight

The objective of this study is to establish a hierarchical embryo selection process by using the time-lapse imaging (TLI), combining the embryo cleavage patterns and timing parameters.
