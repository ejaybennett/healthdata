(fifthQuint)NY-ESO-1-Specific T-cells in Treating Patients With Advanced NY-ESO-1-Expressing Sarcomas Receiving Palliative Radiation Therapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the safety and toxicity of NY-ESO-1-specific T cells when given following high-dose, hypo-fractionated palliative radiation to patients with advanced NY-ESO-1 expressing sarcomas.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To look for preliminary evidence of systemic efficacy of NY-ESO-1-specific T-cell therapy following radiation on non-radiated tumors.

 II.

 To determine whether radiation increases trafficking of adoptively transferred NY-ESO-1-specific T cells by comparing tumor biopsy specimens from radiated and non-radiated tumors.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo palliative radiation therapy at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.

 Patients then receive NY-ESO-1-specific T cells intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes 2-3 days after completion of radiation therapy.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 2 weeks, at 4-6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks, and then for up to 6 months.

 NY-ESO-1-Specific T-cells in Treating Patients With Advanced NY-ESO-1-Expressing Sarcomas Receiving Palliative Radiation Therapy@highlight

This pilot, phase I trial studies the safety of cancer-testis antigen (NY-ESO-1)-specific T cells (a type of immune cell) in treating patients with NY-ESO-1-expressing sarcomas that have spread to other places in the body and are receiving palliative (relief of symptoms and suffering caused by cancer) radiation therapy.

 Placing a modified gene for NY-ESO-1 into white blood cells may help the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells that express NY-ESO-1.

 Palliative radiation therapy may help patients with advanced sarcoma live more comfortably.

 Giving NY-ESO-1-specific T cells following palliative radiation therapy may be a better treatment for patients with sarcomas.
