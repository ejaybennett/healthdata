(thirdQuint)TIGER-3: Open Label, Multicenter Study of Rociletinib (CO-1686) Mono Therapy Versus Single-agent Cytotoxic Chemotherapy in Patients With Mutant EGFR NSCLC Who Have Failed at Least One Previous EGFR-Directed TKI and Platinum-doublet Chemotherapy.

 This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral rociletinib at 500 mg BID and 625 mg BID compared with that of single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy, in patients with previously treated mutant EGFR NSCLC.

 Eligible patients are those with mutant EGFR NSCLC previously treated with at least 1 EGFR inhibitor and at least 1 line of platinum-containing chemotherapy doublet for advanced/metastatic NSCLC.

 After providing informed consent to participate and screening to confirm eligibility, patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either oral rociletinib 500 mg BID, oral rociletinib 625 mg BID, or single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy (investigator choice of pemetrexed, gemcitabine, docetaxel, or paclitaxel; choice of chemotherapy agent must be specified before randomization).

The purpose of this study is to compare the anti-tumor efficacy of oral single-agent rociletinib, as measured by investigator assessment of the PFS, with that of single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutated, advanced/metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least 1 previous EGFR-directed TKI and at least 1 line of platinum-containing doublet chemotherapy.
