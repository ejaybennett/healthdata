(thirdQuint)A Phase 1B Study of MLN2480 in Combination With MLN0128 or Alisertib, or Paclitaxel, or Cetuximab, or Irinotecan in Adult Participants With Advanced Nonhematologic Malignancies.

 The drug being tested in this study is called MLN2480.

 MLN2480 is being tested to evaluate side effects and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for future studies when administered in combination with three other medications.

 This study will assess the safety of MLN2480 as well as how it is processed by the body in participants with solid nonhematologic malignancies who have failed standard therapies.

 The study will be conducted in two phases, the dose escalation phase and the dose expansion phase.

 Approximately 49 participants will be enrolled in the escalation phase.

 Participants in this phase will be assigned to one of the five treatment groups: - MLN2480 + MLN0128 - MLN2480 + Alisertib - MLN2480 + Paclitaxel - MLN2480 + Cetuximab - MLN2480 + Irinotecan Once the MTD for each combination treatment arm has been established in the escalation phase, one or more of the combination treatments will be selected for the expansion phase.

 Approximately 76 participants will be enrolled in the expansion phase.

 This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide.

 The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 14 months.

 Participants will make approximately 43 visits to the clinic including an end of study visit 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile and the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs)/ potential recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) of the combination treatments of MLN2480 + MLN0128, MLN2480 + alisertib, MLN2480 + paclitaxel, MLN2480 + cetuximab, and MLN2480 + irinotecan in participants with advanced nonhematologic malignancies.
