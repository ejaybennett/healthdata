(thirdQuint)Electrophysiological Optimization of Left Ventricular Lead Placement in CRT.

 Background: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established therapy in patients with a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) 80 % with a margen of noninferiority of 20 % for the secondary endpoint of clinical non-response to CRT (assuming a 75 % clinical response rate in the control group) we will need a sample size of 116 patients (given a two-sided alpha value of 0.

05 %).

 Taking into consideration an expected loss of follow-up in approximately 5 % of the patients, we will include 122 patients.

 All analyses will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle.

 Differences between groups will be tested using Students t-test, when normality is demonstrated; otherwise a non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney) is used.

 Categorical variables will be analyzed by 2 test.

 A two-sided P- value of <0.

05 is considered significant.

 Research Plan: The Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital, have the capacity and equipment to conduct this trial.

 The group of investigators contributes with a deep and long-lasting experience in CRT-treatment and 150 de-novo CRT-devices are annually implanted at our institution.

 We plan to enroll the patients during a two and a half-year period.

 This study is planned to start in February 2015 as a PhD program for Charlotte Stephansen, MD.

 Charlotte Stephansen will be the prime investigator in charge of including the patients and she will perform all clinical evaluations and image acquisitions during the admission for CRT implantation and at the six month follow-up.

 She will also be in charge of analyzing data after study completion.

 The results will be published in peer-reviewed international journals, and are expected to result in at least three papers.

 None of the investigators have any conflicts of interest to declare.

 The study will be conducted according to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration II.

 The study will be approved by The Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics, reported to the Danish Data Protection Agency, and registered on ClinicalTrials.

 Perspective: No prospective randomized trials have previously investigated the effect of a CRT treatment-strategy targeting optimal electrical resynchronization achieved by guiding LV lead placement to the myocardial region with the latest electrical activation combined with post-implant VV electrical optimization for narrowing the paced QRS width.

 It is expected that this method improves the response to CRT.

 The human and economic costs of CRT in non-responders are therefore expected to be reduced.

 If an excess increase in LVEF is achieved in this study, it will be possible to prevent and relieve invalidating symptoms and reduce mortality in selected heart failue patients in the future.

 The utility and potential benefits of participating in this study are expected to equalize the risks of exposure to ionizing radiation, possible side effects and inconvenience to the patient.

 Electrophysiological Optimization of Left Ventricular Lead Placement in CRT@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate if "optimal electrical resynchronization" achieved by targeting left ventricular lead placement to the myocardial region with the latest electrical activation combined with post-implant pacemakersettings for narrowing the paced QRS width causes an excess improvement in the pumping function of the heart (the left ventricular ejection fraction) in Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)
