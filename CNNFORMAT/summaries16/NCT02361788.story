(fifthQuint)Study on Newborn Babies With a Yellow Skin Color (Neonatal Jaundice Study).

 PROCEDURES DURING PREGNANCY During the first antenatal care visit the mother will have a gestational dating ultrasound to determine the accurate gestational age.

 During all antenatal care visits information about the mother will be collected as part of standard obstetric care: - Ethnicity - Age - Medical history - Blood transfusion in history - Chronic diseases - Obstetric history - Parity and gravida - Previous neonatal deaths and reason of death - Previous preterm delivery - Previous child with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia - Pregnancy - Gestational dating ultrasound - Obstetric problems - Malaria and morbidity episodes during pregnancy - BMI, MUAC and weightgain - Laboratory results - Hepatitis B status* - HIV status* - Syphilis serology* - G6PD status - Hemoglobinopathy - ABO blood group - Rhesus D blood group Testing for STD and HIV is routine practice at the SMRU clinics.

 Before the screening permission from the mother is requested.

 Life-long antiretroviral triple therapy is available in case of a positive HIV test.

 To assess the knowledge and beliefs on neonatal jaundice among the mothers we will perform a short questionnaire.

 This questionnaire will help the study team to assess the level of knowledge and the misbeliefs on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

 The study team will also ask the subjects about the use of naphthalene containing moth balls and explain them the danger in case the subject's baby will be G6PD deficient.

 PROCEDURES AT BIRTH Eligibility: At birth the neonate will be excluded if the gestational age is 10% weightloss, the neonate will be reviewed carefully for any underlying cause of this weightloss and supplementary feeding (expressed breastmilk or powdermilk) will be started.

 PROCEDURES WHEN DELIVERY OUTSIDE SMRU In case of delivery in another clinic or at home, but the mother and neonate visit a SMRU clinic within the first 48 hours after delivery, the neonate can still be included in the study.

 If a neonate is born outside SMRU and does not visit the clinic within 48 hours after delivery, but presents with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the first 8 days of life, this neonate can be included in the study as well.

 Because no umbilical cord blood was taken, a limited set of laboratory investigations will be performed, as described as below;.

 ABO and Rhesus D bloodgroup 0.

075 ml.

, G6PD fluorescent test 0.

005 ml.

, G6PD spectrophotometric assay 0.

05 ml.

, G6PD flow cytometric assay 0.

05 ml.

, Serum bilirubin 0.

05 ml.

, Haematocrit 0.

05 ml.

, Genotyping 2 ml.

, Total volume 2.

23 ml.

 PROCEDURES DURING INFANT FOLLOW-UP Infant follow-up will take place every month until the age of 12 months.

 Questionnaire: At every visit the mother will be asked about feeding practices and after the age of 6 months about neurodevelopmental milestones.

 Laboratory investigations: Due to the problems of anaemia in this population (50% of the infants are reported to have a haematocrit of < 33% at the age of 6 months; personal communication Dr.

 Rose McGready) haematocrit will be measured monthly, by finger prick, and anaemia will be treated if necessary.

 At the age of one year a stool test for parasitology screening will be taken and the infant will be treated if necessary.

 Finally at one year of age the infant will be screened for hemoglobinopathy due to contradictory reports of the association between neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and hemoglobinopathy as below: Haematocrit 0.

05 ml.

 x11, Hemoglobin typing 3 ml.

 Total volume 3.

55 ml.

 Clinical assessment: A physical examination (including vital signs) will be performed at every visit and the weight will be measured.

 At the age of 2 and 3 month a body composition will be measured using PeaPod.

 At 3, 6, 9 and 12 months the length and head circumference will be measured.

 At the age of 3, 6 months and 12 months the infant will be assessed with the Shoklo Developmental Test 53 and the results compared to age specific norms developed for this population.

 Study on Newborn Babies With a Yellow Skin Color (Neonatal Jaundice Study)@highlight

Background: Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is the most common reason for admission in the neonatal period (first month of life) worldwide and at SMRU.

 The skin of the newborn baby becomes jaundiced, which is caused by a high level of bilirubin in the blood.

 In some neonates the level of bilirubin increases to a level that can cause braindamage or even death.

 There are different causes known that can lead to higher levels of bilirubin, for example G6PD deficiency and prematurity.

 In case of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia the neonate needs to be treated with phototherapy (blue light therapy).

 If there is prolonged jaundice ( 21 days), further investigations needs to be done.

 Objectives: Primary objective: To determine the etiology of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in neonates with a gestational age of 28 weeks from the refugee and migrant population, on the Thai-Myanmar border.

 Secondary objective: - Establishing the incidence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia - Determine the risk factors for the development of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia - Determine the incidence of prolonged neonatal jaundice - Determine the neurodevelopmental outcome, at the age of 6 and 12 months - Determine the body composition, using air-displacement plethysmography, at birth, 1, 2 and 3 months of age - Determine the incidence of anaemia and illness episodes during the first year of life - Determine the incidence of helminthic infection at the age of one year - Assess the knowledge level and misbeliefs on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia among the mothers and SMRU health care staff Research design: The study will conduct an exhaustive prospective descriptive study, all eligible newborns will be enrolled after obtaining the informed consent from their mothers.

 During pregnancy and delivery we will collect clinical data about the mother.

 At birth we will take umbilical cord blood (9 ml) to test for different causes of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

 In the first week of life we plan 4 moments to measure the bilirubin and hematocrit level (0.

05 ml), weight and ask questions about feeding and other practices.

 Based on the bilirubin results we will determine whether the neonate needs phototherapy.

 After the first week we weekly follow-up will be conducted and in case of visible jaundice we will measure the bilirubin level.

 If the neonate is still jaundiced after the age of 21 days we will further investigate the cause.

 In the infant period, until the age of one year, we plan to have monthly follow-up to assess the health and growth of the child and at the age of 3, 6 and 12 months we will do a neurodevelopmental test.

 An improved understanding of the pathological processes contributing to the development of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is needed in order to to identify neonates at risk and develop improved management.
