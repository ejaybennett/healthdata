(firstQuint)Enhancing Cognitive Abilities With Comprehensive Training.

 The present study aims to evaluate a targeted, progressively challenging, online cognitive training program comprised of 49 distinct exercises targeting a variety of cognitive capacities.

 The cognitive training program will be compared to a plausibly beneficial active control condition in which participants completed online crossword puzzles.

 The investigators hypothesize that the cognitive training will show greater transfer to a range of underlying cognitive abilities than the active control, as measured by a broad battery of neuropsychological assessments and participant-reported outcomes.
