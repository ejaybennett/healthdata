(fifthQuint)Atrial Tachycardia as a Predictor of Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke and Mortality in Cryptogenic Stroke.

 The investigators review all consecutive patients that were hospitalized from stroke in our hospital (Neurology department) between January 2010 and September 2013, and who had the diagnosis of cryptogenic stroke at discharge.

 All patients routinely underwent 24-hour ECG recording and an echocardiography during the hospitalization.

 The investigators have a global population of 210 patients who met these characteristics.

 The investigators analyze the presence of atrial tachycardia in 24-hour ECG register in patients with cryptogenic stroke.

 The investigators consider atrial tachycardia as four or more consecutive atrial ectopic beats.

 The investigators analyze baseline characteristics (cardiovascular risk factors, renal function, left atrial size _measured in M mode echocardiography in long paraesternal axis_ and total number of premature atrial complexes in the 24-hour ECG monitoring.

 The patients are stratified according to the presence or absence of atrial tachycardia in 24-hour ECG data.

 The investigators follow the clinical events (AF, recurrent stroke or death) of patients from the electronical medical data of general physician and the re-hospitalizations for recurrent ictus in our hospital (which is the reference hospital of the zone) and mortality during 12 months.

 Atrial Tachycardia as a Predictor of Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke and Mortality in Cryptogenic Stroke@highlight

There is few information about the association between supraventricular arrhythmia different from atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial Flutter and the risk of stroke.

 In this study the investigators hypothesized that the presence of atrial tachycardia would lead to atrial fibrillation and recurrent stroke in patients hospitalized for cryptogenic stroke.

 The investigators study the association of atrial tachycardia (AT), defined as four or more consecutive premature atrial beats, and AF, recurrent stroke and cardiovascular mortality in 192 consecutive patients hospitalized because of cryptogenic stroke.

 The follow-up was 12 months for all population
