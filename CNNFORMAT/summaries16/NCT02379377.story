(thirdQuint)18F-FSPG PET in Imaging Patients With Liver Cancer Before Undergoing Surgery or Transplant.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the relationship between 18F-FSPG PET/computed tomography (CT) and pathology in patients with suspected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) scheduled for liver resection surgery and orthotopic liver transplant (OLT).

 II.

 To compare 18F-FSPG PET/CT with standard-of-care (SOC) diagnostic CT imaging in patients with suspected HCC scheduled for liver resection surgery or OLT.

 III.

 To compare the uptake of 18F-FSPG PET/CT with 11C-acetate PET/CT in suspected HCC and background liver in patients scheduled for liver resection surgery or OLT.

 IV.

 To evaluate uptake of 18F-FSPG PET/CT in non-HCC liver tumors: benign and malignant compared to background.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo 18F-FSPG PET and carbon-11 (11C)-acetate PET scans within 4-8 weeks of surgery or OLT.

 18F-FSPG PET in Imaging Patients With Liver Cancer Before Undergoing Surgery or Transplant@highlight

This clinical trial studies fluorine F 18 L-glutamate derivative BAY94-9392 (18F-FSPG) positron emission tomography (PET) in imaging patients with liver cancer before undergoing surgery or transplant.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as 18F-FSPG PET, may help find and diagnose liver cancer and find out how far the disease has spread.
