(firstQuint)Spinal Anesthesia Versus Combined Sciatic-femoral Nerve Block for Outpatient Knee Arthroscopy.

 Two groups: the first receive a spinal anesthesia injecting 2% hyperbaric prilocaine 40 mg with the patients in lateral decubitus and the surgical limb declive, the second a combined ultrasound-guided sciatic-femoral nerve block injecting 25 ml of 2% mepivacaine solution.

 Onset time, performance time, duration of the block, time of voiding, as well as the time of home discharge will be evaluated.
