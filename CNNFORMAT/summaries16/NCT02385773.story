(fifthQuint)Impact of the Nutritional Product PTM202 on Acute and Long-Term Recovery From Childhood Diarrheal Disease.

 This is a double-blind, randomized control trial of the nutritional product PTM202, which is a food product based on cow milk colostrum and eggs from hens that have been immunized against human diarrheal pathogens.

 Children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years will be enrolled at two sites in Guatemala who present with acute diarrhea.

 The study will have two strata according to the severity of the diarrhea.

 The study product will be administered over 3 days, and the investigators will assess the impact on diarrhea duration and severity, and then follow subjects for 4 weeks to assess the impact of the nutritional product on weight gain following the episode, because poor weight gain is a major health problem in low-income countries.

 The investigators will also monitor for any adverse events during the trial.

 The duration of participation will be 31 days for all subjects.

 A stool sample will be collected at enrollment to ascertain the etiology of the diarrhea.

 A second sample will be collected at the end of the study to assess changes in pathogens.
