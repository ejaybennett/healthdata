(secondQuint)Phase I Study of Image-Guided Radiation Concurrent With Double-Agent Chemotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 In this phase I study, patients with advanced or inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma, or those failed other strategies will be recruited.

 The primary tumor and nearby metastatic nodes will be irradiated with Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) mostly with conventional fractions.

 During the course, oral capecitabine and intravenous oxaliplatin will be given concurrently.

 The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the two drugs will be determined during escalation according to the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLT).

 Phase I Study of Image-Guided Radiation Concurrent With Double-Agent Chemotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma@highlight

This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety of concurrent chemoradiation combining radiotherapy (IGRT) with two cytotoxic agents, capecitabine and oxaliplatin in patients with advanced or inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma.
