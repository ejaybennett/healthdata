(secondQuint)Comparison of Surgical,Clinical and Oncological Outcomes Between Robotic-assisted and Laparoscopic-assisted Gastrectomy.

 This is a prospective study lasting 36 months.

 Minimally invasive gastrectomy is accepted widely in Asian countries.

 Laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy offers improved early postoperative outcomes and improved long-term oncologic outcomes,but it still has its own limitations.

The advantages of robotic surgery include a 3D imagine, convenient movements of the robotic arm, no tremor, and ambidextrous capability.

 This study therefore aimed to compare the clinical results between robotic-assisted gastrectomy(RAG) using the da Vinci Surgical System and conventional laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy(LAG) in gastric cancer patients.

To evaluate the the feasibility and safety of robotic gastrectomy and explore the patients who are more suitable for robotic gastrectomy.

 Comparison of Surgical,Clinical and Oncological Outcomes Between Robotic-assisted and Laparoscopic-assisted Gastrectomy@highlight

The study aims to compare the clinical outcomes between robotic-assisted and laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy for gastric cancer,and evaluate the the feasibility and safety of robotic gastrectomy.

 Furthermore, the investigators can explore the patients who are more suitable for robotic gastrectomy.
