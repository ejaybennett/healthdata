(secondQuint)Trial on Delay Phenomenon Utility in Preventing Anastomotic Leakage After an Esophagectomy.

 Subtotal esophagectomy with tubular gastroplasty to upper mediastinum and esophagogastric anastomosis (Ivor-Lewis procedure) is a very complex surgical technique.

 It is performed in patients with infracarinal esophageal carcinoma and is associated with a high morbidity rate in specialized centers (up to 60% in some groups).

 One of the most important postoperative complications is the oesophagogastric anastomotic leakage which leads a high morbidity (mediastinitis, respiratory failure, pleural effusion) and mortality rate (up to 60% depending on the reports).

 The most important cause of anastomotic leakage is the stomach's extreme sensitivity to ischemic injury.

 There are several experimental studies that have demonstrated that the delay phenomenon before the esophageal resection surgery aims to improve issue perfusion after a period of time.

 Few studies, only cases reports, describe a decrease of the incidence of intrathoracic and cervical anastomotic leakage.

 May the delay phenomenon reduce the incidence of anastomotic intrathoracic leakage?.

 There aren't prospective randomized controlled trials to answer this question.

 For this reason the investigators propose to perform a prospective randomized controlled trial in patients underwent on a subtotal esophagectomy (Ivor-Lewis procedure), comparing two groups: one of them will be subjected a delay phenomenon by arteriographic procedure before esophageal resection surgery, and the other one will be operated directly, to demonstrate if the delay phenomenon can reduce the incidence of anastomotic esophagogastric leakage.

 Trial on Delay Phenomenon Utility in Preventing Anastomotic Leakage After an Esophagectomy@highlight

This is a randomized clinical trial to clarify if the delay phenomenon could reduce the incidence of oesophagogastric dehiscence after an esophagectomy for esophageal cancer comparing an experimental group vs control group.

 The delay phenomenon will be performed by an arteriographic approach.
