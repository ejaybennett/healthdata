(thirdQuint)Study of Intraparenchymal Therapy as Adjunct Therapy in Patients With Recurrent, Resectable Glioblastoma Multiforme.

.

 A challenge in the treatment of glioma is the delivery of treatment to the brain after systemic administration due to the blood brain barrier.

 To improve drug delivery to the brain to achieve very high local concentrations of the anti-neoplastic agent with low system toxicity, a local regional approach is proposed.

 CM-BC2, an irinotecan hydrochloride drug-eluting bead, is an investigational medicinal product intended for direction injection into the tumor resection margin.

 The objective of this trial is demonstration of safety and feasibility of this intraparenchymal injection of irinotecan hydrochloride drug-eluting beads in the treatment of recurrent Glioblastoma multiforme.

 Study of Intraparenchymal Therapy as Adjunct Therapy in Patients With Recurrent, Resectable Glioblastoma Multiforme.

@highlight

The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety and feasibility of injecting irinotecan hydrochloride drug-eluting beads directly into the cavity remaining after a tumor is surgically removed in patients with a type of brain tumor (glioblastoma multiforme - also known as glioma) that has returned after prior therapy.
