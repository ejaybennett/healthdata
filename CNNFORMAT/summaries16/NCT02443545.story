(secondQuint)Long-term Safety and Efficacy of Ferriprox in Iron Overloaded Patients With Sickle Cell Disease or Other Anemias.

 Deferiprone (brand name Ferriprox(R)) is an iron chelator that is approved in the United States and over 60 other countries for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassemia, when other treatments are inadequate.

 This study has been designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of deferiprone to treat iron overload in patients who have sickle cell disease or other anemias.

 Only patients who have completed an earlier study, LA38-0411, are eligible to enroll in this one.
