(firstQuint)A Study of Whether 3 New Oral Formulations of a Strong Pain Killer Release the Same Amount of Drug Into the Body as the Marketed Medication.

 Comparisons will be made between three new oral formulations and an existing marketed reference capsule formulation to determine whether the release rates of the products are similar or equivalent in a fed or fasted state.

 Determination is by measurement of drug concentrations in the blood at serial collection time points pre-dose until 72 hours post-dose, following an administration of a single oral dose.

 Pharmacokinetics parameters of AUC and Cmax are the primary endpoints.
