(firstQuint)Mesh Fixation and Closure of Peritoneum Following Laparoscopic Hernia Repair Using N-butyl Cyanoacrylate.

 During transabdominal pre peritoneal (TAPP) hernia repair a mesh should be fixed at four pre-determined points.

 Number of attempts to fix the mesh with a novel non-penetrating fixation device (LiquiBandFix8) will be recorded.

 This novel device uses n-butyl cyanoacrylate and a defined amount of glue can be delivered with this 5mm laparoscopic instrument (liquid anchors).

 In addition, closure of peritoneum should be accomplished using this device.
