(firstQuint)Noninvasive Brain Stimulation to Evaluate Neural Plasticity After Stroke.

 Subcortical strokes affect small vessels deep in the brain, and typically present with motor hemiparesis.

 The investigator will assess the effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) on motor function and examine how different areas in the human brain interact with each other using brain imaging and brain stimulation.

 The investigator will also evaluate the capacity for noninvasive stimulation to transiently modify brain activity supporting arm movement.
