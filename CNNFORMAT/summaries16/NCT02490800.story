(secondQuint)Phase 1/2a Study of Oral BAL101553 in Adult Patients With Solid Tumors or Glioblastoma or High-grade Glioma.

 This is the first study of the oral formulation of BAL101553.

 BAL101553 will be administered once daily during each day of a 28-day treatment cycle in capsule form to adults with advanced or recurrent solid tumors or recurrent or progressive glioblastoma or high-grade glioma who have failed standard therapy, or for whom no effective standard therapy is available.

 The primary goal of the study is to find the highest dose of BAL101553 that can safely be given to humans and to assess what side effects occur.

 The study will start by treating patients with a low dose.

 Once it has been shown that this low dose is well tolerated, new patients will be treated at higher dose levels ("dose escalation").

 Once the highest, well tolerated dose is identified, additional patients will be treated at that dose (this part is called "dose expansion") to further assess the tolerability and potential anticancer activity of oral BAL101553.

 The study will also measure pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic effects and assess biomarkers.
