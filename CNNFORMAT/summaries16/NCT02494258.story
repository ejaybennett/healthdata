(firstQuint)A Study to Evaluate Long-term Safety in Subjects With Solid Tumors and Hematological Disorders.

.

 The open-label, multicenter, multinational rollover study is intended to evaluate the safety of CC-486, while providing continued treatment with CC-486 for subjects who are receiving single agent CC-486 at the time of transition to the rollover study and tolerated the protocol prescribed regimen in Celgene-sponsored trials, and whom in the opinion of the Investigator may derive clinical benefit from continuing treatment with CC-486.

 Subjects' survival will also be followed if required by the parent CC-486 study protocol.

 If approved by Celgene, subjects from any ongoing or future Celgene sponsored CC-486 studies in solid tumors and hematological disorders will be included in this protocol.
