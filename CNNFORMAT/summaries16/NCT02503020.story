(fifthQuint)Arachidonic Acid Supplementation in Very Preterm Infants.

 the investigators carried out a prospective randomized controlled double blinded trial in order to study nutritional supplements for preterm infants -6/-3 ratio of 2/1.

 Group B's formula was supplemented with DHA (0.

3%) and AA (0.

3%) with an -6/-3 ratio of 1/1.

 Primary outcome: Assessment of psychomotor development with the Brunet Lezine scale at 2 years of age (Early Care Unit CHUS) Secondary outcomes: Physical examination and anthropometric measurements (weight, length, and head circumference) at birth and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months of age (Neonatology Unit CHUS) Blood levels of fatty acids in the first week of life and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.

 Arachidonic Acid Supplementation in Very Preterm Infants@highlight

Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), arachidonic acid (AA omega-6; 20:4-6), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA omega-3; 22:6-3), are required for the formation of non-myelinated cell membranes in the central nervous system, including in the retina, hence the great importance of them for appropriate visual and cognitive development.

 In this study, the investigators assessed anthropometric, visual, auditory, and psychomotor development in very preterm infants who had diets supplemented with different LCPUFA amount of AA to support the importance of sufficient AA values in formula.
