(fifthQuint)Subcutaneous Wound Infiltration of Ketamine or Bupivacaine Pain Perception After Cesarean Section.

 the Group 1 (Ketamine, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of ketamine 1 mg/kg (Ketalar(R), 10 mL inj.

, 50 mg ketamine hydrochloride/ml, Pfizer Drug Company, USA).

 The Group 2 (Bupivacaine, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of 20 mL (100 mg) of bupivacaine 0.

 5 mg bupivacaine hydrochloride/ml, AstraZeneca Drug Company, Turkey).

 The Group 3 (Ketamine+Bupivacaine, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of ketamine 1 mg/kg (Ketalar(R)) plus subcutaneous infiltration of 20 mL (100 mg) of bupivacaine 0.

5% (Marcaine(R)).

 The Group 4 (Placebo, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of 30 mL placebo (0.

9% saline solution).

 All medications were diluted with sterile 0.

9% saline solution to 30 ml solutions in the similar volume and shape syringes and were infiltrated subcutaneously along the skin wound edges and close to the fascia prior to skin closure.

 There were four separate syringes which were prepared by an anesthesiology technician for four different treatment groups labeled G1, G2, G3 and G4 containing the ketamine, bupivacaine, ketamine plus bupivacaine and normal saline solution.

 Patients, anesthetist, surgeon, and other medical and nursing staff were blinded to the contents of the medications.

 Subcutaneous Wound Infiltration of Ketamine or Bupivacaine Pain Perception After Cesarean Section@highlight

Aim: To assess the analgesic efficacy of subcutaneous infiltration of ketamine, either alone or as an adjuvant to bupivacaine, following CS and to compare their effects on postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption.

 Methods: Included patients were allocated to four treatment groups using computer-generated randomization number chart as follows; Group 1 (Ketamine, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of ketamine, Group 2 (Bupivacaine, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of bupivacaine 0.

5%, Group 3 (Ketamine+Bupivacaine, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of ketamine+bupivacaine 0.

5% and Group 4 (Placebo, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of placebo (0.

9% saline solution).

 Patients, anesthetist, surgeon, and other medical and nursing staff were blinded to the contents of the medications.

 VAS scores at resting and on coughing and analgesic consumptions were compared.
