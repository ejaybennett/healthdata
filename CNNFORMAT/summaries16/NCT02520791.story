(fifthQuint)Anti-ICOS Monoclonal Antibody MEDI-570 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma Follicular Variant or Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MEDI-570 (anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570) in patients with refractory/relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), follicular lymphoma.

 mycosis fungoides (MF) and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of MEDI-570.

 II.

 To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS) of MEDI-570 at all dose levels and in a 10-patient expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

 III.

 To determine short and long term effects of MEDI-570 at all dose levels on the immune system and on T-cell lymphocyte subsets.

 IV.

 To determine the relationship between ICOS expression on tumor cells and response to MEDI-570.

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate biomarkers of response and resistance to MEDI-570 in the study population.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 intravenously (IV) over 1-4 hours on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6 weeks for 12 weeks.

This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of anti-inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS) monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 in treating patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma follicular variant or angioimmunblastic T-cell lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory).

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.
