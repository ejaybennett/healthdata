(thirdQuint)Non-Interventional Study of Participants With Newly Diagnosed Schizophrenia Treated With Paliperidone Palmitate.

 This is a retrospective, non-interventional, multicenter study to retrospectively evaluate hospitalization and medical resource use, patterns of paliperidone palmitate use, and clinical outcomes documented within the medical records of young, adult, newly diagnosed schizophrenia participants for the first 12 months of continuous treatment with paliperidone palmitate.

 Only retrospective data available from clinical routine practice and documented in a participant's medical record will be collected.

 The study will be conducted in countries within the EMEA region in which paliperidone palmitate is approved and available.

 The study will be considered complete with the last data collection for the last participant participating in the study.
