 D on Circulating Levels of 25OHD in Postmenopausal Women.

 The active form of vitamin D is produced by skin when it is exposed to ultraviolet-B (UVB) rays.

 However, because of our sedentary lifestyle and to the low sun exposure during winter, the vitamin D status is most frequently deficient.

 Hence the consumption of enriched food could be an efficient strategy to improve vitamin D status.

 The current recommendation for vitamin D intake is 20 mu g per day for adults (19-50 yo) and between 25 and 37.

5 mu g per day for people over 50 years old according to the French National Medicine Academy.

 However, the recommended daily allowance (RDA) in France for vitamin D is limited to 5 mu g corresponding to the maximum enrichment allowed in a food product.

 The current study is designed to evaluate if a daily consumption of two CALIN+ yogurts enriched with 5 mu g of vitamin D is sufficient to improve the vitamin D status in postmenopausal women.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of daily consumption of one or two CALIN+ pot(s) versus no intake of product, after 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks, on the evolution of the serum concentration of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) (D2 + D3) in postmenopausal women.
