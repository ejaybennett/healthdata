(fifthQuint)Probiotics and Corticosteroids for Treating Periodic Fever, Aphthous Stomatitis, Pharyngitis, Cervical Adenitis (PFAPA).

 Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) was first described in 1987 in a study of 12 pediatric patients.

 PFAPA is predominately considered a pediatric illness with onset typically occurring under the age of 5.

 This syndrome is characterized by periodic febrile episodes (39C - 42C) lasting an average of 4 days with recurrence approximately every 21-30 days.

 Patients classically exhibit at least one of three major associated symptoms; aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, or cervical adenitis.

 Between periods of fever, patients are asymptomatic and do not experience long-term deleterious effects on growth or development.

 Currently, the etiology of this syndrome is unknown but does not appear to be heritable or target specific populations.

 Due to a lack of applicable diagnostic tests, the identification of PFAPA is predominantly dependent on patient history and physical examination.

 This methodology relies heavily upon clinical presentation of the patient's illness to rule out other causes of periodic fever.

 As a result of the unknown cause of PFAPA, there are several proposed treatment approaches available.

 Corticosteroids are the current standard of care; typically a single dose of prednisolone (1 mg/kg), given upon first signs of fever with a subsequent dose during the febrile period if necessary.

 Several studies have shown that administration of prednisolone was sufficient to abort the febrile episode.

 However, this treatment method typically results in a decrease in the healthy interval between fever reoccurrence.

 The reduction in fever allows for children to attend school and participate in other activates, but the increased frequency provides additional complications for children and parents.

 Oral cimetidine, a histamine H-2 receptor agonist that results in reduced production of stomach acid, has also been used as possible treatment.

 This treatment has shown to inhibit febrile episodes, it was only effective in 7, 1807 and 2707 patients will come to the study site for re-supply of the probiotic and for evaluation of compliance.

 Throughout the 1-year followup period, parents will be asked to keep a journal to track corticosteroid usage, probiotic usage, additional medication usage, fever intensity, and associated symptoms.

 Standardized thermometers will be provided to ensure consistency.

 These journals will be collected and patient progress will be monitored at the standard care visits every three months.

 In addition, follow-up phone calls will be made monthly to assess progress and to address any concerns.

 Probiotics and Corticosteroids for Treating Periodic Fever, Aphthous Stomatitis, Pharyngitis, Cervical Adenitis (PFAPA)@highlight

The purpose of study is to see if adding probiotics to corticosteroid treatment for children with PFAPA could improve the health and daily of patients through reduction in febrile period frequency and length, along with concomitant reduction of associated symptoms.

 Current standard of care incorporates the administration of corticosteroids; however, while limiting the symptoms associated with PFAPA, corticosteroid use has been shown to increase the frequency at which these symptoms occur.

 Investigators hypothesize that administration of probiotics along with corticosteroids will work to decrease the frequency at which the febrile episodes occur.

 Additionally, probiotics may decrease the maximal fever experienced during these episodes, amount of corticosteroid needed to control the symptoms, average length of the episodes, and the number of patients who ultimately undergo tonsillectomy due to unsuccessful treatment with medication.
