(fifthQuint)Essential Oils for Enhancing QOL in ASD.

 The purpose of the study is to evaluate the use of two fragrant oil formulations to enhance quality of life by increasing relaxation and sleep quality in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

 Essential oils (aromatic oils extracted from plant parts) are routinely used by the public and are available on the market.

 Investigators are conducting this study because it is unknown whether the essential oils formulations will be safe and effective for helping children with ASD relax and sleep.

 To participate in this study children must be between 3-9 years of age and have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.

 Approximately 34 children and their families will be enrolled in the study.

 Participants will try two different fragrant oils in a double-blind randomized order.

 Each child will receive each treatment for 3 months, with a 1-month "washout" period in between during which no oil is used.

 Thus, participants could receive one of two possible treatment courses: The length of participation in the study is 7 months, with two 3-month treatment phases and one 1-month washout period between the treatment phases.

 There will be one screening visit (about 5 hours long, which can be split into 2 visits), two baseline visits (about 2 hours each), two endpoint visits (2 hours each) and 5 other clinic visits (each 45-60 minutes).

 Visits will take place at the OSU Nisonger Center and the OSU General Clinical Research Center.
