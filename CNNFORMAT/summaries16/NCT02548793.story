 The long term goal of the investigators work is to implement real world CPR training strategies that match training locales with at-risk populations, maximize resuscitation skill retention, and promote willingness to act.

 To accomplish this, the investigators will empower stakeholders at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) and local area hospitals to develop local implementation approaches, using either volunteer hospital personnel or paid research assistants as training proctors.

 These stakeholders will be studied as a research subset.

 The training proctors will educate family members or friends of patients at risk for cardiac arrest using a mobile application "app" or VSI kit (RCT), and empower them with the lifesaving skill of CPR.

 The investigators will follow up with the study subjects and conduct CPR skills tests 6 to 12 months from the time of training to assess whether the subjects retained their skills or if they had an opportunity to use the skills that they learned.

 The investigators will also gather information on how the subjects would like to be encouraged to practice their skills.

 The investigators will send a reminder notification every two months following training, to encourage subjects to refresh their training skills.

 At the follow-up skills test at 6 to 12 months, the investigators will administer a survey to assess whether the prompting encouraged the subjects to practice their skills.

 Additionally the investigators will encourage the individuals trained in-hospital to share the kit or mobile app with others.

 The investigators will follow-up with those who are identified as secondary trainees to assess the environment in which secondary training took place.

Prompt delivery of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a crucial determinant of survival for many victims of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), yet bystander CPR is provided in less than one third of witnessed SCA events.

 A number of barriers to bystander CPR training have been identified including time and cost of the training course.

 Since the large majority of arrest events occur in the home environment, studies have suggested that providing CPR training to family members of hospitalized cardiac patients may serve as a useful approach to address an environment in which bystander CPR is frequently not provided.

 Utilizing an existing in-hospital program to train adult family members, the investigators will assess the skills of those who learn CPR through two different educational methods: a mobile app and video self-instruction (VSI).
