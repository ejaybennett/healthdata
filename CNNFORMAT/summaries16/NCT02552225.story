(firstQuint)Treatment of Chronic Laryngitis With Amitriptyline.

 Chronic laryngitis commonly manifests through symptoms including cough, hoarseness, throat clearing, foreign body sensation, throat pain, sensation of excessive phlegm, and difficulty swallowing.

 A significant minority also present with GERD, rhinosinusitis-induced post-nasal drainage, direct allergic effect, and smoking issues.

 Amitriptyline is commonly used for mental/mood problems, but is also prescribed to treat chronic laryngitis because some investigators suggest a neuropathic etiology for idiopathic chronic laryngitis.

 No trials have compared any treatment for chronic laryngitis to placebo and it is unknown if currently used therapies for chronic laryngitis are effective.

 At the baseline visit, subjects will be assigned at random to amitriptyline or placebo, which they will take for 8 weeks.

 Subjects will be seen in the clinic at baseline and at 8 weeks.

 Improvement will be measured using standardized symptom scales, and a self-reported subjective improvement percentage.
