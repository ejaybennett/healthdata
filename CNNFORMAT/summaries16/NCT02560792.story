(fifthQuint)Tailored Activity Goals - an Exercise Prescription Study.

 The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1.

 The first aim is to determine the effectiveness of an experimental manipulation of individuals' affective response to a laboratory-supervised bout of exercise corresponding to a vigorous intensity (just below the ventilatory threshold), compared to a control condition that simply measures individuals' natural affective response to exercise.

 The investigators will specifically determine the effect of this manipulation on anticipated, experienced and remembered affective response to exercise.

 Aim 2.

 The second aim is to examine individuals' adherence to an exercise prescription over the course of one week that asks them to exercise daily on their own for twenty minutes at the same intensity (as indicated by a heart rate monitor) as the laboratory-supervised exercise session, and to determine whether adherence to this prescription is greater for those who expect exercise to lead to positive affect than those who expect exercise to lead to negative affect, as compared to a control condition.

 Aim 3.

 The third aim is to examine potential mediators and moderators of the relationship between anticipated affect and subsequent exercise behavior, including volitional control of exercise, affect regulation ability, and symptoms of depression.

 Tailored Activity Goals - an Exercise Prescription Study@highlight

The primary goal of this study is to determine experimentally the relationship between affective response to exercise and future exercise behavior.

 A secondary goal is to examine potential mediators and moderators of this relationship, specifically four variables considered to contribute to the volitional control of exercise behavior - planning, attention, resource commitment, and affect regulation.

 An additional goal is to examine how symptoms of depression might influence the affective response to exercise, and the relationship between affective response to exercise and exercise behavior.
