(firstQuint)Investigational Study of the Ekso Bionics Powered Exoskeleton for High-Dosage Use by Individuals With SCI in a Non-Clinical Environment.

 This is a 36 month exploratory Investigational Study compliant with the NSF Human Subjects regulations (45 CFR 690) trialing a new device for the SCI populations to aid in ambulatory function in a home setting.

 Ekso Bionics will enable up to twelve (12) subjects with SCI to use an Ekso device in their home for a 12-month period.

 Qualified subjects will help Ekso Bionics determine the practical use of the device in the home environment and will enable Ekso Bionics to gather data to develop a device for use in a home environment.

 The study will require a trained spotter to be present at all times that the device is being used.

 The study will also evaluate the effectiveness of a non-medically licensed spotter to assist the subject.
