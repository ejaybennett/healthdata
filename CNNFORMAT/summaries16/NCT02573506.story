(secondQuint)Study of Consolidation Chemotherapy For Bulky Local Advanced None-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 This Phase II randomized study is to determine the efficacy of consolidation chemotherapy(CC) after split-course chemoradiotherapy(CCRT) in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer with bulky tumor.

 Patients were randomly assigned to either CCRT alone (observation arm) or CCRT followed by CC (consolidation arm).

 All patients received four cycles of weekly docetaxel(25mg/) and nedaplatin(25mg/), each of 1 day's duration, combined with split-course thoracic radiotherapy of 51 Gy/17 fractions and 15 Gy/5 fractions administered in the first and second courses, respectively, with one-month break.

 In the consolidation arm, patients were further treated with two cycles of pemetrexed(500mg/) in non-squamous lung cancer or docetaxel(60mg/) in squamous lung cancer, each of 3 days' duration, every 3 weeks.

 The primary end point is progression-free survival, which is the time that passes from the first day of radiotherapy to the date on which disease progresses.

 Progression-free survival will be calculated and compared using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Toxicities will be graded according to CTCAE v.
