(secondQuint)Intervention Study to Evaluate a Probiotic in Mild to Moderate Psoriasis Patients.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a probiotic in capsules as a coadjuvant in the conventional treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis.

 The efficiency is measured as the reduction in the PASI score in the patients (18 to 70 years old) included in the study, with a mild to moderate plaque psoriasis treated exclusively with topic treatment in the moment of being included in the study.

 Apart from the PASI score reduction from the first visit to the end of the study, the ability to reduce the improvement time in those patients will be evaluated as well.

 Additionally, the following markers of systemic inflammation are also compared between both active and placebo branches: Tumor necrosis factor, Interferon-gamma, interleukines 1b, 12, 16 and 23.
