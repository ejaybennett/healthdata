(fifthQuint)A Clinical Study Investigating the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of ND0612H, a Solution of Levodopa/Carbidopa Administered as a Continuous Subcutaneous Infusion in Subjects With Advanced Parkinson's Disease.

 This phase IIa randomized, controlled, parallel-group study will be conducted in 36 subjects with advanced PD who are treated with oral LD/CD at a stable dose and have predictable morning "OFF" periods and at least 2.

5 hrs of daily "OFF" periods.

 The study will investigate the efficacy, PK, safety and tolerability of continuous SC infusion of 2 dosing regimens of ND0612H.

 Regimen 1 will employ continuous infusion for 24 hrs using a low infusion rate at night and a higher rate at daytime with supplemental administration of oral immediate release (IR) LD/CD in the mornings.

 During the inpatient period of about 3 days, the site staff will manage the administration and replacement of the infusions.

 On Day 4 subjects will be discharged home after they and their study partners have received training on the administration of the infusion.

 A safety visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last SC administration of the study drug.

 A Clinical Study Investigating the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of ND0612H, a Solution of Levodopa/Carbidopa Administered as a Continuous Subcutaneous Infusion in Subjects With Advanced Parkinson's Disease@highlight

This is a multicenter, parallel-group, rater-blinded, randomized clinical study in subjects with advanced PD investigating the efficacy, PK, safety and tolerability of continuous SC infusion of 2 dosing regimens of ND0612H, a solution of LD/CD delivered via a pump system as a continuous SC infusion, compared to standard oral LD/CD.

 After screening, subjects will undergo 1 day of standard oral LD/CD inpatient dosing followed by 2 days of inpatient treatment with 1 of 2 randomly allocated (1:1 randomization ratio) dosing regimens of ND0612H continuous SC infusion.

 Subjects will then continue on a maintenance dose of the assigned ND0612H dosing regimen for the next 25 days.

 A safety visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last SC administration of the study drug for a total of about 2.

5 months of participation for each subject enrolled into the trial.
