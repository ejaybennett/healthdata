(secondQuint)Comprehensive Spinal Alignment Planning Study.

 Preoperative planning using tools such as NuvaMapTM (NuVasive(R), Inc.

, San Diego, CA) enable a surgeon to preoperatively evaluate these alignment parameters and simulate a patient-specific plan using a combination of procedures, techniques, and implants.

 Once in the operating room, realignment objectives can be verified from a lateral fluoroscopic image in real-time using NuvaMap O.

R.

 (NuVasive, Inc.

), a software application integrated with the NVM5(R) neuromonitoring platform (NuVasive, Inc.

).

 This real-time verification allows for confirmation and subsequent changing of the plan as necessary.

 The objective of this study is to validate the utility and effectiveness of comprehensive surgical planning in restoring and preserving sagittal alignment through the collection of clinical and radiographic outcomes.

 Comprehensive Spinal Alignment Planning Study@highlight

A comprehensive approach to the evaluation of alignment in spinal surgery patients - through preoperative planning, intraoperative assessment, and postoperative confirmation - has not been well-studied.

 This study aims to assess the value of such planning through clinical and radiographic outcomes.
