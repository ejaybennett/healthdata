(secondQuint)Addressing Tobacco Use Disparities Through an Innovative Mobile Phone Intervention.

 Participants will be randomized to either the Scheduled Gradual Reduction (SGR) group or the control group.

 All participants in both groups will complete surveys at the baseline, end of program, and 6 month time points.

 All participants in both groups will also receive supportive counseling text messages at various times during the day over a period of 4 weeks.

 Participants assigned to the SGR intervention group will receive their intervention, in addition to the supportive counseling messages received by the control group, via text message over a period of four weeks.

 Participants will initially report their smokeless tobacco use according to their usual habit, and over the course of the intervention be directed via text message precise times to start and stop each instance of smokeless tobacco use, gradually reducing the occurrences of use.
