(thirdQuint)Clinical Impact of Hypothermic Machine Perfusion in Renal Transplant Recipients.

 In this randomized clinical trial, 200 kidney pairs from deceased donors will be included in the study, which will be randomly assigned, one kidney to machine perfusion and the other to cold storage.

 All 400 patients will be followed for 1 year.

 The primary endpoint is delayed graft function (requiring dialysis in the first week after transplantation) and duration of delayed graft function.

 The second endpoints: GFR at week 1, month3, month6 and month 12 post-transplant.

 Clinical Impact of Hypothermic Machine Perfusion in Renal Transplant Recipients@highlight

This is a multi-centers prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

 This trial will investigate the clinical outcome of kidney transplant recipients whose kidneys are under two different forms of organ preservation--hypothermic machine perfusion vs.

 static cold storage.

 Factors during the machine perfusion, such as the pressure, flow rate, and resistance index will also be investigated.
