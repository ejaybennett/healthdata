(thirdQuint)Evaluating the Physiological Strain Induced by a BC Membrane Protective Garment Under Exercise-heat Stress Compared to a Protective Coverall.

 In order to physiologically evaluate a new BC membrane protective garment for the Israeli police use under exercise-heat stress conditions, 12 healthy volunteers from the border guard will participate in this study.

 The subjects will undergo 4 experiment days: Recruitment day, one day of acclimatization to heat, and 2 days of performing experiment protocol, each day dressed with different protective garment (Protective garment in current use + NBC mask, new BC membrane protective garment + NBC mask).

 Core (rectal) and skin temperature and heart rate will be monitored continuously, liquid balance will be recorded.

the physiological heat strain will be assessed and compared between the different protective garments.

 Evaluating the Physiological Strain Induced by a BC Membrane Protective Garment Under Exercise-heat Stress Compared to a Protective Coverall@highlight

Israel ministry of defense is examining a new BC membrane protective garment of BLAUER company constructed with GORE CHEMPAK fabric for the border guard of the police forces.

 The goal of this research is to perform a comparative experiment in order to evaluate the physiological strain induced by the new protective garment under exercise-heat stress conditions, compared to protective garment in current use.
