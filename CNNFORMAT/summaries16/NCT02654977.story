(thirdQuint)CLINICAL PROTOCOL to Investigate the Long-term Safety and Efficacy of Metreleptin in Various Forms of Partial Lipodystrophy.

 Leptin is now an approved therapeutic in the form of Myalept in patients with generalized forms of lipodystrophy.

 However, it is still under investigation for patients with partial forms of the disease based on FDA decision on February 24, 2014.

 The study investigators have been carrying out a protocol in patients with partial lipodystrophy, specifically familial partial lipodystrophy.

 There have been a number of patients who have been treated under this protocol who are not covered by the currently approved label, but who have experienced significant clinical benefit.

 This study would allow continued treatment of patients with partial forms of lipodystrophy who volunteered and completed treatment under the investigators' ongoing protocol (MB002-014) and who have derived significant clinical benefit as judged by an amelioration of their HbA1c, triglyceride levels, and/or reduction in their baseline diabetes or lipid therapies that affect quality of life.
