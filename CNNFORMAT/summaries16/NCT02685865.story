(secondQuint)Comparison of FCSEMS and Plastic Stents.

 The research design is a randomized prospective clinical trial comparing EUS-guided drainage of WON using FCSEMS and plastic stents.

 The trial will be conducted at the Florida Hospital Center for Interventional Endoscopy, Orlando, Florida.

The sample size estimated for this study is 60 patients.

 All patients will undergo EUS-guided drainage of WON and be randomized to either FCSEM or plastic stents in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomized sequence.

 It will not be possible to blind the endoscopist to the stent type being inserted due to the differences in stent appearance.

 The statistician will be blinded to the stent type utilized.
