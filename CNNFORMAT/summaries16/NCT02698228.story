(fifthQuint)Regional Anaesthesia for Painful Injuries After Disasters.

 The Regional Anaesthesia for Painful Injuries after Disasters (RAPID) study aims to evaluate whether regional anesthesia (RA), either with or without ultrasound (US) guidance, can reduce pain from earthquake-related lower limb injuries in a disaster setting.

 The proposed study is a blinded, randomized controlled trial among earthquake victims with serious lower extremity injuries in a resource-limited setting.

 After obtaining informed consent, study participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation to either: standard care (parenteral morphine at 0.

1 mg/kg); standard care plus a landmark-guided fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB); or standard care plus an US-guided femoral nerve block.

 General practice humanitarian response providers who have undergone a focused training in RA will perform nerve blocks with 20 ml of 0.

5% levobupivacaine.

 US sham activities will be used in the standard care and FICB arms and a normal saline injection will be given to the control group to blind both participants and non-research team providers.

 The primary outcome measure will be the summed pain intensity difference calculated using a standard 11-point numerical rating scale reported by patients over 24-hours of follow-up.

 Secondary outcome measures will include overall analgesic requirements, adverse events and participant satisfaction.

The goal of the RAPID study is to fundamentally transform the way serious injuries are managed after earthquakes and other disasters by introducing a novel and cost-effective method for pain control.

 The study will enroll patients in the aftermath of a major earthquake to determine whether regional anesthesia, either with or without ultrasound-guidance, can reduce suffering from lower limb injuries, the most common earthquake-related injury, above and beyond the current standard of care for pain control in these settings.
