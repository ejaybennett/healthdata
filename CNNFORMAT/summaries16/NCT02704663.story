(secondQuint)Transumbilical Versus Lateral Transabdominal Removal of Benign Adnexal Masses Via Laparoscopy.

 Women assigned to laparoscopic surgery for removal of a benign adnexal mass were randomly divided into two groups as regards surgery: a transumbilical (TU) group (n=21) and a transabdominal (TA) group (n=21).

 General anesthesia and use of local anesthetics were standardized.

 Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain and side effects (nausea/vomiting) and the amount of postoperative analgesic used were recorded for 24 hours.

 Investigators also investigated the expenses related to endobags and trocars.

 Further, peri- and postoperative complications were recorded.

 Investigators inquired about patient satisfaction as well as the surgeons' opinions of the alternative methods available.
