(firstQuint)Study Comparing Legflow Versus Bare Balloon Angioplasty for Treatment of Atherosclerotic Disease.

 This interventional study will collect data about the treatment of de novo lesions or restenotic lesions.

 Restenotic lesions that are previously DCB (drug coated balloon) treated or in-stent restenosis are excluded in this study.

 The primary objective of this randomized study is to compare the efficacy of the DCB (Legflow - Cardionovum) versus POBA for the treatment of de novo lesions or restenosis in the SFA and in the popliteal artery (segment P1 -P2) by assessing the binary restenosis rate with duplex ultrasonography at 12 months.

 The secondary endpoints are the assessment of the immediate procedural outcome, distribution of Rutherford, mortality, target lesion revascularization (TLR), target extremity revascularization (TER), amputation and anklebrachial index (ABI).

 For each patient enrolled, data will be collected up to 12 months after the procedure.
