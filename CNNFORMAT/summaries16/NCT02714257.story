(fifthQuint)Working to Increase Stability Through Exercise.

 The intervention will be held in churches, community centers, and senior residential facilities.

 Investigators will work with the exercise sites to recruit up to 125 individuals (5 per exercise site location) to serve as the Group leaders at each site location.

 Group leaders will be trained on the exercises and leadership roles to help lead the group.

 The investigators will ask them to come at least once per week, so the time commitment is minimal.

 The investigators will be recruiting 2100 patients who have suffered a fragility fracture and will randomly assign them to one of two conditions: (A) Control Group - Enhanced Usual Care and (B) Intervention Group - Enhanced usual care plus Exercise coaching that includes in-person and phone coach contacts to encourage and support strength, balance and walking activities.

 Working to Increase Stability Through Exercise@highlight

The investigators propose a 36-month multi-center randomized effectiveness trial to compare the impact of an Enhanced Usual Care (Control) intervention, with Exercise Coaching (Exercise), on Fragility Fractures and Serious Fall-Related Injuries (FF/SFRI) in patients with a previous fragility fracture (FF).

 The investigators will also examine the impact of the intervention on several secondary outcomes like: loneliness, physical function, and bone strength.

 The investigators will do this by following a Pragmatic trial design: 1) limiting exclusions to increase representativeness, 2) limiting research contacts (average 30 min/year) and 3) limiting measures to those practicable for use in usual care.
