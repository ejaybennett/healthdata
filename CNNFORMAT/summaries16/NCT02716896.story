(thirdQuint)Radical Cystectomy Compared With Chemoradiation for Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.

 Currently the standard treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer is the complete removal of bladder and adjacent organs, such as prostate or ovaries.

 Such procedure is highly invasive and undesirable for some patients.

 The researchers hope to learn if chemoradiation, using chemotherapy and radiation, can be a good alternative therapy option.

 Chemoradiation therapy is also currently considered an acceptable clinical approach but is typically used for treatment in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer who have other medical issues that might cause complications during or after undergoing surgery.

 Disease free survival at 5 years is better for those who had their bladder removed, but overall survival rates for chemoradiation therapy patients are comparable between the two approaches.
