(thirdQuint)Trial of Panobinostat in Children With Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma.

 Description This is a multicenter, phase 1 trial of Panobinostat (LBH589) for children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma tumors.

 Panobinostat is a pan-HDAC inhibitor of Class I, II and IV histone deacetylases (HDACs) involved in the deacetylation of histone and non-histone cellular proteins.

 Panobinostat inhibits purified total cellular histone deacetylase activity (IC50 = 0.

03 uM) and activities of most HDAC isoforms (IC50 0.

80 m2.

 1 (starting dose level): 10 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days).

 Patients must have a BSA 0.

65 m2.

 2: 16 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days).

 Patients must have a BSA 0.

65 m2.

 3: 22 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days).

 Patients must have a BSA 0.

65 m2.

 4: 28 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days).

 Patients must have a BSA 0.

50 m2.

 5: 36 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days).

 Patients must have a BSA 0.

50 m2.

 Panobinostat will be administered as a single agent * Dose level 0 represents a potential treatment dose for patients requiring a dose reduction from dose level 1 and may be used as a contingency dose level if the starting dose level of panobinostat is not tolerated in the initial cohort.

 STRATUM 2: Patients with DIPG who have received adequate radiation therapy but have not yet progressed will be enrolled in the currently open Stratum 2.

 Panobinostat will be administered every other day, 3 times/week, every other week p.

o.

 preferably on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.

 Total 4 weeks will constitute one course.

 Treatment will continue for up to two years (26 courses) unless the patient experiences progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or any of the off-treatment criteria.

 The starting dose (dose level 1) is 16 mg/m2/day.

 Below are the proposed dose levels to be studied: Dose level # Panobinostat oral dose (mg) Minimum BSA Restriction Negative 1*: 5 mg/m2/day MWF, every other week (1 course = 28 days).

 Patients must have a BSA 0.

 Panobinostat will be administered as a single agent * Dose levels 0 and -1 represent potential treatment doses for patients requiring a dose reduction from dose level 1 and may be used as a contingency dose level if the starting dose level of panobinostat is not tolerated in the initial cohort.

 Trial of Panobinostat in Children With Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of panobinostat in treating younger patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).

 Panobinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Stratum 1 treats patients with DIPG that has returned or gotten worse (progressed).

 Stratum 2 treats patients with DIPG that has not yet gotten worse.

 Currently, only Stratum 2 is enrolling patients.
