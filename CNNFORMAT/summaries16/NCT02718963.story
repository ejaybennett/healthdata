(firstQuint)Treatment of Dysphagia by Using a Synchronized Electrical Stimulation Device.

 - Design: Prospective study - Inclusion criteria of patient group: who has a dysphagia symptom and confirmed by video-fluoroscopic swallowing study(N=9) - Inclusion criteria of control group: who does not have any dysphagia symptoms, and does not have any underlying disease(N=9) - Setting: Hospital rehabilitation department - Intervention: Participants are applied electrical stimulation by a "Synchronized Electrical Stimulation Device(SESD)" - Main outcome measures: high-resolution manometry(HRM) parameters includes maximal pressure, area integral, rise time, duration of the velopharynx and tongue base, maximal pressure of preeupper esophageal sphincter (UES), low pharynx, cricopharyngeus, minimal UES pressure, UES activity time, and nadir UES duration.

 After apply the SESD, compared the HRM data with the initial data which was obtained before treatment.
