 Topical Timolol for Infantile Hemangioma in Early Proliferative Phase@highlight

Infantile hemangioma (IH) is the most common benign vascular tumor in pediatric population.

 Oral propranolol is the treatment of choice for complicated hemangiomas.

 Topical timolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is an emerging treatment which has been reported to be effective and safe for the treatment of IH, especially for superficial hemangiomas.

 Investigators hypothesize that treatment with topical timolol in the first two months of life, before the proliferative phase or in early proliferative phase, may prevent from further growing and the need to treat with oral propranolol.
