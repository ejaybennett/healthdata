(firstQuint)Phase 1 TAK-041 First-in-Human Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics Study.

 The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-041.

 TAK-041 is being tested to evaluate its safety, tolerability, and PK of single and multiple doses in healthy participants.

 The study will enroll approximately 72 participants.

 The study is composed of 2 parts.

 Part 1 (single-rising dose [SRD], alternating panel design) and Part 2 (multiple-rising dose [MRD], sequential panel design).

 Part 1 consists of 5 cohorts, participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to treatment sequences of 2 periods and for Cohorts 3 to 5 participants will be assigned to a single dose sequential-panel: - TAK-041 5-160 mg - Placebo (inactive) - this is a similar formulation that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient.

 Part 2 consists of 4 cohorts, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatments.

 Dose levels for Part 2 cohort 1 will be based on emerging safety/tolerability and PK data from Part 1.

 The dose levels for Part 2 Cohorts 2 onwards will be based on emerging safety/tolerability and available PK data from Part 1 and from preceding cohorts in Part 2.

 - TAK-041 - Placebo This single center trial will be conducted in the United States.

 Participants will remain confined to the study site from check-in (Day -1) through Days 5 of each period in Part 1 and on Day -2 to 3, Day 7 to 10, Day 14 to 17 and Day 21 to 24 in Part 2.

 For subjects from Part 2 Cohorts 1 to 4, a final visit that completes the study will occur 12 to 16 days after the last safety and PK follow-up visit.
