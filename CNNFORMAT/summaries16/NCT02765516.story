(fifthQuint)Genetic Basis for Prediction of Non-responders to Dietary Plant Sterol Intervention.

 On average plant sterol (PS) consumption of 2-3 grams a day leads to a ~10% decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

 However, inter-individual response to PS consumption varies, with some individuals showing low or no reductions in LDL-C levels, while some even showing an increase in levels.

 Determining factors that predict the direction of response of LDL-C to PS would be helpful in identifying individuals who should consume PS and individuals who should seek another method of treating hypercholesterolemia.

 The objective of this research proposal is to test the a priori predictive potential of a combination of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), i.

e.

, genosets, previously associated with response to PS in a post-hoc manner.

 A clinical trial with a priori recruitment of participants based on genoset which will test LDL-C response to PS consumption using a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled crossover design is proposed.

 Genetic Basis for Prediction of Non-responders to Dietary Plant Sterol Intervention@highlight

The objective of this study is to utilize information on associations between genetic predisposition pertaining to multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the degree of responsiveness of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering to plant sterols (PS).

 The predictive potential of SNPs associated with PS responsiveness will be evaluated using a randomized human intervention trial examining responsiveness of lowering blood LDL-C levels to PS intervention.
