(firstQuint)Prehabilitation for Aortic Repair Patients.

 Patients undergoing elective repair of their thoracic aortic aneurysm will be randomized to a "prehabilitation" program prior to their surgery or to usual care.

 The prehabilitation program is self-directed program designed to improve health and quality of life prior to surgery.

 The program is currently offered to general surgery patients; this study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of such a program in a different patient population.
