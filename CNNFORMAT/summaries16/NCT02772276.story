(secondQuint)Pharmacokinetics of MB-102 and Use of the Non-invasive Optical Renal Function Monitor (ORFM) Device in Subjects With Normal and Impaired Renal Function and a Range of Skin Color Types.

 This clinical study is the first to assess pharmacokinetics and function of the ORFM device in participants with impaired kidney function.

 In addition, it will evaluate the impact of different skin color types on readouts by the ORFM prototype devices QuantumLeap and Radiance.

 These data will be used to further refine the algorithms used in the ORFM device for the pivotal trial and commercial development.

 Safety and tolerance of MB-102 will also be assessed in a larger population of subjects.
