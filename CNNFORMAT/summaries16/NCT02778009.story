(firstQuint)Fit Physicians: Use of Activity Monitors and Activity Integration Program in First Year Medical Students.

 Using fitness trackers and exercise testing, it will determine if participating in a novel program that incorporates wellness into the academic term will improve fitness.

 An estimate, 120 students will enroll in this study.

 Men and women aged 18-55 years of age that are just entering medical school.

 Students who are currently pregnant will not be allowed to participate in this study.

 The scan takes approximately 15 minutes.

 Subjects may be asked to perform an exercise stress test on a treadmill.

 The exercise test is approximately 40 minutes.

 Subjects may be asked to participate in a fitness program 2x a week, and may be asked to wear a Fitbit Flex cent activity tracker on the wrist for the duration of the school year.

 Investigators will be accessing academic grades to use for statistical purposes only.

 Subject names will never be given to any other party other than the investigators involved.
