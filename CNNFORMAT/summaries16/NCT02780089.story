(secondQuint)Study in Patients With Unresectable And Metastatic Melanoma: The Optimize Study.

 This is a non-interventional, observational study with the primary objective to assess and describe "real world" patterns of care in the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

 A sample size of 1,600 prospective patients will provide sufficient information to explore this primary objective.

 There will be no forced number of patients enrolled into a specific treatment cohort.

 Setting or controlling specific treatment enrollment cohort counts would invalidate the results of the primary objective of the study.

 No primary hypothesis is being tested.
