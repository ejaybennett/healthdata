(fifthQuint)Research Study Utilizing Expanded Multi-antigen Specific Lymphocytes for the Treatment of Solid Tumors.

 This phase I dose-escalation trial is designed to evaluate the safety of administering rapidly generated TAA CTL to patients who have undergone allogeneic HSCT or conventional therapy for a high-risk solid tumor due to the presence of refractory, relapsed and/or residual detectable disease.

 Pediatric and adult patients who have high-risk solid tumors with known positivity for one or more Tumor Antigen Associated (TAA) (WT1, PRAME and/or survivin) will be eligible.

 Patients will be enrolled in one of two groups: group A includes patients who have undergone an allogeneic HSCT as part of their prior therapy and group B includes patients who have undergone standard therapy which does not include an allogeneic HSCT.

 TAA CTL may be generated from donor lymphocytes (group A) obtained from either patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or donor PBMC or host lymphocytes (group B).

 Group A patients (post allogeneic HSCT): TAA-CTL will be infused any time after neutrophil engraftment post-HSCT or day 30, whichever comes first.

 Group B patients (no prior allogeneic HSCT): TAA-CTL will be infused any time >1 week after completing most recent course of conventional (non-investigational) therapy for their disease.

 This protocol is designed as a phase I dose-escalation study.

 Three different TAA CTL dose levels will be evaluated in each treatment group (A and B) (see below) with 2 to 4 patients enrolled at each dose level.

 Dose Level One: 1 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Two: 2 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Three: 4 x 107 cells/m2 Patients will receive cells due to the presence of refractory disease and/or high risk for disease relapse and/or residual detectable disease following conventional therapy at the time of the infusion.

 Ideally, patients should not receive other systemic antineoplastic agents for at least 6 weeks after infusion of TAA CTL (for purposes of evaluation), although such treatment may be added if deemed critical for patient care by the attending physician.

 Each patient will receive at least one TAA CTL infusion and may receive a maximum of 8 doses.

 The first and second doses will be administered 45 days apart then additional doses will be spaced every 4 weeks.

 The expected volume of each infusion is 1 to 10 cc.

 If patients with measurable or evaluable disease have a response of stable disease or better by RECIST criteria at the day 28 evaluation after dose 2 or subsequent evaluations they are eligible to receive up to 6 additional doses of CTLs at monthly intervals.

 Each subsequent dose will be at the enrollment dose level (i.

e.

 no subsequent dose escalation).

 Patients will not be able to receive additional doses until the initial safety profile is completed at day 28 following the second infusion.

 Research Study Utilizing Expanded Multi-antigen Specific Lymphocytes for the Treatment of Solid Tumors@highlight

Patients with high-risk solid tumors, those that are refractory to standard up front therapy or relapse after completion of therapy, have a very poor prognosis despite attempts to induce remission with salvage regimen.

 Novel therapies are critical for this patient population with high-risk cancer.

 The ability of tumors to be recognized and lysed by the immune system offers a unique opportunity to aid in tumor eradication by expanding and activating these anti-tumor cells.

 Through this ability to harness sophisticated and specific immunotherapy, residual or relapsed disease that is resistant to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy could be eradicated.

 Prior studies have suggested both safety of expanded specific T cells and efficacy in the setting of melanoma, lymphoma or viral eradication.

 While this therapy has previously been limited by the versatility of the tumor to down-regulate antigens and evade a single immune-target, the use of multi-antigen specific T cells may permit better and more durable anti-tumor immunity.

 Thus, the investigators propose to infuse these specific multi-antigen anti-tumor T lymphocytes into patients with high risk solid tumors.

 This trial will be conducted to demonstrate safety of these cells and generate efficacy and biology data that may be important for future studies that may enhance tumor immunotherapy.
