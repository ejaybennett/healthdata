(thirdQuint)Modelling Interface Pressure Applied by Superimposed Compression Bandages.

 The measurement of the patients' legs shapes will be performed thanks to an optical scanner.

 The patients' posterior part of the calf will be submitted to a localized compression test, in order to characterize the soft tissue mechanical properties of both legs.

 Pressure measurements, applied by the different bandages, will be taken at the height of measurement points B1 and C on the lateral and medial sides of the leg in supine, sitting and standing positions, on both legs.

 2 single bandages (Biflex 16 (Thuasne) and Rosidal K (Lohmann & Rauscher)) and their different combinations will be applied on the patient's legs.

 The order of bandage application for each patient is randomized, but is the same for both legs.

 The order of the leg (right or left) on which the bandages are applied is randomized.

 Modelling Interface Pressure Applied by Superimposed Compression Bandages@highlight

The aim of the study is to measure and model interface pressure applied on the lower leg of patients at risk of veinous thrombosis, by different bandage combinations, composed of Biflex 16 (Thuasne) and/or Rosidal K (Lohmann & Rauscher).

 The patient specific model should better predict the interface pressure distribution than Laplace's Law.
