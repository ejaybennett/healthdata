(firstQuint)Efficacy of Biofortified Maize to Improve Maternal and Infant Vitamin A Status.

 Vitamin A deficiency remains a major public health problem in low and middle income countries.

 Approximately 50% of Zambian children are thought to be affected.

 This randomized control trial will test the efficacy of provitamin A carotenoid biofortified maize meal consumption as a strategy to improve vitamin A status among lactating Zambian mothers and their infants.

 The investigators will enroll up to 255 mother/infant pairs to a three-month study, during which they will receive one of the following three interventions: 1) conventional white maize, 2) provitamin A carotenoid biofortified orange maize, or 3) preformed vitamin A fortified white maize.
