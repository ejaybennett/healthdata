(thirdQuint)Trial of Overminus Spectacle Therapy for Intermittent Exotropia.

 The main objectives of this randomized trial comparing overminus lens treatment to non-overminus (spectacles without overminus or spectacles with plano lenses) are to determine: - The long-term on-treatment effect of overminus treatment on distance IXT control score.

 - The off-treatment effect of overminus treatment on distance IXT control score (following weaning and 3 months off treatment).

 The recently completed IXT3 pilot study (NCT02223650) addressed the question of whether overminus lens therapy has an initial short-term therapeutic effect for IXT while wearing overminus spectacles.

 There have been no rigorous studies that address the following important questions related to overminus lens therapy: - Does overminus lens therapy have a long-term therapeutic effect for IXT while wearing overminus spectacles (over many months or years)? - Does overminus lens therapy have a long-term therapeutic effect for IXT when overminus spectacles are discontinued?.
