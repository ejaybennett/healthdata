(secondQuint)Study to Assess Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interaction Between Avatrombopag When Co-Administered With Fluconazole, Itraconazole, or Rifampin in Healthy Subjects.

 This study will be a single center, open-label, drug-drug interaction study in healthy participants.

 The study will consist of 3 parts: In Part A, the effects of steady-state dosing of a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A (fluconazole) on the single-dose PK of avatrombopag will be assessed.

 In Part B, the effects of steady-state dosing of a strong CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole) on the single-dose PK of avatrombopag will be assessed.

 In Part C, the effects of steady-state dosing of a strong CYP3A and moderate CYP2C9 inducer (rifampin) on the single-dose PK of avatrombopag will be assessed.

 Each Part of the study will consist of 2 phases: Pretreatment and Treatment.

 The Pretreatment Phase will consist of 2 periods: Screening and Baseline Period 1.

The Treatment Phase will consist of 2 treatment periods: Treatment Period 1 (administration of a single oral dose of avatrombopag 20 mg alone under fed conditions); and Treatment Period 2 (administration of oral doses of each inhibitor or inducer alone and concomitant administration of a single oral dose of avatrombopag 20 mg with each inhibitor or inducer [fluconazole in Part A, itraconazole in Part B, or rifampin in Part C] under fed conditions).

 Study to Assess Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interaction Between Avatrombopag When Co-Administered With Fluconazole, Itraconazole, or Rifampin in Healthy Subjects@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of concomitant administration with fluconazole, itraconazole, and rifampin on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single 20-mg dose of avatrombopag in healthy participants.
