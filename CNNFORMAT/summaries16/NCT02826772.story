(fifthQuint)Safety, Tolerability, and PK of GT0918 (Proxalutamide) in Subjects With Metastatic Castrate Prostate Cancer.

 The starting dose cohort in the dose escalation stage will be 50 mg GT0918 (proxalutamide) PO once daily administered to 3 subjects in a fasted state.

 The next dose cohort in the dose escalation stage will be 100 mg PO once daily administered to 6 subjects in a fasted state with escalation to the following dose levels, each having a total of at least 6 subjects per cohort: 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, and 500 mg.

 Dose escalation can occur after a minimum of 3 subjects in the 50 mg dose level have completed 28 days of treatment, no DLTs have occurred and the safety review of the cohort has been performed.

 Dose escalation in the remaining cohorts can occur after a minimum of 6 subjects have completed 28 days of treatment, either no DLTs or 1 subject has a DLT, and the safety review of the cohort has been performed.

 During the dose escalation stage, all subjects will take GT0918 oral administration once daily on an empty stomach (fasted state) for 28 consecutive days.

 The first dosing cycle will be followed by at least a 7-day off-treatment period (for PK analysis); however, no off-treatment period will be scheduled between subsequent treatment cycles.

 If individual subjects on GT0918 show an objective response or stable disease (SD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.

1) criteria and who is expected to benefit from continued treatment in the opinion of the investigator, they may continue to receive additional cycles of GT0918 in the absence of untoward or serious toxicity; however, no subject is permitted to start a subsequent cycle after each bi-monthly disease evaluation until it is confirmed that disease progression has not occurred.

 A subject without disease progression may continue GT0918 treatment with the approval of the investigator; treatment can continue until a subject experiences an intolerable adverse event (AE) or disease progression, withdraws consent or until termination of the study by the sponsor.

 A total of 6 cycles of GT0918 is planned; however, subjects without progressive disease (PD) have the option to continue with their assigned dose in a 6-month Extension Study.

 At the end of total 6 cycles of GT0918 or additional extension cycles, a post-treatment period of 4 weeks will commence that concludes with an end-of-study visit.

 The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be based on the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic, and/or anti-tumor activities, etc.

 of GT0918 from the dose escalation stage.

 Safety, Tolerability, and PK of GT0918 (Proxalutamide) in Subjects With Metastatic Castrate Prostate Cancer@highlight

This study is an open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation study in subjects with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who progressed after both hormonal therapy (abiraterone or enzalutamide) and chemotherapy (docetaxel), or cannot tolerate either or both therapies.

 There will be two treatment phases: Phase 1 (dose escalation stage): Multiple dose escalations of GT0918 (proxalutamide) to establish safety and tolerability.

 Phase 2 (dose expansion stage): Identify two dose levels from Phase 1 to further evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of GT0918 (proxalutamide); subjects will be randomized into the 2 treatment arms.
