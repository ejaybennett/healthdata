(firstQuint)Association of Transcutaneous Pulse CO-oximetry With Inflammatory Lung Diseases.

 Children and young adults age 6-24 with the following conditions: asthma, pneumonia, allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, and well child (without inflammatory illness) will be recruited.

 Subjects will be asked to complete a brief screening survey to determine if they meet inclusion criteria.

 Enrolled subjects will be asked to complete questionnaire forms to characterize their health, current symptoms, medications, and common exposures.

 Transcutaneous carboxyhemoglobin will be recorded.

 This study is cross-sectional and will only require one visit coinciding with the clinical visit.

 Analysis will determine the pairwise differences in SpCO between conditions tested.
