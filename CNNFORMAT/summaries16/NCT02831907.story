(thirdQuint)Portal Flow Pulsatility as a Risk Factor for Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery.

 Acute kidney injury is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery.

 Venous congestion from right ventricular dysfunction and fluid overload can impair kidney perfusion resulting in the cardio-renal syndrome.

 An increase in the variation of blood flow velocity in the portal vein during the cardiac cycle called portal pulsatility is a sign of congestive heart failure.

 Portal pulsatility occurs when increased central venous pressure results liver venous congestion.

 The presence of abnormal portal pulsatility could be used as a marker of venous congestions in other organs such as the kidneys.

 Discontinuous intra-renal vein flow is a risk factor for death or re-hospitalization in heart failure patients and could be seen in patients with portal pulsatility.

 Portal Flow Pulsatility as a Risk Factor for Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible association between portal vein flow pulsatility and acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery.

 Participants will undergo assessment of portal vein flow and intra-renal blood flow using bedside Doppler ultrasound before surgery and daily for three days after cardiac surgery.
