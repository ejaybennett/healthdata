(secondQuint)Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Infusion for Diabetes Related Vascular Complications.

 Diabetic foot is one of the most serious chronic complications of diabetic patients, and still lacking effective treatments.

 Stem cell therapy has been a new and effective therapy in recent years for diabetic foot.

 Combined with the previous studies of the investigators research group, this study intends to transform part of the results of this research, establish an optimal clinical research program, and attempts to break the technical bottleneck in the stem cell therapy for treating diabetes related vascular complications.
