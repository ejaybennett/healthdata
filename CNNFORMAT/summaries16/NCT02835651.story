(firstQuint)Saturated Fatty Acids and HDL Metabolism.

 Study design: Double blind, randomized, cross-over study with two different diets: one diet will be high in palmitic acid (C16:0) and the other diet will be high in stearic acid (C18:0).

 Subjects will receive both diets for 4 weeks with a wash-out period of 4-6 weeks in between.

 Contrast in the intakes of palmitic acid and stearic acid is 6% of energy.

 A postprandial test will be carried out at the end of each dietary period.

 Study population: Accounting for a dropout rate of 20%, 40 healthy men and postmenopausal women, aged between 45 and 70 year, having a BMI (body mass index) between 18.

0 and 30.

0 kg/m2 will be recruited.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0) have different effects on HDL metabolism during the fasted state.
