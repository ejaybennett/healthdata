(firstQuint)Effect of KNO3 Compared to KCl on Oxygen UpTake in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (KNO3CK OUT HFPEF).

 Approximately 50% of heart failure patients exhibit preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), and therefore have HF with preserved EF (HFpEF).

 There are currently no proven effective pharmacologic interventions.

 Exercise intolerance with reduced aerobic capacity is the hallmark of HFpEF and greatly impairs quality of life (QOL).

 During exercise, blood vessels within active muscle vasodilator, increasing perfusion to the muscle bed.

 Nitric oxide is a chief mediator of this process.

 Inorganic nitrate can ultimately be converted to nitric oxide.

 This conversion occurs preferentially at the site of exercising muscle, allowing for vasodilation to occur, hence increasing blood flow to the working muscle.

 Preliminary data suggest that inorganic nitrate improves exercise tolerance in HFpEF.

 The investigator will aim to test this hypothesis in a larger group.

This trial seeks to assess if potassium nitrate (KNO3) therapy improves exercise capacity and oxygen uptake in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
