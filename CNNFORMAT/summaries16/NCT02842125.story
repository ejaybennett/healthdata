(fifthQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Intra-Arterial and Intra-Tumoral Ad-p53 With Capecitabine (Xeloda) or Anti-PD-1 in Liver Metastases of Solid Tumors and Recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer.

 This is a Phase 1/2 study split into 3 arms.

 Arm A will follow the combination of Ad-p53 administered intra-arterially in combination with oral metronomic capecitabine while Arm B follows the intra-arterial administration of Ad-p53 combined with pembrolizumab, both in patients with unresectable, refractory liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and other solid tumors, including primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

 Arm C will follow the combination of intra-tumoral injections of Ad-p53 and nivolumab infusions.

 Arms A and B have a standard 3+3 design, with dosing following the initial cohort determined by MTD and DLT criteria as well as safety and tolerance.

 Arm C will be a single dosing cohort followed for safety and efficacy.

 All patients will be followed for adverse events and preliminary efficacy.

 In Arms A and B, the Maximum Tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined.

 All patients will be followed for general safety and preliminary efficacy using RECIST 1.

1 and Immune-Related Response Criteria.

 CEA levels will also be followed for patients with metastatic colo-rectal cancer.

 Biomarker testing of archival or fresh tissue is performed during the study.

 In Arms A and B, patients will undergo a maximum of 2 8-week cycles, with scans every 8 weeks.

 For Arm B, patients will undergo a maximum of 3 28-day Cycles.

 All patients will continue on the background therapy for any additional cycles.

 No additional biopsies are planned following Screening.

 Enrollment will be up to 24 patients.

 Safety and Efficacy of Intra-Arterial and Intra-Tumoral Ad-p53 With Capecitabine (Xeloda) or Anti-PD-1 in Liver Metastases of Solid Tumors and Recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer@highlight

This is a Phase 1/2 study of the combination of Ad-p53 administered intra-arterially in combination with oral metronomic capecitabine or pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable, refractory liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and other solid tumors, including primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

 A third arm will study the intra-tumoral injection of Ad-p53 combined with nivolumab infusions in recurrent head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC).

 This safety study has a standard 3+3 design for arms A and B; .

HNSCC will be placed in a single dosing cohort.

 The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined as well for intra-arterial infusions, and the entire study will determine the general efficacy using RECIST 1.

1 and Immune-Related Response Criteria.

 Safety will be followed using the CTCAE listings for adverse events.
