(secondQuint)Tandem Predictive Low Glucose Suspend Inpatient Feasibility Study.

 This protocol is designed to test the functionality of a predictive low glucose suspend system under supervised conditions where basal insulin rates are manually increased until a system generated suspension occurs.

 The study will collect data that will be used for planning a pivotal study, and the study data are intended to be used to support a Premarket Approval (PMA) application.

The goal of this study is to assess the functionality of an integrated predictive low glucose suspend system designed to minimize the incidence and duration of hypoglycemia by suspending insulin delivery if hypoglycemia is projected.
