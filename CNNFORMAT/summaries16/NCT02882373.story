(fifthQuint)L-Arginine For Anti- Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Induced Kidney Injury.

 Study Groups: You will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups.

 This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

 - If you are in Group 1, you will receive L-arginine.

 - If you are in Group 2, you will receive the placebo.

 Study Drug/Placebo Administration: You will receive L-arginine or the placebo as a liquid 4 times a day in between meals.

 The liquid will be prepared by a pharmacy.

 You should take the study drug/placebo 30 minutes before each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and then again around 9 PM.

 The dose of the L-Arginine or the placebo may be increased if the study doctor thinks it is needed.

 Study Visits: One (1) time each week you will have your blood pressure checked.

 This can be done at home if you have a blood pressure monitor.

 The study staff will teach you how to take your blood pressure accurately.

 If you do not have a blood pressure machine, then you will need to come to the clinic 1 time each week while you are in the study.

 One (1) time each month blood (about 1/2 teaspoon) and urine will be collected for protein testing and to check your kidney function.

 Length of Study Participation: You may continue taking the study drug/placebo for up to 3 months.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drug/placebo if your symptoms get worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up call.

 Follow-Up Call: One (1) month after you stop taking part in the study, you will be called by the study staff and asked how you are doing.

 This call should last about 5 minutes.

 L-Arginine For Anti- Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Induced Kidney Injury@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if L-arginine can help control side effects of anti-cancer drugs such as high blood pressure, protein in the urine, and kidney problems.

 L-arginine is a nutritional supplement and will be compared to a placebo in this study.

 A placebo is not a drug.

 It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness.

 It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect.

 This is an investigational study.

 L-arginine is not FDA-approved for the treatment of a specific disease or condition.

 Its use in this study is investigational.

 The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

 Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
