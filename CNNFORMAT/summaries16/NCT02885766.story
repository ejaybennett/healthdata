(thirdQuint)Study to Evaluate Tolerability, Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of PF-114 for Oral Administration in Adults With Ph+ Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Which is Resistant to the 2-nd Generation Bcr-Abl Inhibitors or Has T315I Mutation in the BCR-ABL Gene.

 PF-114 is a low molecular inhibitor of a Bcr-Abl kinase activity, which is active with respect to native and mutated forms of this enzyme with mutations in Abl kinase domain.

 Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the ability of PF-114 to inhibit wild Bcr-Abl type and with T315I mutation, as well as other kinds of Bcr-Abl with mutations in kinase domain, including combined mutations.

 In contrast to ponatinib, PF-114 is being developed to increase the action selectivity with respect to Bcr-Abl, which potentially should increase safety of drug application in people.

 The results of performed preclinical studies confirmed improved selectivity of PF-114 action with respect to Bcr-Abl kinases as compared to ponatinib.

 Indication: Adult patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase (CP) or accelerated phase (AP) resistant to previous treatment with at least one 2-nd generation inhibitor of Bcr-Abl (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) or intolerant of approved Bcr-Abl inhibitors or with T315I mutation in the BCR-ABL gene.

A multicenter, open label cohort Phase 1 dose finding study to evaluate tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of PF-114 for oral administration in adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which is resistant to the 2-nd generation Bcr-Abl inhibitors or has T315I mutation in the BCR-ABL gene.
