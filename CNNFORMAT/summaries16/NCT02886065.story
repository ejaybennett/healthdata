(secondQuint)A Study of PVX-410, a Cancer Vaccine, and Durvalumab +/- Lenalidomide for Smoldering MM.

 This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational intervention to use for further studies.

 "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

 In this research study, the investigators are studying Smoldering Multiple Myeloma.

 Smoldering Multiple Myeloma is an early precursor to a rare blood cancer known as Multiple Myeloma, which affects plasma cells.

 The vaccine in Combination with Lenalidomide is being used to hopefully provide immunity against Myeloma.

 Durvalumab is a check point inhibitor which is being combined here to further augment the immune activity of the vaccine.

 It is a monoclonal antibody known to take the brakes off the immune system to restore immunity.

 Lenalidomide in previously studied trials has demonstrated an increase in immune activity.

 It is the hope of the investigators the combination of the vaccine, Lenalidomide, and Durvalumab will augment immunity even further.

 The FDA (the U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration) has not approved PVX-410 as a treatment for any disease.

Durvalumab is also not approved for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma.

 The FDA (the U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration) has approved Lenalidomide as a treatment option for Smoldering Multiple Myeloma.
