(secondQuint)Metronomic Versus Conventional Chemotherapy in as Maintenance Treatment in mCRC.

 In this Prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trial, the investigators will recruit 250 mCRC patients who have finished 18 to 24 weeks first-line chemotherapy and disease evaluation is SD, PR or CR.

 Then, the patients will be randomised into two group.

 The experimental group, capecitabine metronomic chemotherapy versus capecitabine conventional chemotherapy as control group.

 These treatment regimens will be continued until progression, death, or an unacceptable adverse event.

 The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS).

 Secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS), quality of life (QOL) and toxic effects.
