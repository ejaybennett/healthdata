(firstQuint)Effects of CCM-therapy in Patients With Heart Failure.

 The OPTIMIZER III System is indicated for use in patients greater than 18 years of age with symptomatic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction despite appropriate medical therapy.

 The study will gather additional data on the effect of CCM treatment with the objective of determining the impact of CCM on the composite of heart failure hospitalizations and mortality in the low ejection fraction (EF EF 45) heart failure population.

 The study will also assess the impact of CCM on exercise tolerance (six minute hall walk test, 6 Minute Walk Test) and quality of life (Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire, MLWHFQ) in these same populations.
