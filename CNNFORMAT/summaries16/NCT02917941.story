(firstQuint)A Phase 2, Open-Label, Multicenter Study of Ixazomib Plus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Adult Japanese Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma.

 This is a phase 2, open label, single arm, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone in Japanese patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

 The patient population will consist of adult men and women who have a confirmed diagnosis of MM, who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, and who meet other outlined eligibility criteria.

 Patients will receive study drug (ixazomib 4.

0 mg) on Days 1, 8, and 15 plus lenalidomide (25 mg) on Days 1 through 21 and dexamethasone (40 mg) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle.

 Patients may continue to receive treatment until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, whichever comes first.

 Dose modifications may be made based on toxicities.

 Patients with a low creatinine clearance = 60 mL/min) and the patient continues to tolerate this treatment, lenalidomide may then be escalated to 25 mg once daily.

 Treatment periods will be defined as 28-day cycles.

 Patients will be seen at regular treatment cycle intervals while they are participating in the study: four times a treatment cycle for the first 2 cycles, twice a treatment cycle for the 3rd cycle, and then once a treatment cycle for the remainder of their participation in the active treatment and, if applicable, the PFS and OS follow-up phases of the study.

 Response will be assessed by investigator according to the International Myeloma Working Group criteria for all patients every 4 weeks until PD.

 Central laboratory data will be used for serum M-protein, urine M-protein and serum free light chain.

 All patients will be followed for survival after progression.

 Patients will be contacted every 12 weeks until death or termination of the study by the sponsor.

 The study will be closed at 24 months from the enrollment of the last patient.
