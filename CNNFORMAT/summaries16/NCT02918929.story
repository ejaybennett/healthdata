(thirdQuint)A Study of EDP 305 in Healthy Subjects and Subjects With Presumptive NAFLD.

 The first phase assesses single ascending doses for EDP 305 (active drug or placebo) in healthy subjects.

 A "fasted" and "fed" two-part cohort will also assess food effect.

 The second phase assesses multiple ascending doses (active drug or placebo) for 14-days in healthy subjects and also in subjects with presumptive NAFLD (i.

, obese subjects with or without prediabetes or T2DM).

 Each cohort within each phase will enroll a total of 8 subjects who will be randomized to receive EDP-305 or placebo.

 The cohort assessing food effect will enroll 10 subjects randomized to receive EDP-305 or placebo.
