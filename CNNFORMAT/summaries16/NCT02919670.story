(thirdQuint)A Study Evaluating a Proprietary Amino Acid Mixture (Enterade) in Patients Receiving High-Dose Melphalan Conditioning Followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation for Multiple Myeloma and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.

 This research study is a Phase II clinical trial.

 Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease, or in this case, the side effects from a standard treatment for Stem Cell Transplant side effect.

 "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

 In this research study, the investigators are evaluating Enterade/Placebo plus standard supportive care for the treatment of the side effects caused by transplant.

 Enterade works by rehydrating the intestinal cells, thereby helping to restore normal bowel function.

 The ingredients in Enterade are generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration.

 This research study is hoping to learn if adding Enterade to the standard supportive care regimen for the participant transplant will help reduce the side effects from the transplant.
