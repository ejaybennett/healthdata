(thirdQuint)Advanced Understanding of Staphylococcus Aureus Infections in Europe - Surgical Site Infections.

 The primary objective of ASPIRE-SSI is to determine the incidence of S.

 aureus infections, particularly S.

 aureus SSIs, in various adult surgical patient populations, and to identify the patient-related, pathogen-related, and contextual risk factors for the development of S.

 aureus SSI.

 Using this information, a SSI prediction tool will be derived for future clinical trials and public health interventions aimed at SSI prevention.

 Furthermore, immunologic features protective against S.

 aureus SSI will also be assessed.

 The knowledge obtained by this study will enable identification of the surgical patients most at risk of developing S.

 aureus infections, particularly S.

 aureus SSI, and who would probably benefit most from new interventions given prophylactically and specifically to prevent S.

 aureus infections.

 Advanced Understanding of Staphylococcus Aureus Infections in Europe - Surgical Site Infections@highlight

ASPIRE-SSI is a prospective, observational, multicentre cohort study among adult surgical patients, which aims to determine the incidence of healthcare-associated S.

 aureus infections, particularly S.

 aureus surgical site infections (SSIs), across Europe and to assess the most important risk factors for this type of infection.
