(fifthQuint)Testing the Effectiveness of The Welcome Basket Intervention.

 Discharge from hospital has been highlighted as a critical time in the care of individuals with mental illness.

 The peak period of risk for readmission for individuals with severe mental illness is in the first month and the highest risk for post-discharge suicide is within the first 2 weeks with discontinuity of contact with providers highlighted as a key risk factor.

 One half of individuals with schizophrenia miss their first-scheduled outpatient appointment following discharge and this time is a key period of risk for medication non-compliance.

 Common problems that occur at the time of discharge from psychiatric care settings include poor communication between inpatient and outpatient providers and inadequate involvement and support of families.

 The research literature on effective practices linked with discharge is strikingly sparse given the evidence that this is a period of heightened risk.

 The investigators hypothesize that the full version of the Welcome Basket intervention will improve the discharge-related outcomes of individuals with schizophrenia.

 Investigators will also explore the outcomes of an abbreviated, 2-visit version of the intervention.

 This study will employ a randomized, controlled trial design.

 Inpatient clients with a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis will be randomized with a 2:2:1 ratio to: treatment as usual, the full welcome basket intervention, and the abbreviated intervention.

 Measures will include re-hospitalization, symptomatology, quality of life, and community functioning.

 Assessments at baseline, 4 weeks post-discharge, and 6 months post-discharge will facilitate studies of relative effectiveness and sustainment of gains.

 This design will facilitate an examination of both overall outcomes as well as some preliminary dismantling of mechanisms of action.

 Testing the Effectiveness of The Welcome Basket Intervention@highlight

The investigators propose to examine the effectiveness of a brief intervention that might better facilitate the transition into the community for people with schizophrenia.

 The intervention is called the Welcome Basket.

 It involves Peer Support Workers connecting with and supporting hospitalized individuals in the days before discharge and again in the community in the first month immediately following discharge.

 The investigators will compare the outcomes of discharge from hospital as usual with the full version of the welcome basket and a preliminary test of an abbreviated 2 visit version of the intervention.
