(fifthQuint)Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Cognitive Remediation Therapy for Interictal Dysfunction in Epilepsy.

 Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder affecting 50 million people worldwide.

 Patients suffer not only from recurring seizures, but also from cognitive deficits despite adequate treatment control.

 Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) is a therapeutic intervention that has recently shown promise in improving cognitive impairment in many neuropsychological disorders.

 Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method that modulates cortical excitability.

 It works by applying weak electrical currents to the scalp that induce acute modifications of neuronal membrane potentials, producing long-lasting changes in the bioelectric activity of underlying brain tissue.

 It is postulated that tDCS enhances benefit gained through cognitive remediation therapy.

 These interventions have yet to be combined with each other for the treatment of interictal dysfunction in patients with epilepsy.

 The goal of the study is to investigate whether the introduction of tDCS in addition to CRT is effective in the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients suffering from epilepsy.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether tDCS enhances the effect of cognitive remediation therapy on cognition and functional outcome in patients with epilepsy.

 There has been evidence that working memory performance is enhanced in healthy subjects.

 Acute tDCS studies have found improvements in working memory performance in subjects with other neurological diseases.

 To date, there have been no published studies examining whether can enhance learning during multi-session cognitive remediation over 2 weeks in subjects with epilepsy.

 This study could have potential application as a non-invasive clinical intervention for interictal dysfunction in epilepsy.
