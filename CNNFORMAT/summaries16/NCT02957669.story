(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Practice Self-Regulation.

 The Policy & Research Group (PRG) will be evaluating the Teen Pregnancy Prevention program, Practice Self-Regulation (PSR).

 This intervention is designed to address gaps in the existing evidence, reduce disparities in teen pregnancy and associated sexual and reproductive health outcomes, and serve high-need populations.

 The intervention is composed of ten structured, individual therapy sessions intended to promote optimal sexual decision making.

 By increasing knowledge of sexual health and the impact of trauma on sexual decision-making, youth are encouraged and supported in practicing self-regulation.

 The primary focus of the study will be to investigate the impact of the intervention on participants' self-reported sexual behaviors (condom use and number of sexual partners).

 In addition, the study will include exploratory investigations of the following theoretically relevant antecedents to behavior and pathways to behavior change: (1) knowledge of STIs and safe sex practices (including avoiding unintended pregnancies); (2) attitudes and beliefs toward safe sex practices; (3) attitudes and beliefs regarding emotions and self-regulation; (4) self-efficacy to engage in safe sex behaviors; (5) affect regulation self-efficacy; (6) safe sex intentions; (7) safe sex commitment; (8) self-regulatory intentions; (9) self-regulatory commitment; (10) self-esteem; (11) self-regulatory behaviors and tendencies; and (12) emotional regulation behaviors.

 The control (counterfactual) condition, Therapy Practice Group, consists of therapy as usual without the incorporation of elements vital to the Practice Self-Regulation (PSR) intervention.

 All eligible individuals who provided the proper consent to participate were randomized and enrolled into the study at the time they attended their first scheduled study session.

 Outcomes will be assessed using self-reported, participant-level data gathered (by way of a questionnaire) at three time points: baseline (enrollment); post-program (immediately after the end of the intervention period; 18 weeks after baseline) and 9 month follow-up (9 months following the end of the intervention period; 13 months after baseline).

 The study is taking place in New Mexico, Michigan, and Maine at 5 clinics that are serving youth between the ages of 14 and 19 who have been impacted by adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).

 Evaluation of Practice Self-Regulation@highlight

The purpose of the study is to determine the impact of the offer to participate in the Practice Self-Regulation (PS-R) (treatment) relative to the offer to participate in the Therapy Practice Group (control) on increasing knowledge of sexual health and the impact of trauma on sexual decision-making and preventing teen pregnancy and high-risk behaviors nine months after the end of treatment.
