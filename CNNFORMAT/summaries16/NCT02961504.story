(secondQuint)Treatment Evaluation of Acute Stroke for Using in Regenerative Cell Elements.

 This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, phase 2/3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous administration of HLCM051 compared with placebo in subjects with acute ischemic stroke (within 36 hours of onset).

 Japanese subjects who developed a subcortical ischemic stroke and are eligible to participate in the trial will be evaluated.

 Approximately 220 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (HLCM051 group [n=110] or placebo group [n=110]) to receive a single infusion of HLCM051 or placebo.
