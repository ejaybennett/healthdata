(secondQuint)Effects of Levosimendan on Cellular Metabolic Alterations in Patients With Septic Shock.

 The study was designed as a prospective, double-blind, controlled, clinical trial and performed in a multidisciplinary intensive care unit.

 After achieving normovolemia and a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg, 20 septic shock patients were randomized to receive either levosimendan 0.

2 1/2g/kg/min, or dobutamine 5 1/2g/kg/min.

 Interstitial tissue concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, glucose and glycerol were obtained by using muscle microdialysis.

 All measurements, including data from right heart catheterization were obtained at baseline and every 6 hours for the following 72 hours after randomization.
