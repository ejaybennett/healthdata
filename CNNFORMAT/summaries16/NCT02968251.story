(secondQuint)Designing and Evaluating a School-based Hand Washing Program in Malawi.

 A cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) design with pre-, mid- and post-interventions and follow-up measures will be randomized into intervention or control groups.

 A simplified 5-steps hand washing program will be implemented in the intervention group while the control group will continue with their usual practice where schoolchildren do not follow any standard recommended handwashing technique.
