(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Intravenous ETX2514 Administered in Healthy Subjects.

 This Phase 1, single-center, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study investigates the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of single and multiple ascending doses of intravenous (IV) ETX2514 when administered intravenously alone and in combination with sulbactam and/or imipenem/cilastatin in healthy adult participants.

 The study will be conducted in four Parts: A, B, C, and D.

 Part A will explore the safety and tolerability of a single ascending dose (SAD) of IV ETX2514 over 8 cohorts.

 Part B will explore the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses (MAD) of IV ETX2514 over 4 cohorts.

 Part C will explore the safety and tolerability of IV ETX2514 when administered as a single dose in combination with sulbactam (1.

0 gram [g]) and/or imipenem/cilastatin (0.

5 g) to healthy participants over 2 cohorts.

 Part D will explore the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of combined IV ETX2514/sulbactam (1.

0 g)/imipenem/cilastatin (0.

5 g) to healthy participants.

 Evaluation of the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Intravenous ETX2514 Administered in Healthy Subjects@highlight

This research project is being conducted to look at the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK; how the human body processes a substance) of ETX2514 when given to healthy volunteers intravenously as a single dose, and when given as multiple intravenous doses for up to 8 consecutive days.

 As it is anticipated that ETX2514 could be used as a treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii (a type of bacteria) infections, this project will also look at whether ETX2514 will interact with the current treatments for these infections when they are administered at the same time.
