(fifthQuint)Pilot Diet Study for Multiple Sclerosis.

 This is a pilot study of a carefully-designed dietary intervention that aims to help overcome obstacles to diet research in MS as well as provide needed preliminary data for future clinical trials.

 It incorporates elements with suggested benefits for MS including foods high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, and antioxidants, and excludes those that are potentially detrimental such as dairy and saturated fat from meat, refined sugars, and also limits salt content.

 The 15 participants randomized to the dietary intervention arm will undergo intensive training with a nutritionist and the PI regarding the mechanics of the diet.

 Menu suggestions, recipes, and grocery lists will be provided.

 This will be followed by regular meetings and contact with all study participants by e-mail and phone to maximize dietary adherence.

 The 15 subjects not in the dietary intervention group will have regular meetings at the center with a focus on wellness in MS in general.

 Adherence to the diet will be assessed through the use of multiple validated dietary questionnaires as well as through biological specimen analysis.

 Feedback will be requested to provide valuable advice from participants that can be applied to future clinical trials.

 Effects on general health and wellness outcomes such as BMI, lipid profile, fasting glucose, hemoglobin a1c, blood pressure, as well as effects on fatigue and cognition will be explored.

 Fecal specimens for microbiota analysis and blood samples for immunological profiling will be collected and stored for future analysis to help elucidate potential mechanisms for dietary effects.

 Pilot Diet Study for Multiple Sclerosis@highlight

The goal of this project is to establish the feasibility of dietary research in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as to provide preliminary data to support future clinical trials of diet in MS.

 This project is a pilot randomized trial of a dietary intervention in MS patients.

 The dietary intervention was designed to include dietary components that have been suggested to be of benefit in MS through basic science research and observational-type studies in MS patients and to exclude those that have been suggested to be detrimental.

 It is therefore rich in foods that are high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (particularly omega-3 fatty acids), foods that are high in polyphenols and antioxidant vitamins such as berries and other fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains, and excludes meat other than fish as well as dairy and refined sugars and limits salt.

 Subjects are randomly assigned to the dietary intervention or to the non-intervention group.

 The non-intervention group will be invited to attend regular meetings with a focus on wellness in MS however will not receive specific dietary instructions.

 At the end of the study those who were not in the dietary intervention group will have the opportunity to receive all of the materials used during the study should they wish to begin the diet.
