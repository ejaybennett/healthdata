(fifthQuint)Role of Rehabilitation in Concussion Management: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

 Approximately 6,600 athletes will complete baseline assessments and 420 of these individuals who suffer a concussion during the course of study will be directed through the post-injury protocol.

 Following injury, participants will complete post-injury assessments and follow the specific intervention of their randomized group.

 Post-injury assessments will focus on the following: postural stability, neuro-cognitive function, symptom presence and severity, fatigue, vision, dual-task ability, and mental status.

 Participants will complete outcome assessments at the following time points: time of injury, 24-48 hours post-injury, asymptomatic, and one month post return to play.

 Symptoms and physical and cognitive activity will be assessed daily from the first assessment point to 7 days post return to play.

 Session logs will be kept by the supervising clinician at each study site regardless of study arm.

 Baseline and outcome assessments will be entered into a secure online platform, each study site will have the option for paper records of outcomes and session logs to be double entered into the electronic system at a later date.

 Role of Rehabilitation in Concussion Management: A Randomized Controlled Trial@highlight

Approximately 420 professional and amateur athletes will participate in rehabilitation during recovery after sports-related concussion.

 Participants will be cluster randomized, by study site, to a specific study arm.

 Participants will complete post-injury assessments and the intervention of their randomized group aimed at understanding the effects of a multidimensional rehabilitation protocol versus enhanced graded exertion on clinical recovery, return to play, and patient outcomes after sport related concussion
