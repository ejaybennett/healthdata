(fifthQuint)Facilitating Skin-to-Skin Contact In the Postnatal Period.

 Skin-to-skin contact is used as part of a package of Kangaroo Mother Care across the world.

 This has been demonstrated to reduce neonatal morbidity, mortality, and inpatient stays for low birth weight and preterm infants (Charpak and Ruiz 2016).

 This study examines the effect a facilitating garment, the Snuby(R) has on neonatal health outcomes associated with skin-to-skin contact, such as neonatal thermoregulation, breastfeeding status, and self-reported mother-infant bonding.

 It uses a mixed methods approach to address quantitative and qualitative outcomes including participant's perspectives, and measurable health markers.

 Facilitating Skin-to-Skin Contact In the Postnatal Period@highlight

This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of a skin-to-skin facilitating garment used by mother-infant dyads.

 It has three phases including researcher observation, randomised controlled trialing and qualitative midwifery staff perspective.

 The research will determine the effect a facilitating garment has in comparison to conventionally facilitated skin-to-skin contact, by measuring its effect on the baby's temperature stability, breastfeeding status and weight velocity.
