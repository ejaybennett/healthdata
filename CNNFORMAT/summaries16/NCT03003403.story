(fifthQuint)Balance: A Pragmatic Trial of a Digital Health Intervention to Prevent Weight Gain in Primary Care.

 Clinical practice guidelines emphasize recommend weight gain prevention, but evidence-based treatments are not available in primary care.

 Balance, a pragmatic effectiveness trial, will test a scalable treatment approach for medically-vulnerable adults, those who suffer disproportionately from obesity and its adverse health effects.

 Balance builds on the design and findings of the Shape study (NCT00938535) to test a pragmatic intervention within rural community health centers.

 Balance will randomize overweight adults and adults with obesity who are patients a local community health center network (Piedmont Health Services) to either: 1) a 12-month weight gain prevention intervention or 2) usual care.

 Intervention group components include tailored behavior change goals; mHealth self-monitoring and feedback; skills training videos; and stepped responsive coaching from clinic Registered Dietitians.

 The usual care group will receive standard primary care offered by their providers and automated text messages and health information about maintaining a healthy weight.

 All intervention components and materials will be provided in Spanish or English.

 Balance: A Pragmatic Trial of a Digital Health Intervention to Prevent Weight Gain in Primary Care@highlight

Up to 50% of obese patients are not interested in, or ready for, weight loss.

 Clinical practice guidelines clearly recommend that these patients avoid gaining weight.

 However, despite this clinical guideline, weight gain prevention interventions are not available in primary care practice.

 Balance is a pragmatic, randomized controlled effectiveness trial for weight gain prevention for patients within rural community health centers, using a digital health platform.
