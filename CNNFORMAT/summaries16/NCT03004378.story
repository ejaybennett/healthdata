(fifthQuint)Interventions for Adolescent Obesity.

 This study will evaluate the short- and long-term use of activity tracking devices and their effects on short- and long-term weight loss in adolescents.

 The investigators plan to establish whether weight loss translates into a change in obesity-related biomarkers associated with adolescent obesity.

 Each participant with an activity tracking device will have the goal of reaching 10,000 steps per day, in addition to their individual fitness plan.

 Ten thousand steps per day is the current recommendation for improving health and decreasing risk of heart disease.

 Ten thousand steps a day is also a rough equivalent of the US Surgeon General's recommendation to accumulate 30 minutes of activity most days of the week.

 Activity tracking devices will also monitor daily total body energy expenditure and mean sleep hours.

 Interventions for Adolescent Obesity@highlight

This study will be the first to evaluate whether the short- and long-term use of activity tracking devices improve short- and long-term weight loss in adolescents.

 The investigators will be the first to establish whether weight loss translates into a change in obesity-related biomarkers associated with adolescent obesity.

 In addition, the investigators will be the first to report outcomes after the implementation of activity tracking devices in conjunction with an intense adolescent weight loss program.
