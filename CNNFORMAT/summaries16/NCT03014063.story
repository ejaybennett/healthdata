(thirdQuint)Vasopressin Plasma Concentrations in Patients Receiving Exogenous Vasopressin Infusion for Septic Shock.

 Vasopressin is an endogenous hormone that decreases serum osmolarity and increases blood pressure.

 As a part of the stress response to hypotension, vasopressin is released from the posterior pituitary and leads to vasoconstriction through agonism of the vascular vasopressin V1 receptor.

 In patients with septic shock, endogenous vasopressin levels are initially elevated but quickly fall to levels at or below those of normal physiology (1.

4-3.

6pg/mL) because of the depletion of endogenous store.

 Sharshar et al.

 evaluated two sets of patients with septic shock, one of which was evaluated earlier in the septic shock course (3.

6 2.

3 hours, n=18) and one evaluated at a later time from shock onset (mean 38.

7 28.

4 hours, n=44).

 The group of patients evaluated earlier in their septic shock course were more likely than patients evaluated later to have elevated (>3.

6 pg/mL) plasma vasopressin levels (88.

9% vs.

 38.

6%, respectively).

 Similarly, a case series evaluated single vasopressin levels in three patients with septic shock, one of whom was in the first day of shock onset and two of whom were in the fifth and sixth day of shock onset.

 The patient in the earlier stages of septic shock had a plasma vasopressin level that was increased (16pg/mL), while the two patients in the later stages of septic shock had decreased plasma vasopressin levels (1.

6 and 1.

8pg/mL).

 The exact timing of when patients transition from having elevated endogenous vasopressin levels to having normal levels of vasopressin is currently unclear.

 In a clinical trial enrolling patients within the first 12 hours of shock onset, median endogenous vasopressin levels were 3.

5 pg/mL (interquartile range 1.

8, 5.

3 pg/mL; n=54).

 Some have even hypothesized that vasopressin levels rise before clinical hypotension is apparent and the decline in vasopressin levels is associated with the onset of apparent hypotension.

 Further complicating this issue, endogenous vasopressin levels have been shown to be lower in patients with septic shock compared to other shock etiologies such cardiogenic shock (3.

1 1pg/mL in patients with septic shock vs.

 22.

7 2.

2pg/mL in patients with cardiogenic shock, p 26 vs.

 8.

7 10.

8pg/mL, respectively) regardless of shock type.

 This suggests that plasma vasopressin concentration may not directly correlate with MAP.

 The impact of body mass (which may influence vasopressin levels when fixed-dose AVP is administered) on hemodynamic response to AVP has been inconsistent.

 Studies have observed a negative correlation between BMI and change in MAP at 6 hours and a correlation between increasing weight-adjusted AVP dose and reduction in catecholamine requirements, suggesting that hemodynamic response to AVP is associated with body mass.

 In contrast, a third study observed no association between BMI and AVP dose required to meet goal MAP when AVP was administered as the sole vasopressor.

 Finally, a fourth found an inverse correlation between BMI and APACHE II-adjusted 28-day mortality, regardless of the fact that overweight and obese patients received less weight-adjusted vasopressin than underweight or normal weight patients.

 This suggests that while BMI may impact plasma vasopressin concentration, the change in vasopressin concentration may not have an impact on clinical outcomes.

 Recently, a retrospective study was completed at the Cleveland Clinic to evaluate predictors of hemodynamic response to fixed-dose AVP in patients with septic shock.

 Patients were considered to be responders to AVP if a decrease in catecholamine dose was achieved with MAP65mmHg at 6 hours.

 The overall response rate to fixed-dose vasopressin was 45.

4%.

 Within this study, only admission to surgical or neurosciences intensive care units (ICU) vs.

 medical ICU and lower lactate level were associated with increasing chance of response to AVP (OR 1.

71, 95% CI 1.

175-2.

463, p=0.

0049 and OR 0.

925, 95% CI 0.

887-0.

965, p=0.

0003, respectively) on logistic regression.

 Factors previously found to impact vasopressin levels (such as concomitant use of corticosteroids) were not associated with hemodynamic response.

 However, plasma vasopressin levels were not evaluated in this retrospective study.

 The relationship between plasma vasopressin concentration and hemodynamic response in patients receiving AVP is unclear.

 While concomitant corticosteroids have been observed to increase plasma vasopressin concentrations, corticosteroids themselves have been shown to shorten time in septic shock, possibly confounding any relationship between plasma vasopressin concentration and hemodynamic response in patients receiving both agents.

 As previously mentioned, data correlating body mass with hemodynamic response have been inconsistent, but vasopressin levels in patients receiving fixed dose AVP seem to be lower in patients with higher body mass.

 The recent study at the Cleveland Clinic found no association between factors associated with increased plasma vasopressin level and hemodynamic response.

 Together, these data call into question the idea of a dose-response relationship between plasma vasopressin concentration and hemodynamic response.

 This study seeks to prospectively evaluate whether plasma vasopressin levels are associated with improved rates of hemodynamic response to fixed-dose AVP therapy in patients with septic shock.

 Vasopressin Plasma Concentrations in Patients Receiving Exogenous Vasopressin Infusion for Septic Shock@highlight

This is a prospective observational cohort trial evaluating a single plasma vasopressin concentration in patients receiving exogenous, adjunctive vasopressin for septic shock.

 The trial is designed to determine whether plasma vasopressin concentration influences the likelihood of hemodynamic response to exogenous vasopressin therapy.
