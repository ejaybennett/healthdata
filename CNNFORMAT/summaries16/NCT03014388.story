(secondQuint)Posterior Maxillary Ridge Augmentation With Sinus Lift Using Mineralized Plasmatic Matrix Versus Autogenous Bone Graft.

 To study the effectiveness of MPM in ridge augmentation with implant insertion compared with autogenous bone graft.

 -PICO Population(P) : Patients with defective posterior maxillary alveolar ridge.

 Intervention (I) :Implant placement and ridge augmentation with MPM.

 Comparator (C) : Autogenous bone graft.

 Outcome (O) : Patient satisfaction - Implant stability.
