(secondQuint)B-cell Immunity to Influenza (SLVP017) - Years 2 (2010) & 3 (2011).

 This is an exploratory study of healthy children and adults who are given either standard trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV).

 There are no exclusions for gender, ethnicity or race.

 Following confirmation of written informed consent, baseline blood samples will be drawn from all study participants prior to immunization.

 The volunteers enrolled in any the three groups (A,B,C) cannot have been immunized with previous year's seasonal influenza vaccine.

 The identical twins in Groups A will be randomized to each receive a different vaccine (TIV or LAIV) than their twin.

 The non-twin children in Group B will also be randomly assigned to receive either TIV or LAIV.

 Non-twin elderly adults in Group C will be given standard TIV.

 All participants will receive a single dose of their assigned influenza vaccine, either by intramuscular (IM) injection (TIV) or intranasal application (LAIV).

In this exploratory study, investigators will be looking at immune response differences between age groups and between the two different influenza vaccines given to identical twins, vaccine-naive young adults and elderly participants.
