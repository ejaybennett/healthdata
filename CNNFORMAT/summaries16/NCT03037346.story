(fifthQuint)Preparing Patients and Family Caregivers for Medical Decision Making.

 Patient: If you agree to take part in this study, before meeting with the social work counselor, you will be asked to complete 3 questionnaires about your knowledge, attitude, and beliefs about MPOAs.

 This will take about 14 minutes to complete.

 You will also be asked to complete 8 other surveys that include questions about the following topics: - Demographic information (including your name, date of birth, race, religious experience, language of preference, and marital status) - Your medical history (including diagnosis and disease status) - Your knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about MPOA - How confident you are filling out medical forms by yourself - Your preferences, values, and experience with making medical decisions Some of this information may also be collected from your medical record.

 These questionnaires should take about 15 minutes total to complete.

 About 3 months later, at a routine clinic visit or by phone, you will fill out questionnaires about MPOA, your values and goals for medical decision making, and your willingness to take part in future advanced-care planning discussions.

 These should take about 7 minutes total to complete.

 Other Information: You should not share your answers with your family member or caregiver, so that your answers do not influence their questionnaire responses.

 Length of Study: You participation on this study will be over after you complete the second set of questionnaires at the 3-month follow-up doctor appointment.

 Family/Caregiver: If you agree to take part in this study, before meeting with the social work counselor, you will be asked to complete 7 questionnaires that include questions on the following topics: - Demographic information (such as your name, age, race, gender, economic background, and primary language for reading and speaking) - Information about your religious faith or belief system - How confident you are filling out medical forms by yourself - Your preferences and experience in medical decision-making preferences - Your opinion on the patient's values and goals for medical decision-making.

 These questionnaires should take about 8 minutes total to complete.

 About 3 months later, you will fill out the questionnaire about the patient's values and goals for medical decision-making, as well as a questionnaire about your willingness to take part in future advanced care planning discussions.

 Preparing Patients and Family Caregivers for Medical Decision Making@highlight

The goal of this research study is to learn how well MD Anderson helps patients and their families select and prepare an MPOA.

 Researchers want to find out if social work counseling and education help to increase the number of patients who complete MPOA documents.

 They also want to study how counseling and education affects attitudes about medical decision-making, and willingness to take part in these kinds of conversations for patients and their family members and/or caregivers.

 This is an investigational study.

 Reviewing your medical record and completing a set of surveys at your new patient appointment and again 3 months later is the only part of this study that is considered investigational.

 Up to 180 patient and caregiver pairs will take part in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
