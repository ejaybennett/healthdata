(firstQuint)Post-Prandial Liver Glucose Metabolism in PCOS.

 This will be a cross-sectional study with 4 groups of youth.

 A 6 hour OSTT (Oral Sugar Tolerance Test) with an oral U-C13 glycerol tracer will be paired with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) isotopomer analysis of serum samples to describe flux through the hepatic pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle and FAS pathways in girls with PCOS receiving lifestyle only, metformin or oral contraceptive treatment, and obese girls with regular menses receiving lifestyle therapy.

 Hepatic steatosis will be measured with MRI.

The Investigators will measure if hepatic metabolism is upregulated in obese girls with PCOS and hepatic steatosis (HS), compared to PCOS without HS and obese controls without HS.
