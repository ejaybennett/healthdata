(thirdQuint)VIH-1 Colo-rectal Transmission by Infected Semen Cells and Effects of Seminal Plasma ex Vivo (CellspermVIH).

 This project relies on: - our expertise of HIV in semen and male genital tract and our experience in organotypic cultures; - a network of infectious diseases and reproductive biology clinicians to collect, analyze and process seminal cells and seminal plasma from HIV+ donors; - the expertise in confocal microscopy and ex vivo colo-rectal model.

 State of the art culture of colo-rectal tissues, primary cell culture and infection, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, Polymerase Chain Reaction and Luminex assays for cytokine measurements will be the methodologies primarily used in this project.

The objective of our project is to determine the infected seminal cell types and the molecular mechanisms involved in HIV cell-associated transmission in the colo-rectal mucosa, using conditions as close as possible to real life, i.
