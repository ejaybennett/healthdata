(secondQuint)Investigation of Secreted Phosphoproteins and PiP3 (Phosphoinositolphospat 3) in Sputum.

 Within the study, sputum samples will be collected at 3 repetitive occasions in a 3 week interval of the different donors.

 The objective is to assess for biomarker specificity and reproducibility in the two groups (smokers and non-smokers).

 The methods for measurement shall be validated by repetitive measurement of the sputum samples, i.

e.

 comparison of multiple measurements of the same sample and comparison of different samples from the same donor.

 Investigation of Secreted Phosphoproteins and PiP3 (Phosphoinositolphospat 3) in Sputum@highlight

The aim of this study is to validate two new biomarkers in sputum samples.

 These are PiP3 (phosphoinositolphospat ) and phosphor proteins, representing important proteins within inflammatory situations of the lung.
