(firstQuint)An Integrative-"Omics" Study of Cardiomyopathy Patients for Diagnosis and Prognosis in China.

 Identification of novel biomarkers is needed to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiomyopathy.

 Also,the marked variation of genes which is still unclear, may influence clinical outcomes is determined in part by genetic heterogeneity of the systemic response to pathological process.

 Specific aim: 1.

 Proteomics, microRNA-seq and metabolomics will be to determine the correlation of echocardiographic parameters of systolic and diastolic functional entry with circulating molecules 2.

 Genomics will be to determine the association of clinical outcome.

 An Integrative-"Omics" Study of Cardiomyopathy Patients for Diagnosis and Prognosis in China@highlight

This is a multi-omics research of Chinese cardiomyopathies patients, aiming to determine genetic risk factor and serial biomarkers of cardiomyopathies in diagnosis and prognosis.
