(secondQuint)Parameters Analysis in Neurosurgical Critical Patients Through Big Data Acquisition.

 Nowadays, intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is widely used as a way to evaluate intracranial status in neurosurgery department especially in neurosurgical critical patients.

 Most of us focus only on the mean ICP value while ignoring other ICP derived parameters, such ICP waveform, AMP, RAP, PRx, IAAC and so on.

 However, it is reported that these parameters can reflect the status of intracerebral circulation, cerebrospinal compensatory reserve and brain compliance and can often be indicative of impending neurological deterioration and even outcome of patients.

 The PANDA trial is a multicenter prospective observational study designed to investigate the relationship between these ICP derived parameters and clinical status and to uncover the mechanism behind it.

 We will use a brand-new automatic big data collecting and storing system to continuously acquire patients' physiological information such as blood pressure, ICP, ETCO2,EEG etc.

 before analysis.

 Hopefully, this trial will reveal what is happening in the cranial cavity through the natural history of different kinds of intracranial lesion.
