(secondQuint)Evaluation of Skin Quality Improvement.

 The purpose of this study is to comprehensively investigate and objectively demonstrate the effectiveness of hyperdiltue Botox(R) Cosmetic in improving overall skin quality, more specifically evenness of skin tone, reduction of pore size and improvement in the appearance of preexisting skin scars.

 The ability of hyperdilute Botox(R) Cosmetic to improve overall skin quality is likely optimized when it is injected uniformly in hyper-diluted small aliquots in order to "saturate" the dermis.

 We propose to prepare Botox(R) Cosmetic in a manner that is approximately 4 times more dilute compared to the typical Botox(R) Cosmetic preparation.

 A 4x4 centimeter area located in the mid-cheek adjacent to the nose will be injected with hyperdilute Botox(R) Cosmetic.

 Botox(R) Cosmetic is not FDA-approved for this use.

 A maximum of 15 subjects will participate in this study, all of whom will receive injections of Botox(R) Cosmetic during the course of this study.

 This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-masked study.

 This means neither the study doctor nor participant know the experimental agent (e.

9% saline solution and hyperdiluted Botox(R) Cosmetic) injected on each side of the patients' faces.

 The study will last for a total of 75 days.

 Evaluation of the study is based on the analysis of photographic images obtained during the study.
