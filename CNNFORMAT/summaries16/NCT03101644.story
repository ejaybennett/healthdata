(thirdQuint)Optimization of Darunavir Therapy and Dosage Recommendations.

 Data will be used to create a population pharmacokinetic model.

 Inter- and intra-individual pharmacokinetic variability will be quantified and linked to patient-specific covariates, both genetic and non-genetic in nature.

 Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships will be established, linking drug exposure to efficacy (as measured by CD4 cell count and viral load reduction) and toxicity (as measured by frequency and degree of adverse events).

 Simulations will be conducted for specific patient profiles and current dosage guidelines reviewed.

 Optimization of Darunavir Therapy and Dosage Recommendations@highlight

This study will assess and characterize the variability observed in the response to darunavir therapy, an antiretroviral medication used against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

 More specifically, it aims to quantify variations in the drug's blood concentrations and determine the sources of such variability, both genetic and non-genetic.

 In light of this information, current dosage guidelines will then be reviewed.
