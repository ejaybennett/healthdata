(firstQuint)Escitalopram for Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease.

 This study is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of escitalopram as treatment for agitation in Alzheimer's dementia (AD) patients.

 Participants with clinically significant agitation, and their caregiver(s), will receive a structured psychosocial intervention.

 Participants not showing a response three weeks later will be randomized 1:1 to escitalopram (up to 15 mg/day) or a matching placebo.

 Participants will receive study drug for 12 weeks, with in-person visits at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12, and with telephone contacts between in-person visits.

 Following the 12-week study treatment period, participants will be followed for another 12 weeks without receiving study drug.

 Participants who do show a response to the psychosocial intervention will not be randomized to study drug but will be followed for the 24-week follow-up period.
