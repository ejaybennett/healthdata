(secondQuint)A Comparison of Optimal PEEP Determination Guided by EIT and G5 Device in Moderate and Severe ARDS Patients.

 1.

 To titrate PEEP guided by EIT.

 A global inhomogeneity (GI) index and regional compliance based on EIT were developed to quantify the tidal volume distribution within the lung.

 The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of optimizing PEEP with respect to ventilation homogeneity using the GI index and regional compliance.

 2.

 To titrate PEEP with the Protective Ventilation Tool by G5(MV).

 The new generation of ventilator will deliver an optimal PEEP on ARDS patients based on their status automatically.
