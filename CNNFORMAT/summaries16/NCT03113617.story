(thirdQuint)68Ga-RM2 PET/CT in Detecting Regional Nodal and Distant Metastases in Patients With Intermediate or High-Risk Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT for detection of intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer prior to prostatectomy.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive 68Ga-RM2 intravenously (IV).

 Within 45-60 minutes, patients undergo a PET/CT scan.

 Patients may undergo a second PET/CT scan immediately after the first scan for attenuation correction.

 Patients may undergo also a repeat 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT scan after the completion of their treatment to evaluate response to therapy, if requested by the treating physician.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24-48 hours and within 3-12 months.

This phase II trial studies how well gallium Ga 68-labeled gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) antagonist BAY86-7548 (68Ga-RM2) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in detecting regional nodal and distant metastases in patients with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer.

 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT scan may be able to see smaller tumors than the standard of care CT or magnetic resonance imaging scan.
