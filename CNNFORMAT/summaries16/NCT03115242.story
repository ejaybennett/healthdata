(firstQuint)Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound of Carotid Plaque in Acute Ischemic Stroke.

 The main objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of the contrast taking carotid plaques in these acute ischemic strokes.

 The secondary objectives are: - to determine the clinical, sonographic, CT scanner and MRI characteristics of patients in constituted acute cerebral ischemia with carotid atherosclerotic plaque taking contrast to the doppler ultrasound.

 - to explore of the plaque contrast enhancement at 6 months (new injection).
