(firstQuint)A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Guselkumab Administered Subcutaneously in Participants With Active Psoriatic Arthritis.

 This is a study of guselkumab in participants with active PsA who are biologically naive and have had inadequate response to standard therapies.

 It will evaluate the clinical efficacy of guselkumab in the reduction of signs and symptoms, structural damage inhibition and the safety profile of guselkumab in the treatment of PsA.

 The study will consist of a screening phase (up to 6 weeks), a blinded treatment phase (approximately 100 weeks) including a placebo controlled period from Week 0 to Week 24 and an active treatment period from Week 24 to Week 100 and a safety follow-up phase of 12 weeks after the last administration of study agent.

 Efficacy, health economics, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, biomarker and pharmacogenomics evaluations will be performed in the study at defined schedule.
