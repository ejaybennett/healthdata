(firstQuint)Levofloxacin as an Empirical Therapy in Patients With Complicated Urinary Tract Infections.

 A complicated urinary tract infection is a urinary infection occurring in a patient with a structural or functional abnormality of the genitourinary tract.

 Fluoroquinolones have been recommended as the antimicrobials of choice for the empirical treatment of complicated urinary tract.

 Levofloxacin is a broad spectrum agent, which is known to demonstrate good clinical efficacy against urinary tract infection (UTI).

 There is no published evidence available on the empirical use of Levofloxacin 500 mg OD and its optimal duration of therapy in patients with Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI).

 The present study evaluates the efficacy and safety, and optimal duration of therapy of levofloxacin 500 mg OD in patients with complicated UTI.
