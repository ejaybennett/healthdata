(fifthQuint)Influence of Exercise on Trans Fatty Acids.

 Randomized clinical trial with accessible population from the School Clinic of the Adventist Faculty of Bahia, Brazil.

 All women enrolled in the Clinical School physiotherapy service with a body mass index (BMI) above 24.

9kg / m2 will be invited to participate in the study.

 Sixty-six volunteers who met the inclusion criteria were: age between 18 and 30 years, BMI> 24.

9 kg / m2 and sedentarism included randomly.

 Women who present cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, history of alcoholism or smoking, use of lipid-lowering drugs, corticoids, diuretics, beta-blockers, contraceptives, hypothyroidism, parenchymal renal diseases or diabetes mellitus will be excluded.

 The women will be divided randomly into two groups, experiment and control, both with 33 volunteers.

 Group Exercise After a 12-hour fast, the volunteers will be submitted to a blood collection in the antecubital vein to measure basal serum triglycerides, total and fractioned cholesterol, glycemia and insulin.

 From the values of Glycemia and insulin the values of the Homa-IR and Homa-Beta index were calculated by the equation proposed by Matthews et al.

 After 12 days after the first blood collection, the patients will perform a physical exercise session on a treadmill.

 The same will be divided in 3 times: heating, conditioning and cooling.

 The heating will be of 7 minutes, the cooling of 5 minutes and the conditioning time will be the one corresponding to the energy expenditure of 250Kcal with light intensity based on the perception of Borg effort, that is, in the original scale a value between 9 and 11.

 For A better understanding of this scale will be done prior to the day of the exercise accustoming the volunteers to respond adequately when asked about the intensity of the exercise.

 After the physical exercise session they will be instructed to return home and maintain their usual diet.

 After 24 hours after the first blood collection the volunteers will return to the laboratory after a 12-hour fast and will have blood samples collected again.

 The diet of the two days before the blood test will be evaluated through the 24-hour food recall.

 Group control The women in the control group will be submitted to the same data collection protocol of the experimental group, but will not perform exercise 12h after the first collection and will be instructed not to perform physical exercise in the two days prior to blood collection.

 Influence of Exercise on Trans Fatty Acids@highlight

Introduction: The metabolism of fatty acids in plasma is modulated by their availability in plasma.

 Individuals with increased weight have increased plasma fatty acids and physical exercise seems to favor the metabolic responses of fatty acid mobilization.

 Objective: To test the hypothesis that the physical exercise of acute way changes the fatty acids of medium chain of the serum of individuals with increase of the corporal weight.

 Method: Including 66 women, randomly divided into two groups, control and experiment, overweight, sedentary, and between 18 and 30 years of age.

 After a 12-hour fast, basal blood collection will be performed.

 The experiment group, 12 hours after the first collection, will be submitted to a physical exercise session with energy expenditure of 250Kcal.

 The volunteers in the control and experiment group will make a second blood collection 24 hours after the first one.

 The fatty acids will be dosed: pelargonic, azelaic, elaidic and oleic by gas chromatography.

 Intra and intergroup comparisons will be made using the t test for independent and dependent samples, p <0.
