(fifthQuint)Prostate Cancer Survivors and Exercise and Behavioral Counseling.

 Physical activity (PA) has a positive impact on clinical outcomes such as improvement in overall QoL, cancer-specific mortality, reducing treatment-related toxicities, and reducing fatigue across many cancer survivor groups including PCS.

 Despite these benefits of regular PA, the majority of PCS are still not meeting public health PA guidelines.

 Short-term supervised PA programs have been shown to improve health-related fitness and patient-reported outcomes in PCS, but PA declines significantly after the supervised intervention has been completed.

 Research examining the effect of short- term supervised exercise programs on motivational outcomes and longer term PA among cancer survivors is limited, especially theoretical approaches to identify key motivational outcomes for behavior change.

 This study will pilot a two-armed, single blind, RCT comparing SPA+EC to SPA+BC.

 The proposed RCT in PCS is noteworthy given that it differs from standard approaches to supervised PA with the addition of a behavioral counseling component.

 This rigorous comparison condition will provide further evidence that theoretically-informed interventions are needed to adopt long-term PA maintenance.

 The program's supervised exercise length will be 6 weeks, followed by a tapered contact throughout the a 6-week home-based component through 'booster' behavioral counseling delivered via telephone.

 In terms of study measures, objective measures of PA will be used (i.

e.

,accelerometry, inclinometers), and cardiorespiratory fitness will be evaluated using maximal graded exercise testing via treadmill.

 Additional secondary outcomes include cognitive function, quality of life, physical function, body composition, motivational outcomes, sexual functioning, masculinity, sedentary behavior, and cardiorespiratory fitness.

 Prostate Cancer Survivors and Exercise and Behavioral Counseling@highlight

This study will evaluate the feasibility of delivering a supervised physical activity program plus standard exercise counseling (SPA+EC) versus a supervised physical activity plus motivationally-enhanced behavioral counseling (SPA+BC) in prostate cancer survivors (PCS).

 Fifty participants (n=25) will be randomized to receiving SPA+EC or SPA+BC (n=25).

 We hypothesize that PCS receiving the SPA+BC intervention will result in greater increases in objectively-assessed physical activity compared with PCS receiving the SPA+EC intervention.
