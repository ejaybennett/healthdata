(secondQuint)fMRI of Hypothalamic Responses to Taste, Temperature and Glucose.

 The hypothalamus is known to be important for control of feeding behaviour as well as the regulation of temperature.

 Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive method, which detects transient haemodynamic changes in the brain, using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal differences.

 In order to investigate the role of hypothalamic neural activity in response to taste, glucose and temperature, fMRI will be performed before, during and after ingestion of 300 ml plain water or water with added ethyl butyrate (pineapple flavour), added glucose or added ethyl butyrate plus glucose.

 All beverages will be consumed at 22 C and the combination will also be drunk at 0 C.

 The study uses a randomised cross-over design in 16 healthy male subjects with a normal body weight.

 There will be an interval of at least one week between the five occasions.

 BOLD signal intensity of the hypothalamus will be continuously measured for 21 minutes (5 minutes baseline, 4 minutes during drinking and 12 minutes after drinking).

 fMRI of Hypothalamic Responses to Taste, Temperature and Glucose@highlight

The study will consist of five occasions with one week in between.

 BOLD signal intensity of the hypothalamus will be measured using fMRI.

 Measurements will be done before and after drinking 300 ml plain water or water to which glucose and/or ethyl butyrate will be added.
