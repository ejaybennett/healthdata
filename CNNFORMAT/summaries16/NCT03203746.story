(firstQuint)Gingival Crevicular Fluid Levels of Protein Carbonyl Following the Use of Lycopene in Chronic Periodontitis.

 The study was designed as a randomized controlled clinical trial.

 Total subjects selected were allocated into three study groups, Group I (Test group), Group II (Positive control group) and Group III (Negative control group).

 Group I: Included 8 patients with severe chronic periodontitis managed by Scaling and root planing and local delivery of lycopene loaded in solid lipid microparticles.

 Group II: Included 8 patients with severe chronic periodontitis managed by Scaling and root planing only.

 Group III: Included 8 patients with clinically healthy periodontium.

 Protein carbonyl biomarker level and clinical parameters were assisted to evaluate the effect of lycopene as an adjunct to scaling and root planing.
