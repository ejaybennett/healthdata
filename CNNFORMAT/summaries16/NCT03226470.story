(firstQuint)Study of Targeted Therapy Using Transcription Activator-like Effector Nucleases in Cervical Precancerous Lesions.

 Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPVs),especially types 16 and 18,may lead to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia(CIN).

HPVs expresses the oncoproteins E6 and E7, both of which play key roles in maintaining viral infection and promoting carcinogenesis.

 Previous studies showed that using designated TALENs (T27 and T512) targeted HPV16 E6 and E7 produced disruption of HPV16 E6 and E7 DNA, decreased the expression of E6 and E7 proteins, and induced cell apoptosis.

 This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of T27 and T512 in treating HPV Persistency and HPV16-positive CIN.

This is an open-label and triple cohort study of the safety and efficacy of T27 and T512 to possibly treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia(CIN).
