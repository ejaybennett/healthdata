(fifthQuint)Detection of Pressure Areas for Two Elastomeric Impressions.

 This study was conducted to evaluate the significance of using wax spacer in the impression technique regarding the pressure areas and retention of the complete dentures constructed.

 Forty patients with edentulous maxillary arches were selected from the outpatient clinic of removable prosthodontics department, faculty of oral and dental medicine, Cairo university .

The patients were randomly divided into two groups.

 Group I received dentures constructed from impression technique with wax spacer while group II received dentures constructed from impression technique with no spacer.

 On the day of denture insertion pressure areas were detected using pressure indicating paste and denture retention was measured using force gauge.

 The data was collected and analyzed using student's t-test.

 Detection of Pressure Areas for Two Elastomeric Impressions@highlight

Forty completely edentulous patients were selected and randomly distributed into two groups 20 patients each.

Group I received complete dentures constructed from elastomeric impression with wax spacer,group II received complete dentures constructed from elastomeric impression with no wax spacer.

then on time of denture insertion pressure areas were detected using pressure indicating paste and the denture retention was detected.

The results showed less pressure areas in group I and more denture retention values than group II.
