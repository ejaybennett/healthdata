(secondQuint)Characterizing the Cross-sectional Approach to Ovarian Cancer: Genetic Testing of BRCA.

 This multi-centered, cooperative and epidemiological observation study is so designed to investigate the ownership ratio of gBRCAm in the newly diagnosed patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer because such a ratio has not yet been adequately clarified in Japan.

 The newly diagnosed eligible patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer shall be asked to participate in this study in order of diagnosis.

 After obtaining their consents by the written informed consent following appropriate explanation, investigations about the demographic information including the cancer family history shall be performed.

 Subsequently, blood is collected for investigation about gBRCAm.

 In addition, histological classification shall be conducted based on the resected tumor tissues.
