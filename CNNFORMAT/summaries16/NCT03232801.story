(firstQuint)A Mindfulness-based Intervention for Older Women With Low Sexual Desire.

 Specifically, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the intervention.

 Fifty women will be randomized to the mindfulness intervention or an educational control group.

 Both groups will be conducted in 3 sessions over 6 weeks in groups of 10 women.

 Feasibility, acceptability, facilitators, and barriers will be assessed by surveys after each session and after intervention completion.

 Preliminary efficacy will be assessed by measures of sexual desire, sexual function, and overall sexual satisfaction at 6 and 12 weeks.
