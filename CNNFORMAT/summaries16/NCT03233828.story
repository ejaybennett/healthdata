(fifthQuint)Pre-Treatment of Highly Suspicious Pigmented Skin Lesions With Interleukin-2.

 This study is primarily designed to determine if tumor specific immunity can be generated in melanoma patients in response to intralesional IL-2, and whether that immunity can confer resistance to melanoma metastasis.

 This is a randomized, controlled, double blind trial where participants will be randomly assigned to a treatment group (IL-2: Proleukin (Aldesleukin)) or non-treatment group (saline placebo).

 Patients will be identified by Dermatology (Dr.

s R.

 Langley, and K.

 Purdy) and interviews will be held at the surgery clinic (4th floor Dickson Center) QEII HSC, NSHA.

 Randomization will be achieved through the pharmacy preparing treatment and placebo solutions.

 At the onset of the study, 20 opaque envelopes will be prepared by the investigators, randomized, and given to the pharmacy.

 Ten of these envelopes will contain instruction to prepare treatment (IL-2), and the other 10 will contain directions to prepare the injectable control (saline); in this way randomization of treatment and control groups will occur in the pharmacy.

 Once the randomization envelopes are depleted they will be replaced 10 at a time (5 treatment, 5 control) until study conclusion.

 At the time of treatment randomization, the patient will be assigned a codified number (contained within the randomization envelope) to be used to track samples which will be collected and analyzed as a part of this study.

 This code will de-identify the patient and will allow samples to be analyzed without the risk of inappropriate exposure of participant's personal health data.

 When the study solution is prepared by the pharmacy, they will assign a codified ID which will be provided along with the syringe with the patient name labeled as study drug.

 The codified ID will be used to track samples that are analyzed at Dalhouise University, so patient identification information (such as name, address, or other identifying information) does not leave the hospital.

 Treatments, incisional and fine needle biopsy will be conducted at the surgery clinic (4th floor Dickson Center) QEII HSC, NSHA.

Treatment group patients will be treated intralesionally with IL-2 (Aldesleukin, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc.

) at a dose of 500,000 IU in 0.

1 mL for 2 treatment cycles (1 treatment per week) prior to excisional biopsy; control group patients will be treated intralesionally with sterile saline (0.

9% m/v) of the same volume for the same treatment cycles.

 Patient response to treatment will be monitored at each visit.

 Prior to the first treatment and after excisional biopsy of the lesion, all patients will have blood (4 vials) and urine (25-50 ml) samples taken for proteomic and metabolomics analysis.

 Before delivery of the lesion to pathology, the lesion will be subjected to two fine needle aspiration biopsies: one directly into the lesion to be used for RNA analysis to assess the genetic profile of the suspected melanoma, and one in the clear margins of patient tissue obtained during the excisional biopsy.

 All samples obtained from pathology will be returned to pathology within 60 days of receipt, with the exception of the core needle biopsies which are destroyed in the process of analysis.

 All blood, urine, and lesion biopsy samples will be labeled with a codified number (will not contain any patient identifying information) and will be immediately transported to Dr.

 Carman Giacomantonio laboratory (Sir Charles Tupper Medical Building, 11F11) at Dalhousie University for storage.

 After histological diagnosis and staging, cells obtained as formalin-fixed paraffin embedded sections (FFPE sections) from pathology will be obtained directly from pathology; these too will be labeled using the patients designated codifier.

 FFPE sections from pathological analysis of the lesions will be analyzed using immunohistochemical staining techniques analysis to look for levels of tumor infiltrating leukocytes (TILs).

 Fine needle aspiration samples will be assessed for tumor genetic and epigenetic profile.

 Blood and urine will be assessed for proteomic and metabolomic profiles, respectively.

 The difference in lymphocyte infiltration between treatment and control groups will be compared.

 Lymphocytes to be assessed will include natural killer cells, T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), dendritic cells, macrophages (Mac-1+ and Mac-2+) and other immune mediators including PD-1, PD-L1 and FoxP3 expressing cells.

 TILs will be assessed using immunohistochemical staining of FFPE sections.

 Tissue controls will be obtained from the clear tissue margins obtained during the excisional biopsy.

 Immunohistochemical analysis will occur at Dalhousie's Histology and Services Research Lab (Sir Charles Tupper Medical Building, 11B).

 RNA analysis of the lesion will be compared to unaffected patient tissue obtained from the clear margins of the excisional biopsy to assess genetic changes resulting from the melanoma.

 RNA analysis will occur at Dr.

 Giacomantonio's laboratory (Sir Charles Tupper Medical Building, 11F11) at Dalhousie University.

 Proteomic and metabolomic analysis will be conducted on blood and urine samples to assess systemic immune response to both treatment and control groups.

 Serum collected from patient blood samples will be used for proteomic analysis to assess circulating immunomodulators (cytokines and chemokines) before, and after, treatment.

 Urine samples will be used in metabolomic studies to look for metabolites excreted from patients before, and after treatment.

 Proteomic and metabolomic analysis will occur at Dalhousie's Proteomics and Mass Spectrometric Core Facility located in the Life Sciences Research Institute.

 These studies may serve to help develop diagnostic protocols and methods of assessing response to treatments.

 A database containing patient IDs and codified numbers will be restricted to the office of Dr.

 Giacomantonio (11th floor, VG).

 This is a locked office, and the data will only be accessible to the investigators named on this application.

 This database for will contain patient IDs, and info on disease status, treatment/control, follow up visits, and sample analysis - only info pertinent to the outcome measures.

 All sample data will be assessed using codified descriptors and will contain no patient ID info.

 Once the RNA and immunohistochemical data has been analyzed, unmasking treatment and control groups will be conducted at the VG office of Dr.

 Giacomantonio, by the named investigators.

 If the data reaches statistically significance, the study will not accept any more patients, if not, a further 10 patients will be incorporated - to a maximum of 60 patients.

 Any publications of study results will be completed devoid of any information that could be used to identify patients included in the study.

 All study participants will receive biannual assessments for 5 years after the initial intervention to assess disease progression, or the development of new melanoma, to compare between both treatment and control groups.

 This aspect of the study is identical to the patient assessment conducted as per standard of care for melanoma patients.

 Again, any publications of study results will be completed devoid of any information that could be used to identify patients included in the study.

 Pre-Treatment of Highly Suspicious Pigmented Skin Lesions With Interleukin-2@highlight

This study is meant to assess the use of intralesional IL-2 to modulate the immunological response to suspected melanoma, or melanoma in situ, in an effort to increase lymphocyte infiltration and decrease disease metastasis.

 Patients that are clinically diagnosed with suspected Melanoma or Melanoma in situ will be assigned to either a treatment or control arm.

 The treatment group will be subjected to two intralesional IL-2 injections, whereas the control group will be subjected to two intralesional injections of saline.

 The proteomic and metabolomic profiles of both groups will be analyzed using urine and blood samples in an effort to assess the systemic immunological response, if any, to the treatment.

 Also, upon disease confirmation and staging by a qualified pathologist, lesions will be assessed for lymphocyte infiltration using immunohistochemical methods.

 This study will determine whether pre-treatment of IL-2 on lesions (clinically diagnosed as melanoma or melanoma in situ) is effective in generating an adaptive immune response, and whether that immune response may play a role in preventing disease metastasis.
