(secondQuint)Immunotherapy With Bispecific CAR-T Cells for B-Cell Lymphoma, ALL and CLL.

 This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product named CD19 CD20 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells (CD19 CAR T-cells) in patients with high risk, relapsed CD19+ and CD20+haematological malignancies (Leukemia and lymphoma).

 Following informed consent and registration to the trial, patients will undergo an unstimulated leukapheresis for the generation of the CD19 CD20 CAR T-cells.

 Patients will receive the CD19 CD20 CAR T-cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

 The study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of the CD19 CD20 CAR T-cells in patients with high risk relapsed CD19+ malignancies.
