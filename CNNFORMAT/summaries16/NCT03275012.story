(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Safety Study of Gabapentin as add-on to Morphine in Paediatric Patients Affected by Chronic Pain.

 This paediatric trial has the objective to make gabapentin available for children with severe chronic neuropathic or mixed pain.

 This study will be conducted in full conformance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, consistent with ICH-GCP (including ICH Topic E11 guideline) and applicable regulatory requirements including the Paediatric Recommendations (CE/2008).

 Gabapentin has been successfully used to treat neuropathic pain in adults.

 In absence of specific paediatric studies it is not approved for the same condition in children.

 The paediatric use of gabapentin is hampered by: a) the lack of a suitable paediatric formulation, b) the significant variability of gabapentin PK profile and c) efficacy and safety data in this specific population.

 GABA-2 is a superiority trial designed to assess the potential benefit of gabapentin oral solution in augmenting the analgesic effect of morphine in children affected by severe chronic pain thus preventing or decreasing opioid tolerance, as it has been reported to happen in adults.

 Thus GABA-2 study is an randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multi-centre study to evaluate the efficacy of gabapentin added to morphine in paediatric patients suffering from severe chronic pain (neuropathic or mixed with ascertained neuropathic component).

 The trial will include 66 patients aged from 3 months to less than 18 years affected by severe chronic neuropathic or mixed pain and in need of morphine.

 Children from 3 months to 3 years of age.

 Patients 15kg).

 Current dosing schedule for gabapentin is the following: - Day 1 starting dose in mg/kg/day; - Day 3 2 times the starting dose in mg/kg/day; - Day 5 3 times the starting dose in mg/kg/day; - Day 14 2 times the dose of Day 5 in mg/kg/day; - Day 21 3 times the dose of Day 5 in mg/kg/day.

 Dosing of morphine is largely based on the "WHO guidelines on the pharmacological treatment of persisting pain in children with medical illnesses", 2012.

 The guidelines recommended starting dose for immediate release formulation of morphine are '80-200 mcg/kg every 4 hours for infants and 200-500 mcg/kg in 6 divided doses in older children.

 ' However, due to compliance issues a four times daily regimen (q.

i.

d) will be used during the titration phase of this protocol for children with body weight >30kg and throughout this study for patients with 30kg will receive immediate release tablet 4 times daily, during the titration phase and extended release tablets 2 times daily during the maintenance phase.

 All subjects that are completing the study or are withdrawn early must be tapered off of the gabapentin.

 At the visit of Early Termination or End Of Study visit, subjects will be dispensed a taper dose based on their current dose level (the dose of the medicinal product taken during the maintenance period) and should follow the dose tapering as described in the protocol.

 Concomitant use of some medications that could interfere with the study will be prohibited.

 Unrestricted use of paracetamol and/or ibuprofen alone or in combination will be used as rescue therapy any time the patient experiences pain (pain level >4/10 measured with age- appropriate pain scales FLACC, FPS-R or NRS-11) This study includes pharmacokinetic analysis to establish a population pharmacokinetic model adequate to describe the time-course and variability of plasma concentrations of gabapentin and gabapentin plus morphine following repeat dosing in children with chronic pain.

 The study includes also an optional exploratory pharmacogenomics study which requires a separate Informed Consent if the parent of the subject agrees to participate.

 The aims of the exploratory pharmacogenomic research is to better understand inherited genetic factors and their association with clinical assessments, which may include pharmacokinetics of gabapentin, relative susceptibility to drug-drug interactions, predisposition to side effects, and/or patients' response to treatment with gabapentin.

 The study foresees also an exploratory metabolomic study that may provide insight in the mechanism of neuropathic pain and the inter-individual variation in drug response.

 During this study, it is expected that a maximum of 15.

9 mL of blood will be taken from every subject (male and female).

 Additional 2.

0 ml of blood will be required from females of child bearing age for pregnancy testing.

 The primary analysis of efficacy will be conducted using ANCOVA with baseline average pain score as a covariate.

 The study will be conducted under the supervision of an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).

 Efficacy and Safety Study of Gabapentin as add-on to Morphine in Paediatric Patients Affected by Chronic Pain@highlight

The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of gabapentin as adjunctive therapy to morphine in the treatment of severe chronic neuropathic or mixed pain in children from 3 months to less than 18 years of age assessed by the difference in average pain scores between treatment arms at the end of the treatment period.
