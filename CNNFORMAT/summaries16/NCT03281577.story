(firstQuint)Effect of TAK-954 on Gastrointestinal and Colonic Transit in Diabetic or Idiopathic Gastroparesis Participants.

 The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-954.

 TAK-954 is a 5 HT4 receptor agonist and is being tested to treat people who have diabetic or idiopathic gastroparesis and who previously reported delay in stomach emptying.

 This study will look at the gastric emptying time of solids in people who take TAK-954 or placebo.

 The study will enroll approximately 48 patients.

 Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - TAK-954 0.

1 mg - TAK-954 0.

3 mg - TAK-954 1 mg - Placebo (dummy inactive solution) - this is a solution that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient.

 During the study, participants will complete a daily diary to record their bowel habits and determine the severity of their gastroparesis symptoms using the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI).

 This single center trial will be conducted in the United States.

 The duration of treatment is 3 days and the overall period of evaluation is up to 28 days.

 The participants will be contacted by telephone (Days 10 to 14) for follow-up assessment.

 There will be another follow-up phone call for women of childbearing potential (Days 38 to 43).
