(thirdQuint)Smart SCALEs With Bioimpedance Analysis for Treatment Guidance in Decompensated Heart Failure.

 Investigators will include 153 participants hospitalized in the University Hospital in Basel.

 Daily measurements of whole body water and body weight will be performed in each person until diuretic treatment is stopped or the patient is discharged from hospital, respectively.

 Primary endpoint is the correlation between reduction of whole body water (in kg) and reduction of body weight (in kg) in patients with decompensated heart failure receiving forced diuretic treatment (max.

 deviation +/- 1kg).

 Smart SCALEs With Bioimpedance Analysis for Treatment Guidance in Decompensated Heart Failure@highlight

In this trial the measurement of whole body water will be compared to the standard method of measuring the body weight as treatment guidance in patients with decompensated heart failure.

 The Seca mBCA 515 [medical Body Composition Analyser] will be used to quantify the whole body water by using bioelectrical impedance analysis.
