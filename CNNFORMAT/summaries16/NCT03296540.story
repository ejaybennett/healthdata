(secondQuint)CRUSHed vs.

 Uncrushed Prasugrel in STEMI Patients Undergoing PCI.

 The study is a two-centre, randomized, 1:1 trial comparing prehospital prasugrel initiation therapy between crushed vs.

 uncrushed prasugrel tablets on efficacy and safety as well as pharmacodynamics in STEMI patients.

 Patients with STEMI planned for primary PCI will be screened and, if inclusion criteria are met, included at first medical contact (paramedics).

 After enrolment, patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 60mg prasugrel loading dose by ingesting integral or crushed tablets.

 The follow-up duration is 12 months, i.

e.

 clinical outcomes will be analysed in-hospital, at 30 days, and 12 months.

The studys evaluates the effect of prehospital administration of crushed tablets of Prasugrel loading dose (in addition to ASA and standard care) versus uncrushed tablets of Prasugrel loading dose on efficacy and safety as well as pharmacodynamics as measured by platelet reactivity using VerifyNow.
