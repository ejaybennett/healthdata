(fifthQuint)RVA Breathes: A Richmond City Collaboration to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Disparities.

 RVA Breathes includes family-based asthma self-management education (delivered by Community Health Workers [CHWs] with the Institute for Public Health Innovation), homeenvironmental remediation (with Richmond City Health Department's Healthy Homes Initiative), and a schoolnurse component (with elementary schools in the Richmond City Public School System).

 These interventions capitalize among existing resources and relationships with stakeholders in Richmond, each of which is committed to RVA Breathes.

 Three-hundred children with asthma and their caregivers will participate in a randomized clinical trial of RVA Breathes.

 After completing a baseline assessment, families will be randomized to one of three conditions: 1) asthma education + home remediation + school intervention, 2) asthma education + home remediation and 3) comparator condition (Enhanced Standard of Care, E-SOC).

 Families will participate in the program for 12 months and complete follow-up assessments (post-treatment and 3-, 6-, and 12-month) to measure changes in healthcare utilization and the impact of the program on child asthma outcomes.

 Conditions will be compared on the primary outcomes of healthcare utilization, including asthma specific ED visits and hospital admissions, school absences, and controller medication use; secondary outcomes include asthma control, symptoms, and quality of life.

 We will also evaluate the sustainability of RVA Breathes after 12 months (without active intervention), including a review of qualitative data from participants and stakeholders in the program.

 Findings from this trial will allow for dissemination and implementation of RVA Breathes as a sustainable program in the Richmond are.

 RVA Breathes: A Richmond City Collaboration to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Disparities@highlight

The goal of this study is to evaluate a sustainable, community-engaged program to reduce asthma disparities among 5 to 11-year-old children in Richmond, Virginia.

 Richmond, an urban center, has been named the Asthma Capital, or "most challenging place to live in the U.

S.

 with asthma," by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation three times in the last 5 years.

 To date, however, the city has no comprehensive, community-engaged asthma care program for those children at highest risk for poor asthma outcomes.

 To address this disparity, the study team engaged with community partners and completed a mixed-methods needs assessment to enhance understanding of the barriers and supports to asthma care for children and their families living in Richmond.

 Several key priority areas emerged: peer support, advocacy, treating the home as a system, increased school nurse education, and coordination with schools and providers.

 Working together, the community-engaged team translated needs assessment findings to RVA Breathes, a program coordinating asthma care across 4 sectors: family, home, community, and medical care.
