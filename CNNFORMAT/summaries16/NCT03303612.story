(thirdQuint)Clinical Monitoring Strategy vs EP-guided Algorithmic in LBBB Patients Post-TAVI.

 The study population consists of pacemaker-free patients that are 18 years or older undergoing a TAVI at the Montreal Heart Institute.

 Patient consent is required.

 Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following two groups: Group 1: electrophysiology-based algorithmic approach Group 2: standard clinical follow-up with transcutaneous cardiac monitoring.

 Clinical Monitoring Strategy vs EP-guided Algorithmic in LBBB Patients Post-TAVI@highlight

The primary hypothesis of the proposed study is that an electrophysiology-based algorithmic approach is superior to standard clinical follow-up with remote monitoring in reducing the combined endpoint of cardiovascular hospitalization, syncope and death in patients with new onset conduction disturbance following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
