(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy of SGN-LIV1A Plus Pembrolizumab for Patients With Locally-Advanced or Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.

 The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the combination of SGN-LIV1A, which targets LIV-1- expressing tumor cells, with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab for patients with unresectable locally-advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

 These two drugs act through distinct and possibly complementary modes of action.

 This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial.

 Patients given SGN-LIV1A and pembrolizumab in Part A will be monitored for frequency of dose-limiting toxicities to determine if SGN-LIV1A dosing should be de-escalated before opening the expansion in Part B.

 In addition to safety measures, objective response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and other efficacy outcomes will be assessed.

This trial studies SGN-LIV1A in combination with pembrolizumab to find out what their side effects are and if they work for patients with triple-negative breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.

 Patients will be given both experimental drugs every 3 weeks.
