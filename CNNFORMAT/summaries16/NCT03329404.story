(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Safety of RBCs Derived From Mirasol-treated Whole Blood in Patients Requiring Chronic Transfusion (PRAISE).

 Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either Mirasol-treated RBCs followed by conventional RBCs, or to receive conventional RBCs followed by Mirasol-treated RBCs.

 The blood centers will collect the donor RBCs and supply the Mirasol-treated RBCs to the hospital sites for transfusion into patients.

 Hospital sites will order conventional RBCs as per their normal process, from their standard vendor.

 Blood transfusion is the mainstay of care for individuals with thalassemia major.

 The purpose of transfusion is twofold: to improve the anemia and to suppress the ineffective erythropoiesis.

 A transfusion episode for these thalassemia patients are the routine transfusions administered on a regular schedule for the life of the patient.

 The crossover trial design will consist of 2 treatment periods.

 Each period will include a 50 day wash-in phase (Day 0 of the wash-in = Day 0 of the treatment period) followed by 2 transfusion episodes.

 An end of study treatment follow-up visit will occur 2-4 weeks after the last per protocol transfusion, prior to the next standard of care transfusion.

 A final study visit will occur at least 60 days after the last per protocol transfusion.

 The primary objective of the PRAISE study is to determine if percent survival of RBCs derived from Mirasol-treated WB is non-inferior to conventional RBCs when transfused into patients requiring chronic RBC transfusion support.

 The secondary objectives include comparing other efficacy and safety endpoints between treatment groups.

 Efficacy and Safety of RBCs Derived From Mirasol-treated Whole Blood in Patients Requiring Chronic Transfusion (PRAISE)@highlight

This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, crossover trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of red blood cells (RBCs) derived from Mirasol-treated whole blood (WB) versus conventional RBCs in transfusion dependent thalassemia patients.

 Throughout the clinical study, RBC transfusion volume and frequency will be determined by each subject's treating physician.
