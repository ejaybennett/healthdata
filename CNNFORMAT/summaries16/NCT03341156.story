(secondQuint)Administration of Prothrombin Complex Concentrate vs.

 Standard Transfusion During/After Heart Transplantation.

 This study will be a randomized (1:1; PCC vs.

 plasma), open-label trial of hemostatic therapies during heart transplantation.

 The goal is to enroll 60 patients.

 Informed consent will be obtained from patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria before the initiation of any study specific procedures.

 Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either PCC or plasma transfusion.

 The efficacy of interventions will be evaluated after 30 minutes of protamine administration.

 After the heart transplantation, thrombocytopenia and/or hypofibrinogenemia may worsen bleeding associated with vitamin K dependent factor deficiencies.

 Transfusion of platelets and/or cryoprecipitate is permitted if abnormal laboratory values are observed during the rewarming phase of CPB; platelet count mu l, and fibrinogen <200 mg/dl, respectively.

 Laboratory tests (hematocrit, platelet count, PT, PTT, POC-PT, coagulation factor and inhibitor levels (e.

g.

, factor II, antithrombin), thromboelastometry or thromboelastography, endogenous thrombin generation) will also be obtained at baseline, during surgery and at 24 hours after surgery.

 Administration of Prothrombin Complex Concentrate vs.

 Standard Transfusion During/After Heart Transplantation@highlight

This study is comparing the use of Kcentra vs.

 standard transfusion in patients undergoing heart transplantation surgery.

 Half of the patients will receive Kcentra, while the other half will receive fresh frozen plasma.
