(firstQuint)Anti-E1E2 (D32.

10 Epitope-binding) Antibodies Status Prior Therapy Favors Direct-acting Antiviral Treatment Efficacy.

 Presence of anti-E1E2 antibodies was previously associated with spontaneous cure of hepatitis C virus (HCV).

 The hypothesis was to check whether baseline anti-E1E2 antibodies could predict virological outcome in HCV-infected patients receiving direct-acting antiviral treatment.
