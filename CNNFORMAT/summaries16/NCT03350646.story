(thirdQuint)Does the Volume of the Embryo Culture Medium During Embryo Transfer Affects the IVF Outcomes?.

 The volume of culture medium used for embryo transfer is a variable that has been speculated to affect the IVF outcome.

 It is known that ultra high volume (>100 1/2l) of medium during embryo transfer may result in embryo expulsion out of the uterus or ectopic pregnancy.

 Similarly, some authors advocate that ultra low volume of transferring medium (1/2l) may negatively affect pregnancy and implantation rates.

 However small differences in the volume of the culture medium may favor the outcome of the embryo transfer.

 The aim of this study was to evaluate if the use higher volume (40-451/2l VS 20-25 1/2l) of media used for embryo transfer affects the clinical outcomes in fresh IVF cycles.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if higher volume (40-451/2l VS 20-25 1/2l) of media used for embryo transfer affects the clinical outcomes in fresh IVF cycles.

Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study, were randomized, on the day of the embryo transfer, into group A: low volume (20-25 1/2L) and group B: high volume (40-45 1/2L)
