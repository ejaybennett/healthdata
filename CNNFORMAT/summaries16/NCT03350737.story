(secondQuint)Coronary Arteriogenetic Heparinized Exercise.

 Our approach is based on the combination of pharmacological stimuli (with heparin) on top of a 2-week cycle of physical rehabilitation.

 The rationale for this chemical-physical cocktail stems from the fact that increase in shear stress (achieved with exercise), or heparin (when used alone) have no significant effect on coronary arteriogenesis.

 Nevertheless, when the two stimuli are coupled coronary arteriogenesis is consistently present, and clinically significant.

 The basic principle of heparin treatment is to potentiates angiogenic growth factors, which are over expressed by increased shear stress at the site of pre-existing collateral vessels as a result of exercise or pacing.

 Although the precise mechanisms by which heparin potentiates arteriogenesis remain to be completely elucidated, heparin administration combined with exercise has great potential in treating patients with effort angina who are not indicated for conventional revascularization therapy.

 Coronary Arteriogenetic Heparinized Exercise@highlight

This study evaluates the addition of heparin to a 2-week cycle of physical rehabilitation in the treatment of refractory angina.

 Half of the patients will undergo heparin-primed physical rehabilitation, while the other half will undergo only physical rehabilitation.
