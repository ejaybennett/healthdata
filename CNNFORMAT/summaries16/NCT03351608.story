(thirdQuint)Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of Sugammadex for Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade (NMB) in Pediatric Participants (MK-8616-089).

 This trial will be conducted in two parts: Part A and Part B.

 In Part A, pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling will be conducted to identify the pediatric dose providing sugammadex exposure similar to adults.

 For Part B participants, the efficacy of sugammadex (i.

e.

 time to recovery of the TOF ratio) will be assessed.

 Further, safety analyses will be conducted in both Parts A and B.

 Following completion of Part A, an interim analysis (IA) of the PK and safety data will be performed.

 Once the appropriate doses are confirmed and safety data is assessed for the 2 doses of sugammadex, then Part B will commence.

 Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of Sugammadex for Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade (NMB) in Pediatric Participants (MK-8616-089)@highlight

This trial will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of sugammadex for the reversal of both moderate and deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced by either rocuronium or vecuronium in pediatric participants.

 The primary efficacy hypothesis of this investigation is that sugammadex is superior to neostigmine in reversing moderate NMB in pediatric participants as measured by time to recovery to a train-of-four (TOF) ratio of 0.

9.
