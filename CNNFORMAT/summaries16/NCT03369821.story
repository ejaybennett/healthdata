(fifthQuint)EXtremely Early-onset Type 1 Diabetes EXtremely Early-onset Type 1 Diabetes (A Musketeers' Memorandum Study).

 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common autoimmune disease that causes destruction of pancreatic, insulin producing beta cells, leading to high blood glucose.

 T1D is regarded as a childhood disease with an average age of diagnosis of 13 years, but the age presentation is very variable from young infants until late adulthood.

 In Exeter, a group of rare children who have developed T1D in the first year of life (Patel) is described as having Extremely Early-onset Type 1 Diabetes (EET1D).

 Studying these rare patients is important because they are presenting with autoimmunity right at the beginning of life when the immune system is not yet fully developed and at a time when pancreatic autoimmunity first emerges (Krisher) and so this study may give novel insights into the cause of T1D.

 The Exeter Molecular Genetics Laboratory is a world referral centre (www.

diabetesgenes.

org) for Neonatal Diabetes (NDM).

 Most cases of diabetes diagnosed under 6 months do not have EET1D but have genetic mutations in beta cell genes that lead to impaired insulin production (NDM)(Ellard; De Franco).

 Exeter is able to identify the remaining C within 24 hours of receipt.

 All samples will be appropriately labelled in accordance with the 1998 Data Protection Act.

 Biological samples collected from participants will be transported, stored, accessed and processed in accordance with national legislation relating to the use and storage of human tissue for research purposes.

Participants will have the opportunity to consent to gift samples at the end of the study for future research.

 Results of analyses undertaken by the Exeter Clinical Laboratories will be electronically uploaded directly to the study database and linked to Study IDs.

 Safety, Definitions and Reporting Risks Blood samples will be collected by staff trained in venepuncture.

 Any potential discomfort or side-effects will be equivalent to that experienced in routine clinical care.

 Benefits The C-peptide and autoantibody results may help to confirm a diagnosis of T1D so will be reported back to clinicians responsible for the patient's diabetes care.

 Decisions about ongoing clinical care and treatment will be made externally to the research study but treatment will be recorded.

 Adverse effects Should any unforeseen adverse events arise that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to a study procedure, they will be reported to the Sponsor and CI/central coordinating team within 24 hours of the CI or PI or co-investigators becoming aware of the event.

 Confidentiality All information related to study participants will be kept confidential and managed in accordance with the Data Protection Act, NHS Caldicott Guardian, The Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care and Research Ethics Committee Approval.

 Participant data will be held in a link-anonymised format, with personal identifiable data only accessible to personnel with training in data protection who require this information to perform their study role.

 Record Retention and Archiving When the research study is complete, it is a requirement of the Research Governance Framework and Sponsor Trust Policy that the records are kept for a further 15 years.

 Local investigator site files must be archived at the external site according to local R&D requirements.

 They will not be stored at the coordinating centre's archiving facility.

 Statistical Considerations Sample Size Total recruitment target is 240: Study 1: 100 with EET1D plus 100 controls (N=200); Study 2: 20 EET1D plus 20 controls (N=40) Feasibility: The sample size has been selected to assess feasibility rather than on the basis of statistical power.

 In reality with these extremely rare but potentially very interesting patients, every single patient recruited could contribute on their own to a novel discovery.

 The immune, beta cell or autoantibody differences the study may reveal are unknown but a group of 20 v 20 gives an 80% power (alpha 0.

05) to detect a difference of 10% v 50% in a proportion between the two groups and a power of 85% (alpha 0.

05) to detect a 1 SD difference in a continuous variable.

 Statistical analysis: The EET1D as described are unique and findings in the various studies are difficult to predict given the novel nature of this study.

 The study using 100 EET1D v 100 controls gives a 90% power (alpha 0.

05) to detect a difference in proportions of a binary variable of 50% v 30% and a 0.

6SD difference in a continuous variable, and similarly a group of 20 v 20 gives an 80% power (alpha 0.

05) to detect a difference of 10% v 50% in the two groups and a power of 85% (alpha 0.

05) to detect a 1 SD difference in a continuous variable.

 Monitoring of this study will ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice.

 The Investigators will permit monitoring, audits, REC review, and regulatory inspections by providing the Sponsor(s), Regulators and REC direct access to source data and other documents.

 No financial and other competing interests to disclose for the Chief Investigator, PIs at each site and committee members for the overall study management.

 NHS Indemnity will apply to UK participants and UK public liability insurance is provided by the University of Exeter.

 Accidental protocol deviations can happen at any time and must be adequately documented and reported to the Chief Investigator and Sponsor immediately.

 Access to the final study dataset The Exeter study team will have access to the final dataset.

 Of the multiple analyses done during the study, relevant co-investigators for each analysis (e.

g.

 RNAseq for Cate Speake) will have access to the datasets they have contributed to.

 Public and Patient Involvement The CI's direct contact with patients with a diagnosis of diabetes in the first 12 months of life led to the study design.

 Patients, relatives and clinicians agree there would be significant benefit to knowing why and how T1D can present so young and whether understanding this could help with treatment or prevention.

 This work is funded by a patient-focused charity, Diabetes UK.

 Publication Policy On completion of the study, the data will be analysed and a Final Study Report will be prepared and submitted to the Funder, Sponsor and REC.

 Results will be written up and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal(s).

 Abstracts will be submitted to national and international conferences.

 Written information in the form of a letter/newsletter outlining the key findings of the study will be posted on the study website.

 - The University of Exeter owns the data arising from the study.

 - There are no time limits or review requirements on the publications.

 - The Funder will be acknowledged within publications but does not have review or publication rights.

 - After the Final Study Report has been compiled, participants may specifically request results from their PI.

 EXtremely Early-onset Type 1 Diabetes EXtremely Early-onset Type 1 Diabetes (A Musketeers' Memorandum Study)@highlight

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas by the body's own immune system (autoimmunity).

 We do not fully understand what causes this type of diabetes and why there is variation in age of onset and severity between people who develop the disease.

 The aim of this work is to study very unusual people who develop T1D extremely young, as babies under 1 year of age.

 We think that, for the condition to have developed that early, they must have an unusual or extreme form of autoimmunity.

 Studying people with very early-onset diabetes will enable us to look at exactly what goes wrong with the immune system because they have one of the most extreme forms of the disease.

 We may be able to learn a lot about the disease from a small number of rare individuals.

 We aim to confirm that they have autoimmune type 1 diabetes and then try to understand how it is possible that they have developed diabetes so young by studying their immune system genes, the function of their immune system, and environmental factors (such as maternal genetics) that may play a role in their development of the disease.

 People with diabetes diagnosed under 12 months are very rare and they live all over the world.

 We will take advantage of the fact that they are usually referred to Exeter for genetic testing.

 As part of their wider clinical team, we will contact them via their clinician to ask for more information about their diabetes and their family history.

 We will collect samples to study whether they still make any of their own insulin and whether they make specific antibodies against their beta cells in the pancreas.

 Separately, we will study their immune system in depth using immune cells isolated from a blood sample.

 We will then study these cells using cutting edge techniques by Dr Tim Tree at King's College London, by Professor Bart Roep at the Diabetes Metabolism Research Institute Faculty, City of Hope National Medical Center, California (USA), and Dr Cate Speake, Benaroya Reseach Institute, Seattle (USA).

 Some of these tests have never been used in people of young ages around the world, so an aim of this project will be to develop methods that can be used to study people even if they live far away.
