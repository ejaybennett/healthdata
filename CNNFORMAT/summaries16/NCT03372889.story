(fifthQuint)On-Q Catheter Caregiver Education.

 The present study aims to compare the efficacy and caregiver satisfaction between two modes of patient education materials (PEMs): media based and print based.

 The PEMs are designed to education caregivers on how to manage their child's On-Q catheter pain block at home.

 After caregivers have enrolled in the study and have been randomized to an education group, study interventions take place in the private family waiting room.

 Immediately after viewing their assigned PEM, the caregiver completes a 10 question standardized assessment, formatted as a multiple-choice quiz, of their understanding and knowledge of the information conveyed in both modes of PEM.

 The following day, caregivers are contacted by phone call to answer a number of questions to assess their satisfaction with the PEMs they received, the mode of PEM they preferred, and how comfortable they felt managing their child's pain pump at home.

 All information is stored in a secure database (REDCap).

 On-Q Catheter Caregiver Education@highlight

The present study aims to compare caregiver satisfaction and efficacy between two modes of patient education materials (PEMs): media based and print based.

 The caregivers of patient's who undergo ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) reconstruction surgery and receive an On-Q Catheter pain block receive both a hand-out (print based PEM) and watch a short video (media-based PEM) describing how to care for their child's On-Q Catheter at home.

 Upon enrollment into the study, caregivers are randomly assigned to either first view the hand-out or the video, then complete a 10 questions standardized assessment of information that was presented in the PEMs.

 Caregivers are called the next day to assess caregiver satisfaction with the PEMs, which mode of PEM was more helpful to them, and how comfortable they felt managing their child's pain pump at home.
