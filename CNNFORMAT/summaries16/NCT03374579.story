(secondQuint)co2 Gap and co2/o2 Ratio in Liver Transplant Patients.

 use of carbon dioxide gap and arterio venous oxygen content to trace the effect of preload challenge by giving via a specific venous line , first 150 ml is infused over one minute, after stroke volume at one minute measure the remaining 350 ml is infused over 14 minutes at constant rate , the fluid challenge performed with albumin 5% , fluid responsiveness is an increase in stroke volume by 15% after infusion of 500ml albumin 5%.

 Objectives is to investigate the ability of VA-co2 gap and gap/ ratio to predict the hemodynamic response to mini fluid challenge, and to compare the validity of VA-co2 gap and gap/ratio with svo2 for prediction of fluid responsiveness.

 co2 Gap and co2/o2 Ratio in Liver Transplant Patients@highlight

finding surrogate to co to trace the effect of preload challenge would make the test more applicable without the need of advanced hemodynamic monitors,suggested that co2 gap can be used to detect FR after mini fluid challenge and fluid bolts .
