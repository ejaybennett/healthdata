(thirdQuint)Effect of Apical Negative Pressure Irrigation System at Cleaning Lateral Canals and Reduction of Periapical Lesions After Endodontic Therapy.

 This is a single center, prospective clinical study conducted in patients who present for routine endodontic therapy.

 The study has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (Ethics Committee) Aspire IRB located at Santee, CA.

 The clinical investigator will treat patients who present with radiographic evidence of periapical pathology and will randomize the subjects to either negative pressure irrigation system treatment (EndoVac Pure) with ultrasonic irrigation or negative pressure irrigation system treatment (Endovac Pure) without ultrasonic irrigation.

 All other aspects of the treatment (access, instrumentation and obturation will be according to clinicians conventional clinical judgment.

 Subjects will have a pre-treatment PA x-ray and CBCT scan before treatment, a PA x-ray at six months and a CBCT scan at one year post-treatment.

The aim of the present study is to assess with PA x-rays and CBCT scans the volumetric changes in periapical radiolucencies in endodontically treated teeth 1 year after endodontic treatment and evaluate how well the lateral canals are filled after irrigation with the new generation of negative irrigation pressure unit with and without the ultrasonic irrigation.
