(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Reporting of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Associated Cardio-vascular Adverse Reactions.

 ICIs have dramatically improved clinical outcomes in multiple cancer types and are increasingly being tested in earlier disease settings and used in combination.

 However, irAEs can occur.

 Here the investigators use VigiBase (http://www.

vigiaccess.

org/), the World Health Organization (WHO) database of individual safety case reports, to identify cases of cardiovascular adverse drug reaction following treatment with ICIs.

 Evaluation of Reporting of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Associated Cardio-vascular Adverse Reactions@highlight

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) might have high grade immune-related adverse events (irAEs) on the cardio-vascular system.

 This study investigates reports of cardio-vascular toxicity with treatment including anti-PD1, Anti-PDL-1, and Anti CTLA4 classes using the World Health Organization (WHO) database VigiBase.
