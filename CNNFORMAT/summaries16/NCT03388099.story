(secondQuint)Impact of Gonadotrophin REceptor Polimorphisms on the Relationship Between Serum AMH and Ovarian Response.

 Serum AMH has shown to have a high predictive capability of the ovarian response to stimulation for IVF.

 On the other hand, patients who are carriers of polymorphisms in the FSH and LH receptors, have shown to need higher doses of gonadotrophins for ovarian stimulation.

 The proportion of carriers has been described to be around 20% of the population.

 Nevertheless, the determination of these polymorphisms is not performed in routine practice.

 It is unknown if their presence affects to the relationship between serum AMH levels and ovarian response.

 This is a prospective, single center, non-interventional, cohorts study.

 Impact of Gonadotrophin REceptor Polimorphisms on the Relationship Between Serum AMH and Ovarian Response@highlight

Aim of study: To compare the relationship between serum AMH and ovarian response for IVF with the GnRH antagonist protocol in patients who are carriers of FSH and/or LH receptor polymorphisms with those that are not.
