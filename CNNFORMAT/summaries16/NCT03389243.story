(fifthQuint)Paracetamol and Metamizole With SPI-guided Anaesthesia for VRS.

 Monitoring depth of anaesthesia using spectral entropy (SE) and quality of neuromuscular block are routine in modern anaesthesia, whereas monitoring of analgesia still requires further studies.

 Recently, the Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) was added as a surrogate variable showing the nociception-antinociception balance into abovementioned parameters constituting a novel approach in monitoring patients intraoperatively, known as adequacy of anaesthesia (AoA) or tailor-made anaesthesia.

 Different options of preemptive analgesia are used to decrease the postoperative pain perception as well as diminish the rate of PONV by deceasing intraoperative consumption of intravenous narcotic analgesics.

 Paracetamol and Metamizole With SPI-guided Anaesthesia for VRS@highlight

The aim of this randomized trial is to assess the efficacy of preemptive analgesia using paracetamol or metamizole or both of them under SPI-guided anaesthesia for vitreoretinal surgery (VRS), presence of PONV (postoperative nausea and vomiting) and oculocardiac reflex (OCR) and compare Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) with Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) for monitoring pain perception postoperatively.

 Patients will receive general anaesthesia combined with either preemptive analgesia using preemptive intravenous infusion of 1,0 g of metamizol or preemptive intravenous infusion of 1,0 g of acetaminophen or both of them together.
