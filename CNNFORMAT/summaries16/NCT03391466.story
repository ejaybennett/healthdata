(secondQuint)A Study Evaluating the Efficacy of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Compared to Standard of Care Therapy in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma.

 This is a phase 3 randomized, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel versus standard of care therapy in subjects with relapsed/refractory DLBCL.

 Adult subjects with relapsed/refractory DLBCL after first-line rituximab and anthracycline-based chemotherapy will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive axicabtagene ciloleucel or standard of care second-line therapy.

 Standard of care will consist of a protocol-defined, platinum-based salvage combination chemotherapy regimen followed by high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant in those who respond to salvage chemotherapy.
