(thirdQuint)Predictors of Sepsis in Ex-Preterm Infants.

 Preterm infants have increased numbers of viral infections in childhood.

 They are also more likely to die from infection during the neonatal and infant periods than infants born at term.

 While studies have demonstrated that premature infants have decreased adaptive and innate immune responses compared with infants born at term, there has been little investigation into whether this impaired immunity improves and becomes similar to full term infants once the ex-preterm infants reach term-corrected gestational age.

 There have likewise not been studies to determine whether specific immune markers may predict the risk of developing sepsis.

 Given the immaturity of the preterm immune system and the many potential infectious and inflammatory insults they are exposed to during the preterm period (infections, poor nutrition, stress, steroid therapy), there is also a possibility that the relative immune deficiency experienced by preterm infants may persist into infancy.

 The goal of this study is to determine whether former preterm infants have sustained differences in immunity compared to age-matched controls, which would have significant implications for infection risk and response to vaccination.

 Additionally, this study hopes to examine whether certain immune system abnormalities make certain babies more likely to have a serious infection.

 The present study will assess composition and function of T and B cell compartments in preterm and former preterm infants.

 Nutritional status will be measured and stool samples will be obtained to analyze the composition of the microbiome.

The aims of this study are to: - Assess whether ex-preterm infants have a persistently immature immune system, which may decrease their ability to respond to infections, when they reach term-corrected gestational age.

 - Examine whether clinical history, nutrition status, and microbiome composition are linked to the immune composition of term and ex-preterm infants and whether these variables can be used to predict the risk of developing sepsis.
