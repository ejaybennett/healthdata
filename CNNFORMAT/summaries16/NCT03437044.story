(fifthQuint)Low Maintenance Dose Ticagrelor Versus Clopidogrel in Diabetes Patients Undergoing PCI.

 Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are characterized by platelet hyperreactivity and reduced pharmacodynamic (PD) effects to several oral antiplatelet agents, including clopidogrel.

 In addition to the hyperreactive platelet phenotype, impaired drug metabolism as well as increased platelet turnover rates may contributed to impaired clopidogrel-induced antiplatelet effects in DM patients.

 These observations may contribute to the higher ischemic event rates, including stent thrombosis, observed in DM patients compared with non-DM patients treated with clopidogrel.

 Ticagrelor is characterized by more prompt, potent and predictable antiplatelet effects compared with clopidogrel and lower ischemic events in patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) on a background of aspirin therapy.

 In patients who experienced a prior (1-3 years) myocardial infarction (MI), compared with placebo, ticagrelor 60 mg bid on a background of aspirin therapy also reduced long-term ischemic events, with a mortality benefit observed in DM patients.

 To date the PD effects of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in DM largely derive from post-hoc assessments or in stabilized patients (e.

g.

 >30 days after PCI), and have not been prospectively evaluated in the context of elective PCI procedures.

 Moreover, PD studies with the ticagrelor 60 mg bid regimen are limited.

 Therefore, the aim of this investigation will be to compare the PD effects of a ticagrelor 60 mg bid versus clopidogrel 75 mg od MD regimen in DM patients without a prior major CV event undergoing elective PCI.

 Low Maintenance Dose Ticagrelor Versus Clopidogrel in Diabetes Patients Undergoing PCI@highlight

To date there is very little PD and pharmacokinetic (PK) data on the ticagrelor 60 mg bid dosing regimen.

 In particular, there is no prospective PK/PD study on this dosing regimen in patients with DM who are known to have impaired response to clopidogrel therapy.

 Since DM patients frequently require elective PCI due to chronic progression of CAD (and not solely because of an acute thrombotic complication), and clopidogrel remains the guideline recommended P2Y12 inhibiting therapy for these patients, understanding the PD effects of the ticagrelor 60 mg bid regimen in this setting is an unmet clinical need.

 This is also in light of the ongoing THEMIS trial which is specifically evaluating the impact of the ticagrelor 60 mg bid dosing regimen in type 2 DM patients without a prior major CV event.
