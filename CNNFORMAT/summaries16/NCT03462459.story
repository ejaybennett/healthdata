(thirdQuint)Efficacy of Oral Vancomycin Prophylaxis for Prevention of Recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection.

 Many patients who have a CDI experience recurrent or relapsing symptoms.

 The investigators are studying whether vancomycin in low doses will help prevent further CDI episodes and how this therapy impacts patients' gastrointestinal microbiome and composition.

 Patients with a history of past CDI who are receiving antibiotics for a non-CDI condition will be invited to participate.

 Approximately half of the participants will receive a low-dose capsule of vancomycin and half will receive a placebo.

 Participants will continue taking the vancomycin/placebo for 5 days after their prescribed antibiotics end.

 Participants will be randomized to receive either placebo or oral vancomycin in addition to their prescribed antibiotic therapy.
