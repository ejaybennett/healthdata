(secondQuint)Quad Resection (Hot Snare vs Cold Snare vs Hot EMR vs Cold EMR).

 The optimal method for removal of polyps 6-9 and 10-15 mm in size is not established.

 In this study, we propose to evaluate four different treatments for polyps (sized 6mm-15mm).

 The four treatments are cold snaring without injection, hot snaring without injection, cold EMR, and hot EMR.

 This study aims to help to establish the optimal resection technique for 6-9 and 10-15 mm polyps.

 Quad Resection (Hot Snare vs Cold Snare vs Hot EMR vs Cold EMR)@highlight

The study will compare the use of cold snare, hot snare, cold EMR, and hot EMR for polyp resection.

 Although previous studies have compared two of the potential resection methods, no previous study has evaluated all four of the resection methods.
