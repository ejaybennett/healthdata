(secondQuint)Role of Interferon- and Vaccine Response.

 The research project deals with one of the most important virological preventive measures after stem cell transplantation: vaccination against influenza viruses.

 Patients with allogeneic stem cell transplantation may experience serious complications of influenza and are at higher risk for inadequate response to the vaccine.

 The research project will make it possible, in a translational-medical orientation, to investigate the exact influence of genetic polymorphisms of the Interferon (IFN)- signalling cascade on the immune response after vaccination.

 This knowledge will make it possible to identify high-risk patients for a poor vaccination response before vaccination and to personalize the current vaccination strategy (intra-muscular injection), e.

g.

 by subcutaneous vaccination, repeated administration of the vaccine or vaccine with adjuvants.

 Role of Interferon- and Vaccine Response@highlight

The following observational study will investigate whether the vaccine response (antibodies, T and B cells) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation is influenced by genetic polymorphisms in the interferon lambda signal.
