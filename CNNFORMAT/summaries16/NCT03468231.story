(secondQuint)HAIC of FOLFOX vs.

 HAIC of OXA for Advanced HCC.

 Sorafenib is the most widely used palliative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal venous tumor thrombus (PVTT).

 Our previous prospective study revealed that sorafenib combined with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil/leucovorin confer a survival benefit to HCC with major PVTT.

 However, HAIC of fluorouracil is not such for advanced HCC.

 Whether HAIC of oxaliplatin is as effective as HAIC of oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil/leucovorin is controversial.

 Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective randomized control study to find out it.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil/leucovorin compared with HAIC of oxaliplatin alone in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with major portal venous tumor thrombus (PVTT).
