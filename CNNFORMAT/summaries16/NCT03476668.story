(firstQuint)Relationship Between Dopaminergic Asymmetric Degeneration and Attentional Resources in Parkinson's Disease.

.

 To bypass the impaired habitual motor-behavioural control, Parkinson's disease (PD) patients may exploit the network of goal-directed mode of action.

 The frontostriatal connections underline this functioning, that is based on attention.

 Since the cognitive processes are related with dopamine, the asymmetrical degeneration of the dopaminergic system affects differently the right side affected (RPD) and the left side affected (LPD) PD patients.

 The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between the asymmetric dopaminergic degeneration and the attentional resources in a group of patients with PD.
