(thirdQuint)Low-Cost Tool for Compliance and Treatment-Tracking of Low Back Pain Patients.

 Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to develop and deploy a low-cost measurement system which tracks exercise compliance and enables remote health coaching for patients with low back pain.

 The system will consist of a series of small motion sensors built into a custom designed harness which connect wirelessly tot he user's tablet or smartphone.

 A software application will guide the patient through the exercise routine while the sensor system monitors their motion, classifies exercise completion, and tracks their progress through the protocol.

 The results of the routine will be securely uploaded to caregivers where they can monitor progress, modify the patient's exercise prescription, and offer encouragement and coaching to continue the therapy.

 This research program aims to enable the long term treatment-tracking of patients with chronic low back pain.

The purpose of the study is to develop, design and implement an easy-to-use, cloud-enabled software for patients with low back pain and evaluate the effect of the system on compliance and quality of life.

 We hypothesize that a device which measures compliance to physical therapy regimens in patients with low back pain will increase patient participation.
