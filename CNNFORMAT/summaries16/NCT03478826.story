(firstQuint)Creation of a Longitudinal Biospecimen Repository From Patients With Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILD).

 The proposed biospecimen repository would be derived from patients diagnosed with ILD.

 This is to include 500 patients in the repository, with each patient contributing approximately 5 longitudinal blood and urine samples.

 The longitudinal blood and urine samples participation will be optional.

 Depending on the patient's disease activity, which determines the frequency of clinical visits, serial blood and urine samples will be collected from individual patients on a quarterly to annual basis.

 In addition, the researchers would also like to keep any leftover lung tissue from any clinical procedures that are performed.

 Tissue will be used for future research and may be stored indefinitely.

 The residual tissue collection will be optional.
