(secondQuint)Cortical Dynamics of Inhibitory Control: A Concurrent tDCS-MEG Study.

 Concurrent tDCS-MEG parallel arms single-blinded experimental design (right anodal v sham tDCS) will be employed in this study.

 The study will be conducted at the University of Nottingham, using a sample of student volunteers.

 This study aims to examine the influence of anodal tDCS on beta-band and alpha-band oscillatory activities, using an anti-saccade task administered before, during and after tDCS stimulation.

 It can potentially help understand the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning rapid response impulsivity and how these can be influenced by tDCS.

 The research hypotheses are that (i) a generalised mechanism for top-down inhibitory control will play a vital role, whereby prefrontal beta-band activity initiates alpha-band activity for functional inhibition over the frontal eye fields and other areas in the neurocircuitry involved in RRI; (ii) anodal tDCS (as opposed to sham) delivered over the right DLPFC will enhance this mechanism; and (iii) there will be no significant correlations between measures of self-report impulsivity and performance on the anti-saccade task and measures of oscillatory activity.

This study aims to use concurrent Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) with measures of impulsivity to examine the neurobiological underpinnings of rapid response impulsivity (RRI) and how these can be modified using tDCS in healthy subjects.
