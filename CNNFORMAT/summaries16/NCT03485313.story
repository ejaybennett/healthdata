(secondQuint)Beta-hCG Test Reference Range Determination.

 Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the placenta shortly after implantation of a fertilized ovum into the uterine wall and the rapid rise of blood hCG concentration after conception makes it an excellent marker for confirmation and monitoring of early pregnancy.

 As such, levels in the blood of non-pregnant premenopausal individuals are low, typically -hCG test, a 95th percentile of a healthy, non-pregnant, adult female reference population [upper reference limit (URL)] shall be determined in this study.

 Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and give informed consent will be enrolled in this study.

 Because hCG levels in blood increase with age, the study population will be divided into two age groups: 18 to 40 years and >40 years, with approximately 125 subjects per group.

 One EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) blood sample will be collected from each subject via standard venipuncture.

 The maximum trial duration for each subject will be one visit/blood draw.
