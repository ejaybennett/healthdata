(secondQuint)A Novel Transition Program to Reduce Disability After Stroke.

 A gap in care exists at the point of transition from inpatient rehabilitation (IR) to home, when survivors encounter new environmental barriers due to the cognitive and sensorimotor sequelae of stroke.

 Resolving these barriers and improving independence in the community have potential to significantly improve stroke survivors' long-term morbidity.

 The proposed study investigates the efficacy and safety of a novel enhanced rehabilitation-transition program to reduce environmental barriers and improve daily activity performance and community participation.
