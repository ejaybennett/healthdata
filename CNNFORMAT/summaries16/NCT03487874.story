(thirdQuint)Efficacy of the C8 Nerve Root Block During Interscalene Block for Anesthesia of the Posterior Aspect of the Shoulder.

 By blocking only the 5th to 7th cervical nerve blocks, conventional interscalene brachial plexus block spares the 8th cervical and 1st thoracic dermatomes which innervate the posterior aspect of the shoulder.

 To visualize the shoulder joint space during shoulder arthroscopic surgery, the introduction of a posterior portal is essential.

 However, conventional interscalene brachial plexus block cannot effectively relieve the pain caused by its insertion due to sparing of the 8th cervical and 1st thoracic dermatomes.

 The addition of the 8th cervical nerve root block to conventional interscalene brachial plexus block decreases pain intensity upon the introduction of a posterior portal.

 Efficacy of the C8 Nerve Root Block During Interscalene Block for Anesthesia of the Posterior Aspect of the Shoulder@highlight

This study evaluates the effects of selective 8th cervical nerve root block during interscalene brachial plexus block on the relief of pain intensity upon the introduction of a posterior portal during arthroscopic shoulder surgery.

 The 5th to 7th cervical nerve roots will be blocked in half of participants, while the 5th to 8th cervical nerve roots will be blocked in the other half.
