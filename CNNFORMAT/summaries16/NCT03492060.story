(fifthQuint)A Natural History Study of HNRNPH2-related Disorders.

 Neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of disorders in which the development of the central nervous system is disturbed.

 The genetic basis for many neurodevelopmental disorders has continued to expand and a recent gene called HNRNPH2 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein H2 (HNRNPH2)) is one such gene that is associate with a common neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism and autistic features, and tone abnormalities.

 The investigators would like to examine patterns of initial presentation, patterns in neurological evaluations, neurological testing including brain MRI and electroencephalography and outcomes individuals with a variant in the HNRNPH2 gene.

 This is non-interventional study that examines both data previously used in clinical practice and prospective data collection in the form of questionnaires and assessments.

 By analyzing such data, the investigators hope to gain insight into outcomes and patterns of neurological development.

The purpose of this study is to analyze patterns in individuals with HNRNPH2 genetic variants, including their neurological comorbidities, other medical problems and any treatment.

 We will maintain an ongoing database of medical data that is otherwise being collected for routine medical care.

 We will also collect data prospectively in the form of questionnaires, neuropsychological, and motor assessments to examine the landscape of deleterious variants in this gene.
