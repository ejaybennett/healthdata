(fifthQuint)Microbiome and Endometrial Receptivity in Obese Infertile Women.

 The main objective of our study is to compare the composition of the endometrial microbiota between patients with normal weight and patients with obesity.

 A.

 Secondary Objectives/research questions - To analyze the composition of the digestive microbiota through samples of saliva and feces in infertile patients with normal weight and obesity.

 - To assess whether there is a relationship between the body mass index (normal weight, obesity Class I, Class II, Class III) and the main bacterial species detected in endometrial fluid samples from infertile patients.

 - To evaluate the influence of the digestive microbiota on the composition of the endometrial microbiota according to the body mass index in infertile patients.

 - To evaluate if there is an influence of the endometrial microbiota on the results of endometrial receptivity analyzed with the non-invasive Endometrial Receptivity Array test (niERA).

 Microbiome and Endometrial Receptivity in Obese Infertile Women@highlight

The objective of this project is the identification and quantification of the main bacterial communities present in the endometrial microbiota in obese infertile patients, to assess if there is an alteration of their composition dependent on the body mass index, and if such alteration it could influence the reduction of endometrial receptivity, demonstrated in obese women.

 If obese patients have an altered digestive microbiota and, at the same time, a lower endometrial receptivity, the investigator want to assess whether such reduction in receptivity may depend on an alteration in the endometrial microbiota, which in non-obese infertile patients has been shown to negatively influence the reproductive results
