(thirdQuint)Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Patients With R/R PTCL Treated With Gemcitabine.

 Currently, there is no standard treatment for patients with recurrent or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma who relapse after a first line of cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, oncovin, and prednisone (CHOP) treatment.

 Chemotherapies such as gemcitabine are used as monotherapy but the results alone are insufficient.

 In addition, there is no approved monotherapy in the European Union, with the exception of brentuximab vedotin in refractory or recurrent large systemic anaplastic lymphomas.

 Stem cell transplantation may be an option for patients who respond to a second line of treatment or a subsequent line of treatment, but conditions for being eligible for transplantation, including long-term remission, are infrequent.

 Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is a targeted treatment directed against a protein, cluster of differentiation antigen 30 (CD30), present on the surface of lymphoma cells.

 It allows chemotherapy to enter directly into the lymphoma cell.

 The CD30 protein is variably expressed in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell lymphoma; about 50% of patients have significant expression.

 Data from clinical studies with brentuximab vedotin suggest that the addition of this treatment to gemcitabine may be more successful than gemcitabine alone.

 The main hypothesis is a 15% increase in responder patients after 4 cycles of treatment with brentuximab vedotin and gemcitabine.

 The main objective of the study is therefore to determine the overall response rate after 4 cycles of treatment according to the criteria of Lugano 2014 (response based on CT-scan).

 The secondary objectives will focus on the efficacy of brentuximab vedotin: complete response rate, response time for responder patients, time to failure of treatment, time to next treatment and overall survival, efficacy of brentuximab vedotin maintenance: survival progression-free, response time, overall survival, overall response rate based on positron emission tomography (PET)-scan and brentuximab vedotin toxicity in patients treated with gemcitabine and in maintenance therapy.

 The duration of the study is estimated to be 4.

5 years including follow-up with an estimated recruitment period of 1.

5 years.

 70 patients will be enrolled.

 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Patients With R/R PTCL Treated With Gemcitabine@highlight

This study is an open label, multicenter phase 2 study.

 The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in patients treated by gemcitabine for relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma in term of overall response rate assessed after 4 cycles of treatment according to the international response criteria for malignant lymphoma (Lugano Classification 2014 - CT-Based Response).
