(thirdQuint)Effect of Evolocumab on Coronary Endothelial Function.

 To evaluate the effect of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab on coronary and systemic endothelial function, systemic biomarkers of endothelial function and of inflammation, and echocardiographic measures of left ventricular diastolic and systolic properties in subjects who are HIV+.

 Potential participants will be asked to undergo a screening MRI exam.

 Those who have evidence of coronary endothelial dysfunction on the MRI exam will receive evolocumab 420 mg sq (the dose that is approved for treatment of hypercholesterolemia) following the screening exam and again at one month.

 Repeat MRI and ultrasound measures of coronary and systemic endothelial function, as well as serum markers of endothelial function and inflammation, and echocardiographic measures of diastolic and systolic left ventricular function will be obtained at one and six weeks following the first administration of evolocumab.

 The investigators will test the hypotheses that PCSK9 inhibition improves endothelial function measured non-invasively on MRI and systemic markers of inflammation at one week (+/- 3 days) and six weeks after initiation of the PCSK9 antibody.

 Effect of Evolocumab on Coronary Endothelial Function@highlight

The investigators propose a pilot study using (1) MRI to assess coronary artery endothelial function, (2) brachial ultrasound to assess systemic endothelial function, (3) serum markers of inflammation and of endothelial cell function and (4) echocardiographic measures of left ventricular diastolic and systolic properties, before and following initiation of PCSK9 antibody in HIV positive subjects.
