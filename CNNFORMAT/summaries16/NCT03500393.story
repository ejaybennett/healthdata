(secondQuint)A Remotely Supervised Exercise Program for Lung Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemoradiation (REM).

 The research team adopts an overtly pragmatic approach where our design choices are made to enhance external validity and create a parsimonious intervention that can be integrated into busy clinical practices.

 This is a pilot study and is not designed to definitively provide evidence for a treatment effect, but rather to establish feasibility and to optimize the intervention and study procedures in preparation for a larger trial.

 We will conduct a pilot RCT comparing a remotely supervised exercise program (REM) to an unsupervised exercise program (UNSUP).

 Data will be collected upon enrollment (T0; at least 2 weeks prior to beginning chemoradiation), immediately prior to chemoradiation (T1), immediately post-chemoradiation (T2) and 1-month post-chemoradiation (T3).

 A Remotely Supervised Exercise Program for Lung Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemoradiation (REM)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a remotely supervised exercise program (REM) in promoting adherence to an exercise prescription before and during chemoradiation.
