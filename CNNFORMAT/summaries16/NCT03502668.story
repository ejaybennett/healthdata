(fifthQuint)Phase 1-2 Study of Low Dose ASTX727 (ASTX727 LD) in Lower Risk MDS.

 A Phase 1-2, multicenter, open-label study of various ASTX727 LD doses and schedules to assess the safety, pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and hematologic response in subjects with IPSS risk category of low-risk or Intermediate-1 MDS.

 The study will be conducted in 2 phases: Phase 1 Stages A and B, and Phase 2.

 Randomization will be stratified by diagnostic category (low-risk vs Intermediate-1 based on IPSS), baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (10^9/L vs >10^9/L), and ECOG Performance Score (0-1 vs 2).

 Phase 1: In Stage A, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 cohorts of 6 subjects each in a 10-day schedule in 28-day cycles.

 When safety has been established in Phase 1 Stage A, Phase 1 Stage B will open, wherein additional subjects (n=24 evaluable) will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio into 4 cohorts of 6 subjects each in a 14-day schedule in 28-day cycles.

 Dose Levels by Cohort (Dailyx5, Offx2, Dailyx5): - 1: 5 mg decitabine, 100 mg cedazuridine - 2: 10 mg decitabine, 100 mg cedazuridine - 3: 15 mg decitabine, 100 mg cedazuridine Phase 2: Using 2 doses/schedules selected from Phase 1, 40 additional subjects per dose/schedule will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio.

 The selected doses/schedules will be evaluated for safety (drug-related AEs), efficacy (including hematologic response), PD (LINE-1 methylation, and fetal hemoglobin as fraction of total hemoglobin), and PK.

Multicenter, open-label study of various ASTX727 LD doses and schedules to assess safety, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and hematologic response in subjects with IPSS risk category of low-risk or Intermediate-1 MDS.

 In Phase 1 Stage A, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 cohorts of 6 subjects each in a 10-day schedule in 28-day cycles; when safety is established in Stage A, 24 evaluable subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio in Phase 1 Stage B into 4 cohorts of 6 subjects each in a 14-day schedule in 28-day cycles.

 In Phase 2, 40 new subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 2 doses/schedules selected from Phase 1.
