(firstQuint)Comparison of Arthroscopic Supraspinatus Tendon Tear Repair in Patients Over 60 Years With and Without Patch Augmentation.

.

 An arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is nowadays mostly implemented in order to restore function and reduce or eliminate pain.

 The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial is to demonstrate, in patients 60 years or older with a large rotator cuff tear, that biological or synthetic patch augmen-tation in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair results in decreased rate of retear 24 months post-operatively compared to re-pair without patch augmentation.

@highlight

The aim of the study is to show that patch augmentation in rotatorcuff tear results in lower rate of recurrent tendon defects compared without patches.
