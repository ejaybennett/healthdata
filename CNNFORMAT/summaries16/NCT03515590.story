(secondQuint)Emulsion Droplet Physical State on Postprandial Lipemia and Satiety.

 A double blinded randomized cross-over acute meal study will be carried out in which 15 healthy male participants will attend two study visits, separated by at least one week.

 On each study visit, fasted participants will consume either the solid or the liquid emulsion, in a randomized order.

 Both emulsions tested will have the exact same composition only differing in the physical state of the lipid emulsions, in order to isolate the impact of physical state, specifically, on metabolic response.

 Postprandial lipemia and satiety will be measured for 6 hours after consumption of the test beverage.

 The study meals will include crushed acetominophen, the appearance of which will be measured in plasma as a measure of liquid content gastric emptying.

 Participants will be asked to maintain their usual lifestyle habits throughout the study, with some changes in the 48 hour period leading up to each of the two visits.

 Emulsion Droplet Physical State on Postprandial Lipemia and Satiety@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the changes in blood lipids and feelings of satiety after consumption of oil-in-water emulsions in which the droplets are in either the liquid or solid (i.

e.

 crystalline) states.
