 Study aim is to examine the effect of an online structured support group intervention (SMART Connections) designed to improve retention in HIV care services among youth ages 15-21 years living with HIV enrolled in ART services.

 A randomized control trial in which youth living with HIV (YLHIV) will be allocated to standard of care (control) or standard of care plus an online support group and followed for 12 months.

 Structured questionnaires will be administered to participants at baseline, 6 and 12 months.

 Clinical data will also be extracted on participants.

 In-depth interviews with a subset of participants and intervention implementers will be completed at the end of the intervention period.

 Although participants will be recruited from health facilities, the intervention is conducted "virtually," by trained facilitators, not within the health facilities.
