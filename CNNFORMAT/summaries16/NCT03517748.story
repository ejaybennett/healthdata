(thirdQuint)Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of DM05 Versus Optive on the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Ocular Dryness.

 Evaluation of the non-inferiority of DM05 in comparison with OptiveTM, in terms of cornea and conjunctiva staining (Oxford score), on worse eye, between D0 and D35.

 - Comparison of D35 versus D0 and D84 versus D0 for each product and comparison between products for the following parameters: - Evolution of cornea and conjunctiva staining (Oxford score) on worse eye.

 - Evolution of OSDI score (Ocular Surface Disease Index).

 - Evolution of Van Bijsterveld score (Lissamine green staining) in worse eye.

 - Evolution of Schirmer test result in worse eye.

 - Evolution of Tear film Break-Up Time (TBUT) in worse eye.

 - Evolution of ocular dryness severity by evaluation of each main symptom by the patient and total score of all symptoms - Evaluation of treatment performance by the investigator and the patient.

 - Evaluation of the average frequency of use during 84 days for DM05 and OptiveTM.

 Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of DM05 Versus Optive on the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Ocular Dryness@highlight

This study is a multicentric, comparative, randomized, investigator-blinded, in parallel groups study to demonstrate the non-inferiority of DM05 in comparison with Optive cent , in terms of cornea and conjunctiva staining (Oxford score) on patients with moderate to severe ocular dryness, after 35 days of treatment.
