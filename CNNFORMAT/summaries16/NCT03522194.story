(thirdQuint)Left Ventricular Diastolic Function During Anesthesia Induction.

 In this prospective observational study two cohorts of patients with different anesthesia regimes are investigated.

 Anesthesia is maintained with sevoflurane or propofol.

 Before induction of anesthesia a transthoracic echocardiography is performed to examine systolic and diastolic function.

 Immediately after induction, during maintenance and after completion of anesthesia any changes of diastolic function are examined with transthoracic echocardiography.

 All anesthetic medications, fluids, vasoactive medications and catecholamines are registered.

 Left Ventricular Diastolic Function During Anesthesia Induction@highlight

Diastolic dysfunction is an important cause of hemodynamic instability in the perioperative field.

Therefore this study aims to investigate the influence of existing diastolic dysfunction or deterioration of diastolic function on hemodynamic stability during induction of anesthesia and postoperative complications.

 The impact of different anesthetics on diastolic function is investigated.
