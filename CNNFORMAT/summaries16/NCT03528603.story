(fifthQuint)Acute Assessment of Platelet Reactivity After the Intake of Oleocanthal.

 Fifty adult male volunteers will be asked to participate in one of two study trials that will be randomized double-blind controlled crossover trials with 2 study visits.

 The participants will arrive to the facility after an overnight fast, and will be asked to consume their assigned EVOO either without (trial 1) or with (trial 2) a standardized low-phenolic food (such as rice, pasta or mashed potatoes) with 40 mL of one of 2 EVOOs that are matched for their total phenolic content, but with one oil containing oleocanthal, and one with very low levels of oleocanthal.

 At zero, two, 4 and 6 hours after EVOO intake a blood sample will be collected for the assessment of collagen- ADP-, and AA-induced platelet aggregation, as well as an untargeted metabolomics profile.

 As an assessment of phenotypic stability, a subset of individuals (n=5 per trial) that have exhibit either low or high platelet responses, will be asked to repeat the above study.

 Acute Assessment of Platelet Reactivity After the Intake of Oleocanthal@highlight

The investigators have previously observed a reduced level of platelet aggregation 2 hours after healthy male individuals were asked to drink extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) that provided a higher level of one specific phenolic known as oleocanthal.

 This study will help the investigators further determine the effects of oleocanthal-rich EVOO intake on platelet function at 2, 4 and 6 hours after intake with food compared to platelet function in the morning after an overnight fast.
