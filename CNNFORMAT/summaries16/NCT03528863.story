 Web-based Mindfulness Meditation in Reducing Distress in Participants With Metastatic Gastrointestinal Cancer and Their Caregivers@highlight

This trial studies how well web-based mindfulness meditation works in reducing distress in both participants with gastrointestinal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, and their caregivers.
