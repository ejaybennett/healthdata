(secondQuint)Propofol to Reduce the Incidence of Postanesthetic Emergence Agitation in Pediatric Patients Under General Inhalation Anesthesia.

 Approval from Ethical Committee of Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia was acquired prior conducting the study.

 Subjects were given informed consent before enrolling the study and randomized into two groups; propofol and control.

 Non-invasive blood pressure monitor, electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse-oxymetry, and capnograph were set on the subjects in the operation room.

 Induction and maintenance of anesthesia will use sevoflurane.

 Mechanical ventilation will be given to maintaining end-tidal carbon dioxide 35 to 40 mmHg.

 After surgery, patient will be given intravenously 15mg/kg acetaminophen, 0.

05mg/kg neostigmine, and 0.

02 mg/kg atropine.

 Patient will also be given propofol 0.

5 mg/kg on propofol group while no propofol will be given on control group.

 30 minutes after patient was admitted to post-anesthesia care unit, patient will be evaluated for emergence agitation using Aono scale and Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale.

 The incidence of emergence agitation, hypotension, and desaturation will be treated accordingly.
