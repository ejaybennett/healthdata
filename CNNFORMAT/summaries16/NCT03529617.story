(secondQuint)Pharmacokinetics of Liposomal Amphotericin B in Critically Ill vs.

 Non-critically Ill Hematological Patients: Exploration of Covariates.

 This phase IV, open label, non-randomized, monocenter pharmacokinetic study will be carried out in critically ill and non-critically ill (hematology) patients receiving multiple dose treatment with L-AmB.

 The pharmacokinetic exposure to liposomal amphotericin B in plasma, urine, BAL and ascitic fluid will be compared between the two population groups in an early and late exposure day.

 Correlating covariates will be identified to provide a rationale for optimal dosing strategy in critically ill patients.
