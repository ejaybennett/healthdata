(firstQuint)Ambulatory and Blood Pressure Variability Responses to Exercise in Normotensive and Hypertensive Women.

 The differences in hypotensive and cardioprotective responses of exercise among menopausal hypertensive and normotensive women are still not very clear, mainly the responses of blood pressure variability.

 In this way, were evaluated 6 indices related to the variability of 24 hour ambulatory pressure measurements in these women before and after 12 weeks of combined exercise training.
