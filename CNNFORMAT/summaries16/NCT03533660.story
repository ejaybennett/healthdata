(thirdQuint)Alcohol Biosensor Monitoring for Alcoholic Liver Disease.

 The investigators propose a 3 month randomized controlled trial (RCT) pilot of alcohol biosensor monitoring (ABM)(WrisTAS) for patients with Alcohol Associated Liver Disease (AALD) who intend to stop drinking.

 All participants will wear the ABM device but participants will be randomized to receive either personalized feedback on the data recorded on the device (n=30) or enhanced usual care without feedback on device data (n=30).

 The investigators will determine whether ABM plus feedback improves outcomes for AALD patients compared to enhanced usual care and hypothesize ABM feedback will reduce alcohol consumption, improve motivation and self-efficacy for abstinence and improve engagement in treatment.

 The investigators will also conduct research including qualitative data collected from participants who will provide opinions on ABM feasibility, acceptability, and usability.

 Qualitative methods are especially useful for understanding the perceived needs, barriers, and preferences for monitoring alcohol use and are especially required for future translation of this technology into clinical practice.

 Alcohol Biosensor Monitoring for Alcoholic Liver Disease@highlight

Successful treatment of alcohol associated liver disease (AALD) depends primarily on abstinence from alcohol.

 The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial of alcohol biosensor monitoring for patients with alcohol associated liver disease to determine if monitoring with feedback on alcohol use patterns reduces alcohol consumption and improves outcomes.
