(fifthQuint)Effectiveness of a Structured Intervention to Optimize the Use of Mirabegron.

 A quasi-experimental design with before/after measurement and a control group was used.

 The objective was to identify the effectiveness of a training activity on deprescribing treatments.

 In addition, it was proposed to establish the duration of medication in real clinical practice, and its prevalence of use before and after the intervention.

 Control group: Usual care Intervention: - Initiatives for healthcare professionals: information and training with written material, in an infographic format, distributed to all general practitioners.

 - Initiatives for specialized hospital care: information regarding the intervention for urologists and gynaecologists.

 - Management support with the definition of a structured strategy for all the addresses of the PHC and GPs.

 - Monthly feedback monitoring to general practitioners.

 The intervention consisted of: a) meetings with all the directors of the PHC; b) informative meetings and sessions in the PHC; c) distribution of the infographic to all the GPs; d) lists of patients with treatment provided periodically from the medication area; and e) review of the treatments by the GPs.

 If considered appropriate, and with the consent of the patient, the medication was withdrawn.

 A pharmacist and a clinical pharmacologist acted as consultants in case of any doubts regarding specific patients.
