(fifthQuint)Intratumoral Administration of CCL21-gene Modified Dendritic Cell With Intravenous Pembrolizumab for Advanced NSCLC.

 A phase I, non-randomized, dose escalating, multi-cohort trial followed by dose expansion at the dose established during dose escalation (ExD) will be conducted.

 During dose escalation, a modified 3+3 design will be used.

 Three patients will be assigned to each cohort.

 Patients enrolled into a given cohort will receive the same Ad-CCL21-DC dose by CT-guided or bronchoscopic intratumoral injection followed by intravenous pembrolizumab 200mg one hour after DC injection on days 0, 21, and 42, and intravenous pembrolizumab 200mg every three weeks thereafter for up to a year.

 The Ad-CCL21-DC dose is 1 x 107 cells/injection in the first cohort (1), and will be increased to 3 x 107 cells/injection (2) pending tolerability in earlier cohort.

 Dose escalation may proceed only if all 3 patients enrolled in the lower dose cohort experience no DLT or 1 of 6 patients in a cohort has a DLT.

 If a patient dies within 30 days of receiving investigational treatment and the death is considered to be at least possibly related, further study enrolment will be held until further evaluation by the UCLA DSCMB.

 If the dose regimen in cohort 1 (Ad-CCL21-DC 1 x 107 cells/injection) is not well tolerated, de-escalation to Ad-CCL21-DC 0.

5 x 107 cells/injection will be allowed (-1).

 If the dose regimen specified for Cohort 2 (Ad-CCL21-DC 3 x 107 cells/injection) is not the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), no further dose escalation will be conducted, and this dose level will be defined as maximum administered dose (MAD).

 After completion of the dose-escalation phase, all safety and tolerability data will be reviewed and the ExD will be determined.

 A dose expansion cohort of 24 patients (D) will be enrolled and treated at ExD for up to a year.

 All enrolled patients will continue to be followed by a physician, and undergo a history and physical examination every 3 months until progressive disease (PD) or withdrawal from the study.

 Eligible patients will be assigned to a cohort and will receive intratumoral injections of autologous Ad-CCL21-DC and intravenous pembrolizumab in conjunction with tumor sampling and patient monitoring.

 Intratumoral Administration of CCL21-gene Modified Dendritic Cell With Intravenous Pembrolizumab for Advanced NSCLC@highlight

This is a phase 1 trial of intratumoral administration of CCL21-gene modified dendritic cells combined with intravenous pembrolizumab for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

 Up to 12 patients will participate in the dose escalation phase and during dose expansion, 12 patients will be evaluated.

 Before the first injection of dendritic cells, blood will be collected from the patient and leukapheresis will be performed.

 Dendritic cells obtained from this blood draw will be cultured and induced with Ad-CCL21 gene.

 Then, the patient's lung tumor will be injected with these modified dendritic cells.

 This injection will be followed by treatment with 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab.

 Patients will receive an injection of Ad-CCL21 DC followed by treatment with pembrolizumab on Days 0, 21, and 42.

 After these three injections, patients will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every three weeks for up to one year.

 From enrollment of the first patient to the last dose administered to the last subject, this study is anticipated to take approximately 5 years to complete.
