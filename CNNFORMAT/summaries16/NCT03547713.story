(secondQuint)A Neuropsychological Characterization of Social Feedback Processing in Social Anxiety.

 Social anxiety (SA) disorder is a relatively widespread emotional disorder which is associated with considerable impairment in social, educational, and occupational functioning (Kessler et al.

, 2005).

 This condition is characterized by a debilitating preoccupation with the evaluation of the self by others, ultimately leading to excessive fear and avoidance of interpersonal encounters.

 As opposed to healthy individuals who typically process social feedback in a positively biased manner, Individuals with high levels of SA tend to evaluate the feedback conveyed by others negatively.

 Such biases have a profound contribution to the maintenance of social-related concerns (Clark & Wells, 1995).

 Thus, the overreaching goal of this research is to provide a neuropsychological account of biased processing of social feedback evident in SA.

 To meet this goal, participants varying in their level of SA are asked to deliver a speech and evaluate it before and after receiving social feedback during an fMRI scan.

 Additional structural scans, as well as physiological and psychological measures, are obtained in order to explain individual differences in processing of feedback.

 The long-term goal of this study is to better delineate both neurobiological and psychological models of SA, as well as to help in directing future neuromodulation-based treatments of mood and anxiety disorders.

 A Neuropsychological Characterization of Social Feedback Processing in Social Anxiety@highlight

The purpose of this study is to characterize neuropsychological mechanisms mediating processing of social feedback in people with different levels of social anxiety, by implementing functional and structural MRI.
