(secondQuint)IV Acetaminophen as Adjuvant Analgesic to Hydromorphone - Emergency Department Patients.

 The primary objective of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the analgesic efficacy of IV acetaminophen as an analgesic adjunctive medication to IV hydromorphone for the treatment of acute pain in the ED.

 The secondary objective is to compare the side effect profiles and adverse events associated with the combination of acetaminophen and hydromorphone vs.

 hydromorphone alone.

 The primary outcome is the between group difference in change in NRS pain scores from baseline (immediately before administration of analgesics) to 60 minutes post-baseline.

 The secondary outcome variables are difference in proportion of patients who choose to forego additional pain medication 60 minutes post-baseline when asked the question, "Do you want more pain medication?"; difference in proportion of patients who receive additional pain medication before 60 minutes post-baseline ("rescue" medication) and after 60 minutes.

 The incidence of adverse events and side effects in the two groups will be compared.

 The study will continue until the enrollment target of 162 patients has been achieved.

 Based upon prior research studies, we anticipate that it will take approximately one year to reach our target.

 This is a double-blind, parallel group, randomized clinical trial comparing the analgesic efficacy of the combination of 1000 mg IV acetaminophen and 1 mg IV hydromorphone versus 1 mg IV hydromorphone alone for the treatment of acute pain in the Emergency Department.

 Target participants are adult patients (21 through 64 years of age) presenting to the ED with severe acute pain.

 This study will be conducted in the Emergency Departments on the Moses and Einstein campuses of Montefiore Medical Center.
