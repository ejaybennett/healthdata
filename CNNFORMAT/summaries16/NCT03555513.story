(fifthQuint)The Frequency and Risk Factors of Delayed Graft Function.

 In this multi-center retrospective study, data from 480 transplanted patients had been collected from existing local hospital registries in three countries (Iran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), and Kuwait) with 3 years post transplantation follow-up.

 Data for this study was collected based on routine clinical practice of medical practitioners across the participating countries.

 A case report data collecting form was designed for gathering the data including the recipient and donor's characteristics prior to transplantation, and after transplantation up to three years post transplantation.

 Using binary logistic regression analysis, the potential risk factors for occurrence of DGF in living donor transplantations were tested.

 Graft and patient survival at 1, 2 and 3 years depending on follow-up time was evaluated.

 The Frequency and Risk Factors of Delayed Graft Function@highlight

Delayed graft function (DGF) is an important phenomenon after kidney transplantation with direct and indirect implication on graft survival.

 Although its incidence and risk factors have been studied after cadaveric kidney transplantation cases, only few data is available regarding transplants from living donors.

 The present study was performed to investigate the frequency and risk factors of DGF among living-unrelated kidney transplant recipients among three transplant centers in part of Middle East.
