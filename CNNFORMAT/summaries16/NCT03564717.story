(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Segmented Versus Full Arch Three Dimensionally Printed Transfer Tray for Orthodontic Indirect Bonding.

 Fourteen patients (7 in each group) with mild to moderate crowding, requiring orthodontic treatment with full set of permanent teeth including second molars, will be selected for this study.

 A total of 196 brackets will be used (98 Full Arch Tray and 98 Segment Arch Tray).

 The same bracket type and bonding material will used in both groups.

 The accuracy of bracket transfer will be measured by 3 Shape Ortho planner software (Bracket Placement Module), rate of bond failure by counting number of debonded brackets upon tray removal & chair side time by using digital watch.

 Evaluation of Segmented Versus Full Arch Three Dimensionally Printed Transfer Tray for Orthodontic Indirect Bonding@highlight

This study is conducted to overcome the problems of conventional indirect bonding technique, through investigating accuracy of two novel three dimensionally digitally printed indirect bonding transfer trays (full arch & segmented) in terms of accuracy of transferring brackets, rate of immediate bond failure and chair side time.
