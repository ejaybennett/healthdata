(thirdQuint)Phase II Umbrella Study Directed by Next Generation Sequencing.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of targeted agents or checkpiont inhibitors in advanced stage NSCLC with genomic alteration.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the clinical efficacy of targeted agents or checkpiont inhibitors in advanced stage NSCLC with genomic alteration.

 II.

 To evaluate safty and tolerence of targeted agents or checkpiont inhibitors in advanced stage NSCLC with genomic alteration.

 Phase II Umbrella Study Directed by Next Generation Sequencing@highlight

This phase II, umbrella trial study directed by next generation sequencing (NGS) works in Chinese patients with advanced stage NSCLC who never received any anti-tumor treatment.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of targeted therapies or immunotherapy to NSCLC patients whose tumor harbors a genomic variant known to be a drug target or to predict sensitivity to a drug.
