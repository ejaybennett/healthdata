(thirdQuint)The Clinical Research of Anti-CD20 CAR-T Cells in Patients With Refractory or Relapsed B Lymphocyte Lymphoma.

 The main purpose: To preliminary explore the safety, tolerability and cellular pharmacokinetics of CD20-CART cell agents in the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphomas.

 The Secondary purpose: The following indicators for preliminary observations of CD20-CART cells in the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell malignant lymphoma.

 1.

 The determination of lymph nodes to evaluate the anti-tumor effect caused by the input of CD20-CART cells agents.

 2.

 Assessing the ability of CD20-CART cell agents to inhibit the migration of bone marrow and lymph node tumor foci.

 3.

 Assess the killing ability of CD20-CART cell agents to tumor cells in vitro, for patients whose tumor cells could obtain.

 4.

 Disease control rate (DCR) (=CR (complete disease remission) + PR (partial remission of disease) + SD (stable disease), short-term efficacy assessment); Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (long-term efficacy assessment).

 The Clinical Research of Anti-CD20 CAR-T Cells in Patients With Refractory or Relapsed B Lymphocyte Lymphoma@highlight

The present study is an exploratory study.

 Patients who meeting the enrollment conditions for relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma receive a single intravenous dose of CD20-CART cells.

 The research with the open-label, single arm running control methods in order to initially observe the safety, tolerability, and cellular pharmacokinetics of CD20-CART cell drugs.
