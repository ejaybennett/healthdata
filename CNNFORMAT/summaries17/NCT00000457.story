(thirdQuint)Pharmacologic Relapse Prevention for Alcoholic Smokers.

 The purpose of this trial was to recruit 292 recovering alcoholic smokers (abstinent from alcohol for a minimum of 1 year), who want to stop smoking and provide them with 100% nicotine replacement.

 The 100% nicotine replacement will be undertaken using a nicotine patch.

 By measuring their nicotine levels at study entry we can determine the patch dosing needed.

 The patch dosing will vary from 22 mg to 44 mg.

 Those who are able to achieve tobacco abstinence by week 8 will enter a relapse prevention phase for the remaining 44 weeks.

 In this phase, they will be randomized to active or placebo bupropion (300 mg/day).

 After 44 weeks of the relapse prevention trial (at week 52 of study participation), they will enter a post medication follow up for 6 months.

This study will compare the long-term use of bupropion (Wellbutrin) and placebo for reducing the rate of smoking relapse in recovering alcoholics who achieved initial abstinence from smoking with nicotine patch therapy.

 The study will also determine the cessation rate in the 8th week of treatment among recovering alcoholics using a nicotine patch.

 The patch dose is projected to serve as a 100-percent replacement.
