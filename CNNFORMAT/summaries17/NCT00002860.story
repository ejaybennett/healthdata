(firstQuint)SWOG-9430: Surgery in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Assess overall and progression-free survival in patients with metastatic melanoma (beyond the draining lymph nodes) after complete surgical resection of all known disease.

 - Determine the ability of the Southwest Oncology Group Melanoma Committee to enroll patients with metastatic melanoma who can be resected to a disease-free state.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 All patients undergo gross total resection of all known disease.

 Patients whose disease cannot be completely resected or who have disease recurrence after surgery are removed from study.

 Patients found to have microscopic residual disease after surgery are considered completely resected.

 Resected tissue is submitted for analysis on protocol SWOG-9431.

 Patients may receive any adjuvant therapy (e.

g.

, radiotherapy, interferon, and/or vaccines) deemed clinically appropriate by the treating physician.

 Patients are followed periodically for 5 years after study entry.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 eligible patients with completely surgically resected disease will be accrued for this study.
