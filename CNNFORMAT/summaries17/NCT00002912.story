(thirdQuint)Combination Chemotherapy Plus PSC-833 in Treating Children With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Leukemia.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PSC-833 in combination with mitoxantrone and etoposide in children with refractory or relapsed acute leukemia.

 II.

 Determine the effects of PSC-833 on mitoxantrone and etoposide pharmacokinetics.

 III.

 Quantify MDR1 gene expression and MDR1 P-glycoprotein expression and function in patient-derived leukemia cells.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of PSC-833.

 Patients undergo induction therapy consisting of etoposide IV and mitoxantrone IV on days 1-5.

 Patients then receive PSC-833 IV over 124 hours beginning on day 2.

 A second course is administered no sooner than 21 days from the start of the first course if the marrow is hypocellular after the first course.

 Patients with persistent disease after 2 induction courses are removed from the study.

 Patients receive a total of 3 courses of etoposide/mitoxantrone.

 Patients who achieve complete remission after 1 induction course receive 2 courses of etoposide/mitoxantrone with PSC-833 as consolidation, beginning within 4 weeks of attainment of complete remission.

 Patients who achieve complete remission after 2 induction courses receive 1 course of etoposide/mitoxantrone with PSC-833 as consolidation.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PSC-833 until the maximum tolerated dose is determined.

 Patients are followed every 6 months.

 Combination Chemotherapy Plus PSC-833 in Treating Children With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Leukemia@highlight

Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of PSC-833 plus etoposide and mitoxantrone in treating children who have refractory or relapsed acute leukemia.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Some cancers become resistant to chemotherapy drugs.

 Combining PSC-833 with chemotherapy may reduce resistance to the drug and allow more cancer cells to be killed.
