(fifthQuint)Cisplatin, Interferon Alfa, Surgery, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of neoadjuvant interferon alfa 2b (IFN-A2b) administered with cisplatin in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

 II.

 Determine the MTD of IFN-A2b administered with radiation therapy and cisplatin after surgery in these patients.

 III.

 Determine the response rate and toxicity of induction therapy with IFN-A2b and cisplatin in these patients.

 IV.

 Determine the toxicity of concurrent radiation therapy, cisplatin, and IFN-A2b after surgery in these patients.

 V.

 Determine the local control rate, freedom from progression, median survival, and long term survival of these patients after combined modality therapy.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

 Patients receive induction therapy consisting of cisplatin IV weekly and interferon alfa 2b (IFN-A2b) subcutaneously three times a week for 6 weeks.

 Patients who experience at least 25% tumor shrinkage receive another 4 weeks of therapy.

 Patients then undergo debulking surgery to remove all gross tumor, if possible.

 If this resection is performed, then patients begin radiation therapy 2-6 weeks after surgery.

 Patients with unresectable tumors begin radiation therapy 2-4 weeks after the last course of induction chemotherapy.

 Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

 Concurrently, patients receive cisplatin IV weekly and IFN-A2b subcutaneously three times a week.

 Cohorts of 4 patients each receive escalated doses of IFN-A2b during induction chemotherapy.

 Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IFN-A2b is established, one dose level below this dose is used for the beginning doses of IFN-A2b during adjuvant chemotherapy.

 If no unacceptable toxic effects occur, then the dose of IFN-A2b is escalated to the induction MTD.

 Patients are followed at 3-6 weeks after completing radiochemotherapy, then every 3 months thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.

 Cisplatin, Interferon Alfa, Surgery, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.

 Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.

 Combining chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and interferon alfa may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of cisplatin plus interferon alfa followed by surgery and interferon alfa plus radiation therapy in treating patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.
