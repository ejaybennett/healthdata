(secondQuint)Phase I Study of Ex Vivo Liver-Directed Gene Therapy for Familial Hypercholesterolemia.

 PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Autologous hepatocytes are obtained from a partial hepatectomy and transduced with a recombinant retroviral vector containing the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene.

 The transduced hepatocytes are infused via the inferior mesenteric vein 3 days following surgery.

 Traditional therapy is discontinued for 4 weeks prior to protocol therapy and may resume 6 weeks after the hepatocyte infusion.
