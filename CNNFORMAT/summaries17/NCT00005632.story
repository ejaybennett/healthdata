(secondQuint)Vaccine Therapy Plus QS21 in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine if immunization with glycosylated MUC-1 antigen containing MUC-1 (106) with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate plus immunological adjuvant QS21 induces an antibody, helper T cell and/or cytotoxic T cell response against MUC-1 in patients with prostate cancer expressing MUC-1.

 II.

 Determine post-immunization changes in PSA levels and other objective parameters or disease (radionuclide bone scan and/or measurable disease if present) in these patients after receiving this therapy.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive glycosylated MUC-1 antigen containing MUC-1 (106) with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously (SQ) plus immunological adjuvant QS21 SQ on weeks 1-3, 7, 15, and 27 for a total of 6 vaccinations.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or until documented disease progression.

 Vaccine Therapy Plus QS21 in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

 Combining a vaccine with QS21 may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus immune adjuvant QS21 in treating patients who have prostate cancer.
