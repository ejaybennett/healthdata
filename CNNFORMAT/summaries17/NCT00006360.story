(secondQuint)Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Oropharyngeal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Assess target coverage and major salivary gland sparing in patients with stage II or III oropharyngeal cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy.

 - Determine the nature and prevalence of acute and late side effects of this treatment in these patients.

 - Determine the rate and pattern of locoregional tumor recurrence in these patients after this treatment.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive 3-D conformal radiotherapy and/or intensity-modulated radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks, in an effort to spare major salivary glands.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 57-64 patients will be accrued for this study over 27 months.

 Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Oropharyngeal Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy in treating patients who have stage II or stage III oropharyngeal cancer.
