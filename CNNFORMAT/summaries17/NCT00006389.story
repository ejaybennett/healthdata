(thirdQuint)Bryostatin 1 and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Stomach Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the response rate and survival in patients with metastatic or unresectable carcinoma of the stomach treated with bryostatin 1 and cisplatin.

 II.

 Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

 III.

 Determine the molecular determinants of response to this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 72 hours on days 1-3 followed by cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 4.

 Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Bryostatin 1 and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Stomach Cancer@highlight

Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 and cisplatin in treating patients who have metastatic or unresectable stomach cancer.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Bryostatin 1 may increase the effectiveness of cisplatin by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

 Combining cisplatin with bryostatin 1 may kill more tumor cells.
