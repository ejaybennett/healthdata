(fifthQuint)The Effects of Anti-HIV Drugs on the HIV Virus in HIV-Infected Patients.

 The natural history and pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection are linked closely to the replication of virus in the body.

 Studies obtained entirely from analyses of peripheral blood led to a shift in the understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis.

 Recent studies have shown that lymphoid tissues are a major reservoir for HIV and the primary site of virus replication.

 The proposed studies will provide the first comprehensive assessment of HIV-1 expression and lymphocyte response in both blood and lymphocyte tissue compartments.

 The data obtained will provide new insight into HIV-1 pathogenesis and provide a more rational basis for treatment decisions concerning early therapy of HIV-1 infection.

 Patients are admitted to the hospital for insertion of an angiocath to collect blood samples periodically over 48 hours on the day study medication from the parent study is initiated.

 After discharge, additional blood samples are obtained over a 6-month period.

 Within 7 days prior to a scheduled biopsy, patients have physical examinations and laboratory evaluations done.

 All patients undergo some combination of the following during the 2-week prestudy evaluation period and at Weeks 4 and 24: a) superficial lymph node biopsy from cervical, axillary, or inguinal area; b) rectal biopsy; and/or c) tonsillar biopsy.

 The tissue samples provide an assessment of viral and cellular dynamics.

 The Effects of Anti-HIV Drugs on the HIV Virus in HIV-Infected Patients@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine the HIV virus in the blood and lymphoid tissues of patients taking anti-HIV medications.

 HIV infection is closely linked to the growth of the HIV virus in the body.

 Much of this information was obtained from studying how the HIV virus grows in circulating blood.

 Recent studies have shown that the lymphoid tissue (part of the immune system) is a major site where HIV is found in the body and is also where much of the HIV virus growth occurs.

 This study will examine not only blood but also lymphoid tissue to gain a better understanding of the disease and how to treat it.
