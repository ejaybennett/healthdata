(secondQuint)Ecteinascidin 743 in Treating Patients With Unresectable Advanced or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the rate of clinical benefit, in terms of the incidence of objective partial and complete response, stable disease, or minor response of more than 3 months duration, in patients with previously treated, unresectable advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma treated with ecteinascidin 743.

 II.

 Determine the progression-free survival, overall survival, and response duration in patients treated with this drug.

 III.

 Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

 IV.

 Determine the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to number of prior cytotoxic therapies for advanced disease (1-2 vs more than 2).

 Patients receive ecteinascidin 743 IV over 3 hours on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 3 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-76 patients (18-38 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 13 months.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ecteinascidin 743 in treating patients who have unresectable advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.
