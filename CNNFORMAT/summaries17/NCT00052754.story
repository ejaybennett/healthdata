(secondQuint)Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Synovial Sarcoma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the therapeutic activity of gefitinib, in terms of progression-free rate, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma expressing HER1.

 - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the objective response, in terms of time to onset and duration of response, in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral gefitinib twice daily.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 3 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
