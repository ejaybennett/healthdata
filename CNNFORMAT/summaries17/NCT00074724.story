(secondQuint)Dobutamine Echocardiography In Patients With Ischemic Heart Failure Evaluated for Revascularization.

 BACKGROUND: The number of individuals presenting with coronary artery disease (CAD) with impaired left ventricular (LV) function (measured as ejection fraction {EF}99% power to address three important secondary hypotheses.

 The results of this study will provide definitive information regarding the value of assessing myocardial viability with DE and significant clinical implications for the selection of patients with CAD, LV dysfunction, and HF who are most likely to benefit from surgical revascularization.
