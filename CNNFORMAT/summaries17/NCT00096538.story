(thirdQuint)Valganciclovir in Treating Patients With Classic Non-HIV-Associated Kaposi's Sarcoma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the antitumor activity of valganciclovir in patients with classic non-HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).

 Secondary - Determine the effect of this drug on lytic and latent human herpesvirus-8 gene expression in KS lesions of these patients.

 - Determine the effect of this drug on the markers of angiogenesis in KS lesions of these patients.

 - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

 Patients receive oral valganciclovir twice daily for 3 weeks and then once daily for 21 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 All patients are followed for 1 month after completion of therapy.

 Patients with responding disease are followed monthly for up to 1 year.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.

 Valganciclovir in Treating Patients With Classic Non-HIV-Associated Kaposi's Sarcoma@highlight

RATIONALE: Herpesvirus is found in the lesions of most patients with Kaposi's sarcoma, and may have a role in causing Kaposi's sarcoma.

 Valganciclovir is an antiviral drug that acts against many types of herpesviruses and may be an effective treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well valganciclovir works in treating patients with classic non-HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.
