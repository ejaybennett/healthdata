(thirdQuint)A Study of Thalidomide Plus Dexamethasone (Thal-Dex) Versus DOXIL plusThalidomide Plus Dexamethasone (DOXIL -Thal-Dex) in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma.

 This is a multi-center, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance) study to compare the safety and effectiveness of Thalidomide + Dexamethasone versus DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection) + Thalidomide + Dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

 Treatments are administered in 28-day cycles.

 Patients will receive 4 to 12 treatment cycles, depending on the response of their multiple myeloma to the treatment (measured according to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant Response Criteria).

 Patients will have additional tests that include Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scans or echocardiograms to assess the patients for potential cardiotoxicity that could be related to treatment with DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection).

 Maximum duration of study participation for each participant will be 48 weeks.

The purpose of this study is to determine if Thalidomide + Dexamethasone or DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection) + Thalidomide + Dexamethasone is more effective in treating newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma.

 The number of patients whose multiple myeloma disappears for a period of time (complete Response) will be studied to make the determination of which treatment is more effective.
