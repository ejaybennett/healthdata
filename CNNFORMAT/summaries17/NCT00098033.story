(secondQuint)Investigation of Clofarabine in Acute Leukemias.

 The specific aims of the project are (1) conduct the phase II study of clofarabine and evaluate the antileukemic efficacy in AML, ALL, and CML-accelerated and blastic phases in terms of complete response (CR) rate, response duration, and survival; and (2) analyze the relationship between cellular uptake and retention of clofarabine triphosphate (the active metabolite), inhibition of DNA synthesis, and clinical outcome.

 Completion date provided represents the completion date of the grant per OOPD records.

 Investigation of Clofarabine in Acute Leukemias@highlight

The goals and objectives of this project are to evaluate the antileukemic activity of the investigational agent clofarabine in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in accelerated and blastic phases.
