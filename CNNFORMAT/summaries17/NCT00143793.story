(fifthQuint)NT-proBNP and New Biomarkers in Patients With Dyspnea and/or Peripheral Edema.

 Primary endpoint: - Sensitivity and specificity of biomarker measurements for discrimination of heart failure from dyspnea of other origin.

 Secondary endpoints: - Determination of Cut-off(s) - Discrimination of cardiac and non-cardiac diseases causing to dyspnea or peripheral edema - Determination of treatment costs of the initial hospital stay - Evaluation of resource savings when implementing NT-proBNP for determination of diagnosis.

 - Time to diagnosis.

 - Hospitalization rate /Intensive care treatment rate between day 1 and 28 - Duration of initial hospital stay - 30-day re-hospitalization rate - 30 day mortality rate and adverse event rate - 1 and 5 year mortality rates - 1 and 5 year rehospitalization rates.

 NT-proBNP and New Biomarkers in Patients With Dyspnea and/or Peripheral Edema@highlight

The objectives of this study are to: - Evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of NT-proBNP (N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide) and new biomarker measurements for the diagnosis of heart failure in patients with acute dyspnea and/or edema.

 - Determine the exact biomarker cut-off point(s) for the differentiation of healthy persons, patients with heart failure and patients with dyspnea of other origin.

 - Evaluate treatment costs in patients with dyspnea under special consideration of NT-proBNP measurement.
