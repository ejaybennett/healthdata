(thirdQuint)Monitoring Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-infected Parents in Thailand.

 Implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a substantial decrease in HIV-related mortality and morbidity.

 Current guidelines emphasize maximal and durable viral load suppression.

 However, while the goal of therapy is the restoration of immunity, treatment failure is usually defined as the inability to maintain undetectable viral load, without regard to immune function.

 This situation often leads to a rapid sequence of therapeutic switches, thus narrowing therapeutic options over time.

 A monitoring strategy driven primarily by the patient's immune restoration would most likely be as effective in preventing disease progression, would lead to fewer changes in HAART regimens and would be considerably simpler and cost effective.

 Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two switching strategies: - VL-S, the standard viral load (VL) based monitoring strategy, where switching is performed when VL is confirmed (within one month) above 400 copies per mL.

 - CD4-S, the alternative CD4 based monitoring strategy where switching is performed when a confirmed (within one month) relative decline in CD4 count of more than 30% from peak values is observed within 200 cells from baseline.

 The initial HAART regimen will be a NNRTI+NRTI containing regimen and the second line regimen will be a PI containing regimen, subsequent regimens will be chosen individually based on tolerance, previous drugs used, resistance profile, and drugs available.

 Patients will be followed until the end of the study (maximum of 5 years for the first enrollee, three years for the last enrollee).

The purpose of this study is to determine if a decision to switch to a subsequent antiretroviral regimen based upon the CD4 cell count rather than the standard switching strategy based on viral load could ensure the same immunological and clinical outcome and preserve future treatment options in AIDS patients
