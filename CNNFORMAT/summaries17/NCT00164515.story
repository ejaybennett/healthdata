(firstQuint)Increasing Physical Activity Among Overweight Women With Mobility Disabilities.

.

 Regular, sustainable physical activity can have a dramatic effect on reducing obesity and other secondary conditions and increasing quality of life.

 People with mobility limitations have a higher level of physical inactivity resulting from numerous personal and environmental barriers to physical activity participation.

 This project will evaluate the feasibility of increasing physical activity among overweight individuals with mobility limitations through physician-referrals to a personalized exercise programme at the Chicago-based National Center on Physical Activity and Disability (NCPAD).
