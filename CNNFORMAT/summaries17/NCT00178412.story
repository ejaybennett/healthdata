(fifthQuint)Improving Outcomes of Hospitalized Elders and Caregivers.

 More than 12 million elderly people are hospitalized each year in the United Status, frequently resulting in functional decline.

 Family care of hospitalized elders is important given the increasing numbers of hospitalized elders, needs for elder care in the home after hospital discharge, and responsibilities of family caregivers for providing this care.

 Involving family caregivers in the hospital care of their loved one may result in positive outcomes for both the elderly patients and their family caregivers.

 However, there is a paucity of empirical studies that have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to enhance family participation in caring for hospitalized elders.

 In the proposed study, we will build upon our prior work that has demonstrated the positive effects of theoretically-driven interventions with families of hospitalized patients and older adults at home.

 Among the unique contributions of this study include: (a) a randomized controlled design, (b) testing of a theoretically-driven, reproducible intervention that can be easily translated into clinical practice and widely disseminated; (c) the testing of an explanatory model to explain the effects of the intervention, (d) a prospective cost-effectiveness analysis; and (e) an intervention that begins early in the hospital stay, and (f) measurement of both short- and more long-term outcomes, up to 2 months following hospital discharge.

 The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a theoretically-driven, reproducible intervention (CARE: Creating Avenues for Relative Empowerment) on the process and outcomes of hospitalized elders and their family caregivers.

 The secondary aims are to: (a) explore what factors moderate the effects of the intervention program (e.

g.

, social economic status and family preferences for care participation); and (b) determine the cost-effectiveness of the CARE program.

 A two-group experiment will be used with 280 family caregivers of hospitalized elders.

 Measures of both process and outcome variables will be included, such as family caregiver beliefs, anxiety, worry, depression, role outcomes, as well as elderly patients outcomes during hospitalization and after hospital discharge.

 Findings from a recent pilot study with 49 family caregiver-elders dyads support undertaking this full-scale clinical trial in that family caregivers who received the CARE program, versus those who received a comparison program, had more positive coping and role outcomes and their hospitalized elderly relatives had positive outcomes during and after hospitalization.

 Improving Outcomes of Hospitalized Elders and Caregivers@highlight

In this study, an intervention is tested that is designed to improve the outcomes of hospitalized elders and family caregivers.

 Study design: - randomized, controlled study - participants: 280 family caregivers aged 21 or above - length of follow-up: 2 weeks and 2 months after hospitalization Study hypothesis: In this randomized clinical trial, the following hypotheses will be tested: 1.

 Hospitalized elders whose family CGs receive the CARE program versus those who receive a comparison program will have better outcomes during and after hospitalization as measured by: (1) fewer incidents of dysfunctional syndrome; (2) shorter hospital stays; (3) lower readmission rates; (4) less depressive symptoms; (5) higher cognitive level; (6) less functional decline perceived by family CG; and (7) a closer relationship with their family CGs.

 2.

 Family CGs of hospitalized elders who receive the CARE program will report: (1) More positive beliefs about their loved one's responses to hospitalization and their role in the hospital setting; (2) more positive emotional outcomes (less worry, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) during and after hospitalization; (3) More participation in their loved one's care during hospitalization; and (4) More positive role outcomes (more role reward, less role strain, more prepared for their loved one's care, and a closer relationship with their elderly relatives, both during and after hospitalization).

 3.

 The proposed model to explain the effects of the CARE program on the process and outcomes of family CG coping and elderly patient outcomes will be supported for CGs and elderly patients.
