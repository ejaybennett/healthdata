(firstQuint)Intravenous Allopurinol in Heart Failure.

 Xanthine oxidase have been reported to improve mechano-energetic coupling in failing hearts.

 The investigators developed a means to directly measure creatine kinase flux, the major energy reserve of the heart, in the human heart exploiting new magnetic resonance technologies.

 The investigators propose to study 10 healthy subjects and up to 25 with heart failure (dilated cardiomyopathy) before and after a single 300mg IV infusion of allopurinol.

This study tests the hypothesis that allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, improves heart metabolism in patients with heart failure.
