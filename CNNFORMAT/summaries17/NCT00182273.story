(thirdQuint)Canalith Repositioning Procedure for BPPV in Primary Care.

 Many patients consult their family physicians because of dizziness.

 This is a disabling condition with serious consequences, especially in older people, as it may lead to falls and consequent fractures.

 One of the most common causes of dizziness is the so-called Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV).

 Patients with BPPV typically have severe vertigo provoked by a change in head position.

 Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo can now be accurately diagnosed, and distinguished form other dizziness producing conditions, in the physician's office and without any sophisticated diagnostics tools.

 Furthermore, it can be treated in the office setting by specific head positioning maneuvers (Canalith Repositioning Procedure) that are easy to learn and perform.

 The Canalith Repositioning Procedure is currently almost exclusively performed in specialized settings by ENT and Internal Medicine specialists.

 Its efficacy has been demonstrated in these settings.

 However, to-date no studies have been conducted in the primary care settings about the use and efficacy of the procedure, where the condition is first seen and assessed.

 This is a randomized controlled trial to determine whether the procedure performed by family doctors cures dizziness.

The purpose of this study is to see whether family doctors can treat benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), or dizziness, using a procedure in the office.

 The study is looking at whether the treatment procedure cures the dizziness in more patients compared to patients that receive a "sham" or placebo procedure.
