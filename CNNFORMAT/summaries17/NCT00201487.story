(thirdQuint)Choline Quantification in Breast Cancer by MRS.

 1.

 Establishment of new MRS sequence for choline quantification of choline.

 This sequence is choline-selective, and signals from water and lipids are suppressed simultaneously.

 2.

 Compare to different methods for choline quantification.

 The first method is quantification through an external phantom standard, containing a known concentration of choline.

 The other method is based on the utilisation of internal water signal as a reference.

 Both calculations can be performed from the same MR exam.

 Ten patients will be included in the study.

 Choline Quantification in Breast Cancer by MRS@highlight

Choline has been found in increased concentration in breast cancer patients.

 Hypothesis: The choline signal as observed by MRS is sensitive to treatment, and a positive response to treatment will give a reduction in choline concentration.

 The purpose of this study is to establish methods for quantification of choline in breast cancer by MRS
