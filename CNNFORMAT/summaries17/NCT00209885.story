(secondQuint)Optimal Multimodal Analgesia in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy.

 Aim of the study: to compare postoperative complaints (PONV, pain, etc) and PACU discharge time between two groups: - A: standard of care (SOC)receiving intraoperative dexamethasone, ondansetron, ketorolac, and general anaesthesia with propofol, remifentanil and cisatracurium - B: SOC + preoperative gabapentin, intraoperative lidocain infusion, s-ketamin and droperidol.

 Primary endpoints: - postoperative abilities over time - discharge time from PACU according to fixed criteria - consumption of analgesics and antiemetics in the PACU Secondary endpoints: - degree of nursing requirements at the PACU - General tolerability of the regimes.
