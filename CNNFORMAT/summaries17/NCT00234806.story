(fifthQuint)Health-e-Access Telemedicine in Primary Pediatric Care.

 This involves estimating the impact of reduced absence due to illness on parents and their employers and estimating the value of a telehealth visit to these stakeholders.

 An interview instrument was developed to administer before experience with telehealth and again after a family has had experience with the program.

 In addition program attendance (childcare or school) records will be collected to document changes in absenteeism pre and post telehealth service implementation.

 This study involves a before and after research design including both historical and concurrent controls comparing a detailed utilization of health services including telehealth visits, emergency department services and illness related office visits.

 Analyses will include center-level analyses of service utilization on a weekly basis pre and post as well as a child-level analyses including utilization before enrollment in a participating childcare center or school through program participation and, eventually, telehealth participation.

 This is a descriptive observational study of the feasibility and acceptability of integrating telehealth service into 10 primary care pediatric practices.

 This study will document the integration process by maintaining a log of key communications relating to decision making (meeting minutes, memos, written agreements, protocols) and by interviewing key staff such as residents, nurse practitioners, attending physicians, staff nurses, and administrative leaders following the study period.

 Health-e-Access Telemedicine in Primary Pediatric Care@highlight

This study aims to take the existing model from the pilot of Telemedicine in Daycare and expand it to other suburban childcare centers and both urban and suburban elementary schools.

 An assessment of the value of telehealth in the child programs will then be initiated to detail the impact of utilization and costs.

 An assessment of the value of integrating telehealth into primary care practice will also be evaluated.

 The impact of continuity of care, well child visit rates, and immunization status will be among the various measures used in this evaluation.
