(secondQuint)Cetuximab, Bevacizumab & 5FU/Leucovorin vs.

 Oxaliplatin, Bevacizumab & 5FU/Leucovorin in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

 This is a Phase III, open label, nonblinded study.

 A total of 240 eligible patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either treatment Arm.

 In this trial, we will compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of this novel combination of biweekly infusional 5-FU/leucovorin plus cetuximab and bevacizumab (FOLF-CB) to the current standard of care, biweekly infusional 5-FU/leucovorin plus oxaliplatin and bevacizumab (Bev-FOLFOX).

 For practical purposes, this study will be a head to head comparison of oxaliplatin versus cetuximab, since the other components of both regimens will be the same.
