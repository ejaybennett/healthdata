(fifthQuint)Prevacid vs Lifestyle Modifications for the Treatment of LPR.

 The results of studies evaluating PPI therapy versus lifestyle modifications for the treatment of LPR have not been conclusive.

 However, many of these studies were conducted at tertiary care centers.

 We will look at patients presenting with LPR symptoms in a community setting.

 All subjects will have an exam of their larynx via laryngoscopy at each of the 4 study visits (screening, week 6, week 12, and week 24).

 Based on exam findings, the physician will complete the Reflux Finding Score.

 The subjects will also complete the Reflux Symptom Index weekly to assess for changes in their symptoms.

 The statistical analysis of this study will include evaluating changes in the Reflux Finding Scores and Reflux Symptom Index scores over the 24 weeks of study participation.
