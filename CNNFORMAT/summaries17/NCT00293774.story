(firstQuint)Alberta Hip Improvement Project.

 This study is designed to provide orthopedic surgeons and decision makers with evidence-based health measures for patients that are treated by orthopedic surgeons for degenerative joint disease of the hip in Alberta.

 This study is provincial initiative to determine whether new alternative hip bearing surfaces improve patient outcomes and/or decrease health resource utilization in patients with degenerative joint disease of the hip in Alberta.

 The primary objective is to compare time to revision for patients receiving alternative hip bearing surfaces to patients receiving conventional total hip replacements.

 Secondary objectives are to evaluate long-term safety; to evaluate costs; to determine if alternative hip bearing surfaces improve patient function; to develop evidence base guidelines for the implementation of alternative hip bearing surfaces in Alberta; do develop a modal to assess other technologies and health advances; to develop an Alberta HIP registry.
