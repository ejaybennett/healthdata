(thirdQuint)Effectiveness of a Procedure for Previously Failed Glaucoma Surgery.

 The healing process after filtering surgery for glaucoma may cause an unsuccessful outcome for the trabeculectomy procedure.

 In order to control the rising intraocular pressure due to the failed trabeculectomy, medications may be restarted and/or filtering surgery may need to be repeated.

 Our primary research showed that transconjunctival mitomycin-C in needle bleb revision may be an effective procedure to control this situation.

 This retrospective study will follow over 100 patients from May 1997 to May 2006.

 This long-term follow up will help assess the future role of this technique in glaucoma practices.

 Effectiveness of a Procedure for Previously Failed Glaucoma Surgery@highlight

Transconjunctival mitomycin-C in needle bleb revision may be an effective procedure to treat cases with a previously failed trabeculectomy.

 We will investigate approximately 100 consecutive cases with follow up of up to 9 years.

 We anticipate that this procedure is an effective, safe, and appropriate option for successful glaucoma treatment.
