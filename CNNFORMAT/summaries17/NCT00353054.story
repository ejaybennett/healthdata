(firstQuint)Effect of Calcium/Vitamin D Supplementation on Body Weight and Fat Loss.

.

 The effect of a calcium supplementation on body weight loss is inconclusive and some studies have suggested that adequate calcium intake can have a favourable effect on some metabolic variables.

 The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of (Caltrate 600 + D (R)) on body composition and various indicators of metabolic health in overweight and obese females characterised by a usual low daily calcium intake, on a weight-reducing program.

 The main hypotheses of this study were: - Caltrate 600 +D(R) increases body weight and fat mass losses of individuals on a weight-reducing program.

 - Caltrate 600 +D(R) improves the metabolic profile of these subjects, independently of variations promoted by body fat loss.
