(thirdQuint)A Type 2 Diabetes Study of the Longer-Term Glycemic Effect of AVANDAMET vs.

 Metformin.

 This was a phase IV, randomized, double-blind, global, multi-centre study.

 The study consisted of a 2 week screening period followed by an 80 week double-blind treatment period.

 Subjects who met all eligibility requirements were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by country, gender (male and female) and pre-screening HbA1c (9% or>9) either to MET or AVM.

 When the substudy was added, a new randomization was created for the participating centers.

 Those subjects in the bone sub-study were stratified by country, gender (male, premenopausal female, and postmenopausal female), pre-screening HbA1c (i.

e.

, 9%; >9%), and either to MET or AVM.

 At randomization, Visit 3 (Week 0), subjects were initiated at Dose Level 1.

 Treatment with AVM was initiated at a dose of 4 mg/500 mg and titrated up to a maximum total daily dose of AVM 8 mg/2000 mg.

 Treatment with MET therapy was initiated at a dose of 500 mg and titrated up to a maximum daily dose of 2000mg.

 A Type 2 Diabetes Study of the Longer-Term Glycemic Effect of AVANDAMET vs.

 Metformin@highlight

This study will evaluate the longer-term glycemic effect of two medicines approved for initial treatment of type 2 diabetes.

 The study consists of a 2 week screening period (2 study visits), followed by an 80 week double-blind treatment period (11 study visits).

 Also, a sub-study was included to look at changes in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine.
