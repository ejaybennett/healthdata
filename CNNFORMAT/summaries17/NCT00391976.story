(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Safety of 28 or 56 Day Treatment for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa in Children With Cystic Fibrosis.

 This was a multi-center, open-label, two-arm, randomized study.

 All patients diagnosed with CF and who fulfilled the criteria for early infection with P.

 aeruginosa initially received tobramycin 300 mg twice a day for 28 days.

 At the end of the 28-day treatment period, patients who met the inclusion criteria and none of the additional exclusion criteria were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive an additional 28 days of treatment with tobramycin 300 mg twice a day (56-day group) or to stop study medication (28-day group).

 All randomized patients had regular study visits until a positive P.

 aeruginosa sample was obtained.

 Once P.

 aeruginosa had recurred, the patient entered a follow-up phase where minimal information was collected for 27 months.

 During the follow-up phase, patients were treated according to their physicians' discretion.

 Patients who started treatment with tobramycin but were not randomized (i.

e.

 due to a positive antibody test) and followed up during routine clinic visits.

 They were allowed to continue their 28-day treatment period and afterwards be treated according to their physicians' discretion.

 Efficacy and Safety of 28 or 56 Day Treatment for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa in Children With Cystic Fibrosis@highlight

This study assessed time to recurrence of infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa following treatment of the initial infection with tobramycin nebuliser solution.

 The safety profile of the initial tobramycin treatment was assessed during the first 3 months of the study and patients were followed until the end of the study, month 27.
