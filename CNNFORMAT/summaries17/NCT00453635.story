(secondQuint)Study With Docetaxel, Carboplatin and Herceptin Versus Vinorelbine and Herceptin in HER-2 (+) Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients.

 Herceptin, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the transmembrane glycoprotein HER2/neu (c-erbB-2), is a valuable option in the treatment of women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

 The combination of Herceptin and chemotherapy yielded significantly better results than chemotherapy alone in response, time to progression, and survival time.

 Whether the combination of Docetaxel, Carboplatin and Herceptin versus the administration of Vinorelbine and Herceptin combination in HER-2 positive patients with metastatic breast cancer is preferable is not yet known.
