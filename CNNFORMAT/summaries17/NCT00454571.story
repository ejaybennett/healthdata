(fifthQuint)Pazopanib Hydrochloride After Leuprolide Acetate or Goserelin Acetate in Treating Patients With Relapsed Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine if pazopanib hydrochloride is able to increase time to progression, as measured by prostate-specific antigen (PSA), after 6 months of limited gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy comprising leuprolide acetate or goserelin in patients with androgen-sensitive relapsed stage D0 prostate cancer.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the adverse events in patients treated with this regimen.

 II.

 To monitor for changes in testosterone in relationship to pazopanib therapy versus observation.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive androgen blockade comprising GnRH agonist therapy (e.

g.

, leuprolide acetate or goserelin acetate) for 6 months.

 Patients who develop metastases or have PSA progression while on GnRH agonist therapy are removed from the study and placed on total androgen blockade.

 The remaining patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 ARM II: Patients undergo observation.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 12 months.

 Pazopanib Hydrochloride After Leuprolide Acetate or Goserelin Acetate in Treating Patients With Relapsed Prostate Cancer@highlight

This randomized phase II trial is studying how well pazopanib hydrochloride works after leuprolide or goserelin in treating patients with relapsed prostate cancer.

 Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

 Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells.

 Antihormone therapy, such as leuprolide acetate or goserelin acetate, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body.

 Giving pazopanib after leuprolide or goserelin may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer
