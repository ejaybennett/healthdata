(thirdQuint)Safety Study of Infusion of SGT-53 to Treat Solid Tumors.

 The p53 gene is a vital tumor suppressor gene in humans.

 Numerous human tumors possess a loss or mutation of wild type p53 (wtp53).

 In addition to playing a crucial role in cell cycle control, the p53 gene is a critical component in two of the pathways involved in regulating tumor cell growth: cell death (apoptosis) and the regulation of angiogenesis.

 The loss of such critical tumor suppressor activity is believed to be responsible for p53's involvement in such a broad array of human tumors and resistance to chemo/radiotherapy.

 SGT-53 is a complex composed of a wild type p53 gene (plasmid DNA) encapsulated in a liposome that is targeted to tumor cells by means of an anti-transferrin receptor single-chain antibody fragment (TfRscFv) attached to the outside of the liposome.

 Pre-clinical studies have indicated that SGT-53 could sensitize tumors to the effects of radiation/chemotherapy.

 The Phase 1a portion of this clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SGT-53.

 In addition, pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of SGT-53 will be measured and correlated with tumor response and toxicity.

 The Phase Ib portion of this clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety of SGT-53 in combination with docetaxel, determine the recommended Phase II doses of these two agents, and evaluate the effect of the combination of SGT-53 and docetaxel on tumor size or progression.

This is a Phase Ib study as a continuation of the original Phase I protocol.

 The purpose of this Phase Ib study is to evaluate the safety of a single course of SGT-53 in combination with docetaxel and determine the recommended Phase II doses of SGT-53 and docetaxel in combination for evaluation in subsequent clinical studies for the treatment of solid tumors.
