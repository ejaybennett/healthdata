(thirdQuint)Effects of an Oral GH Secretagogue (MK-677) on Body Composition and Functional Ability of Older Adults.

 This is a two year, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial of once daily administration of MK-677, an oral GH secretagogue, to healthy older adults.

 During the first year, subjects will be randomized to MK-677 or placebo treatment.

 In each of three subgroups of subjects (men, women off and women on hormone replacement therapy), 16 subjects will receive MK-677 and 8 will receive placebo.

 After 1 year, the subjects who received placebo will be switched to MK-677 treatment; the subjects who received MK-677 for the first year will be randomized to either placebo or MK-677 for the second year of the study.

The study will test changes in GH, IGF-I, body composition and function.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment of healthy older men and women with oral MK-677 for 12 months will enhance pulsatile GH release and increase mean GH and IGF-I concentrations into the range of young adults and will have favorable effects on body composition and functional ability on older adults.
