(thirdQuint)Cediranib Maleate in Treating Patients With Relapsed, Refractory, or Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia or High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the objective response rate in patients with relapsed, refractory, or untreated acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes treated with AZD2171 (cediranib maleate).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 II.

 Determine the response duration, event-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

 III.

 Determine the hematological response rate in patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to disease (acute myeloid leukemia vs myelodysplastic syndromes).

 Patients receive oral cediranib maleate once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients undergo bone marrow biopsy at baseline and on day 28 for correlative studies.

 Samples are analyzed for circulating endothelial cells, VEGF receptor expression, and leukemic blasts via flow cytometry and microvessel density via histopathological techniques.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months and then every 6 months for up to 2 years.

 Cediranib Maleate in Treating Patients With Relapsed, Refractory, or Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia or High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome@highlight

This phase II trial is studying how well cediranib maleate works in treating patients with relapsed, refractory, or untreated acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.

 Cediranib maleate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer.
