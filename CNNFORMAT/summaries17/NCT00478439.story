(thirdQuint)Investigation of Macular Pigment Augmentation on Dark Adaptation.

 The study design is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled intervention study that will evaluate whether macular pigment augmentation improves the speed of dark adaptation.

 Two groups of participants will be enrolled, old adults with normal vision and early age-related macular degeneration patients.

 Macular pigment will be augmented using EyePromise RESTORE (ZeaVision, Inc).

 EyePromise RESTORE is a nutritional supplement that has been found to increase macular pigment levels in some users.

 Macular pigment level and the speed of dark adaptation (how fast a person adjusts to the dark) will be assessed at baseline, 4-months, and 8-months.

 Fundus appearance will be assessed at baseline and 8-months follow-up.

The study will evaluate whether taking a nutritional supplement designed to increase macular pigment in the eye can improve a person's ability to adjust to darkness.

 Patients will be assigned to take either a placebo or nutritional supplement for 8 months.

 Vision will be assessed at baseline, 4 months, and 8 months.
