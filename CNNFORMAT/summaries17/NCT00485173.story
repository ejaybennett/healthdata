(thirdQuint)INFUSE Bone Graft/ PEEK Interbody Spacer/ Anterior Cervical Plate Pivotal Clinical Trial.

 This pivotal clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of INFUSE(R) Bone Graft with the PEEK Interbody Spacer and Anterior Cervical Plate in patients with symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD).

 The implant under investigation in this clinical trial is INFUSE(R) Bone Graft, the PEEK Interbody Spacer, and Anterior Cervical Plate.

 The device will be implanted using an anterior surgical approach.

 Safety and effectiveness data for patients in this study will be compared to that of historical controls.

 Historical control data will be taken from the control arms of the following Medtronic studies: (1) the Artificial Cervical Disc (also known as PRESTIGE(R) Cervical Disc System) pivotal IDE trial (NCT00642876) and (2) the BRYAN(R) Cervical Disc System pivotal IDE trial (NCT00437190).
