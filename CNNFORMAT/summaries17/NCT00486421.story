(thirdQuint)Rituximab and Prednisone as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of rituximab, when administered with standard prednisone treatment, in maintaining a platelet count 50,000/mm at 6 months without further therapies (e.

g.

, splenectomy or other salvage therapies) in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.

 - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

 Secondary - Determine the time to platelet recovery in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the duration of platelet recovery in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Assess efficacy of this regimen in preventing spontaneous bleeding events in these patients.

 - Determine the response in patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

 Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral prednisone once daily on days 1-14 followed by a taper to day 56.

 Treatment is administered in the absence of disease relapse or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.

 Rituximab and Prednisone as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura@highlight

RATIONALE: Rituximab and prednisone may increase the number of platelets in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving rituximab together with prednisone works as first-line therapy in treating patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.
