(secondQuint)Clinical Study to Assess Safety and Effectiveness of the Zenith Dissection Endovascular System in Patients With Aortic Dissection.

 The Zenith(R) Thoracic Dissection Study is a clinical trial to study the safety and effectiveness of the Zenith(R) Dissection Endovascular System in the treatment of dissections (length-wise tear) of the descending thoracic aorta.

 The Zenith(R) Dissection Endovascular System is comprised of the Zenith TX2(R) TAA Endovascular Graft and the Zenith(R) Dissection Endovascular Stent.

 Instead of making a large incision in the chest, the physician makes a small incision near each hip to insert, and guides the graft and the dissection stent into place in the aorta.
