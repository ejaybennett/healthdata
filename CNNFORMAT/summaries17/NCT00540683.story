(secondQuint)Measurement of the Distribution of Optical Properties in Adult Human Muscle.

 The researcher can monitor muscle physiology, for example during exercise or in response to external factors such as shock by Diffuse Optical spectroscopy technique.

 The Diffuse Optical spectroscopy technique can determine significant changes in muscle, muscle structure, muscle tissues metabolism and hemodynamics.
