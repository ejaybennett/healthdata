(fifthQuint)University Health Network Whiplash Intervention Trial.

 Background: Whiplash is the most common traffic injury, affecting 83% of people involved in motor vehicle collisions.

 It results in a significant burden of pain, disability and health care utilization.

 Preventing chronic whiplash is a priority for clinicians, insurers, and policy makers.

 However, whiplash injuries are resistant to treatment and few of its prognostic factors are modifiable through intervention.

 One of the rare factors amenable to change is the provision of timely and effective clinical care.

 To date, no randomized trials that have investigated the effectiveness of a coordinated and staged multidisciplinary rehabilitation program aimed at improving the health outcomes of patients with whiplash-associated disorders.

 Moreover, it is not known whether rehabilitation programs are superior to physician care in promoting better health outcomes.

 Overall, there is a need for a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to investigate what program of care yields the best outcomes for patients.

 Purpose: To compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the "Soft Tissue Injury Care Model" designed by AVIVA Canada, the "Pre-approved Framework Guideline for Grade I and II Whiplash Associated Disorders" recommended by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario and a physician-based "Education and Activation" intervention on the rate of self-rated recovery from whiplash-associated disorders.

 Methods: We designed a three-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial.

 Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receive one of three program of care: 1) the "Soft Tissue Injury Care Model" designed by AVIVA Canada;2) the "Pre-approved Framework Guideline for Grade I and II Whiplash Associated Disorders" recommended by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario ; or 3) a physician-based "Education and Activation" intervention.

 Significance: The results of this study will provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of three commonly used management strategies for whiplash injuries in Ontario.

 The results will help guide the development of effective and cost-effective programs of care and inform insurance and government policy on the rehabilitation of whiplash injuries.

 University Health Network Whiplash Intervention Trial@highlight

Whiplash is the most common traffic injury, affecting 83% of people involved in motor vehicle collisions.

 People with whiplash injuries often experience pain and disability that can last for a long period.

 This may subsequently lead to an increased use of the health care system.

 Preventing chronic symptoms is a priority for clinicians, insurers, and policy makers.

 However, there are very few factors that can be changed by treatment to prevent prolonged symptoms.

 Providing effective care at the appropriate time is one aspect that can be changed and needs to be studied.

 To date, no randomized clinical trials have investigated the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs for the management of patients with whiplash-associated disorders.

 Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest whether rehabilitation programs are superior to physician-based care at improving whiplash-associated symptoms.

 Thus, there is a need for a randomized trial to determine what program results in the best outcomes for patients.

 The purpose of this study is to compare three programs of care that are currently available in Ontario for the management of patients with Whiplash-associated disorders.

 The results of this study will demonstrate which of three programs of care is superior in improving the physical and mental health of patients with whiplash-associated disorders.

 The results will help guide the development and implementation of effective and cost-effective programs of care by informing clinicians, insurers and government on the best rehabilitation options for patients with whiplash injuries.
