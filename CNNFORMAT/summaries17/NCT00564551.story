(secondQuint)Effect of Increased Intake of Low Fat Dairy Products on Weight Loss and Insulin Resistance.

 Obesity can cause many health problems as it is linked to several chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes.

 We know that individuals who are overweight or obese, and have impaired glucose tolerance or insulin resistance, have a good chance of developing type 2 diabetes.

 Research tells us that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes can be decreased by losing weight and making dietary changes.

 A promising area of study involves using low-fat milk products and calcium to prevent and/or control obesity and diabetes.

 This study is important because it will determine if including low-fat milk products in weight reducing diets can enhance weight loss, improve fat loss and decrease levels of blood glucose and insulin in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes not treated with medication.

 This information is directly applicable to treating diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
