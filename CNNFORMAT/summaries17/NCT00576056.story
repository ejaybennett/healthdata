(firstQuint)Effectiveness and Safety Study of TACE Plus Oral Sorafenib for Unresectable HCC.

 The proposed study will make an important contribution to understanding not only the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in addition to TACE in patients diagnosed with unresectable HCC, but this will also be the first clinical trial with sorafenib to assess the effects of this novel therapy on HRQL.

 Understanding the effects of sorafenib on HRQL is critical in the treatment of HCC secondary to the modest benefits in survival that have been reported with conventional therapies.

 Our team has one of the largest experiences in evaluating HRQL in patients diagnosed with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

 We have previously reported on alternative methods of evaluating HRQL, solutions for missing data in clinical trials as well as tested statistical and clinically meaningful differences, within and between treatment groups, in clinical trials with patients diagnosed with hepatobiliary carcinoma.
