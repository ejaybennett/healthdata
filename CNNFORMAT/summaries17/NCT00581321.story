(secondQuint)Oral Water Ingestion in Heart Transplant Patients.

 In this study we propose to assess the hemodynamic response to the ingestion of 16 fl oz of water.

 We will test the hypothesis that water ingestion will increase the systemic vascular resistance.

 This study will occur in patients status post cardiac transplantation during their clinical right heart catheterizations.

 Invasive hemodynamics including cardiac outputs and plasma norepinephrine levels will be measured before and 30 min after the water ingestion.
