(secondQuint)A Safety and Efficacy Study of a Topical Gel for the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Psoriasis.

 This pilot study aims to confirm the results of a previous proof of concept study performed by Dr.

 Michael Holick using a different dosage form.

 The secondary objective is to determine if there is a dose dependent difference or trend in response between the two concentrations of PTH (1-34) peptide gel.

 Subjects will be randomized to receive one of three treatment groups on a 1:1:1 basis.

 The three treatment groups are: - Treatment Group 1: 0.

05% PTH (1-34) Gel - Treatment Group 2: 0.

10% PTH (1-34) Gel - Treatment Group 3: Placebo Gel.
