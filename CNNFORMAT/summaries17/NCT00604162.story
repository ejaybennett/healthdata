(firstQuint)PillCam Colon Capsule Endoscopy (PCCE) in the Visualization of the Colon.

 The development and introduction of a specially designed, customized colon capsule combined with a dedicated capsule colonoscopy procedure protocol will allow for more efficient evaluation of the colonic mucosa.

 This is expected to improve the capability of the Given(R) Diagnostic System to detect colonic pathologies and to serve as a diagnostic and screening tool for colonic disease.

 This study is designed to compare capsule colonoscopy and colonoscopy procedures in detecting colon abnormalities.

 Note that the physician performing the capsule endoscopy and reading the capsule videos and the physician performing the colonoscopy were unaware of each other's findings until completion of the examinations and reports (assessor-blind).
