(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of GCS-100LE in the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma.

 The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and the dose-limiting toxicities of GCS-100 in subjects with relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose and/or the recommended dose for further studies.

 The secondary objectives of this study are (i) to evaluate the safety of treatment with GCS-100 in combination with bortezomib (VelcadeTM) in subjects whose disease has progressed on GCS-100 alone; (ii) to evaluate the response to GCS-100 alone, in combination with bortezomib in subjects whose disease has progressed on GCS-100 alone, and during dexamethasone therapy in combination with GCS 100 plus bortezomib in subjects whose disease has progressed on GCS-100 plus bortezomib; (iii) to evaluate the utility of potential surrogate markers; (iv) to perform exploratory correlative analyses of bone marrow samples to define better the mechanisms of action and response to therapy.
