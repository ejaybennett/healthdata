(firstQuint)Efficacy Study of Drug-eluting and Bare Metal Stents in Bypass Graft Lesions.

 A large number of studies showed that drug-eluting stents significantly reduce in-stent restenosis and the subsequent need for target vessel revascularisation compared with bare metal stents.

 Although this applies to the vast majority of patients, intimal hyperplasia and in-stent restenosis have not been completely eliminated and remain to occur in certain high risk subgroups.

 While there is a plenty of data about the efficacy of DES in complex lesions or diabetics, no randomized data exist about the efficacy of DES in coronary artery bypass graft lesions.

The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of drug-eluting stents and bare metal stents to reduce reblockage of bypass grafts after coronary stenting
