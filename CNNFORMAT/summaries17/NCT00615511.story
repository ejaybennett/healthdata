(thirdQuint)Efficacy of Pregnenolone in Patients With Schizophrenia.

 Pregnenolone is a steroid health supplement which is readily available in health food stores.

 We are using it in this study at higher doses than you would normally take as a health supplement because preliminary studies have indicated that negative symptoms improve and certain aspects of cognition improve at these doses.

 We do not require you to stop your existing treatment in order to enter the study.

 After four months we will test your symptoms and cognition and ask if you would like to continue taking pregnenolone, at no cost, in a follow-up study designed to determine the long-term costs and benefits of taking pregnenolone.
