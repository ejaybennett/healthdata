(thirdQuint)Fast Track Management in Elective Open Infrarenal Aortic Aneurysm Repair.

 Prospective randomization of patients admitted with infrarenal aortic aneurysm who undergo elective open repair in a "traditional" and "fast track" treatment arm.

 Main differences consist in preoperative bowel washout (none vs.

 3L cleaning solution) and analgesia (patient controlled analgesia vs.

 patient controlled epidural analgesia: PCA vs.

 PCEA).

 Study endpoints are morbidity and mortality, need for postoperative mechanical ventilation and length of stay (LOS) on intensive care unit (ICU).

 Fast Track Management in Elective Open Infrarenal Aortic Aneurysm Repair@highlight

Fast track programs have been introduced in many surgical fields to minimize postoperative morbidity and mortality.

 Morbidity after elective open infrarenal aneurysm repair is as high as 30%, mortality ranges up to 10%.

 In terms of open infrarenal aneurysm repair no randomized controlled trials exist to introduce and evaluate such patient care programs.
