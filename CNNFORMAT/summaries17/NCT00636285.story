(thirdQuint)Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study in Adults for the Prevention of S.

 Epidermidis Infection in Low Birth Weight Infants.

 This study will evaluate the safety of three doses of BSYX-A110 in adults before initiating studies in the target population of low birth weight infants.

 This will be an open label, dose-ranging study of BSYX-A110 in 12 adults.

 The dose levels to be evaluated are 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg.

 Each dose level will enroll 4 adult volunteers who will receive one dose of BSYX-A110 intravenously.

 The primary endpoint of this study is safety and tolerability.

 The secondary endpoints include the pharmacokinetics of the rise in anti-LTA antibody and opsonic activity against S.

 epidermidis.

 Epidermidis Infection in Low Birth Weight Infants@highlight

The purpose of this Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of BSYX-A110 in a small number of healthy adult volunteers.

 Following the demonstration of safety in adults, this anti-Staphylococcal monoclonal antibody will then be evaluated in the target population of hospitalized low birth weight neonates.
