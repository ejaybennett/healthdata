(thirdQuint)Ibuprofen or Morphine in Treating Pain in Patients Undergoing Pleurodesis for Malignant Pleural Effusion.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the efficacy of a non-steroidal based regimen comprising ibuprofen in decreasing post-pleurodesis pain as compared to an opiate-based regimen comprising morphine sulfate in patients with malignant pleural effusion.

 - To evaluate whether chest drain size influences the amount of post-pleurodesis pain.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to histological tissue type (mesothelioma vs non-mesothelioma) and thoracoscopic procedure.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a large bore chest drain (24F) on day 0 and receive oral ibuprofen 3 times daily for 3 days.

 The chest tube is removed on day 3.

 - Arm II: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a small bore chest drain (12F) on day 0 and receive oral ibuprofen 3 times daily for 3 days.

 The chest tube is removed on day 3.

 - Arm III: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a large bore chest drain (24F) on day 0 and receive oral morphine sulfate 4 times daily for 3 days.

 The chest tube is removed on day 3.

 - Arm IV: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a small bore chest drain (12F) on day 0 and receive oral morphine sulfate 4 times daily for 3 days.

 The chest tube is removed on day 3.

 All patients will receive regular background analgesia comprising paracetamol 4 times daily on days 0-3.

 Patients not adequately treated with these regimens may also receive rescue analgesia comprising morphine sulfate IV on days 0-3.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months, and periodically thereafter.

 Ibuprofen or Morphine in Treating Pain in Patients Undergoing Pleurodesis for Malignant Pleural Effusion@highlight

RATIONALE: Morphine and ibuprofen help lessen pain caused by pleurodesis.

 It is not yet known whether one drug is more effective than the other in lessening pleurodesis-related pain or whether the size of the chest drain tube affects pain.

 PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying ibuprofen to see how well it works compared with morphine in treating pain in patients undergoing pleurodesis for malignant pleural effusion.
