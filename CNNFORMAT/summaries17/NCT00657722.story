(thirdQuint)Identification of Criteria of the Success of the Endarterectomy in Chronic Pulmonary Post Embolic Hypertension.

 Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension(CTEPH) is caused by obstruction of the large pulmonary arteries by acute and recurrent pulmonary emboli, and organization of these blood clots.

 ANTOINE BECLERE respiratory unit, in partnership with the MARIE LANNELONGUE hospital thoracic and vascular surgery departments was designated recently as reference national centre for pulmonary hypertension and represents the only French structure for evaluation of CTEPH with 150 patients addressed each year.

If the disease is proximately located, CTEPH can be cured surgically through a complex surgical procedure performed under Hypothermia and total circulatory arrest.

 In spite of multidisciplinary meeting deciding the operability of each case the rate of failure is approximately of 15% (9% of operative mortality rate and 6% of technical failure).

 The aim of this study is to identify predictive angiographic and CT findings of success, by allowing a better selection of operable patients.

 It would be possible to improve the effectiveness of the surgical treatment and reduce the rate failure from 15% to 7 % or even 5 %.

In order to improve effectiveness of the surgical operation thanks to a reduction in the rate of failure, this study will allow us to identify predictive angiographic and CT finding of surgical failure, starting from standardized reading grids, in order to have a better selection of the operable patients.
