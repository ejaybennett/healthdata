(thirdQuint)Mitoxantrone  Cetuximab 2nd Line Androgen Independent Prostate Cancer (AIPC).

 This is a nonblinded, randomized phase II study to determine the activity of Novantrone (mitoxantrone) with or without Erbitux (cetuximab) in patients with androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC) who have been treated previously with docetaxel chemotherapy.

 The Novantrone (mitoxantrone)-only treatment arm will serve as a concurrent control arm to aid in the determination of the benefit of the Novantrone (mitoxantrone)-Erbitux (cetuximab) combination in this setting.

 Patients will be randomly assigned 2:1 to 1 of 2 treatment arms; 93 patients in Arm 1 and 47 patients in Arm 2.

 A balanced randomization procedure will be performed utilizing a code list that will be developed prior to the study opening.

 Because the patients will be stratified by performance status (ECOG 0 and 1 vs.

 ECOG 2), the list will be developed to ensure a balance between the 2 treatment arms.

 Mitoxantrone  Cetuximab 2nd Line Androgen Independent Prostate Cancer (AIPC)@highlight

To determine the time to progression produced by the combination of Novantrone (mitoxantrone) and Erbitux (cetuximab) versus Novantrone alone in metastatic AIPC patients previously treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy.

 TTP is defined as time from the start of treatment date to the date the patient is first recorded as having disease progression, even in patients who discontinue study treatment early due to toxicity.
