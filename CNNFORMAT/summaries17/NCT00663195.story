(firstQuint)Effects of Spironolactone on Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) in Heart Failure.

 Myocardial fibrosis is observed in failing hearts.

 MMPs are considered markers of fibrosis.

 Recently, circulating MMPs can be measured and are elevated in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).

 It has been reported that spironolactone improves myocardial fibrosis in CHF animal models.

 Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of spironolactone on circulating MMP levels in patients with chronic heart failure.
