(firstQuint)Effects of Glutamine on GLP-1 and Insulin Secretion in Man.

 In this study, will investigate the effect of glutamine, an amino acid, on GLP-1, insulin and glycaemia in normal lean subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes.

 Preliminary data published by our group suggests that glutamine is a strong determinant of GLP-1 secretion in vitro.

 We will test the hypothesis that glutamine lowers post-prandial glucose levels.

 We will also investigate whether sitagliptin modifies this effect.
