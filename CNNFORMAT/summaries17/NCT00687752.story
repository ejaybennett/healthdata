(firstQuint)Sonographic Assessment of Fetal Deglutition Associated With Hydramnion:Its Absence is Indicative of Central Nervous System (CNS) Pathology.

 310 singleton pregnancies (22-35 weeks) enrolled into the study.

 We assessed sonographically the fetal larynx in an axial plane through the mandible and observed the fetal deglutition movements .

We encountered two cases of hydramnios were no deglutition movements could be noted.

 In all other cases the deglutition was normal.

 The motivation to conduct the current observational prospective study was to assess whether there is a link between absence of fetal deglutition and CNS pathology of the fetus.

 In the first case the fetus deceased at 35 weeks of gestation; obduction was declined by the parents.

 In the second case caesarian section at 33 weeks was carried out recently due to fetal distress.

 The infant is still in uncapable of swallowing and there for is under investigation at the neonatal center of our hospital.
