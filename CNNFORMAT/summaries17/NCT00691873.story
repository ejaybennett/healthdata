(thirdQuint)Study to Evaluate the Effect of Xolair(Omalizumab) on Improving the Tolerability of Specific Immunotherapy in Patients With at Least Moderate Persistent Allergic Asthma Inadequately Controlled With Inhaled Corticosteroids.

 Omalizumab is an FDA approved anti-IgE drug used to treat allergic asthma.

 This study is designed to give omalizumab 13 weeks prior to administering rapid build up of specific allergy shot, with an overlap of omalizumab and cluster therapy for 3 weeks.

 The cluster therapy will take 4 week to complete with maintenance dosage lasting an additional 6 weeks.

In patients with at least moderate persistent allergic asthma controlled with inhaled steroids, omalizumab (administered per US product label), when compared to placebo, will provide the participants with significantly improved tolerability of specific allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots) administered per a cluster schedule(rapid build up method).
