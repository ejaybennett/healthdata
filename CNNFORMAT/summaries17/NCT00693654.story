(firstQuint)Comparative Study of the Efficacy of SARNA Sensitive Lotion for Treatment of Uremic Itch in Adult Hemodialysis Patients.

 This was a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, controlled study.

 Fourteen subjects received treatment lotion (1% pramoxine HCl) and the remaining 14 received a bland emollient (Cetaphil lotion).

 A target lesion limited to one anatomic site, excluding face and genitals, was selected at baseline.

 Each subject was instructed to apply lotion twice daily to all affected areas of pruritus for four weeks.

 The use of any other topical or systemic medication to treat uremic pruritus was not permitted while participating in the study.

 Subjects were clinically evaluated for erythema, xerosis, lichenification and overall severity at baseline, week 1, and week 4 (end of study).
