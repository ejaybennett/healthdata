(firstQuint)Follow-up Study of Chondrogen Delivered by Intra-Articular Injection Following Meniscectomy.

 The long-term safety of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) (Chondrogen) has not yet been established.

 This 3-year follow-up study will provide additional data to gain understanding of the safety of the investigational agent.

 This study is designed to determine the safety of a single intra-articular injection of 50 million donor-derived hMSCs or 150 million donor-derived hMSCs in suspension with commercial sodium hyaluronan compared to an injection of vehicle (diluted hyaluronan) alone.

 The injections were performed under the initial study, Protocol No.

 550.
