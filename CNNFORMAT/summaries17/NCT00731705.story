(thirdQuint)In-Vitro Studies in Depletion of Haplotype Mismatched Alloreactive T Cells.

 The purpose of this research is to study how immune cells (called T cells) that cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can best be selectively separated from other T cells and removed from the cells that will be returned to the cancer patient's body.

 These other T cells may protect against infection when given to patients after a stem cell transplant.

 The removal of cells that cause GVHD would allow doctors to safely give back the T cells that protect against infection, without the risk of GVHD.

The doctors in the Bone Marrow Transplant Service at the Indiana University Cancer Center are working to better understand how the immune cells that cause graft-versus-host disease (a major complication of stem cell transplantation in which the donor immune cells attack the patient's organs) can be selectively removed from the graft, leaving other immune cells that fight infections.
