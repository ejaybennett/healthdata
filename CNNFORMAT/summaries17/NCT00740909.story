 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Trichotillomania@highlight

This study aims to develop a comprehensive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy protocol for adult patients with Trichotillomania that emphasizes relapse prevention and that addresses comorbid affective symptoms, as well.

 The study will compare the efficacy of CBT with a minimal attention control (MAC)condition.

 We hypothesize that outcome at post-treatment, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up will be better for the CBT vs.

 MAC condition including higher responder rates and greater reduction in hair pulling severity.
