(secondQuint)Addition of Heparin to Taurolock-TM CLS in HD Patients With TCC Dose it Improve Catheter Patency Problems ?.

 Bacteremia and thrombosis are the major complications of TCC used for hemodialysis.

Instilation of CLS containing antibiotic-anticoagulant solution in the end of each dialysis session till the next dialysis ,can prevent Catheter related bacteremia (CRB).

In previous study in our department, Taurolock-TM decreased the rate of CRB but increased the incidence of catheter malfunction.

 The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of of Heparin addition to CLS-Taurolock- TM ( Taurolidine &citrate 4%) in prevention of catheter patency problems in HD patients with TCC, in addition to CRB prevention.

 Methods : Patients with newly inserted TCC for HD enrolled and randomized to receive one of three CLS types : group 1- Taurolock-TM, Group 2 - Taurolock-TM and Heparin , Group 3- Heparin .

Patients were followed for 6 monthes.

 The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of Taurolock TM with heparin on the rate of CRB and vascular patency.

 Addition of Heparin to Taurolock-TM CLS in HD Patients With TCC Dose it Improve Catheter Patency Problems ?@highlight

Addition of Heparin to the Catheter Lock Solution (CLS): Taurolock-TM will improve the vascular patency compared to Taurolock-TM alone , in hemodialysis patients with Tunneled Cuffed Catheter(TCC) as vascular access.
