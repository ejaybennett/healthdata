(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Safety Study of Vandetanib (ZD 6474) in Combination With Bicalutamide Versus Bicalutamide Alone in Patients With Chemotherapy Naive Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer.

.

 With the advent of PSA surveillance, many patients diagnosed with hormone refractory disease, have PSA rising disease only, are asymptomatic, with no evidence of metastatic disease.

 There is no standard of care in this patient population.

 A standard treatment in this population has been the addition of a non-steroidal anti androgen such as bicalutamide.

 PSA response rate (defined as a 50% decrease) have been reported in 20% range with bicalutamide.

 Even in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) and metastases that have no cancer related symptoms, initiation of chemotherapy is controversial given the palliative nature of chemotherapy and potential for serious toxicity.

 These patients are generally well enough to to undergo trials of novel agents and achieve adequate drug exposure, such that any cytostatic effect will be apparent.
