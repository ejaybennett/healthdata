(secondQuint)A Safety and Efficacy Study of Lansoprazole in Preventing Aspirin-Induced Gastric and Duodenal Ulcers.

 In Japan, low-dose aspirin is one of the commonly prescribed drugs for inhibiting thrombosis and thrombus formation after angina, myocardial infarction, ischemic cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery by-pass surgery and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in patients.

 While low-dose aspirin is effective in these cases, its use sometimes causes gastric and duodenal ulcers which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, and in worse cases may lead to death.

 The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of lansoprazole versus gefarnate in patients with a history of gastric or duodenal ulcers receiving daily low dose aspirin therapy.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether lansoprazole, once daily (QD), compared to gefarnate, twice daily (BID), is effective in preventing the recurrence of gastric and duodenal ulcers in patients receiving long term treatment with low dosage aspirin.
