(secondQuint)Elucidation and Monitoring Postprandial Endothelial Function.

 Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a hallmark for the initial stage of vascular dysfunction and has been associated with diet-related disorders such as cardiovascular disease.

 This makes prevention of ED an important health target.

 From previous studies we know that a high-fat (HF) meal (challenge) impairs postprandial endothelial function (EF).

 Current studies only evaluated the effect of a HF meal on Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD), a measure of macro vascular EF.

 This methodology (FMD) however, is time consuming and large variations in reproducibility are reported in literature.

 The question remains whether other types of macro- and micro vascular EF measurements can be used to observe ED after a HF meal that are more accurate, faster and easier to perform.

 In addition, it is know that the postprandial phase results in activation of leukocytes.

 This activation of leukocytes is likely to contribute to ED, but the exact underling mechanism remains unclear.

 Elucidation and Monitoring Postprandial Endothelial Function@highlight

The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a high fat challenge on several measures of endothelial function.

 The secondary aim of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of postprandial endothelial dysfunction and to identify early biomarkers
