(secondQuint)Compassionate Use of Omegaven IV Fat Emulsion.

 Intravenous lipids are necessary in PN (parenteral nutrition) dependent patients due to their high caloric value and essential fatty acid content.

 However, parenteral fat emulsions composed of soybean oils (omega 6 fatty acids) have been implicated in predisposing patients to PN associated liver disease.

 It is hypothesized that by administering Omegaven(R), comprised of fish oil (omega 3 fatty acids) in place of conventional soybean fat emulsion, the progression of PN-associated cholestasis may be prevented or reversed.

This is a compassionate use protocol to use intravenous fish oil infusion, Omegaven(R), to infants and children with parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease to enable reversal of elevated serum liver enzymes and direct bilirubin (cholestasis).
