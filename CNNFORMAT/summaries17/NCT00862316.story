(secondQuint)Oxford Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty With and Without Navigational Unit.

 The ability to use a computerized navigational unit during knee arthroplasty can be a major benefit to surgeons that perform a small amount of knee arthroplasties.

 Navigational assistance can decrease surgery and anesthesia time as well as decreasing variation in posterior tibial slope and improved range of motion.
