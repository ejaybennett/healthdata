(firstQuint)Endurant Stent Graft Natural Selection Global Postmarket Registry.

 The Endurant Stent Graft Natural Selection Global Post-market Registry, ENGAGE is initiated to expand the clinical knowledge base by including 'real world' subjects, applying a minimal amount of subject selection criteria.

 This subject group may better represent the subject profile treated in actual clinical practice without selecting sub-groups of particular low/high risk or excluding certain diseases.

 ENGAGE aims at following and documenting the subject selections, diagnostic tools used and treatment interventions chosen by the vascular surgeon or interventional radiologist.

 ENGAGE will not impose CIP required study procedures affecting clinical practice.
