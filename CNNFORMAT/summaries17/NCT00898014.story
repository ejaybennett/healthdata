(thirdQuint)Blood Levels of Tumor Cells in Predicting Response in Patients Receiving First-Line Chemotherapy for Stage IV Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Predict the overall and progression-free survival of patients with stage IV breast cancer by measuring the rate of circulating tumor cells (CTC) before the second course of chemotherapy.

 Secondary - Predict overall and progression-free survival of these patients by measuring the rate of CTC before the start of chemotherapy, at the first tumor evaluation, and after 2-3 courses of chemotherapy.

 - Correlate the detection of CTC with tumor markers, clinical response, and radiological response.

 - Study the changing status of HER-2 in CTC in patients receiving trastuzmab (Herceptin(R)).

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Blood samples are collected at baseline, before the second course of chemotherapy, before the third or fourth course of chemotherapy, and when progressive disease is diagnosed (before second-line treatment is initiated).

 Circulating tumor cells from the blood samples are examined by immunofluorescence.

 Patients are followed periodically for up to 3 months.

RATIONALE: Measuring blood levels of tumor cells in patients with breast cancer may help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

 PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at blood levels of tumor cells in predicting response in patients receiving first-line chemotherapy for stage IV breast cancer.
