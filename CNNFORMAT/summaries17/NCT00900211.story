(thirdQuint)Tissue Sample Collection From Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Arms, Hands, Legs, or Feet Treated on Clinial Trial CRUK-VORTEX.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine early in the course of treatment which patients treated on clinical trial CRUK-VORTEX have an increased likelihood of distant metastases so as to highlight individuals who might benefit from early adjuvant systemic therapy.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Tumour and normal tissue samples will be taken at the time of surgery during treatment on clinical trial CRUK-VORTEXand preserved for future microarray analyses.

 Tissue microarrays will be produced from both tumor and normal tissues.

 Blood samples will be collected for future DNA analysis.
