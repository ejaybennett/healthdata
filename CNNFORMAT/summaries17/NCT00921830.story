(secondQuint)Pharmacokinetics of 3 Formulations of Ibuprofen Suppositories.

 Ibuprofen is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic in adults and children.

 Two ibuprofen suppository formulations have been developed for pediatric use to facilitate dosing in younger age groups.

 This is a single-dose, balanced, randomised, three-period crossover study in healthy male and female adult volunteers.

 Each volunteer will receive a single dose of 50 mg ibuprofen as a suppository, a single dose of 200 mg ibuprofen as a suppository and a single oral dose of 200 mg ibuprofen (tablet).

 There will be 14 blood samples taken over 12 hours in each study period.

 Concentrations in plasma of ibuprofen and its S and R enantiomers will be measured using a validated chromatographic method.

 Standard pharmacokinetic parameters will be obtained and bioavailability on the basis of rate and extent of drug absorption will be assessed.
