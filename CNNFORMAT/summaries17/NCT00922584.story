(thirdQuint)Sorafenib Treatment in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer After Failure of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor.

 Sorafenib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, targets the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway at the level of Raf kinase and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, and has shown efficacy against NSCLC in Phase I/II trials.

 Because the targets of sorafenib are different from that of EGFR-TKI, it is reasonable for sorafenib to treat relapsed advanced NSCLC after failure of EGFR-TKI treatment.

 Sorafenib Treatment in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer After Failure of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor@highlight

This trial's aim is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of sorafenib in relapsed advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) after failure of epidermal growth factor receptors-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment and to explore the correlation between clinical outcomes and biochemical modulation of signal transduction pathways.
