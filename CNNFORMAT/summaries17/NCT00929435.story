(thirdQuint)Incidence of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Carriage Rates in Resident Physicians.

 This is a prospective observational study looking at the incidence of MRSA colonization.

 New residents will be monitored every month with nasal swabs.

We would like to elucidate factors responsible for MRSA colonization in healthcare workers.

We would like to see if health care workers who are colonized spontaneously cleared MRSA and if there was any factors involved.

 Nasal swabs will be plated on the spot by trained individuals and the plates then incubated for 48 hours.

 Plates will be read by microbiologist after incubation.

 Incidence of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Carriage Rates in Resident Physicians@highlight

One hundred new residents will be recruited prior to the start of residency and followed prospectively for a year.

 Monthly nasal swabs will be performed to identify colonization with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

The proportion of study subjects colonized with MRSA at the end of 1 year will be calculated.
