(fifthQuint)S8809-S9800-S9911-S9704-A Study of Blood and Tissue Samples From Patients With Follicular Lymphoma Treated With Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin Hydrochloride, Vincristine, and Prednisone.

 OBJECTIVES: - To test for association of polymorphisms in Fc-gamma (Fc) receptors IIa (H/R131) and IIIa (V/F158) with progression-free survival and clinical response in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with rituximab and CHOP chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, and prednisone.

 - To assess novel polymorphisms in Fc receptors for predictive and prognostic significance in patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: Genomic DNA extracted from paired samples of serum and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue is analyzed for R131H polymorphism in Fc receptor IIa and V158F polymorphism in Fc receptor IIIa by TaqMan-based assay.

 The DNA is also analyzed for genotypes corresponding with several other polymorphisms in Fc receptors, as determined by the HapMap project.

 The resulting Fc receptor genotypes are then compared with clinical data from the Southwest Oncology Group database to identify associations between particular genotypes and progression-free survival, overall response, and complete response.

 A multivariate analysis incorporating clinical prognostic variables (e.

g.

, age, stage, serum LDH level, extranodal disease, and performance status) is also performed to determine whether Fc receptor polymorphisms are independent predictive or prognostic markers for clinical outcome.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

 PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood and tissue samples from patients with follicular lymphoma treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, and prednisone.
