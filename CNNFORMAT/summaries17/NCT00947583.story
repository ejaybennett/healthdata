(fifthQuint)Osteocel Plus in Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF).

 This is a prospective, non-randomized multi-center study to compare the use of Osteocel Plus in subjects who receive TLIF surgery at one or two levels.

 These subjects will present with degenerative conditions in the lumbar spine that are amenable to surgical treatment and will be screened prior to study enrollment.

 Subjects will receive Osteocel Plus during their TLIF operation.

 Subjects will be followed for 24-months following surgery to determine the number of study subjects that are solidly fused at or before 24 months postoperatively, and to determine the mean time to fusion.

 This data will be compared to published and/or retrospective data for autograft, synthetic ceramics and BMP.

 Osteocel Plus in Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF)@highlight

This study is being conducted to determine the percentage of patients with solid spinal fusions after being treated with Osteocel Plus in a TLIF procedure.

 Due to the unique processing conditions, Osteocel Plus retains a high concentration of stem cells in conjunction with the allograft bone matrix, so it is hypothesized that the fusion rate with Osteocel Plus will be comparable to published data for autograft.

 The Osteocel product family has already been used in approximately 15,000 cases worldwide.
