(secondQuint)Femoral Versus Psoas Continuous Peripheral Nerve Blocks Following Hip Arthroplasty.

 To determine the association between perineural catheter location and postoperative analgesia, analgesic requirements, ambulatory distance, and flexion following hip arthroplasty.

 Primary Hypothesis: Differing the catheter insertion site (femoral vs.

 psoas compartment) for a perineural local anesthetic infusion is not associated with lower pain scores during the 24-hour period beginning the morning following hip arthroplasty.

The purpose of this research study is to determine if the insertion site of a perineural catheter, or tiny tube placed next to the nerves that go to the hip which you will have surgery, affects the amount of pain relief that is experienced after surgery.
