(thirdQuint)Incidence of Iron Deficiency Anemia in Toddlers.

 The purpose of this study is to analyze the frequency of Iron deficiency anemia in a group of 400 toddles from age 18 months to 36 months.

 Two groups of children will be included, 200 children from Jewish origin and 200 from non Jewish origin, mostly Arabs.

 A questionnaire that included demographic characteristics, nutrition and iron supplementation in the first year, growth status, and laboratory results will be filled for each patient.

 The laboratory analysis will include complete blood count and serum ferritin analysis.

 Children that were previously diagnosed suffering from iron deficiency, children suffering from chronic diseases or were born premature will not be included in the study.

 Incidence of Iron Deficiency Anemia in Toddlers@highlight

The frequency of iron deficiency anemia was extensively studied in infants on the first year of life.

 There is not enough information about the frequency of iron deficiency during the second and third years of life.

 In a previous study performed in Israel and published in Pediatrics 2006 the incidence of anemia does not decrease towards age 18 months.

 Then there is reasonable to study the iron deficiency frequency beyond this age.
