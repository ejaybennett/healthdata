(firstQuint)The Effect of Ketamine on Interleukin-6 Synthesis in Hepatic Resections Requiring Temporary Porto-arterial Occlusion.

 Introduction: Many complications in liver resection surgery, such as post-operative hepatic insufficiency, sepsis, and multi-organ liver failure, have been attributed to ischemia-reperfusion injury and the release of pro-inflammatory agents.

 Previous studies had shown that ketamine inhibited the synthesis of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in some cardiac surgeries, and that IL-6 levels had a direct correlation with mortality in critically ill patients.

 Goal: The purpose of our study was to determine the effect of ketamine on IL-6 levels in patients undergoing liver resections with temporary porto-arterial occlusion (Pringle maneuver).

 Material and Methods: Our prospective, controlled, randomized, and blinded study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Hospital Italiano of Buenos Aires (CEPI).

 All procedures were carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinski.

 All patients voluntarily consented to the study and signed the appropriate informed consent approved by the CEPI.

 Inclusion criteria were age of 21 years or older and planned liver resection with Pringle maneuver lasting 30-60 minutes.

 Those with chronic illness requiring corticosteroids, cirrhosis, hemodynamic instability prior to the surgery, diabetes, sepsis, surgical interventions or chemotherapy treatments within the past 30 days, pregnancy, illnesses that could potentially affect the hepatic circulation, arterial or ocular hypertension (contraindications for the use of ketamine), ketamine allergy, preoperative portal embolization / radiofrequency ablation, or requiring emergency surgeries were not considered.

 From March 2002 to June 2008, 44 consecutive patients agreed to participate and were enrolled in the study.

 Those who did not require the Pringle maneuver during the resection, who did not undergo the planned procedure, or whose hematocrit was less than 20% for over 30 minutes were excluded.

 Patients were assigned to one of two groups according to a computer generated randomization.

 The study group received ketamine 0.

25 mg/kg, while the control group was administered an identical volume of saline.

 Syringes containing 10 ml of either ketamine or saline were delivered by the hospital pharmacy personnel to the corresponding anesthesiologist, who was blinded to their contents.

 In order to calculate the correct dose that was administered immediately after induction of anesthesia, the ketamine and placebo concentration was established at 10 mg/ml.

 Both anesthesia and surgical teams were the same in all cases.

 Members of both teams, as well as all personnel involved with blood collection remained blinded at all times.

 All patients were transported to the operating room with an intravenous line in place and premedicated with midazolam 0.

04 mg/Kg.

 Once in the operating room, they received intravenous antibiotics, non-invasive cardiac monitoring, blood pressure monitoring, and pulse oxymetry.

 Remifentanil 0.

25 micrograms/kg/min was administered prior to induction with sodium thiopental 2-2.

5 mg/Kg.

 Vecuronium 0.

1 mg/Kg was used for muscle relaxation.

 After waiting approximately 3 minutes, patients were intubated endotracheally and a nasogastric tube was placed.

 Remifentanil 0.

5 micrograms/kg/min, ibuprofen 10 mg/Kg, and morphine 0.

15 mg/kg were administered during the case.

 Anesthesia was maintained with Sevorane in the setting of an FiO2 of 0.

70.

 Mechanical ventilation was adjusted to allow an EtCO2 of 25-30 mmHg and a plateau pressure 100 picograms/mL difference among both groups with a SD 50 picograms/mL among both groups, a total of 36 patients were randomized.

 P<0.

05 was considered significant.
