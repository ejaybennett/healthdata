(thirdQuint)Methemoglobinemia in Young Patients With Hematologic Cancer or Aplastic Anemia Treated With Dapsone.

 OBJECTIVES: - Define the incidence of methemoglobinemia in patients with hematologic malignancy or aplastic anemia who received dapsone prophylaxis through a retrospective chart review encompassing the last 15 years.

 - Identify major risk factors for developing methemoglobinemia.

 OUTLINE: Medical charts are reviewed.

 Of particular interest is demographic information, reasons for beginning dapsone prophylaxis, duration of dapsone prophylaxis, dapsone dosing, methemoglobin level, and treatment with methylene blue.
