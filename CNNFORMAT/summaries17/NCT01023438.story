(secondQuint)Strategies to Improve Prescribing in Heart Failure Patients.

 Heart failure is highly prevalent, particularly in elderly subjects, and costly, mainly because of the high rate of recurrent hospital admissions.

 Although guideline-recommended treatments, such as beta-blockers and renin-angiotensin inhibitors, are effective on both mortality and morbidity, these drugs are very often underprescribed or used at lower doses than those shown to be beneficial in clinical trials, particularly in the primary care setting, for fear of adverse events.

 Although referral to specialist services may improve prescription of recommended drugs and doses achieved, frequent consultations may be unfeasible and costly.

The study is designed to assess whether active specialist support and educational material improve the prescription process for heart failure patients in primary care.
