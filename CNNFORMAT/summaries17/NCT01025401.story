(thirdQuint)Characterization of Epileptic Motor Patterns by Tridimensional Analysis of Movement 2.

 CAPAMETRIM 2 aims to characterize epileptic motor patterns by a quantitative three-dimensional analysis of movements.

 The project is planned in three phases: - Installation of 3-D accelerometric and magnetic sensors acquisition systems on the hospital (extension of a preceding study CAPAMETRIM).

 - Collection of data on epileptic patients.

 Sensors will be positioned on the right and left hands and on the head.

 A 3-D analysis of movements will be done according to the collection by tagging data with visual analysis made on video.

 - Development of a motor pattern classification system used for seizure detection.

 Characterization of Epileptic Motor Patterns by Tridimensional Analysis of Movement 2@highlight

CAPAMETRIM 2 aims to characterize epileptic motor patterns by a quantitative three-dimensional analysis of movements.

 This is done to obtain a 3-D motor signature of seizures, for a given patient, and allows their detection with an ambulatory monitoring system.

 The benefit for patients is to improve the diagnosis of their diseases by better characterizing their seizures.
