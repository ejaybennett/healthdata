(thirdQuint)UFUR (Tegafur/Uracil) Plus Iressa in Non-small-cell Lung Cancer.

 Iressa is a selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI).

 It is an orally active agent for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in those who have failed a previous platinum-based regimen and taxane treatment.

 UFUR (Tegafur/Uracil) is effective agent against chemo-naive NSCLC.

 It has anti-angiogenesis effect when used as long-term low dose treatment.

 Present phase II randomized clinical trial is designed to answer whether or not adding an oral anti-angiogenesis agent (UFUR), that has low toxicity profiles when long term use, to EGFR-TKI (Iressa) could increase patients survival and response rate.

 UFUR (Tegafur/Uracil) Plus Iressa in Non-small-cell Lung Cancer@highlight

Iressa [epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)] has been reported to activity against Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) failed previous chemotherapy.

 UFUR was found to have anti-angiogenesis effect when long term treatment was given.

 Combination of EGFR-TKI and anti-angiogenesis agents is a novel treatment.
