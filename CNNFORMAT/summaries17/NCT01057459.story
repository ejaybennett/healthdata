(thirdQuint)DNA Analysis in Predicting Response to Antibody Therapy in Patients With Follicular Lymphoma Treated on Clinical Trials CALGB-50402 or CALGB-50701.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: l.

 To test the hypothesis that killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes predict overall response (partial response [PR], complete response[CR], and unconfirmed complete response [CRu]) within 12 months to rituximab-containing monoclonal antibody combinations in follicular lymphoma patients treated on CALGB protocols 50402 and 50701.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To test the hypothesis that KIR and HLA genotypes are associated with survival outcomes (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]) in follicular lymphoma patients treated with rituximab-containing monoclonal antibody combinations on CALGB protocols 50402 and 50701.

 OUTLINE: Genomic DNA is extracted from previously collected blood samples for KIR and HLA genotyping and polymorphism analysis.

 DNA Analysis in Predicting Response to Antibody Therapy in Patients With Follicular Lymphoma Treated on Clinical Trials CALGB-50402 or CALGB-50701@highlight

This research trial studies deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis in predicting response to antibody therapy in patients with follicular lymphoma treated on clinical trials Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)-50402 or CALGB-50701.

 Studying samples of blood from patients with follicular lymphoma in the laboratory may help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment.
