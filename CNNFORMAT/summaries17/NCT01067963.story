(thirdQuint)Self-Management and Resourceful Transition of Type 2 Diabetes With Stage 3 Kidney Disease.

 The SMaRT intervention is a 3-week intervention that uses a combined behavioral-education and counseling methodology.

 The combined intervention involves computer-aided education alongside telephone counseling via motivational interviewing.

 The computer-aided education is tailored to the diagnoses of type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease and designed in a learning module approach to facilitate goal-setting and discussion of health concerns with greater efficacy and in a more informed way during the brief office visit.

 Such Computer-aided education has been used to improve diabetes self-management and glycemic control in middle-aged to older adults with moderate success.

 The inclusion of CKD information will augment current diabetes self-management intervention.

 The telephone counseling using the evidence-based behavioral change approach of motivational interviewing is a patient-centered approach of partnering with patients by eliciting their health-related concerns.

 This approach tailors the SMaRT intervention to include collaborative goal-setting with guidance based upon the patient's readiness for change.
