(fifthQuint)Calcitonin Gene-related Peptide Levels in Chronic Migraine.

 This double-blind study will evaluate reduction in number of headache days following treatment with OnabotulinumtoxinA versus Saline.

 Additionally, CGRP levels in saliva will be correlated with a reduction in headache attacks.

 At Visit 1, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive injections of OnabotulinumtoxinA or Saline in an identical manner.

 Subjects will collect 3 saliva samples during each month of the 7 month study: 1 collection at Baseline headache level, 1 collection at onset of headache that is one degree worse than Baseline level that will be treated with acute therapy, and 1 collection at 2 hours following treatment.

 Subjects will document headache and headache symptoms in a daily diary and return to the clinic with diary and saliva samples at monthly visits.

 Following 4 months (including a 1 month washout after Visit 4), subjects will return at Visit 5 and receive cross-over injections.

 Subjects randomized to OnabotulinumtoxinA at Visit 1 will receive injections of Saline.

 Subjects randomized to saline at Visit 1 will receive injections of OnabotulinumtoxinA.

 Subjects will document headache and headache symptoms in a daily diary and return to the clinic with diary and saliva samples at monthly visits.

 At Visit 8, 3 months following re-injection at Visit 5, subjects will exit the study.

 Calcitonin Gene-related Peptide Levels in Chronic Migraine@highlight

Twenty patients will be enrolled in a 2-site, 7-month, double-blind study conducted to evaluate a reduction in headache days and attacks and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) levels in saliva following treatment with OnabotulinumtoxinA versus saline.

 Eligible patients will be randomized and receive injections of OnabotulinumtoxinA or Saline at Visit 1.

 Following 3 months plus a 1 month wash out, patients will receive cross-over injections at Visit 5.

 Patients will return for monthly visits and exit the study at Visit 8.

 Patients will collect saliva at monthly intervals and document in a daily headache diary throughout the study .
