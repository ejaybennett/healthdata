(secondQuint)Vessel Wall Response of the Bio-Active-stent and Everolimus-Eluting Stent Assessed By Optical Coherence Tomography.

 A prospective, randomized and controlled study comparing the coverage of the BAS and EES implanted in acute coronary syndrome.

 Clinical follow-up at 1, 6, 12 and 18 months.

 OCT analysis at the time of the 6 to 8 months follow-up.

 Vessel Wall Response of the Bio-Active-stent and Everolimus-Eluting Stent Assessed By Optical Coherence Tomography@highlight

The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the completeness of struts coverage and vessel wall response (strut malapposition, neoin-timal formation) to the bio-active-stent (BAS) versus ever-olimus-eluting stent (EES) implanted for the treatment of the culprit lesion in acute coronary syndrome.
