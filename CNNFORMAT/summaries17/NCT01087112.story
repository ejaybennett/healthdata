 Mother-Infant Psychoanalysis Project of Stockholm (MIPPS)- Follow-up at 4 Years@highlight

An RCT comparing mother-infant psychoanalytic treatment (MIP) with Child Health Centre care in cases of mother-infant relationship disturbances was performed on 80 cases in Stockholm 2005-2008.

 The infants were < 18 months at interview #1.

 At 6 months follow-ups, significant effects were shown in favour of MIP on maternal sensitivity (EAS), depression (EPDS), and relationship qualities PIR-GAS).

 This study will evaluate effects at a child age of 4 1/2 years; to evaluate the longterm effects of MIP and CHild Health Centre care, and to better validate results on children who now have reached an age where they can participate more actively in evaluations.
