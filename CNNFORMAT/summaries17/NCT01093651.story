(secondQuint)Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibition and Immune Function in HIV.

 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection and treatment with antiretroviral therapies are associated with several cardiometabolic risk factors; insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, central adiposity, that increase risk for MI and stroke.

 A new class of drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes has been introduced; Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPPIV)-inhibitors (Januvia(R), Onglyza(R), alogliptin).

 Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPPIV)-inhibition could be a safe and effective therapy for HIV-associated insulin resistance and diabetes.

 However, no safety data exist.

 The research question is: If HIV+ adults with stable immunologic (CD4+ T-cell count >350 cells/1/2L) and virologic (plasma HIV RNA levels; a potent inhibitor of HIV-entry into T-cells, or harm the HIV+ immune system by inactivating CD26 on immune cells.

 We hypothesize that DPPIV-inhibition will not harm the immune system in HIV+ people.

 We propose a blinded randomized controlled pilot safety trial of an FDA-approved DPPIV-inhibitor in virologically- and immunologically-stable HIV+ men and women.

 We will monitor CD4+ T-cell count, plasma HIV RNA levels, immune activation markers, and safety outcomes (lipid/lipoprotein profiles, blood pressure, kidney and liver function) during 4-6 months of DPPIV-inhibitor exposure vs placebo in 20 HIV+ adults.

 If safety is confirmed, the efficacy of DPPIV-inhibition in HIV+ with insulin resistance will be tested in future trials that examine potential glucoregulatory and cardiovascular benefits.

We will test the safety of a new class of anti-diabetes compounds (DPPIV-inhibitors) in people living with HIV.

 Future trials will examine efficacy for treating diabetes and reducing cardiovascular disease risk in people living with HIV.
