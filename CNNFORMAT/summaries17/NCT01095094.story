(thirdQuint)Ritonavir and Lopinavir in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent High-Grade Glioma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival in patients with recurrent or progressive high grade gliomas treated with ritonavir and lopinavir.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the toxicity of ritonavir and lopinavir in this patient population.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral ritonavir and lopinavir twice daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

 Ritonavir and Lopinavir in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent High-Grade Glioma@highlight

RATIONALE: Ritonavir and lopinavir may stop the growth of gliomas by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving ritonavir together with lopinavir works in treating patients with progressive or recurrent high-grade glioma.
