(secondQuint)Bioavailability and Vascular Effects of Apple Polyphenols.

 This study is a randomized four phase crossover trial investigating the bioavailability of apple flavanols and the effects on nitric oxide products, a surrogate marker for changes in endothelial function.

 Each test phase will comprise a 3 day period of intervention which will be identical in nature (except for the test product consumed) and separated by a minimum of 1 week.

 On days 1-3 of each test phase volunteers will consume a low flavanol diet.

 After consumption of the test product on the morning of day 2, blood and urine samples will be collected at regular intervals for the next 24h.

 Bioavailability and Vascular Effects of Apple Polyphenols@highlight

The main purpose of this study is to determine the oral bioavailability of flavanols (polyphenolic compounds) from apple granules and an apple extract delivered in a water based beverage at two different doses.

 We will also investigate the effects of apple flavanols on nitric oxide production.
