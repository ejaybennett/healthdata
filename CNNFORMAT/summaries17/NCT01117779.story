(thirdQuint)Tracking Renal Tumors After Cryoablation Evaluation.

 The registry is non-interventional; it will neither direct the cryoablation procedures performed nor define the post-surgery follow-up of each subject.

 A subject's participation in the registry will not influence or direct subject treatment procedures or follow-up care.

 Physicians will use their discretion and personal standards of care to select subjects, perform the cryoablation procedures and define appropriate follow-up visit schedules for their subjects; it is anticipated that subjects will be seen at least once per year during the five-year follow-up period of TRACE.

 Subjects may be followed by the physician performing the cryoablation procedure or by their local/personal physician.

 The enrolling physician will be responsible for providing the follow-up data to the registry and will, as appropriate, work with a subject's local/personal physician to collect the follow-up data.
