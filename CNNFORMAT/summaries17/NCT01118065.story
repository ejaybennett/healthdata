(thirdQuint)Everolimus in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent, Unresectable, or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the efficacy of everolimus in patients with progressive or recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

 Secondary - To determine maximum percentage of tumor reduction in these patients.

 - To describe activity time to event endpoints.

 - To assess toxicity.

 - To determine evolution of serum thyroglobulin.

 - To perform explorative pharmacogenomic, pharmacokinetic, and translational studies.

 (exploratory) - To investigate efficacy of everolimus in patients with progressive or recurrent, unresectable or metastatic disease of undifferentiated (anaplastic) or medullary thyroid cancer.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Everolimus in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent, Unresectable, or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well everolimus works in treating patients with progressive or recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic thyroid cancer.
