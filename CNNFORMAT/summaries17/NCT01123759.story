 Exposure to methylmercury, a developmental toxicant found primarily in fish.

 Fish is nutritionally important for providing long chain omega-3 fatty acids that are important for perinatal health.

 Since maternal transfer of mercury and omega-3 fatty acids are the primary routes for fetal (placental transfer) or infant (maternal milk) exposure, there is a critical need to develop specific advice for childbearing-aged women based upon the 2004 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee's recommended intake i.

e.

, consume 8 ounces of fish per week.

 This clinical trial investigates whether weekly consumption of selected fish species for 12 weeks can improve plasma concentrations of the omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) while reducing hair or blood mercury concentrations.

Fish can provide pregnant women with omega-3 fatty acids for fetal brain development but some fish contains high levels of mercury which is detrimental to fetal brain development.

 The hypothesis is that women who have previously consumed high mercury fish can reduce the mercury level in their bodies and improve their omega-3 levels in three months by eating fish that is high in omega-3 fatty acids and low in mercury.
