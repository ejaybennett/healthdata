(fifthQuint)Functional and Anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of Chronic Brain Injury and Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO2) Study Subjects.

 In an ongoing feasibility study (HYBOBI), brain-injured subjects are exposed to hyperbaric oxygen at 1.

5 atmospheres for 60 minutes.

 They receive this exposure five days per week, and receive 60 total sessions.

 Prior to hyperbaric oxygen, these study subjects have neurologic, cognitive, and functional measures.

 The measures are repeated at the conclusion of 60 hyperbaric oxygen sessions, and again six months later.

 The goal of the HYBOBI feasibility study is to learn about these patients and determine possible hyperbaric oxygen effects, if any, to prepare for a blinded randomized controlled clinical trial.

 This study adds an imaging component to the HYBOBI study, further investigating brain changes in participants.

 Participants will undergo Brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) using a 3 tesla magnet, and Brain CT (Computed Tomography) Angiogram.

 Subjects will undergo imaging before receiving hyperbaric oxygen and within 2 weeks of completion of the 60 hyperbaric sessions.

 Functional and Anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of Chronic Brain Injury and Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO2) Study Subjects@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate Brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), and Brain CT (Computed Tomography) Angiogram data in subjects who participate in the "Hyperbaric Oxygen for Chronic Stable Brain Injury" (HYBOBI) study.

 Including information from MRI and CT studies provide information about whether hyperbaric oxygen improves brain function in subjects who have had a brain injury.

 Subjects will complete MR and CT scans twice during the study.

 The first MR and CT will be performed prior to the first hyperbaric session of the HYBOBI study, and the second will be performed within two weeks following the last hyperbaric session.
