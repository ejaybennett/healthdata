(fifthQuint)Efficacy Against TB Disease, Safety, and Immunogenicity of MVA85A/AERAS-485 in HIV-Infected Adults (C-030-485).

 This Phase II multi-country trial was conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 650 HIV-positive adults with no evidence of active TB disease.

 Subjects were stratified at the time of randomization by whether or not they were receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and then randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either MVA85A/AERAS-485 at 1 x 10^8 plaque forming units (pfu) or placebo (Candin).

 Randomization of each group was capped so that at least 50% of the subjects randomized were receiving ART at randomization.

 Subjects were to receive an intradermal injection of MVA85A/AERAS-485 or placebo on Study Day 0, followed 6-9 months later by a booster injection of MVA85A/AERAS-485 or placebo.

 The minimum follow-up period for each subject was 6 months after their last vaccination, during which subjects were followed for safety, clinical signs and symptoms of TB, and immunogenicity.

 All subjects were to continue to be followed every 3 months until the last subject enrolled had been followed for 6 months after their last vaccination.

 Efficacy Against TB Disease, Safety, and Immunogenicity of MVA85A/AERAS-485 in HIV-Infected Adults (C-030-485)@highlight

This is a phase II, proof of concept, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the protective efficacy against TB disease, safety, and immunogenicity of MVA85A/AERAS-485 in healthy, HIV-infected adults.

 This study consists of 650 adults subjects (ages 18-50 years of age inclusive) who will receive study vaccine or placebo at Study Day 0 and again 6-9 months later.

 Samples for real-time evaluation of immunogenicity were to be collected from 70 subjects (immunogenicity analysis set).
