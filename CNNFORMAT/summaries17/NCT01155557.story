(thirdQuint)The Effect of Specific Strength-Training on Tension-Type Headache in Children 9-17 Years.

 Frequent and chronic tension type headache are the most frequent pain illnesses in children with a prevalence of 0.

5-7,6%.

 Frequent or daily headache leads to constraints in the child's life in relation to school and social activities.

 The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet fully examined.

 In several studies in adults and in children it is found that the shoulder muscles are tense and tender, but it is not known whether this phenomenon is primary or secondary to tension-type headache.

 A decrease in muscle capacity is furthermore found in studies.

 We therefore aim at examining parameters for muscle function in order to compare the differences between children with and without headache, and at examining the effect of a 10 week progressive specific strength training programme on headache compared to an in time comparable multidisciplinary intervention based on lifestyle counseling.

 The Effect of Specific Strength-Training on Tension-Type Headache in Children 9-17 Years@highlight

This study aims at examining muscle strength capacity in neck and shoulder muscles in children and adolescents with and without tension-type headache, and furthermore examining the effect of a 10 week specific strength training programme for neck and shoulder muscles compared to a multi-disciplinary approach in 10 weeks.
