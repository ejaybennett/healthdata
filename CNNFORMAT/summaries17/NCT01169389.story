(firstQuint)Analgesic Control Following Knee Arthroscopy.

 There is increasing evidence of the toxic effects of intraarticular administration of local anaesthetic.

 Hyaluronic acid supplementation given at the time of knee arthroscopy has not been fully evaluated as a possible alternative.

 We have studied the efficacy of a hyaluronic acid (HA) supplement (Durolane(R)) and a local anaesthetic (Bupivacaine) at providing early and short-term post-operative analgesic control following knee arthroscopy.

Patients will be randomised to receive either 10mls of 0.

5% Bupivacaine or 10mls of Durolane(R) into the joint immediately after completion of surgery.

 WOMAC and Tegner-Lysholm scores were obtained at baseline then at 1, 2, and 6-weeks post surgery.

 VAS pain scores were obtained at baseline; 1 and 24-hours; and 1, 2 and 6 weeks following surgery.

This study aims to investigate the analgesic effects offered by bupivacaine and Durolane (a hyaluronic acid supplement) administered immediately following the completion of knee arthroscopy.
