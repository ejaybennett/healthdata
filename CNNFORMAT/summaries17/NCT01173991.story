(secondQuint)Carbohydrate Counting in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes Treated With Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion.

 This study was designed as a randomized, controlled (versus standard education), open, one-center trial.

 Patients in group 1 were taught carbohydrate counting to estimate insulin preprandial bolus, while the patients in group 2 followed standard education.

 Primary outcome (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) and secondary outcomes (fasting glucose, glycemic variability, insulin requirement, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, quality of life) were measured at baseline, 3, and 6 months.

The investigators postulate that carbohydrate (CHO) counting in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) may improve glycemic control, glycemic variability and quality of life.
