(thirdQuint)Intact Vagal Innervation and Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Effects.

 GLP-1 is a potent enterogastron and incretin hormone.

 It is rapidly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase IV so only 10-15% enters the systemic circulation.

 This has led to the hypothesis that GLP-1 interact locally with afferent sensory nerve fibers.

 We investigated the role of intact vagal innervations on the effect of GLP-1 on the food intake, gastric emptying (GE) and appetite.

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of transmission via the vagal nerve for the effect of Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in respect to gastric emptying, appetite and food intake.

 The hypothesis is that a great deal of the effects of GLP-1 is mediated via the nervous system and for this reason the researchers will investigate individuals with and without intact nervous supply.
