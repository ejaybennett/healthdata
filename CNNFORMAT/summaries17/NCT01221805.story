(secondQuint)STA-LiatestD-Di-Exclusion of Venous Thromboembolism.

 The study population will be selected from prospective, consecutive ambulatory outpatients suspected of having venous thromboembolism.

 These patients will first be evaluated using the Wells score: - patients with low or moderate pretest probability will be considered for D-dimer testing, those with D-dimer positive will be considered for an imaging procedure, - patients with high pretest probability will be considered for an imaging procedure.

 Patients with "low or moderate" pretest probability and a negative D-Dimer result will be followed for 3 months to evaluate potential development of deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism.

 These patients will be contacted by phone 3 month after their first visit.

 STA-LiatestD-Di-Exclusion of Venous Thromboembolism@highlight

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the ability of STA(R) Liatest(R) D-Di combined with a clinical pretest probability (PTP) to safely exclude pulmonary embolism (PE) or Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) in a 3 month follow-up.
