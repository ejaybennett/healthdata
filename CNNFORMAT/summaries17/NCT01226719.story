(secondQuint)FOLFOXIRI Plus Panitumumab Patients With Metastatic KRAS Wild-Type Colorectal Cancer With Liver Metastases Only.

 Further data has emerged showing a consistent lack of efficacy using EGFR inhibitor panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with KRAS mutant colorectal cancer.

 For patients with liver-only metastatic colorectal cancer, improvement in response rates with newer chemotherapy regimens has led to a larger percentage of patients eligible for surgical resection.

 Treatment with FOLFOXIRI improves response rates when compared to FOLFIRI.

 Similarly, the addition of an EGFR inhibitor improves the response rate of FOLFIRI in patients with wild-type KRAS.

 In this trial, we will attempt to maximize the response rate and the surgical resection rate by using FOLFOXIRI and panitumumab.

In this Phase II study the investigators plan to determine the overall response rate (ORR) of the combination of FOLFOXIRI plus panitumumab as first-line treatment of patients with liver-only metastatic KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer.
