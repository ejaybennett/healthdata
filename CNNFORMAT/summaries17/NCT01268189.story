(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Oxygen Diffusion Dressing for Accelerating Healing of Donor Site and Other Wounds.

 Patients who are scheduled for excision of burns or other injuries will have one of two donor sites covered with the OxyBand Dressing, and the other treated according to standard of care.

 OxyBand is an FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved (K043063) wound dressing for delivery of oxygen into the wound.

 Two small clinical studies using OxyBand have been conducted on standardized laser burn wounds, demonstrating faster healing time compared to a placebo.

 No studies have compared this dressing to Xeroform dressing, the standard dressing used on donor sites in the USAISR.

 Evaluation of Oxygen Diffusion Dressing for Accelerating Healing of Donor Site and Other Wounds@highlight

This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, and controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of OxyBand Dressing for the use as a dressing for autogenous skin donor sites compared to our current standard donor site dressing (Xeroform).

 Hypothesis is that the mean healing time for wounds treated with the OxyBand dressing will be less than the mean healing time for wounds treated with the Xeroform dressing.
