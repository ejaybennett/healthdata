(fifthQuint)Oral Health and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life in Early Stage Breast Cancer Survivors.

 This is a 2 arm prospective study.

 PM women receiving breast care, with and without breast cancer, at the University of Michigan are eligible.

 The study procedures include: survey/questionnaires, oral exam performed at Michigan Center for Oral Health Research (MCOHR) with specimen collection, and medical chart review.

 The goal of this study is to collect dental data and oral health quality of life data on women who are receiving AI therapy.

 This study does not administer any treatments or drugs to participants.

 Oral Health and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life in Early Stage Breast Cancer Survivors@highlight

The 3 Specific Aims are (1) To determine the prevalence, incidence and severity of oral conditions in postmenopausal early stage breast cancer survivors within the first 18 months of adjuvant Aromatase Inhibitor(AI) therapy, (2) To determine the oral health quality of life among postmenopausal early stage breast cancer survivors who are receiving AI therapy, (3) To determine the utilization of dental care among postmenopausal women receiving AIs with a history of early stage BCa over time.

 The hypothesis for this pilot study is that AIs negatively impact oral health and oral health quality of life in the setting of breast cancer survivors.

 Further, we hypothesize that dental visits are underutilized in women with BCa undergoing adjuvant AI therapy.
