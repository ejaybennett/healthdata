(firstQuint)Immune Response After Booster Vaccination in HIV - Infected Patients Who Received Rabies Primary Vaccination.

 The investigators have learned from the previous studies that some HIV-infected patients especially those with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count had poor antibody response to rabies vaccination.

 Because of the role of the memory B cell, the investigators hypothesized that primary rabies immunization in HIV-infected patients could rise rapid anamnestic antibody response to ones after booster vaccination in case of re-exposure of rabies occur despite of their immunocompromised state.
