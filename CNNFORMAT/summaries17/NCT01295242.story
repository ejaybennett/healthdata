(firstQuint)Natural History of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infections in Mid-Adult Women (WHIM).

 The investigators propose a longitudinal study of 500 women in order to determine rates and risk factors for HPV infections in 30-50 year old women.

 Participants will be followed for 6 months and will be asked to complete online questionnaires on their health, sexual behavior, HPV vaccinations, and cervical cancer screening.

 The investigators will ask participants to self-collect monthly vaginal swab samples and self-collect 2 oral swab samples.

 Women will also be asked to provide 2 blood samples.

 All swab samples will be tested for type-specific HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay, blood samples will be tested for HPV antibodies.
