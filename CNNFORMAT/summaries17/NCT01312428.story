(secondQuint)Pelvic Alignment Level (PAL) Instrument Evaluation.

 Total hip replacement (THR) has been a sucessful treatment for cases of degenerative joint diseases.

 However, post operative complications such as dislocations, osteolysis, component wear and migration are still a concern.

 It has been noted in the scientific literature that precise acetabular cup position helps reduce such post operative complications.

 The Pelvic Alignment Level (PAL) offers this solution by assessing pelvic motion and optimizing implant position without the need for intra-operative fluoroscopy or a large capital expenditure.

 The focus of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes (acetabular cup placement, femoral offset, and leg length) of using the PAL instrument to those without using PAL instrument during total hip replacement.

 This will be a prospective, post market, randomized multi-center clinical study.

The study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the Pelvic Alignment Level (PAL) instrument in achieving desired acetabular position, desired leg length and offset after Total Hip Replacement (THR) reconstruction.
