(firstQuint)Drug Utilization Study on the Prescribing Indications for Yasmin and Other OCs in Croatia.

 Large, prospective non-interventional cohort studies with active surveillance of study participants indicate that many users of oral contraceptives use these preparations not only for contraception but also for the treatment of hormone-dependent diseases and symptoms - such as premenstrual dysphoric disorder, acne, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary syndrome, bleeding disorders and painful periods.

 In the International Active Surveillance Study of Women Taking Oral Contraceptives (INAS) more than 30% of participants reported that they use their OC for contraception as well as for the treatment of one of the mentioned conditions.

 It is also conceivable that some women use OC not for contraception but only for one of these hormone-dependent conditions.

 In most instances the exclusive use for these conditions would constitute off-label use as only few preparations have a stand-alone approved indication for one of these conditions.

 For many countries the actual extent of off-label use of OCs for these conditions is unknown.

 This applies also to Croatia.

 Therefore, the Croatian health authority requested a drug utilization study to investigate current prescribing indications for Yasmin(R) and other OCs in Croatia.

 The study details were agreed upon with the Croatian health authority.
