(secondQuint)Sativex Thorough QT/QTc Study.

 This is a multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, four arm, parallel group study to evaluate the effect of Sativex on the QT/QTc interval.

 Within 30 days of screening, eligible subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups.

 Baseline ECG measurements were recorded at specified times and the following day, subjects commenced five days treatment with Sativex or placebo.

 On Day 5, subjects then received either moxifloxacin 400 mg (Group 4) or moxifloxacin placebo (Groups 1, 2 and 3).

 Triplicate ECG measurements and pharmacokinetic samples were collected on Day 5.

 On days 1-5, Safety ECG measurements were also collected at pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose.

 Subjects returned to the study centre for an outpatient safety follow-up visit approximately 10-14 days after their last dose of study medication.
