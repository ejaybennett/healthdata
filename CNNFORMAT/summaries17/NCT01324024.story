(fifthQuint)Attention & Memory Impairments in Menopausal Women.

 Midlife decline in cognitive function, particularly attention and working memory, is a frequent complaint for which menopausal women seek clinical intervention.

 Many of the cognitive complaints detected in menopausal women including, short-term memory, organization of tasks, sustaining focus and concentration, and regulating emotions, overlap with symptoms frequently reported by adults with ADHD.

 These impairments are reported by many women who have no previous history of ADHD, and appear to be linked to reduced estrogen levels occurring in menopause.

 This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study testing whether LDX, a stimulant medication, would be effective in alleviating midlife onset impairments of attention and working memory among menopausal women.

 There will be 3 days in which subjects will undergo a brief cognitive testing assessment; the first testing period will occur at baseline prior to beginning LDX or placebo treatment (PT) in trial A; the second testing period will occur following 4 weeks of double blind LDX or PT; and the final testing period will take place after another 4 weeks of double blind LDX or PT in Trial B.

 Each cognitive test period will involve 2 separate cognitive testing batteries that will take approximately 120 minutes total to complete.

 Attention & Memory Impairments in Menopausal Women@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether a medication called Vyvanse(R) (lisdexamfetamine; LDX) has an impact on cognitive functioning, specifically measures of sustained attention, verbal encoding and recall and working memory, in menopausal aged women.

 LDX is a medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

 The cognitive difficulties that menopausal women report experiencing are typical of adults who are diagnosed with ADHD.

 The investigators will assess whether or not LDX is effective in alleviating those cognitive disruptions when compared to a placebo.
