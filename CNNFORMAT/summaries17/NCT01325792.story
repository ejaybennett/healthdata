(secondQuint)Open Complex Ventral Incisional Hernia Repair Using Biosynthetic Material for Midline Fascial Closure Reinforcement.

 The study will evaluate the performance of the biosynthetic mesh when used to reinforce the midline fascial closure in single-staged open complex ventral incisional hernia repair.

 It is designed to test the null hypothesis that the two year recurrence rate associated with the device is greater than or equal to 50% vs the alternative hypothesis that the two year recurrence rate is less than 50%.
