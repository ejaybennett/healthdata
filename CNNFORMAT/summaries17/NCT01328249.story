(firstQuint)Dose Dense Doxorubucin and Cyclophosphamide Followed by Eribulin Mesylate for the Adjuvant Treatment of Early Stage Breast Cancer.

 This is a single-center, single-arm Phase II trial to assess the feasibility of dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy in subjects with early stage (I-III), HER-2 normal breast cancer.

 A total of 80 adult subjects will be enrolled in order to have 73 subjects who start the eribulin portion of the adjuvant study regimen.

 After completion of 4 cycles of AC, each subject will begin 4 cycles of eribulin mesylate 1.

4 mg/m2 intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of every 21 day cycle.
