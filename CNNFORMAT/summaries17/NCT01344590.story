(fifthQuint)Ethanol Lock for Prevention of Central Line-Associated Blood Stream Infections.

 Blood stream infections are an important complication of the use of central venous lines (CVLs) and result in increased morbidity, mortality, and cost.

 Blood stream infections related to CVLs may be the result of migration of skin organisms along the catheter tract or introduction of organisms into the lumen of the catheter.

 The extraluminal route of infection appears to be most common early after catheter insertion while the frequency of infection acquired by the intraluminal route appears to increase the longer the catheter is in place.

 Meticulous attention to best practices for insertion and the subsequent care of the insertion site reduces infection by the extraluminal route.

 Adherence to good technique for entering the line may similarly reduce infection by the intraluminal route.

 Ethanol is an effective antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of human pathogens; including the bacteria and fungi which most commonly infect CVLs.

 The mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of ethanol is attributed to the ability to denature proteins and induced resistance to the effect of ethanol has not been reported.

 These features suggest that ethanol-lock is a promising approach to the prevention of acquisition of central line associated blood stream infections by the intraluminal route.

 Ethanol Lock for Prevention of Central Line-Associated Blood Stream Infections@highlight

Vascular access via central venous lines (CVL) is essential to the care of many patients in the intensive care setting.

 While the value of these lines for the management of critically ill patients is generally accepted, the potential for line-associated blood stream infection is a known complication of the use of this intervention.

 Ethanol is an effective antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of human pathogens.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of daily treatment of the catheter lumen with ethanol to prevent central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI).

 The hypothesis is that this treatment will reduce the incidence of CLABSI compared to maintenance of the lines with normal saline alone.
