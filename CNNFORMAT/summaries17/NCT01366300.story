(firstQuint)Effect of Intravenous Lidocaine on BIS-guided Propofol Requirements During General Anesthesia.

 Use of intravenous lidocaine as a coadjuvant agent during general anesthesia has increased.

 Lidocaine infusion during and after abdominal surgery decreases postoperative pain and reduces ileus duration, reducing patients hospital stay and opioid consumption.

 Intravenous lidocaines effect on other intravenous anesthetics is unclear, and there are no present studies evaluating its interaction on hypnotic anesthetic requirements when using a BIS (Bispectral Index) monitor to maintain an adequate depth of anesthesia.

 We therefore decided to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the interaction of systemic lidocaine infusion, initiated and maintained during surgery, on propofol requirements and anesthetic depth as measured by BIS.

 Effect of Intravenous Lidocaine on BIS-guided Propofol Requirements During General Anesthesia@highlight

The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the interaction of lidocaine infusion initiated and maintained during surgery, on propofol requirements during general anesthesia.
