(thirdQuint)Combination Therapy of Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a and Tenofovir Versus Tenofovir Monotherapy in Chronic Hepatitis B.

 The objective of this study is to compare the long-term efficacy of treatment with combination therapy with peginterferon plus tenofovir versus tenofovir monotherapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.

 This is a randomized (1:1) parallel group design trial comparing (i) Tenofovir DF 300 mg daily for 192 weeks (4 years) and (ii) peginterferon alfa-2a 180 mu g weekly for 24 weeks plus Tenofovir DF 300 mg daily for 192 weeks (4 years).

 Enrolled participants will be stratified by HBeAg status (positive/negative), genotype (A vs.

 all others) and cirrhosis (present vs.

 absent).

 After 192 weeks of treatment, participants meeting criteria for treatment discontinuation will stop treatment and be followed for 48 weeks (total duration of treatment and follow up is 240 weeks).

 Emtricitabine/tenofovir coformulated as Truvada, approved for treatment of HIV but not for treatment of HBV infection, will be offered to patients with primary nonresponse, partial virological response or confirmed virologic breakthrough.

 Combination Therapy of Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a and Tenofovir Versus Tenofovir Monotherapy in Chronic Hepatitis B@highlight

This clinical trial compares the efficacy of peginterferon plus tenofovir for 24 weeks followed by monotherapy with tenofovir for a further 3.

5 years to the efficacy of tenofovir alone given for 4 years in patients with chronic hepatitis B.

 The primary measure of outcome will be HBsAg loss in serum at 48 weeks after stopping all antiviral therapy (sustained off-treatment response).
