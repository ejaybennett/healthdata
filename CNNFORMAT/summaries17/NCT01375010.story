(fifthQuint)Vitamin D HIV Study on Postmenopausal Women.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of vitamin D repletion on rates of bone loss and indices of immune function in HIV+ postmenopausal women.

 Lower baseline serum Vitamin D levels, as assessed by measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) were associated with a trend toward more bone loss.

 In addition, the investigators found that despite providing supplements that contained approximately 600 IU vitamin D, serum 25-OHD did not increase during the first year.

 Provision of adequate calcium and vitamin D is the cornerstone of effective prevention and therapy of osteoporosis.

 HIV-infected patients may be at increased risk of having vitamin D deficiency because they take several medications that may interfere with vitamin D action.

 Therefore, the investigators will recruit 100 HIV infected postmenopausal women for this study who are on a stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen and randomize them to receive 1000 or 3000 IU of vitamin D daily.

 The subjects will be followed closely for one year to monitor compliance and changes in bone health and immune function.

 Vitamin D HIV Study on Postmenopausal Women@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of vitamin D on measures of bone health and immune function in HIV infected postmenopausal women.

 The investigators prior research with this population revealed that low vitamin D levels are very common.

 Prior research with this population also revealed that Vitamin D is necessary for the body to absorb calcium and is important for the health of the bones.

 When vitamin D levels are low, there are increased risks of bone loss, muscle weakness, falls and fractures.

 Low levels of vitamin D have also been associated with impaired immune function.

 This study will help us learn whether two different doses of vitamin D will improve bone health and immune function.
