(secondQuint)The Role of Epigenetics in Inner City Asthma.

 Asthma is a complex, heritable disease that affects more than 11.

2% of the U.

S.

 population, which represents approximately 9 million children and 23 million adults.

 It is thought that asthma may be caused by the interaction of multiple genetic factors, such as whether a parent or sibling has asthma, and environmental factors, such as living in an inner city.

 Studying DNA from people who have asthma and those who do not have asthma may help us better understand the importance of those genes and how they are involved in asthma severity and response to treatment.

As part of ongoing efforts to determine the causes of asthma and the progression of the disease, this study will gather data to explore the interaction of genetic and environmental factors in the cause and severity of asthma in inner city children.
