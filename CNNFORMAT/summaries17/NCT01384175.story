(secondQuint)Epidural Anesthesia and Postoperative Analgesia With Ropivacaine and Fentanyl.

 Ninety-three patients were scheduled for off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) under propofol/fentanyl anesthesia.

 Day before surgery patients were asked for informed consent and randomized into three postoperative analgesia regimens aiming at a visual analog scale (VAS) score mu g/ml postoperatively 3-8 mL/h.

 After placement of an epidural catheter at the level of Th2-Th4 before OPCAB, a thoracic epidural infusion (EI) group (n=31) received epidural anesthesia (EA) intraoperatively with ropivacaine 0.

75% 1 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 mu g/kg followed by continuous EI of ropivacaine 0.

2% 3-8 mL/h and fentanyl 2 mu g/mL postoperatively.

 The patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) group (n=31), in addition to EA and EI, received PCEA (ropivacaine/fentanyl bolus 1 mL, lock-out interval 12 min) postoperatively.

 Hemodynamics and blood gases were measured throughout 24 h after OPCAB.

The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of thoracic epidural anesthesia followed by postoperative epidural infusion and patient-controlled epidural analgesia with ropivacaine/fentanyl in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting
