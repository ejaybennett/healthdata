(secondQuint)Contrast Medium Volume and Contrast-induced Nephropathy After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

 contrast media volume to creatinine clearance (V/CrCl) ratios were obtained from consecutive consenting patients after unselective PCI.

 Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify the optimal sensitivity for the observed range of V/CrCl.

 The predictive value of V/CrCl for the risk of CIN was assessed using multivariate logistic regression.
