(firstQuint)SOX as Salvage Treatment in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.

 The treatment option in patients with platinum-resistant relapsed or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma is limited.

 Previous studies showed that both S-1 and oxaliplatin were effective in head and neck cancer.

 Therefore, we aim to evaluate this regimen in salvage setting of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
