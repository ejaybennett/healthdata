(firstQuint)A Study of the Activity of Eculizumab for Prevention of Delayed Graft Function In Deceased Donor Kidney Transplant.

 Based on experimental data and supportive observations in humans associating complement gene upregulation with ischemic reperfusion injury, it is hypothesized that C5 cleavage is a key step in the pathogenesis of ischemic reperfusion injury following transplantation.

 It is further hypothesized that eculizumab, an antibody that blocks C5 cleavage in humans will be an effective prophylactic agent to prevent ischemic reperfusion injury in high risk recipients.

 To test this hypothesis, this study is a pilot prospective, randomized study to test the efficacy of eculizumab vs.

 placebo given once at the time of transplantation in preventing delayed graft function in first adult recipients of deceased donor kidneys.
