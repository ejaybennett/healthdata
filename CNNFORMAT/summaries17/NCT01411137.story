(fifthQuint)Carbidopa-Levodopa (CD-LD) ER Alone or in Combination With CD-LD IR to IPX066 Followed by IPX066 Extension Safety Study.

 Part 1: This study was a multicenter, open-label study.

 Subjects were to be converted from their previous CD-LD treatment to IPX066 over a 6-week period.

 Up to 40 subjects were to be enrolled in the study.

 Enrollment was defined as subjects who received study drug in Part 1 - Visit 1.

 Subjects were to be entered into one of two cohorts.

 Approximately 24 subjects were to enroll in Cohort 1 (non-OPDM subjects) and up to 16 subjects at selected sites were to enroll in Cohort 2 (OPDM subjects).

 For the subjects enrolled in Cohort 2, along with the OPDM measurements, PK blood samples were also to be collected.

 Part 2: Following the successful completion of Part 1 of the study, eligible subjects could participate in Part 2, a 6-month open-label extension study.

 Part 3: Following the successful completion of Part 2 of the study, eligible subjects could participate in Part 3, an additional 6-month open-label extension study.

 Carbidopa-Levodopa (CD-LD) ER Alone or in Combination With CD-LD IR to IPX066 Followed by IPX066 Extension Safety Study@highlight

The study had three distinct parts and is described as follows: Part 1: - To evaluate the dose conversion from CD-LD ER taken alone or in combination with CD-LD IR to IPX066 in subjects with advanced PD - To evaluate the utility of the Objective Parkinson's Disease Measurement (OPDM), an exploratory computer-based system, in assessing dexterity and mobility in a subset of PD subjects.

 Part 2: cent To evaluate the long-term safety and clinical utility of IPX066 under open-label conditions in eligible subjects who successfully completed Part 1 of the study.

 Part 3: cent To further evaluate the long-term safety of IPX066 in eligible subjects who successfully completed Part 2.
