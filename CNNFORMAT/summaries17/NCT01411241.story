(fifthQuint)Study of a Booster Injection of Pentaxim Vaccine Administered With Dengue Vaccine in Healthy Toddlers.

 Participants will require 8 or 9 clinic visits and will receive a total of 7 injections.

 The dengue post-vaccinal viremia will be assessed at Visit 2 from a subset of toddlers.

 The dengue immunogenicity will be assessed 28 days after CYD dengue dose 2 and dose 3 from a subset of toddlers.

 All participants will be followed-up for safety after each vaccine dose and for 6 months after the last dengue vaccination.

 Study of a Booster Injection of Pentaxim Vaccine Administered With Dengue Vaccine in Healthy Toddlers@highlight

The aim of the study is to assess whether the second CYD dengue vaccination could be administered concomitantly with the booster vaccination of a pediatric combination vaccine (Pentaxim cent ) during the same day and visit but in 2 different sites of administration.

 Primary Objective: - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response against all antigens (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Hib) in participants receiving one booster dose of Pentaxim cent vaccine administered concomitantly with the second dose of CYD dengue vaccine compared to subjects receiving one booster dose of Pentaxim cent vaccine administered concomitantly with placebo.

 Secondary Objectives: - To describe the safety of Pentaxim cent vaccine administered concomitantly with the second dose of CYD dengue vaccine, or administered concomitantly with placebo.

 - To describe the safety of the CYD dengue vaccine in all subjects after each dose.

 - To describe the antibody response to each dengue virus serotype (post-Dose 2 and post-Dose 3) after the second dose of CYD dengue vaccine administered concomitantly with Pentaxim vaccine or administered alone.

 - To describe the antibody response to each dengue virus serotype post-Dose 2 and post-Dose 3 in all subjects.
