(thirdQuint)Toll-like Receptor (TLR) 7 Agonist, Cyclophosphamide, and Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer With Skin Metastases.

 By harnessing the cytocidal and immunostimulatory properties of two local treatment modalities, RT and IMQ, an effective, adaptive immune response can be generated, resulting in systemic control of metastatic breast cancer after local treatment of cutaneous metastases.

 Additionally, based on investigators' recent preclinical data, the investigators intend to estimate in patients with metastatic breast cancer, if the addition of immunomodulatory cyclophosphamide can increase anti-tumor responses.

 This trial originally had one treatment arm IMQ/RT(patients were treated with IMQ and RT).

 Recent evidence has emerged that the addition of immunomodulatory cyclophosphamide (CTX) increased anti-tumor responses, therefore the IMQ/RT arm is closed and the trial will continue with two additional cohorts (CTX/IMQ/RT and CTX/RT) which include cyclophosphamide.

 Toll-like Receptor (TLR) 7 Agonist, Cyclophosphamide, and Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer With Skin Metastases@highlight

This study is to find an optimal dose of Imiquimod (IMQ) in the first part (Phase I) and test the effectiveness of the combination treatment of IMQ, cyclophosphamide (CTX), and radiotherapy (RT) in patients with skin metastases from breast cancer in the second part (Phase II).

 Currently this trial is in its Phase II part.
