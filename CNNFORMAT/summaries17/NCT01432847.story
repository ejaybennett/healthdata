(fifthQuint)Cell Collection to Study Eye Diseases.

 This study will establish a repository of biospecimens to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which will be used to determine molecular mechanisms for the following potentially blinding eye diseases: Best Vitelliform Dystrophy (Best Disease); Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration (L-ORD); Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD); Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA); Joubert syndrome; X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (RP); oculocutaneous albinism,Stargardt s with ABCA4 gene mutations; Waardenburg syndrome, coloboma, Enhanced S-Cone syndrome (ESCS), Spinocerebellar Ataxia, Type 7 (SCA7) and eye diseases associated with MITF, PAX2, or PAX6 gene mutations.

 Skin fibroblasts, hair keratinocytes, and/or blood cells may be collected from participants with retinal diseases and from age, gender and ethnicity-matched healthy participants.

 Although research involving multiple different ocular cell types from these patients may be performed, the vast majority of the work will be centered on the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and neural retina.

 RPE and/or neural retinal cells generated from the iPS cells of participants with retinal diseases and healthy volunteers will be used to analyze molecular mechanisms involved in disease initiation and progression.

 In addition, the iPS cell-derived ocular cells will be used to perform high throughput (HTP) drug screens aimed at suppressing the molecular phenotypes of the disease and to identify potential therapeutic agents for these diseases.

 Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to generate participant-iPS cells that can be differentiated into ocular cell types, to be used to study the molecular mechanisms of and to develop treatments for Best disease, L-ORD, AMD, LCA, Joubert syndrome, X-linked RP, OCA, Startgardt s disease, Waardenburg syndrome, coloboma, ESCS, SCA7 and eye diseases associated with MITF, PAX2, or PAX6 gene mutations.

 This objective will be carried out in three phases.

 First, this study will establish a repository of fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and/or blood cells collected from participants with eye diseases and from matched controls without any eye diseases.

 Second, the somatic cell repository will be used to generate iPS cells, which will be differentiated into RPE, neural retinal and/or other ocular cells.

 These cells will be used to elucidate molecular pathways that have led to disease pathogenesis.

 In the third phase, the participant-specific ocular cells will be used to perform high throughput drug screens to identify novel potential therapeutic compounds.

 The cells obtained in this protocol may be genetically modified and may be transplanted into animals in the laboratory.

 Study Population: We plan to recruit 25 participants with Best disease, 25 participants with L-ORD, 100 participants with AMD, 35 participants with early onset retinal degeneration and/or LCA, 25 participants with Joubert syndrome, 25 participants with X-linked RP, 50 with OCA, 25 with Stargardt s disease with ABCA4 mutations, 25 with eye diseases due to MITF mutations, 25 with Waardenburg syndrome, 25 with eye diseases due to PAX2 mutations, 25 with eye diseases due to PAX6 mutations, 25 participants with coloboma, 5 participants with ESCS without macular edema, 25 participants with SCA7, and 465 healthy volunteers without any eye disease.

 If possible, unaffected siblings and relatives of participants with eye diseases will be included as healthy volunteers.

 Design:In this basic science, research-oriented study, skin, hair, and/or blood samples may be collected from affected participants with the eye diseases and/or genetic mutations under study, and from control participants matched for age, gender and ethnicity.

 The sample collection procedures will incur only minimal risk to adult participants.

 For on-site minor participants, the skin biopsy procedure is a minor increment over minimal risk.

 Offsite minor participants will not undergo the skin biopsy.

This study will typically require only one visit by each participant.

 Participants may be requested to return if their initial sample(s) did not produce adequate cells for study in the laboratory.

 Participants who were previously enrolled to provide samples for research-grade iPS cell generation may return for an additional visit to provide samples for clinical-grade iPS cell generation, if eligible.

 The skin fibroblast, keratinocyte, and/or blood samples will then be used to generate participant-specific iPS cells, and these cells will then be differentiated into RPE, neural retinal and/or other ocular cell types.

 iPS cells may not be made from all samples.

 The investigators will use the samples for research studies aimed at identifying molecular and signaling pathways underlying disease onset and progression and for developing potential therapeutic treatments for the eye diseases under study.

 Outcome Measures: The outcome measures for this study include the creation of iPS cells from at least one of the three types of somatic tissues collected from each participant, the differentiation of iPS cells into RPE, neural retinal cells and/or other ocular cells, and the identification of molecular and physiological phenotypes in these cells that may be linked to the onset or progression of Best disease, L-ORD, AMD, LCA, Joubert syndrome, X-linked RP, OCA, Stargardt s disease, Waardenburg syndrome, coloboma, ESCS, SCA7and eye diseases due to MITF, PAX2, and PAX6 mutations.

 This analysis may lead to the discovery of therapeutic interventions for these diseases.

 There are no specific participant-based clinical outcomes for this protocol.

 Participants will, in general, be seen only once for this protocol, as they will be ascertained and/or receiving standard care under the NEI Evaluation and Treatment Protocol (08-EI-0169) or other NEI protocols.

 In rare cases, participants may be requested to return to the clinic if their initial sample(s) did not produce adequate cells for study in the laboratory.

 Cell Collection to Study Eye Diseases@highlight

Background: - Best Vitelliform Dystrophy (Best disease), Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration (L-ORD), and Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) all affect the retina, the light sensing area at the back of the eye.

 Doctors cannot safely obtain retinal cells to study these diseases.

 However, cells collected from hair follicles, skin, and blood can be used for research.

 Researchers want to collect cells from people with Best disease, L-ORD, and AMD, and compare their cells with those of healthy volunteers.

 Objectives: - To collect hair, skin, and blood samples to study three eye diseases that affect the retina: Best disease, L-ORD, and AMD.

 Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have Best disease, L-ORD, or AMD in at least one eye.

 - Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

 Design: - The study requires one visit to the National Eye Institute.

 - Participants will be screened with a medical and eye disease history.

 They will also have an eye exam.

 - Participants will provide a hair sample, a blood sample, and a skin biopsy.

 The hair will be collected from the back of the head, and the skin will be collected from the inside of the upper arm.
