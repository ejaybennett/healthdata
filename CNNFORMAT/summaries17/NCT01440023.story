(fifthQuint)Developing Cognitive Training for Tourette Syndrome.

 The current research seeks to examine the feasibility of using a computer-based RI training program as an adjunctive intervention for the Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT).

 Our central hypothesis is that cognitive training designed to enhance RI will potentiate treatment outcomes of CBIT.

 To this end, the investigators will conduct a two-arm placebo-controlled double-blind trial, in which 20 children with TS will be randomly assigned to CBIT with computerized RI training (CBIT+RIT; n=10) or CBIT with placebo computer training (CBIT +PLT; n=10).

 CBIT consists of eight weekly sessions that present awareness training, competing response training, relaxation training and functional contingency management in a manualized format.

 The adjunctive computer training (RIT or PLT) will be delivered during the first 4 weeks of CBIT/HRT (i.

e.

 8 twice-weekly 40-min sessions).

 Tic symptoms and RI capabilities will be assessed at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 1 month follow-up.

 This project is expected to increase our understanding about the nature of response inhibition deficits in TS and generate knowledge that will guide the development of effective cognitive interventions for TS.

 Developing Cognitive Training for Tourette Syndrome@highlight

Many researchers suspect that individuals with Tourette Syndrome (TS) may have a poor cognitive ability (i.

e.

, response inhibition; RI) that is essential to inhibit inappropriate response such as vocal or motor tics.

 The investigators aim to test whether a well-established behavior therapy for TS can be improved by increasing the individual's RI capabilities.

 To this end, 20 children will be randomly assigned to behavior therapy with computer-based RI training or behavior therapy with placebo computer-based cognitive training.

 The investigators will test the hypothesis that computer-based RI training can be a useful addition to the well-established behavior therapy to enhance its therapeutic effect.
