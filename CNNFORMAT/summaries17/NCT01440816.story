(fifthQuint)IL-12 Gene and in Vivo Electroporation-Mediated Plasmid DNA Vaccine Therapy in Patients With Merkel Cell Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To measure the effect of intratumoral injection of tavo followed by in vivo electroporation (EP) (electroporation-mediated plasmid DNA vaccine therapy) on the local expression of interleukin-12 (IL-12) in the tumor microenvironment in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the safety of tavo-EP in MCC.

 II.

 To assess the clinical efficacy of this treatment approach in MCC.

 III.

 To assess the immunologic changes resulting from this treatment approach.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive tavo intratumorally (IT) and undergo electrical discharge via OMS around the tumor site for electroporation-mediated plasmid DNA vaccine therapy on days 1, 5, and 8.

 Patients with unresectable disease may receive a second course of treatment in 12 weeks.

 Patients with localized disease proceed to definitive treatment as determined by the treating physician starting 2-4 weeks after the first injection.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 4-8 (for patients who received definitive treatment) or 12 (for patients with unresectable disease) and then annually for up to 5 years.

 IL-12 Gene and in Vivo Electroporation-Mediated Plasmid DNA Vaccine Therapy in Patients With Merkel Cell Cancer@highlight

This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of ImmunoPulse IL-12(R) in treating patients with Merkel cell cancer.

 ImmunoPulse IL-12(R) is the combination of intratumoral interleukin-12 gene (also known as tavokinogene telseplasmid [tavo]) and in vivo electroporation-mediated plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] vaccine therapy (tavo-EP) administered using the OncoSec Medical System (OMS).

 Placing the gene for interleukin-12 into Merkel cells may help the mount an effective anti-tumor immune response to kill tumor cells.
