(secondQuint)Maternal-fetal CD4 Microchimerism in HiV Exposed Newborns After Spontaneous Delivery and Cesarean Section.

 At birth maternal CD4+ t-cells from umbilical cord blood and placenta blood are measured by microchimerism-analysis.

 After 6 weeks the maternal CD4+ t-cells are measured in the blood of the babies blood.

 Additionally we look for HiV in maternal CD4+ t-cells.

 Maternal-fetal CD4 Microchimerism in HiV Exposed Newborns After Spontaneous Delivery and Cesarean Section@highlight

The aim of this single centre study is to measure maternal CD4+ t-cells in HiV exposed Newborns after spontaneous birth in comparison to cesarean section.

 This may have an influence on the risk of vertical HiV transmission.
