(secondQuint)Study of Patients With Stage IV Malignant Melanoma Using PS-341 (Bortezomib, Velcade) and Interferon-alpha-2b in Malignant Melanoma.

 The primary objective of this study is to: cent Determine the safety, tolerability and DLTs of VELCADE when administered in combination with interferon-alpha-2b (IFN--2b) to patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

 The secondary objectives of this study are to: - Document any objective anti-tumor responses that may occur in response to this treatment regimen.

 - Document the time to tumor progression in patients receiving this treatment regimen.

 - Measure levels of the cell cycle proteins p21 and p27 in PBMCs and tumor biopsies obtained pre-study and during week 4 of Cycle 1 (Day 26).

 - Conduct histologic evaluations of microvessel density, tumor apoptosis and lymphocytic infiltrates within tumor biopsies obtained pre- and post-study.

 - Measure plasma levels of bFGF and VEGF over the course of the study.

 - Monitor the effects of proteasome inhibition on the biological activity of IFN- within immune cells by measuring Jak-STAT signal transduction in patient PBMCs.
