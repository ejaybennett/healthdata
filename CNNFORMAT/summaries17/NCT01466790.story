(thirdQuint)A Study of TMC435 in Combination With PSI-7977 (GS7977) in Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1-Infected Prior Null Responders To Peginterferon/Ribavirin Therapy or HCV Treatment-Naive Patients.

 This is a Phase IIa, randomized (the study medications are assigned by chance), open label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study of TMC435 plus PSI-7977 (GS7977) with or without ribavirin.

 The study consists of a screening phase (6 weeks); a treatment phase (12 or 24 week period); and a posttreatment phase (follow-up period up to Week 48).

 Approximately 180 patients will be enrolled in this study.

 Patients will be sequentially enrolled into two cohorts in this study.

 Cohort 1 (90 patients) will include patients without advanced hepatic fibrosis who did not respond to previous PegIFN/ribavirin therapy and Cohort 2 (90 patients) will include only patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis who did not respond to previous PegIFN/ribavirin therapy or are HCV treatment-naive.

 Safety will be evaluated throughout the study and will include evaluations of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination.

 The entire study duration for each participant will be approximately 48 weeks.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 plus PSI-7977 (GS7977) with or without ribavirin in patients who are chronically infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) and who did not respond to prior peginterferon/ribavirin therapy or are HCV treatment-naive (patients who never received treatment for HCV infection).
