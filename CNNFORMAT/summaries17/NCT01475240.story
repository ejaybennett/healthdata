(fifthQuint)The Effect of Hyperbilirubinemia on CV Disease, Neurocog Function and Renal Function.

 Use of some protease inhibitors is associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia as a result of inhibition of the UGT1A1 enzyme.

 Elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin are best characterized among individuals with Gilbert syndrome, which is the most common inherited cause of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, present in 3-10% of the general population.

 Gilbert syndrome arises through variants in the UGT1A1 enzyme, thus these PIs induce a biochemical picture similar to Gilbert syndrome.

 Although elevations of bilirubin may occasionally lead to scleral icterus or jaundice, cohort studies of individuals with Gilbert syndrome indicate bilirubin elevations may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events.

 Inflammation may also be relevant to cardiovascular (CV) risk, neurocognitive impairment and renal disease in HIV infection.

 This study seeks to investigate any association between antiretroviral associated HBR and CV risk markers, neurocognitive impairment and renal dysfunction.

 The Effect of Hyperbilirubinemia on CV Disease, Neurocog Function and Renal Function@highlight

Use of some protease inhibitors is associated with elevations of a blood pigment called bilirubin.

 This may occasionally lead to yellowing of the eyes (scleral icterus) or jaundice, but in the general population bilirubin elevations have been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that could be associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular or other disease events.

 Inflammation may also be relevant to neurocognitive impairment in HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection hence elevations of bilirubin may also be protective against neurocognitive impairment.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of hyperbilirubinemia (HBR) on risk of heart and renal diseases, and cognitive function.
