(thirdQuint)31P MRS Ischaemic Exercise Optimisation and COPD.

 31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31P MRS) is a non-invasive method to measure muscle metabolism during exercise.

 This protocol is intended to provide information for planning future clinical trials applying 31P MRS as an endpoint measure for proof of pharmacology studies with novel therapeutic molecules.

 Parts A & B of this study will refine imaging and exercise protocols for 31P MRS during brief periods of muscle ischaemia and will assess the test-retest variance.

 In Part C we will apply 31P MRS with aerobic exercise in a pilot study to estimate differences in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism between age- and sex-matched control subjects and patients with myopathy associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

An MRI study to develop a reliable methodology for 31P MRS ischaemic exercise in order to obtain a consistent standard of measurement of muscle metabolism while maintaining an acceptable level of subject comfort and use optimised method to measure and compare metabolism in the biceps and quadriceps of patients with COPD-related myopathy and control subjects
