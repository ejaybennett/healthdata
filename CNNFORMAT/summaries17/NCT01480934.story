(secondQuint)Evaluation of Posterior Capsule Opacification in Eyes With Diabetes Mellitus.

 There is a paucity of available literature that prospectively evaluates the development of PCO with the single-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOL implantation in diabetic versus non-diabetic eyes on a long-term basis.

 Therefore, this study was designed to compare the degree of PCO after cataract surgery between diabetic and age-matched non-diabetic patients.

 This prospective, observational case control study comprised patients who underwent phacoemulsification .

The patients were asked to return for postoperative follow-up visits at 1 month, 1 year and 4 years.

 the digital images were analyzed for PCO .

 Evaluation of Posterior Capsule Opacification in Eyes With Diabetes Mellitus@highlight

To compare the development of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) between eyes with and without a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) after single-piece hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) implantation 4 years postoperatively.

Diabetes mellitus would not increase the incidence of PCO at 4 years.
