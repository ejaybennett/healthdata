(secondQuint)Effect of Dose on the Pharmacokinetics of OROS Hydromorphone Under Fasted Conditions in Healthy Taiwanese Participants.

 This is a single-center, randomized (study drug assigned by chance like flipping a coin), open-label (all people involved know the identity of the intervention), 4-way crossover (participants receive different interventions sequentially during the trial) study in healthy adult Taiwanese participants.

 All participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 different possible treatment sequences and will receive all treatments in the order specified by the randomization schedule.

 The study consists of a screening phase, an open-label treatment phase consisting of 4 single-dose treatment periods, and end-of-study or withdrawal assessments.

 During the open-label treatment periods, the participants will stay in the center until completion of the 72-hour pharmacokinetics [PK] (how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and how it is removed from the body over time) blood sample on Day 4.

 A 7- to 14-day washout period (period when receiving no treatment) will separate the open-label treatment periods.

 The safety and tolerability will be evaluated over the investigated dose range.

 The duration of participation in the study for an individual participant will be approximately 12 weeks.

 Effect of Dose on the Pharmacokinetics of OROS Hydromorphone Under Fasted Conditions in Healthy Taiwanese Participants@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of OROS Hydromorphone in healthy adult Taiwanese participants after oral administration of 4 different dose strengths of 8, 16, 32 and 64 mg under fasted conditions.
