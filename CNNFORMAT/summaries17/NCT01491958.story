(secondQuint)Safety & Efficacy of Atorvastatin for Prophylaxis of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease in Patients With Hematological Malignancies HLA- Donor Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.

 The study is a single-arm phase II single institutional trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing HLA matched related donor HSCT.

 This study will explore a two-pronged acute GVHD prophylaxis strategy, consisting of pre-treating consenting related donors with atorvastatin before stem cell mobilization and collection, followed by atorvastatin plus methotrexate/tacrolimus-based GVHD prophylaxis in transplant recipient patients.
