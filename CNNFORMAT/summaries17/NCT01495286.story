(fifthQuint)Safety of Noninvasive Electrical Stimulation of Acupuncture Points (NESAP) in Infants.

 The investigators propose an open label trial to assess the safety of using electrical stimulation at acupuncture sites in 42 infants receiving a routine heel stick.

 Two sub studies will precede the main safety study, with 6 infants in each sub study and 30 infants in the main study.

 These sub studies will use electrical stimulation intensities that are a fraction of the planned intensity of the electrical stimulation that will be used for the main part of the study.

 As part of routine neonatal screening, blood will be collected from a heel stick(s) by qualified nursing staff in the hospital nursery or in the patient's room.

 Less than one ml of blood will be drawn over 1-2 minutes.

 Study infants will be watched more carefully with heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation performed as part of this study.

 Infants not participating in the study will be watched as per usual unit protocol.

 Electrical stimulation at acupuncture sites will be administered via an EMPI Select Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) unit.

 To produce analgesia, small electrodes will be placed on the baby's legs at specific acupuncture points: ZuSanLi (ST36) just below the knee, triggers release of endorphins; SanYinJiao (SP6) just above the inner ankle, important point for energy balance; Kun Lun (BL60) depression behind lateral malleolus, protects local tissue trauma to heel; and Tai Xi (Ki3) behind the inner ankle, an important energy meridian.

 25, 39, 48-50, StimCare self-adhesive electrodes with a gel base will be applied to the skin; the skin will not be punctured by these procedures.

 For the main part of the study, a low continuous current will be provided with minimal voltage of 3.

5 milliamps (mA).

 The frequency will be delivered using a stimulation of 10 Hz for 101 minutes prior to the heelstick, with continued stimulation during and for 51 min after the heelstick.

 This paradigm is based on the basic animal research developed by Dr.

 Han and other research groups.

 Two sub studies will precede the main safety study, with 6 infants in each sub study, using electrical stimulation intensities that are a fraction of the planned intensity.

 Infants in sub study 1 will receive electrical stimulation at 1 mA and 2 Hz.

 Infants in sub study 2 will receive electrical stimulation at 2 mA and 10 Hz.

 Safety of Noninvasive Electrical Stimulation of Acupuncture Points (NESAP) in Infants@highlight

This research study represents a pilot, open arm study that will evaluate the safety of using Non-invasive Electrical Stimulation of Acupuncture Points (NESAP) in 42 newborn infants less than 3 days of age who require heel sticks for clinical blood sampling.

 The investigators plan to enroll 51 infants into the study in order to obtain 42 completed infants.

 Two sub studies will precede the main safety study, with 6 infants in each sub study and 30 infants in the main study.

 These two sub studies will use electrical stimulation intensities that are a fraction of the planned intensity of electrical stimulation that will be used during the main part of the study.

 The clinical trial will be performed at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Hospital (Little Rock, AR).

 The study will evaluate the pain response to heel stick routinely used to obtain This blood from 30 term neonatal infants, ages 37 to 42 weeks Electrical stimulation will be applied at appropriate acupuncture points using a very low current for 10 minutes, routine for procedural pain.

 The response to pain will be assessed using pain scales and physiologic changes.

 The investigators hypothesize that the NESAP procedure is safe in newborn infants undergoing a routine heelstick.
