(thirdQuint)Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of Hantaan and Puumala Virus DNA Vaccines.

 The study will enroll 3 randomized groups of 9 subjects each, along with 3 alternates, for a total of 30 subjects.

 The study will include one group of subjects injected with the HTNV DNA vaccine, one group injected with the PUUV DNA vaccine, and one group injected with both HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines (mixed), administered with the Ichor TDS-IM device.

 Subjects will receive one dose of vaccine on Days 0, 28, and 56 and will be followed until Day 240.

 Subjects will complete post-injection memory aids for 14 days after each injection.

 Subjects will be evaluated for safety and immune response throughout the study.
