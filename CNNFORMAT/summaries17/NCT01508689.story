(firstQuint)Effect of Calcium-fortified Cereal Bars on Dietary Calcium Intake in Women.

 The average intake of calcium in women in the United States from the diet (about 800 mg/day) is below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (1000 mg/day for ages 18 to 50 years, 1200 mg/day for age above 50 years), which increases their risk of developing osteoporosis.

 Consumption of two calcium-fortified cereal bars per day may be a feasible way to increase the dietary intake of calcium.

 This study will use Kellogg's Nutri-Grain(R) cereal bars, which provide 200 mg of calcium per bar, or a total of 400 mg/day.
