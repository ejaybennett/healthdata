(thirdQuint)Spinal Cord Stimulation and Functional MRI.

 The main objective is to define, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the effects of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on cortical and subcortical BOLD effects in patients with neuropathic leg pain.

 Our hypothesis is that SCS will demonstrate a consistent pattern of BOLD activation that will correlate with symptomatic improvement.

 Spinal Cord Stimulation and Functional MRI@highlight

The overall objective of this study is to assess patterns of fMRI cortical activation with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in patients with neuropathic leg pain and therefore define cortical correlates, as well as to investigate cortical representations of pain and pain relief and the interactions therein, in the setting of neuropathic leg pain and SCS.
