(firstQuint)Individual Dosage Selection of Irinotecan (CPT-11) Based on UGT1A1 Genotype in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients.

 Genetic polymorphisms of UGTs result in reduced enzyme activity and increased toxicity.

 UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6 are reported to increase CPT-11-related toxicity in Asian patients.

 Moreover, the area under concentration curve (AUC) ratio of SN-38G to SN-38 is decreased in Asian patients having UGT1A1 *28 or UGT1A1*6.

 This implicated that the current standard dose of CPT-11 would be overdosing for homozygous UGT1A1*28/*28, *6/*6 or *28/*6 patients.

 The study is designed to investigate the role of prospectively dose reduction of CPT-11 in toxicity, tumor response and pharmacokinetics for homozygous UGT1A1 patients, and compare these parameters to standard dose of CPT-11 for wild-type, heterozygous or homozygous UGT1A1 patients.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of dose selection of CPT-11 on toxicity, response and pharmacokinetics according to UGT1A1 genotype in colorectal cancer patients.
