(fifthQuint)Medical Marijuana Use in HIV+ Patients: Probability Survey.

 Participants will answer questions about marijuana, medical marijuana, and other drug use.

 We will also ask about health and steps participants take to keep healthy.

 The study will take up to one hour to complete.

 Participants will also be asked to sign a release of information form.

 This form would allow us to look at medical records at the HIV clinic.

 Medical Marijuana Use in HIV+ Patients: Probability Survey@highlight

More scientific information is needed about medical marijuana use among HIV positive patients.

 There is conflicting information about the use of marijuana, use of medical marijuana, and the associations between them and health status/health risk behaviors/health care utilization.

 In addition, it is not clear whether patients who participate in prospective clinical studies differ from participants who do not participate; if there are differences between those two groups, then this would limit generalizability of knowledge about these issues.

 The goal of this project is to describe the use of marijuana among HIV positive patients and its association with health status/health risk behaviors/health care utilization.
