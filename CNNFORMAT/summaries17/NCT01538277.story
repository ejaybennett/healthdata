(firstQuint)A Pilot Study of a Contact Force Catheter for Pulmonary Vein Antrum Isolation.

 A randomized controlled study comparing pulmonary vein antrum isolation with and without the knowledge of the real-time contact force.

 In both groups, a catheter, which is able to measure contact force (SmartTouch, ThermoCool catheter, Biosense Webster) will be used.

 In the control group, the operator will be blinded to the measured contact-force.

 In all patients, the ablation will be guided by a circumferential mapping catheter (Lasso, Biosense Webster), CARTO 3 mapping system and ablation of adenosine-induced reconnection will be performed in all patients.

 Follow-up will be performed by continuous monitoring using an implantable loop recorder (Reveal XT, Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn).

The knowledge of the real-time contact force leads to a greater reduction in atrial fibrillation burden after pulmonary vein antrum isolation.
