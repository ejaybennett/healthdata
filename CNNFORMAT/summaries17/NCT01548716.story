(thirdQuint)A Study of 25-hydroxy Vitamin d Levels in Non-itching Hemodialysis Patients.

 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels from non-itching HD patients in this study will be compared to 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels from our ongoing study in HD patients with itching.

 The primary endpoints for both studies are continuous variables.

 Student's t test will be used to test for statistical significance.

 Multiple regression analysis will be used for controlling covariates and testing the interaction among covariates.

 A Study of 25-hydroxy Vitamin d Levels in Non-itching Hemodialysis Patients@highlight

Hypothesis: 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in non-itching hemodialysis (HD) patients will be higher than those in HD patients with itching 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels will be measured in non-itching hemodialysis patients and compared to levels previously measured in a previous study of 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels of patients complaining of itching.
