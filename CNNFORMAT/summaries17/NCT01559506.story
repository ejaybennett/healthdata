(firstQuint)Air Barrier System Device to Reduce Contamination in Posterior Spine Surgery.

 The ABS is a device that uses localized clean air flow to shield a surgery site from ambient airborne contamination.

 This study examines the hypothesis that the ABS can reduce the presence of airborne colony-forming units at the surgery site during posterior spinal procedures.
