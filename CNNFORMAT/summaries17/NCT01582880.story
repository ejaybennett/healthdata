(secondQuint)Use of Cross-linked Donor Corneas as Carriers for the Boston Keratoprosthesis.

 The corneal cross-linking technique has been shown to strengthen the cornea and resist degradation by the body's own enzymes.

 The use of highly-resistant donor corneas is meant to eliminate the serious post-operative complication of corneal melting (keratolysis) that repeatedly occurs in Boston KPro patients with severe ocular burns, autoimmune and cicatrizing diseases.

 Use of Cross-linked Donor Corneas as Carriers for the Boston Keratoprosthesis@highlight

The purpose of the pilot study is to test the efficacy and safety of riboflavin/Ultraviolet A (UVA) cross-linked human donor corneas as carriers for the Boston Keratoprosthesis (Boston KPro) in patients with higher risk for corneal melting (keratolysis).
