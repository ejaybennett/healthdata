(secondQuint)Correlation Between Glycated Hemoglobin and Mean Plasma Glucose in Hemodialysis Patients.

 The Hb turnover in hemodialysis population is higher than the general population leading to a general believe that HbA1c tend to underestimate mean plasma glucose.

 The investigators are trying to define the correlation between mean plasma glucose and HbA1c in the hemodialysis population and trying to study the factors that could affect this correlation (dose of erythropoetin, ret count.

.

) We are trying to see if HbA1c is a better tool to assess glycemic control over 1 month than glycemic control over 3 month.

 This clinicaly will translate in obtaining HbA1c more frequently in hemodialysis patients to assess their glycemic control.

 Correlation Between Glycated Hemoglobin and Mean Plasma Glucose in Hemodialysis Patients@highlight

The investigators are studying the correlation between Hba1c and the mean plasma glucose in diabetic hemodialysis patients.

We are reviewing if HbA1c is a good clinical tool to assess glycemic control over a 3 months duration in hemodialysis patients
