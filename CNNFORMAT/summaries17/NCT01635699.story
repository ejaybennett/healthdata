(firstQuint)Effect of Modified Fujita Technique Uvulopalatoplasty on Oxidative DNA Damage Levels in Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea SyndromE (OSAS).

 Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a sydrome which has characteristic upper way obstruction and a decrease in blood oxygen saturation as sleeping.

 uvulopalatopharngoplasty (UPPP)is one of the surgical approaches applied to the patients with OSAS, since the oxidative damage markers have been found high in patients with OSAS.

 Although antioxidant levels were higher in patients with OSAS than those in normal population, there is report about the effect of UPPP on antioxidant status in patients with OSAS.

 We performed this study to confirm whether is there a We performed the present study to confirm whether there is a relationship between the OSAS and oxidative damage before and after UPPP.

The purpose of this study is to determine the possible effects of uvulopalatopharngoplasty (UPPP) -which is a a therapy used on patients with Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS- on oxidative damage.
