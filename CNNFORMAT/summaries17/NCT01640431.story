(secondQuint)Lumbar Segmental Stabilization and TENS in Lumbar Disc Herniation.

 Objective: To contrast the efficacy efficacy of method Lumbar Segmental Stabilization and TENS on pain, functional capacity and ability to activate the TrA of individuals with chronic back pain caused by disc herniation.

 Design: Sixty patients are being randomized into two groups namely: Lumbar Segmental Stabilization (LS ) (specific exercises for the muscles transversus abdominis and lumbar multifidus) (n = 30) and TENS group (TG) (n = 30) receiving assistance under a current of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).

 Groups were contrasted regarding pain (visual analogical scale and McGill pain questionnaire), functional disability (Oswestry disability questionnaire) and TrA muscle activation capacity (Pressure Biofeedback Unit = PBU).

 The program lasts for 8 weeks, and sessions happen twice a week, with duration of one hour each.

 Evaluations will be performed before, after and with a follow-up six months after treatment.

 Significance level is established at 5%.
