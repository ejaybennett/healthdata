(firstQuint)Real Life Effectiveness in Patients With Not Optimally Controlled Asthma.

 1.

 All not-well controlled asthma patients would include the study.

 2.

 We will compare three ways of asthma control including SMART, fixed doses with regular doses and fixed doses with higher doses 3.

 We will evaluate the efficacy/safety for these not-well controlled patients.
