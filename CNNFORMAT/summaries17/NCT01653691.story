(secondQuint)Laser Therapy for Treating Hypertrophic Burn Scars in Children.

 In this study we hope to answer an important question in pediatric burn care: what are the techniques whereby tunable-dye laser neo-vessel ablation is optimally employed to ameliorate hypertrophic scars resulting from burn injuries in children? Hypertrophic scarring is considered an adverse wound healing event that results in abnormal scar formation.

 This scarring process is associated with pruritis and discomfort and can interfere with function and aesthetics.

 Topical creams, massage, stretching and pressure are used as standard treatments of burn scar formation.

 With the child serving as their own control, we want to objectively measure the impact of PDL on burn scars in children.

 Variables of timing of application, duration and number of sessions will all be collected.
