(secondQuint)Steady-state Pharmacokinetics of BIA 2-093 and Oxcarbazepine in Healthy Volunteers.

 Single centre, open-label, randomised, three-way crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers.

 The study consisted of three 8-day treatment periods separated by washout periods of 10-15 days.

 On each of the treatment periods the volunteers received either a daily oral dose of BIA 2-093 900 mg once-daily (od), BIA 2-093 450 mg twice-daily (bid), or Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal(R)) 450 mg bid.
