(thirdQuint)Multicenter Trial Evaluating the Immunogenicity of HPV Vaccination in Girls on Immunosuppressive Therapy.

.

 The human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the cause of the most common sexually transmitted infection.

 Among oncogenic HPV, HPV 16 and 18 are found in 70% of invasive cancers.

 Among the non-oncogenic HPV, HPV 6 and 11 are found in 90% of anogenital warts.

 Two prophylactic vaccines are currently available: Gardasil (R) protects against HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 and Cervarix (R) that protects against HPV16 and 18.

 Gardasil (R) is indicated for the prevention of high-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN2-3), cancers of the cervix, high-grade dysplasia of the vulva (VIN2-3) and genital warts.

 The choice of Gardasil (R) is linked to the theoretical risk of graft rejection with the bivalent vaccine, and the fact that the frequency of anogenital warts related to HPV 6 and 11 is increased in the immunocompromised population.

 The immunosuppressed women are more likely to present abnormal cervical smears than general population.

 A notice on the age of vaccination against HPV for girls to receive a transplant was made by the High Council of Public Health, recommending that vaccination against HPV could be offered to girls to benefit a transplant before the age of 14 years and according to data from the MA.

 The High Council of Public Health also renewed its request that studies be conducted specifically on the vaccination of girls and young women, immunocompromised, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

 The primary objective is to evaluate the persistence of immunological response to tetravalent HPV vaccine at 18 months after first dose of vaccine.

PRIMAVERA is a Phase IIa clinical trial, with the objective to assess the immunologic response to HPV vaccine in a population of immunocompromised girls.

 The principal hypothesis is that the immunologic response to tetravalent vaccine in girls who received immunosuppressive treatment is comparable to the immunologic response in girls that are not immunosuppressed.
