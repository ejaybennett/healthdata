(firstQuint)Laryngeal Mask Airway in Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy.

 The laryngeal mask airway (LMA)is a device used to secure the airway of patients during general anesthesia.

 This device is routinely used for anesthesia in elective head and neck surgeries, including adenotonsillectomy.

 In this study, the efficacy of the LMA will be studied as it pertains to operative times and cost.

 The child will be randomized into either the LMA group or the ETT group.
