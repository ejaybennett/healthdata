(secondQuint)Physical and Chemical Study of Atherosclerosis Mechanisms.

 The chemical and physical properties of different lipids of body.

 The clinical part of the work is a prospective randomized comparative controlled clinical trial of patients with atherosclerotic diseases.

 Developed the concept of "limited biological resources" of the body based on the increase in the expenditure of energy reserves of the body, allowing a critical look at overweight.

 The role of overweight in the development of atheromatous fat was revealed.

 The positive results from the weight loss in patients with atherosclerotic disease were drawn.

 Developed the metabolic concept of atherosclerosis associated with evolutionary aging and conversion of lipids in hard atherosclerotic fat.

 Physical and Chemical Study of Atherosclerosis Mechanisms@highlight

Study the mechanisms of atherosclerosis based on a comparative study of physical and chemical properties of lipid tissues at various localization with subsequent development of concept of treatment and prevention.
