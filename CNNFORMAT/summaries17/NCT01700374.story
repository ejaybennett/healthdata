(thirdQuint)Happy Mommy! Happy Baby! Study.

 The objectives of this study are to further our understanding of maternal prepubertal adversity on fetal and infant neuroendocrine development.

 This study utilizes 3-D ultrasound to measure fetal adrenal gland volume, a battery of psychosocial/behavioral assessments to determine the degree of maternal stress and prepubertal adversity, and an acoustic startle paradigm and Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) to assess maternal arousal.

 This study also utilizes an infant stress test to assess infant arousal.

The purpose of this study is to determine how difficult life-events that women experienced during their childhood might affect their babies.

 Women who are asked to participate in this study will fill out forms about their physical and mental health, have 3D ultrasounds of their baby's adrenal gland, have their stress responses measured and have their baby's development and stress responses assessed.
