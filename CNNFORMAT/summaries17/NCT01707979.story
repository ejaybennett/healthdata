(firstQuint)NIR- and Multifrequent Impedance Spectroscopy on the Skin in Type 1 Diabetes.

 The aim of the study is to examine how suitable a hand-held measuring probe (DDD-probe) using NIR (near infrared light) as well as impedance (conductivity), is to detect early signs of diabetic neuropathy.

 The DDD-probe is put directly on the skin and is measuring by the use of light and impedance.
