(thirdQuint)Clinical Trial of Autologous Adipose Tissue Derived Stromal Cell Therapy for Ischemic Heart Failure.

 The population of the ischemic heart failure patients is enormous in Japan and the only radical treatment for them is heart transplantation: however, the number of giving donor is extremely limited.

 Mesenchymal stem cells have been capable to differentiate into mesodermal-lineage cells as well as endodermal-lineage cells such as myocardial cell.

 They reside in the mesenchymal tissues such as bone marrows as well as adipose tissues.

 The latter tissues are relatively enriched with mesenchymal stem cells compared to bone marrow cells.

 In this study, the ischemic heart failure patients will undergo intracoronary administration of autologous adipose tissue derived stromal cells through cardiac catheterization.

 Clinical Trial of Autologous Adipose Tissue Derived Stromal Cell Therapy for Ischemic Heart Failure@highlight

Mesenchymal stem cells have capability to differentiate into myocardium, vascular endothelial cell, vascular smooth muscle cell and will be useful for heart regeneration.

 Adipose tissue is relatively enriched with mesenchymal stem cell compared to bone marrow tissue.

 In this trial, eligible ischemic heart failure patients will be proceeded intracoronary administration of autologous adipose tissue derived stromal cells by cardiac catheterization.
