(fifthQuint)A Phase I-II Study of PAXG in Stage III-IV Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.

 OBJECTIVES: PHASE I: to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of nab-paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin, capecitabine, and gemcitabine.

 PHASE II: to evaluate the feasibility and the activity of the PAXG regimen in terms of 6-months progression-free survival in patients with stage III and IV pancreatic cancer.

 OUTLINE Phase I - dose finding single institution trial, followed by a randomized open label multicenter phase II trial.

 Phase II: Patients will be stratified by stage (III vs IV) and CA19.

9 level (10 x ULN); Patients will be randomly assigned to receive PAXG (arm A) or gemcitabine-nab-paclitaxel regimen (arm B).

 Treatment plan (phase II): Arm A: PAXG every 4 weeks (1 cycle): cisplatin at 30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15, nab-paclitaxel at the RP2D on days 1 and 15, capecitabine at 1250 mg/ m2 days 1-28, gemcitabine at 800 mg/ m2 on days 1 and 15.

 Arm B: Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel every 4 weeks (1 cycle): gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15; nab-paclitaxel at 125 mg/mq on days 1, 8 and 15.

 Treatment will be administered for a maximum of 6 cycles or until there is a clinical benefit.

 A Phase I-II Study of PAXG in Stage III-IV Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma@highlight

Four-drug combo yielded a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival compared to gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

 Nab-Paclitaxel showed promising antitumor activity in patients with pancreatic cancer.

 Given the synergism of taxanes with gemcitabine, fluoropyrimidines and platinating agents the role of nab-Paclitaxel in a 4-drug regimen will be explored.

 The aim of this trial is to determine the recommended dose of nab-paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin, capecitabine, and gemcitabine, PAXG regimen (Phase I), and to evaluate the feasibility and the activity of the PAXG regimen in patients with stage III and IV pancreatic cancer.
