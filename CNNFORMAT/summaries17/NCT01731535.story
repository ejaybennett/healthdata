(firstQuint)Evaluation of the Risk for Radiographic and Clinical Nonunion in Patients With Previous Bisphosphonates Therapy.

.

 We intend to review the UWHealth patient database to identify individuals with delayed or nonunion fractures.

 Subsequently, we will collect associated medical information related to fractures such as age of osteoporosis diagnosis, BMI, previous bisphosphonate treatment, type and location of fracture, time to complete union, other treatment needed for nonunion etc.

 With this information, we will evaluate the risk of delayed and nonunion fractures in patients previously receiving bisphosphonate treatment compared to a normal population.

 We also will investigate other potential causes of delayed or nonunion fractures in this population.

 Evaluation of the Risk for Radiographic and Clinical Nonunion in Patients With Previous Bisphosphonates Therapy.

@highlight

Dose and duration of bisphosphonate therapy will increase the likelihood that patients experience delayed healing of non-union fractures.
