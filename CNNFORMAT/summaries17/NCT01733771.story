(fifthQuint)The Effect of Complementary Medicine (CAM) Treatments on Common Symptoms in Hospitalized Patients.

 Symptomatic patients are referred to CAM treatments by the medical staff of the departments.

 Patients interested in CAM treatments may receive various CAM treatments such as reflexology, acupuncture, guided imagery and hypnosis, according to patient preference and practitioner availability.

 Patients are requested to grade the severity of their symptoms on a visual analogue scale (0-100) before treatment and within 3 hours following treatments.

 Patients who are interested in standard care alone and not interested in CAM treatments grade their symptoms similarly, and serve as a control group.

 Primary outcomes are symptomatic relief and secondary outcomes are correlations between belief or disbelief in CAM with the primary outcomes.
