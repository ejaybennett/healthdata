(thirdQuint)Analysis of Cisatracurium Consumption in Balanced Anesthesia With 1% Sevoflurane, and With Only Sevoflurane, Using a Closed-loop Computer Controlled System Infusion.

.

 156 patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II were assigned to three groups.

 The patients were all on schedule for elective general surgery under general anesthesia with duration of at two to four hours.

 All patients were induced with Etomidate (0.

2mg/kg), Midazolam (0.

05-0.

1mg/kg), Sufentanil (0.

3-0.

5 mu g/kg) and a bolus dose of Cisatracurium (0.

15mg/kg).

 Patients were aged between 20 and 65.

 The maintenance of anesthesia in each group varies as follows: Patients in Group 1 were all maintained with Total Intravenous Anesthesia, Group 2 with Sevoflurane at 1% and propofol infusion, Group 3 with only sevoflurane.

 Muscle paralysis is maintained using a closed-loop computer gated infusion of Cisatracurium which kept T1 mu g of Sufentanil.

@highlight

The aim in this study was to quantify the difference in cisatracurium and sufentanil consumption, and its recovery period, when patients are under balanced general anesthesia with 1% sevoflurane and patients under only sevoflurane general anesthesia, using a closed loop computer control infusion.

 Investigators further investigated this effect on its recovery period and sufentanyl consumption.
