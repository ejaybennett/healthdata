(thirdQuint)CD19 Redirected Autologous T Cells.

 This study is being conducted to determine the optimal dose of autologous CART-19 T cells engineered to express anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptors in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19 positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

 The two dose levels being assessed are 1-5x10e8 versus 1-5x10e7.

 The trial will be conducted in two stages.

 In stage I subjects will be randomized into one of the two dose cohort with a1:1 ratio for a total of 12 subjects per dose cohort.

 Stage II will be to enroll an additional 8 subjects to the selected dose cohort once safety, tolerability and clinical responses have been evaluated to determine the optimal dose cohort.

 CD19 Redirected Autologous T Cells@highlight

This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group study to determine the optimal dose of CART-19 cells (autologous T cells expressing CD19 chimeric antigen receptors expressing tandem TCR Zeta and 4-1 BB co-stimulatory domains) of the two dose levels being assessed (1-5x10e8 vs.

 1-5x10e7 CART-19 cells).

 This trial will be conducted in two stages.
