(fifthQuint)Vinorelbine-ifosfamide Versus Gefitinib for EGFR Gene Mutation Negative Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients.

 Ifosfamide is a first generation cytotoxic drug to treat NSCLC.

 Phase II studies demonstrated that single-agent ifosfamide administrated by various schedules produces response rates of 15-29%, with media survival times of 5-7 months.

 Ifosfamide has also been used in various combination regimens to treat NSCLC, including platinum based and non-platinum regimens.

 But in refractory NSCLC patients platinum and some third generation cytotoxic drugs have been used before.

 So in this study, ifosfamide is combined with vinorelbine.

 In previous study, Masters reported the objective response rate was 40% and the median survival duration was 50 weeks, with a 1-year survival rate of 48% with vinorelbine-ifosfamide regimen [Vinorelbine 15 mg/m2 on days 1-3, and ifosfamide 2.

0g/m2 on days 1-3 with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) support].

 The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of this regimen is myelosuppression.

 In our experience, the regimen of vinorelbine 25mg/m2 d1, d8 and ifosfamide 1.

25g/m2 d1-d3 with Mesna uroprotection is safe in Chinese population and the objective response rate is about 7% (data not published).

 Gefitinib is the first small molecule inhibitor that has directed activity towards EGFR and has shown appreciable response rates in phase II trials of patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC.

 In the posterior analysis of Iressa Dose Evaluation in Advanced Lung Cancer (IDEAL) and IRESSA Survival Evaluation in Lung Cancer (ISEL) trials, the response rate with gefitinib ranges from 2.

6% to 10% in wild-type EGFR gene NSCLC patients.

 Vinorelbine-ifosfamide Versus Gefitinib for EGFR Gene Mutation Negative Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients@highlight

In the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline for NSCLC, epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) is recommended as the third-line treatment for EGFR gene mutation negative NSCLC patients who failed to the first-line platinum doublet chemotherapy [i.

e.

 paclitaxel-carboplatin (PC) or gemcitabine-cisplatin (GP)] and the second-line chemotherapy with docetaxel or pemetrexed.

 But as we know, if patients had no EGFR gene mutation, EGFR-TKI treatment is not effective.

 The overall survival is short and the objective response rate is low.

 As for EGFR gene wild type patients with good performance status, besides EGFR-TKI treatment, other first generation cytotoxic drugs i.

e.

 vinorelbine or ifosfamide maybe an alternative treatment.

 So the purpose of this clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness and safety of vinorelbine-ifosfamide with gefitinib in advanced or metastatic EGFR gene mutation negative NSCLC patients.
