(thirdQuint)A 2-Part Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability, pk, Effects on Histology and Some Clinical Parameters of Givinostat in Ambulant Children With DMD.

 Approximately 20 children will be enrolled in the study as follows: the first 4 children will be treated at a low dose level of Givinostat.

 If none of the stopping criteria described in the study protocol are met after 2 weeks of treatment at the low dose, the review team will determine the escalated dose level (i.

e.

, intermediate dose level) to be used for the treatment of an additional 8 children who will be treated at the intermediate dose.

 The 4 children previously treated at the low dose level will also be switched to the intermediate dose level.

 If none of the stopping criteria are met after 2 weeks of treatment at the intermediate dose, the review team will determine the subsequent escalated dose level to be used for the treatment of an additional 8 children who will be treated at the high dose.

 All children treated at the intermediate dose level will be switched to the high dose level.

 Once all 20 children enrolled during the Part 1 of the study have been treated for at least 2 weeks, the review team will determine the recommended dose (RD) to be used in Part 2 based on the safety and tolerability profile observed and on the pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses.

 All the children enrolled will switch to the RD level, which will be administered for the subsequent 12 months of the study (Part 2).

 The additional children (if any) will be enrolled during Part 2 of the study and will receive the RD of Givinostat for 12 months.

 The total duration of the study is 15 months and an additional 12 months for the extension phase.

This is a 2-part, phase 2 study to assess the effects of Givinostat on muscle histologic parameters and on clinical parameters in ambulant children with DMD.

 The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Givinostat will also be assessed.

 All children treated in part 2 continue in the extension phase, for a maximum of an additional 12 months.
