(secondQuint)Efficacy Combined Fecal Immunochemical Test-Sigmoidoscopy for the Detection of Advanced Colorectal Neoplasia.

 The investigators will evaluate the efficacy of FITS for the detection of advanced colorectal neoplasia compared to colonoscopy.

 This study was designed as multicenter randomized interventional study.

 The expected period are 36months.

 A total 13 tertiary hospitals will participate in the study.

 Subjects will be randomly allocated to FITS group and colonoscopy group.

 Subjects who undergo FITS will be performed by following colonoscopy to confirm the efficacy of FITS.

 In colonoscopy group, subjects as a control group would be performed colonoscopy.
