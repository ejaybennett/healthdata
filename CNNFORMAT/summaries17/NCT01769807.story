(thirdQuint)Efficacy Study of CPAP on Nitrate and Norepinephrine Levels in Severe and Mild-moderate Sleep Apnea (SABIO).

 The investigators aimed to compare NOx and U-NE levels and blood pressure (BP) between male patients with mild-moderate and severe OSA and determine the impact of 1 month of CPAP therapy on these parameters.

 The investigators undertook a prospective study of 67 consecutive OSA patients (36 mild-moderate, 31 severe).

 Measurements of plasma NOx at 11 pm, 4 am and 7 am, 24-h U-NE and ambulatory BP were obtained at baseline and after 1 month of CPAP.

 Efficacy Study of CPAP on Nitrate and Norepinephrine Levels in Severe and Mild-moderate Sleep Apnea (SABIO)@highlight

Reduced plasma nitrate (NOx) levels and increased urinary norepinephrine (U-NE) levels have been described in severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and are reverted by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

 The investigators wanted to know the effect of CPAP on these biomarkers in mild-moderate OSA.
