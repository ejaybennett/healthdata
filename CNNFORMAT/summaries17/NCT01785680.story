(thirdQuint)Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) in Sierra Leone.

 Specific Aim 1: Implement an integrated protocol in Sierra Leone for the management of MAM and non-complicated SAM that uses a single anthropometric indicator as well as the same food.

 Standard care refers to traditional, segregated treatment of MAM and SAM.

 Hypothesis: An integrated management protocol for MAM and SAM will achieve greater community coverage and a greater individual recovery rate than standard care.

 Methods Eligible subjects will be children with MAM or non-complicated SAM aged 6-59 months.

 MAM is defined as MUAC 11.

5 cm.

 Non-complicated SAM will be defined as MUAC 11.

5 cm, the RUTF dose will be reduced.

 Upon follow-up, caretakers of children will be questioned about symptoms of acute illness, compliance with study foods and food intolerance or allergy.

 If edema persists or MUAC is 12.

5 cm, an additional two weeks of RUTF will be dispensed.

 If the child is judged to have altered mental status, respiratory distress or an acute clinical illness needing medical care, the child will be referred to the health center for complicated SAM and withdrawn.

 If MUAC > 12.

5 cm, the child will be given lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS), a bed net, albendazole, zinc, referral for immunizations compliant with current WHO recommendations, oral rehydration salts to give if the child has more than three loose watery stools in 24 hours, and asked to return for follow-up in 1, 3 and 6 months.

 Caretakers will be instructed to seek medical care sooner if the child has fever, poor appetite or signs of an acute illness.

 If the child is between 6-24 months of age, the caretaker will participate in enhanced breastfeeding counseling, carried out by the Care Group model.

 A Care Group is a team of 10 to 15 trained volunteers who provide health and nutrition education to residents within 10 to 15 households each, with the aim of changing behavior and health practices.

 Each integrated program center will implement one or several Care Groups depending on the number of 6-24 month old children enrolled in the program.

 The Care Group model is built upon multiplication of volunteer effort, peer support and community mobilization, thereby creating a social movement involving the entire community to foster positive behavior change.

 The key message is appropriate complementary feeding with continued breastfeeding in 6-24 month old children.

 Ancillary messages to be included are family planning, immediate and exclusive breastfeeding of infants 0-5 months, and safe hygiene practices.

 All health and community health workers involved in the project will follow a one week Care Group training to support adequate complementary feeding for the 6-24 month olds.

 Participation Standard Protocol These children will receive treatment in accordance with the 'National protocol for community-based management of acute malnutrition' of Sierra Leone, which reflects standard practice worldwide.

 The management scheme uses weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) to categorize children and includes separate care for MAM and non-complicated SAM, using different foods.

 A research assistant will be assigned to the standard care sites to collect informed consent, data, and to assess the availability of foods and supplies.

 If food is not available, the study will supply, as it is essential for making a valid comparison between the two protocols.

 Integrated Protocol Foods Children participating in the integrated treatment protocol will receive, as a supplement to the normal diet, 75 kcal/kg/d RUTF when MUAC 11.

5 cm and edema has resolved, whether s/he was enrolled for MAM or SAM.

 Children with MUAC 12.

5 cm.

 IMC will enroll children between 6-24 months of age whose caretaker will participate in enhanced breastfeeding counseling, carried out by the Care Group model or a modified version tailored to the context of the research program.

 Study design IMC will assist each integrated program center to implement one or several Care Groups depending on the number of 6-24 month old children enrolled in the program.

 The key message for this group of care givers will focus on appropriate complementary feeding with continued breastfeeding in 6-24 month old children Ancillary messages to be included are family planning, health care seeking behaviors, and safe hygiene practices.

 IMC will train all community health workers involved in the project in a one week intensive training on the Care Group approach to support adequate complementary feeding for the 6-24 month olds.

 Participation Caretakers will be approached for sub study enrollment immediately upon successful completion of therapy for MAM, during the interval when their children are receiving the LNS.

 It is anticipated that the children whose mother received the Care Group counseling will have greater breast milk intake.

 There are ample numbers of eligible children in the study such that if a mother chooses not to participate or drops out after agreeing, a replacement can be easily found.

 Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) in Sierra Leone@highlight

The long-term objective of this proposal is to develop and demonstrate an effective, integrated and streamlined protocol to treat moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and non-complicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children during humanitarian emergencies.

 Hypothesis: An integrated management protocol for MAM and SAM will achieve greater community coverage and a greater individual recovery rate than standard care.
