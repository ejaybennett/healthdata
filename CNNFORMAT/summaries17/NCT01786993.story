(thirdQuint)MultiPoint Pacing IDE Study.

 All subjects will undergo a 2 dimensional Echocardiogram within the 30 days prior to implant, and again at 3, 6 and 9 months post implant.

 At implant, the final LV pacing configuration is programmed using any one of the 10 available pacing vectors.

 The paced/sensed atrioventricular (AV) and interventricular (VV) delays may be optimized as per the site's standard of care.

 Subjects will continue to receive BiV therapy until the 3-month follow-up visit.

 At the 3-month visit, responder status between Enrollment and 3 months will be assessed using the Clinical Composite Score (CCS).

 All subjects that are "Improved" using the definition outlined in the CCS will be grouped together as Responders.

 All subjects that are "Worsened" or "Unchanged" using the definitions outlined in the CCS will be considered as Non-responders.

 All subjects will undergo acute measurement of cardiac performance (e.

g.

, Echocardiography) at various MPP combinations compared to BiV pacing.

 Only subjects with "equal or better" echocardiographic measurements (i.

e.

, EA VTI measurements) with MPP feature on compared to BiV pacing will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two arms - BiV arm or MPP arm.

 At the 9-month visit, responder status will be evaluated once again using the CCS and compared to the status at 3 months.

 MultiPoint Pacing IDE Study@highlight

This IDE study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multi-center clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of patient treatment with MPP compared to patient treatment with standard BiV pacing at 9 months.

 The study will be conducted at a maximum of 50 investigational centers located in the United States.

 A maximum of 506 subjects implanted with the Quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy device (CRT-D) system will be enrolled in the study.
