(fifthQuint)Effect of Managing Problematic Eating Behaviours With Dietary Management on Chronic Disease Self-management.

 This study is specifically focusing on Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and Hypertension as these are chronic conditions in which dietary management is not only an integral part of managing the condition, but can also be a major factor in poor outcomes.

 Many of the current approaches and interventions used for treating these conditions provide patients with information about "what" eating behaviours to change and "how" to change them, such as through DEP (Diabetes Education Program) and CDSM (Chronic Disease Self-Management, aka Stanford).

 The new intervention proposed in this study will be primarily based on material from the Craving Change cent program; the focus of which is to provide patients with an understanding of "why" it is difficult to change problematic eating behaviours.

 The new information that will be added is specific to chronic disease management.

 The original Craving Change cent program provides patients with information about how the environment, the physical body and emotional reactions can contribute to problematic eating behaviours thus increasing difficulty in changing those behaviours.

 The Craving Change cent program also provides patients with tools for overcoming the identified obstacles from the environment, physical body and emotional reactions in order to facilitate behaviour change.

 Patients who have a diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and/or Hypertension and who are poorly controlled, are often required to make dietary changes to improve those conditions and often struggle to make the necessary dietary behaviour changes.

 By providing these patients with a behavioural intervention that uses the main components of the Craving Change cent program along with additional information specific to chronic disease management, the overall aim is to help patients improve control over the chronic condition with which they have been diagnosed.

 As this is a feasibility study, the main goal is to determine if patients who are diagnosed with chronic disease(s) can be recruited successfully, stay in the program and experience a change in their perceptions of eating behaviours as a result of learning various strategies offered in the program.

 Specifically, this study is focusing on whether the strategies learned improve emotion regulation, which in turn could facilitate behaviour change.

 Our primary outcome measure is the EEQ ("Emotional Eater Questionnaire"); which is a validated 10 item questionnaire measuring the degree of interaction between emotion and food choice.

 This study is a Randomized Control Trial.

 The setting is 3 Family Health Teams in the Greater Toronto Area.

 Eligibility criteria includes rostered status to the Family Health Team, no previous participation in a program using Craving Change cent , diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and/or Hypertension, and 2 of 3 high A1c / BP / LDL.

 Patients are identified using Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and those patients meeting criteria are sent an EEQ via mail.

 Patients consenting to participation are invited to intake at which blood pressure (BP), height/weight/waist circumference (ht/wt/wc) is measured and patients are randomized to immediate participation in the program or to wait list control.

 After 6 weeks EEQ is re-administered, and BP, ht/wt/wc is measured again.

 Effect of Managing Problematic Eating Behaviours With Dietary Management on Chronic Disease Self-management@highlight

Dietary management is an integral aspect of self care for many chronic diseases.

 Craving Change cent is a standard program already offered at many Family Health Teams (FHT) to patients interested in being more mindful of their food choices.

 The program helps patients understand why they have difficulty with modifying behaviours associated with diet, addresses the impact of emotion on eating behaviour and provides affect regulation strategies.

 Existing literature shows that emotion has a strong effect on food choice and that emotion regulation can lead to improvements in food choice.

 Craving Change cent , however, is currently not selectively offered at FHTs to patients deemed to be at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and has not been evaluated in that context.

 For this study, we propose to 1) Selectively target patients at higher cardiometabolic risk; and 2) Evaluate an effect of the program (as modified to address chronic diseases) through a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).

 If found to be effective, the modified Craving Change cent program, called "Beyond the Fork: A health-centred approach to managing chronic disease", could be broadly implemented within Family Health Teams.
