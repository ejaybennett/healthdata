(fifthQuint)Lifestyle Intervention for Treatment of Diabetes.

 The Look AHEAD trial has demonstrated improved risk factor control among overweight or obese diabetes patients who received an intensive lifestyle intervention at both one and four years after enrollment.

 Translating such findings into accessible and effective weight loss programs is a major public health challenge.

 We are conducting "Lifestyle Interventions for Treatment of Diabetes" (LIFT Diabetes).

 The overall goal is to investigate two approaches to improving risk factor control; one which is modeled after Look AHEAD and is designed to achieve 7% weight loss and increase physical activity to > 175 minutes per week among minority and lower income diabetes patients via a 12-month, group based lifestyle intervention, using community health workers supervised by an interventionist.

 Participants will have up to 4 group visits/month and up to 12 individual contacts/year.

 The other approach will promote Diabetes Self Management (DSM) by educating participants regarding health behaviors which lead to improved diabetes control; this arm is also 12 months, and is delivered in the clinic by intervention staff via monthly group visits and up to 12 individual contacts/year.

 We will randomize 260 overweight or obese adults with diabetes to either intervention, and determine the impact on outcomes (UKPDS-estimated CVD risk, risk factor control), weight, cost, resource utilization, and safety at 12 months, and after transitioning back to usual care, at 24 months.

 The hypotheses are that the community based intervention results in 10% relative reduction in CVD risk compared to clinic-based intervention; the interventions are equivalent with respect to adherence and participant satisfaction; and the community based intervention is associated with lower cost than the clinic based intervention.

 Translating evidence based, lifestyle strategies, and targeting minority and underserved patients, will yield, if successful, models for addressing diabetes-related health disparities.

 Lifestyle Intervention for Treatment of Diabetes@highlight

This study is evaluating two approaches to improving the control blood sugar, and other risk factors for heart disease in overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes.

 The first approach has participants focus on weight loss via reducing food intake and increasing physical activity, while attending weekly group sessions led by trained community health workers for 12 months.

 The second approach has participants receive education on diabetes self management, which focuses primarily on glucose control, while attending monthly group sessions led by a study staff member for 12 months.

 We are recruiting persons with type 2 diabetes who live in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area of North Carolina who are willing to attend sessions at the Downtown Health Plaza of Wake Forest Baptist Health.

 We will measure risk factors for heart disease (glucose control, blood pressure, blood cholesterol) and calculate the predicted risk of heart disease, and see which intervention lowers risk to a greater extent at 12 months, as well as 24 months.
