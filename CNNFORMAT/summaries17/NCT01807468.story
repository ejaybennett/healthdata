(thirdQuint)Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation and NK Cell Therapy in Patients With High-risk Solid Tumors.

 HaploSCT following reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen will be performed in patients with high-risk solid tumors.

 Both parents will be evaluated for their KIR genotype and phenotype and the one with the greatest degree of KIR-L mismatch with the patient will be selected as the donor.

 In addition, ex-vivo expanded NK cells derived from the donor will then be administered after haploSCT to increase the GVT effect.

 Low-dose IL-2 will be given after expanded NK cell infusion to enhance NK cell alloreactivity.
