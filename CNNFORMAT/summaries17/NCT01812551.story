(fifthQuint)Treatment of Low Bone Density in Cystic Fibrosis.

.

 The study included 2 phases.

 Phase 1 (1-year open-label observational study): following baseline evaluation, bone mass changes have been studied with a simple therapy of adequate calcium intake and 25-OH vitamin D supplements in all eligible subjects (N=171).

 Phase 2 (1-year double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study): the 128 subjects showing an insufficient response to calcium + 25-OH vitamin D alone (bone mass increase <5%) at the end of Phase 1, were randomized into 2 groups and assigned to alendronate treatment (N=65) or placebo (N=63) (in addition to calcium and 25-OH vitamin D as during Phase 1).

 The study has been carried out by the Coordinator's Institution (Istituto Auxologico Italiano)in collaboration with most Regional Reference Centers for CF in Italy.

 Treatment of Low Bone Density in Cystic Fibrosis.

@highlight

Cystic fibrosis (CF) -- an autosomal recessive genetic disease affecting about 60,000 individuals worldwide, including about 3,800 in Italy -- is often associated with low bone mineral mass.

 The current aggressive therapies have ensured a much longer survival of CF patients but this has led to a higher frequency of osteoporosis and bone fractures, a serious problem which not only affects quality of life, but also hinders further therapeutic measures.

 The aim of this study, conducted on a large group of children, adolescents and young adults with CF, has been the evaluation of bone mass changes after 1 year of a simple treatment with RDA-adjusted dietary calcium plus 25-OH vitamin D supplementation, and the feasibility and efficacy of alendronate treatment (for another year) in patients not responding to calcium + 25-OH vitamin D alone.
