(secondQuint)Pilot Study of Glycemic Control in Diabetic Hemodialyzed Patients.

 We conducted a pilot prospective multicenter study in five French centers (Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg Sainte Anne Hospital, Colmar, Mulhouse, Valenciennes) designed to evaluate the feasibility and effects of a 3 month treatment regimen with rapid-acting insulin and basal long-acting insulin analogues (i.

e.

, aspart and detemir, respectively) along with CGM on glucose level control in diabetic hemodialyzed patients.

 All patients who were admitted to the nephrology departments and matched the inclusion criteria between January 1st, 2010, and June 30th, 2012, were consecutively included in the study.

 CGM was used to analyze blood glucose excursions at baseline and 1 and 3 months of treatment.

 It was started during the first dialysis session and then continued for the next two days at home under ambulatory conditions.

 The CGM was continued during the next dialysis session.

 Therefore, in total, CGM (Navigator(R); Abbott, Rungis, France) was performed for 54 hours, including two consecutive hemodialysis sessions and at 0, 1, and 3 months of treatment.

 The probe for the system was subcutaneously inserted at the beginning of the first dialysis session to analyze interstitial glucose, and it was removed at the end of the second dialysis session.

 Due to the time required for CGM calibration, plasma glucose levels were only partially recorded during the first dialysis session.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of the basal-bolus detemir-aspart insulin regimen coupled with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on glycemic control in hemodialyzed patients with diabetes
