(secondQuint)A Study Exploring Two Strategies of Rivaroxaban (JNJ39039039; BAY-59-7939) and One of Oral Vitamin K Antagonist in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Who Undergo Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

 This is an open-label (both physician and participant know the treatment that the participant receives), randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), multicenter clinical study assessing the safety of 2 rivaroxaban treatment strategies and one vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment strategy in participants, who have paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and have had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement.

 A target of 2,100 participants will be randomized into the study, with approximately 700 participants in each treatment strategy group.

 The randomization will be stratified by the intended duration of DAPT (1, 6, or 12 months).

 The study consists of a screening phase, a 12-month open-label treatment phase, and an end-of-treatment/early withdrawal visit.

 The total duration of participation in the study for each participant is approximately 12 months.

The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety for 2 different rivaroxaban treatment strategies and one Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA) treatment strategy utilizing various combinations of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) or low-dose aspirin (ASA) or clopidogrel (or prasugrel or ticagrelor).
