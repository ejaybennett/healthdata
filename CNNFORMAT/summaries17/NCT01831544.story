(secondQuint)A Clinical Trial to Evaluate the HeartWare MVAD System (MVAdvantage).

 This multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, single-arm trial will investigate the safety and performance of the Miniaturized Ventricular Assist Device (MVAD(R)) system over 24 months in subjects with advanced heart failure.

 The primary endpoint is survival at 6 months presented as a simple proportion (subjects alive on the MVAD(R) pump divided by endpoint eligible subjects).

 Secondary endpoints include the incidence of bleeding, incidence of major infections (per INTERMACS definitions), time to death, incidence of all device failures and device malfunctions, Health Status improvement, and Functional status improvement.

 Safety measures will include the frequency and rates of adverse events, overall and for each specific event, which will be collected throughout VAD support.
