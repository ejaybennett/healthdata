010: A Study of Gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel With or Without NPC-1C to Treat Patients With Pancreatic Cancer.

 During Part 1 of the study, the safe and tolerable dose of NPC-1C in combination with Gemcitabine will be determined.

 Upon completion of the phase I study up to 90 patients be randomized to one of two arms: A: Patients will receive NPC-1C(NEO-102) infusion at a dose of 1.

5mg/kg IV nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion, maximum infusion time not to exceed 40 minutes) followed by gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion) for 3 consecutive weeks (on Day 1, 7 and 15 ) followed by a week of rest (for a 28 day cycle).

 OR B: Patients will receive on Day 1, 7 and 15 nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion, maximum infusion time not to exceed 40 minutes) followed by gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion) for 3 consecutive weeks (on Day 1, 7 and 15).

 NPC-1C(NEO-102) infusion at a dose of 1.

5mg/kg IV 30 minutes following the completion of the gemcitabine on days 1 and 15 of the 28 day cycle.
