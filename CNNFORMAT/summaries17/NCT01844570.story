(secondQuint)Levamlodipine Maleate or Amlodipine Besylate for Treatment of Hypertension: A Comparative Effectiveness Research.

 It is a multicenter, prospective cohort study with large sample size.

 It is to evaluate the effect on the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular endpoint events and blood pressure control in hypertensive patients who use Levamlodipine Maleate (Xuanning) or amlodipine besylate(Norvasc).

Xuanning group and Norvasc group will recruit 5000 patients respectively.

 Each site will recruit patients in chronological order;patients who participate will finish the two-year follow up(1,2,3,6,12,18,24 months after recruitment) and relevant data will be recorded.

 Baseline data will be analyzed to evaluate the equilibrium between two or more groups (such as the number of options).

 Logistic regression and propensity scores (PS) would be used to match major indicators of effectiveness and safety indicators using matching method baseline data.
