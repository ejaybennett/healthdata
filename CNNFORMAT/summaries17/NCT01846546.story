(fifthQuint)Cerebrospinal Fluid Endostatin/Collagen XVIII Concentrations in Patients With Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.

 Patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or less) requiring continuous lumbar drainage of CSF were included in the study.

 Patients delivered within 4 h whose highest abbreviated injury score was 3 or less (other than head injury) were considered to be isolated TBI cases and were included.

 To avoid interfering factors, patients who suffered open or combined injuries, had existing prior neurological disease were excluded.

 Those who died within the first week of hospitalization and/or whose serial cerebrospinal fluid samples could not be obtained were also excluded as having incomplete data.

 Accordingly, 30 patients were analyzed in this study.

 Demographic data, including age, gender, mechanism of trauma and GCS score at admission were documented when the patients arrived at the emergency room.

 The control group comprised 20 patients whose cerebrospinal fluid was examined via lumbar puncture for investigation of suspected neurological disease.

 All patients had normal neurological examination, negative imaging studies, and none had evidence of trauma or preexisting neurological disease, including tumors, vascular anomalies, or abnormalities of cerebrospinal fluid.

 The study had approval from the hospital ethics committee and informed consent for participating in the study was obtained from an appropriate member of each patient's family before performance of lumbar drainage.

 Cerebrospinal Fluid Endostatin/Collagen XVIII Concentrations in Patients With Severe Traumatic Brain Injury@highlight

Angiogenesis is an important pathophysiological response to traumatic brain injury (TBI) and modulated by pro- and anti-angiogenic factors.

 Recent studies have suggested that endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin/collagen XVIII might play an important role in the secondary brain injury following TBI.

 The aim of this study was to investigate early changes in the concentrations of CSF endostatin/collagen XVIII after TBI and evaluated the relations of endostatin/collagen XVIII to injury severity and clinical outcome.

 Endostatin/collagen XVIII concentrations were measured serially for 1 week after hospitalization by using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay method in the cerebrospinal fluid of 30 patients with TBI and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or less on admission.

 Comparative analysis were used to determine if its serial changes correlate with the GCS score and prognosis.

 Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to appraise the value of CSF endostatin/collagen XVIII levels in predicting the prognosis of patients with severe head injury.
