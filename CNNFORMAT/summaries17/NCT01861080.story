(thirdQuint)Korean Registry of Target Organ Damages in Hypertension.

 Background: the exact prevalence of target organ damages in Korean hypertensives are unknown.

 Study Objective: to investigate the prevalence of target organ damages in Korean patients with incident hypertension.

 Study Design: prospective, multi-center and observational study Study Populaton: approximately 5000 consecutive patients with incident hypertension, who visited outpatients clinics and agreed to participate in the registry Primary outcome - Subclinical organ damages 1.

 left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiogram or echocardiography 2.

9 mm) or plaque 3.

 increased pulse wave velocity (> 12 m/s) 4.

 low estimated glomerular filtration rate ( 133, W > 124 mmol/L; proteinuria > 300 mg/24 hr 4.

 Peripheral artery disease 5.

 Advanced retinopathy: hemorrhage or exudates, papilledema.

 Korean Registry of Target Organ Damages in Hypertension@highlight

The objective of this study is to know prevalence of clinical or subclinical target organ damages in Korea hypertensives by constructing nationwide hypertension registry.

 We will register 5000 consecutive patients with incident hypertension at 20 major university hospitals in South Korea.

 We will investigate clinical/subclinical target organ damages, renin/aldosterone level and cardiovascular events in each patient.
