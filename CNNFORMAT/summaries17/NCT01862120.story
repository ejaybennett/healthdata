(fifthQuint)Dose Finding Study of Il-2 at Ultra-low Dose in Children With Recently Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes.

 Main objective: Define the lowest dose of rhIL-2 inducing TREGS in children with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes.

 Conduct of the study: Three doses will be studied versus placebo in parallel groups of six patients.

 Each dose or placebo will be studied according to three periods of treatment: 1.

 Induction of TREGS following a cure of 5 days repeated once daily administration [day 1 - day 5].

 2.

 Maintenance of TREGS following repeated administration once every two weeks for one year [day 15 - day 337].

 At each treatment period, Treg response and tolerance will be evaluated.

 In addition, overall response on T1D parameters will be assessed throughout the study.

 Dose Finding Study of Il-2 at Ultra-low Dose in Children With Recently Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes@highlight

Human recombinant interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) is a biological signalling protein playing a key role in the regulation of the immune system.

 At high doses, rhIL-2 activates the immune effectors T cells (TEFFS) while at low doses rhIL-2 induces and activates regulatory T cells (TREGS), a population of immune cells controlling the immune Teff response.

 In patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), TREGS fail to control the autoimmune destruction by TEFFS of pancreatic beta-cells producing insulin.

 The investigator recently showed that rhIL-2 at low dose is well tolerated in patients with an autoimmune disease and in adults with established T1D, inducing TREGS without effects on TEFFS.

 The investigators aim to use rhIL-2 at low dose to induce/stimulate TREGS in young recently diagnosed T1D patients.

 This study will investigate the dose effect relationship of low dose rhIL-2 on TREG induction such as to optimize the risk benefit ratio of this treatment in T1D.

 Through Treg induction, the investigators aim to protect the remaining/regenerating pancreatic -cells from autoimmune destruction, thus improving or even curing T1D.
