(secondQuint)A Study to Assess the Effect of Abiraterone (JNJ-589485) on the Pharmacokinetics of Pioglitazone Following Administration of Abiraterone Acetate (JNJ-212082) and Pioglitazone HCl Tablets in Healthy Male Participants.

 This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) single-dose drug-drug interaction study to assess the effect of abiraterone on pioglitazone.

 Approximately 16 healthy adult male participants will be enrolled in this study.

 The study consists of a screening phase, an open-label treatment phase consisting of 2 single-dose treatment periods, end-of-study or withdrawal assessments done upon completion of the 72-hour pharmacokinetic sampling on Day 11 of Period 2 or upon withdrawal, and a follow-up visit 5 to 7 days after the last study procedure.

 The total study length is 32 days.

 Participants will receive pioglitazone alone on Day 1 (Period 1) of the study.

 On Day 8 (Period 2), participants will receive a single dose of abiraterone acetate followed by a single dose of pioglitazone one hour later.

 Successive pioglitazone administrations will be separated by a washout period of 7 days.

 Participants will be confined to the study center from Day -1 to Day 4 of Period 1 and from Day 7 to Day 11 of Period 2, at least 10 hours before each study drug administration until completion of the 72-hour blood sample collection for each period.

 A pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected from all participants on Day -1.

 Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of abiraterone on the pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to a drug) of pioglitazone when coadministered with abiraterone acetate in healthy adult male participants.
