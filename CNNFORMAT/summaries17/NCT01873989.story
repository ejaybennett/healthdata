(firstQuint)Testosterone Replacement for Male Opioid Agonist Maintained Patients.

 This study aims to assess the initial efficacy of testosterone replacement in male opioid agonist patients with symptomatic hypogonadism and chronic pain.

 The study has two specific aims: 1.

 To estimate, in male opioid agonist maintained patients, the prevalence of (a)symptomatic hypogonadism and (b) co-occurring symptomatic hypogonadism and chronic pain.

 2.

 To conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial to obtain data regarding the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy (compared to waitlist control) of testosterone replacement for male patients with chronic pain and opioid dependence, and symptomatic hypogonadism treated with opioid agonist maintenance treatment (N=40).
