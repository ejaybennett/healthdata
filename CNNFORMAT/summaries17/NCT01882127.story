(thirdQuint)All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) Combining Dexamethasone Versus High-dose Dexamethasone for Initial Treatment of Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP).

 The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, randomised controlled trial of 80 primary ITP adult patients from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China.

 One part of the participants are randomly selected to receive All-Trans Retinoic Acid(10mg tablet by mouth every 8 hours a day for 12 consecutive weeks, combining with dexamethasone (given orally at a dose of 40 mg per day for 4 days, the others are selected to receive high-dose of dexamethasone treatment (given orally at a dose of 40 mg daily for 4 days).
