(thirdQuint)Effects of Zolpidem CR in Sleep and Heart Recovery in Cardiac Intensive Care Unit Patients.

 The environment of an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is notoriously inhospitable to patients who experience a period of sleep deprivation (SD).

 Recent research has shown that SD, even in the short-term, may be related to echo and electrocardiographic changes that may potentially be predictors of cardiac arrhythmias.

 The objective is to evaluate the effects of early treatment with zolpidem controlled release (CR(R)) compared to a placebo on clinical and polysomnographic parameters for patients in a cardiac ICU who had recently been diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome.

 A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be conducted in cardiac ICU patients who had been diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome.

 The patients in group A will receive placebo and patients in group B will receive zolpidem CR(R) 12.

5 mg from the first night of hospitalization until their discharge.

 Patients will undergo overnight full polysomnography on the first night in the ICU and will complete a sleep diary with a visual analogue scale to evaluate sleep quality in the morning after the first 3 nights of hospitalization.

 The results of the routine ICU laboratory tests including the serum levels of cardiac enzymes [troponin T and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB)] will be collected preceding the first dose of the drug/placebo, and then daily thereafter.

 Effects of Zolpidem CR in Sleep and Heart Recovery in Cardiac Intensive Care Unit Patients@highlight

A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be conducted in cardiac ICU patients who had been diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, using a sleep promoting drug (zolpidem controlled release).

 The study hypothesis is that sleeping better can improve the heart recovery in patients with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.
