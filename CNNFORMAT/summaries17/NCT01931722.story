(secondQuint)Exercise and Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAA)Requirements in Older Men.

 We hypothesize that the dietary requirement for the branched chain amino acids (BCAA) in an older strength-trained (ST) population will be greater than the current recommendation (RDA).

 If so, a greater intake of BCAA together with ST is necessary if one aims to maximize muscle protein synthesis (MPS).

 Currently, the BCAA requirement in the ST older population (55-65 y) is unknown.

 This is critical information especially given the value of ST for overall health.

Likely, branched chain amino acid (BCAA) requirements are increased in older strength-trained (ST) individuals.

 If so, supplementation in this group will maximize muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and minimize loss of muscle with age (sarcopenia).
