(secondQuint)Ocular Surface Reconstruction With Cultivated Autologus Mucosal Epithelial Transplantation.

 Ocular surface damage caused by severe ocular surface diseases.

 Corneal limbal stem cell transplantation has been demonstrated to improve the outcome of ocular surface reconstruction.

 However, the conventional management of allograft limbal transplantation generally has unsatisfactory outcome because of high risk of rejection and requires long-life immunosuppressive medications.

 Ocular surface reconstruction with cultivated autologous mucosal epithelial transplantation is served to improve the surgical results of ocular surface reconstruction and decrease the use of immunosuppressive medications.

The purpose of this study is to elucidate the appropriate condition of developing cultivated autologous oral mucosal epithelial graft and evaluate the surgical outcome of transplantation of the cultivated cells in the patients.
