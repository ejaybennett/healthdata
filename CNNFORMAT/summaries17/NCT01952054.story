 Denosumab for Breast Cancer With Bone Mets@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if denosumab in combination with a hormonal drug can help lower the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with breast cancer that has spread to the bone.

 The safety of this combination will also be studied.

 This is an investigational study.

 Denosumab is FDA approved and commercially available to prevent bone-related events caused by breast cancer that has spread to the bone.

 Using denosumab to lower CTCs in patients with breast cancer that has spread to the bone is investigational.

 You may have the option of continuing denosumab after the study ends.

 Up to 35 patients will take part in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
