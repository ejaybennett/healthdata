(fifthQuint)How Does the Clinical Tool 'What's Going Around' Affect Clinical Practice.

 The epidemiological context of a patient's presentation can provide important information for clinicians to aid in diagnosis and treatment.

 The investigators previously developed and validated a syndromic surveillance tool for detecting influenza-like illness (ILI) encounters.

 The investigators then evaluated 40,642 outpatient ILI episodes during 'flu seasons' over 6 years.

 The investigators found that even after controlling for patient presentation and physician factors, the context in which a patient presented was strongly associated with the likelihood that an antimicrobial agent would be prescribed.

 Specifically, patients were less likely to be prescribed an antibiotic if they presented with ILI during the pandemic influenza period (when awareness of 'flu season' was very high), or after their physician had personally seen many patients with ILI in the prior week.

 Currently, most clinicians have only limited access to data regarding the 'context' in which a patient presents.

 Under such circumstances, physicians are often unaware of local epidemiological information that could help them make optimal treatment decisions.

 In centers with advanced use of electronic health records (EHRs), it is increasingly possible to perform syndromic surveillance that is local (e.

g.

 specific to a neighborhood or school district), current (e.

g.

 updated daily), and specific to a patient's characteristics (e.

g.

 age, chief complaint).

 To that end, the investigators have developed algorithms for syndromic surveillance for a number of syndromes including Asthma, ILI, Pertussis, Group A Streptococcus Pharyngitis, and Gastroenteritis.

 These algorithms may provide contextual information that might be of use to clinicians.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of how a point-of-care clinical decision tool in the form of syndromic surveillance algorithms affect clinical decision making amongst outpatient health care providers and also patient outcomes.

 We will be using a 2 year look back prior to tool roll out as a comparison.

 Specific Aims: To determine the effect this point-of-care clinical decision tool has on clinical decision making amongst primary care providers.

 To determine the clinical outcomes of patients whose physicians had access to these tools To understand how these point-of-care clinical decision tools are used among healthcare providers in day to day practice.

 How Does the Clinical Tool 'What's Going Around' Affect Clinical Practice@highlight

Previous work has shown that the epidemiological context of a patient's presentation can provide important information for clinicians to aid in diagnosis and treatment.

 With current electronic health records, it is increasingly possible to perform syndromic surveillance that is local and specific to a patient's characteristics.

 The investigators have developed algorithms for syndromic surveillance for a number of conditions in which contextual information might be of use to treating clinicians.

 The syndromic surveillance algorithms already developed are for influenza-like-illness, whooping cough, asthma exacerbation, Group A Streptococcal pharyngitis, and gastroenteritis infection.

 The investigators plan on studying these tools with a clustered randomized control cohort study evaluating how clinical decision making is affected by use of these tools by outpatient general practitioners.

 The goal is to incorporate these validated algorithms into a quality improvement tool which will provide point-of-care clinical decision support to clinicians
