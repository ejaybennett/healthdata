(secondQuint)Efficacy of Remodulin in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) and Pulmonary Hypertension.

 A prospective, open-label, non-randomized multi-center study is proposed to assess the efficacy of Remodulin in adults with congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension.

 Subjects will be enrolled at UCLA and Ohio State University (PI: Curt Daniels, MD).

 The study will involve a six month trial of continuous subcutaneous Remodulin therapy, with assessments conducted prior to initiation of therapy and at 1 and 6 months following initiation of therapy.

 A separate initiation visit will be scheduled after the baseline visit in order to provide subjects with comprehensive training in the use and care of the Remodulin drug delivery system.

 Baseline and post-treatment (6 month) assessments will include a history and physical examination, cardiopulmonary exercise test, six minute walking distance, serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR) quality of life survey, and subjective assessment of functional capacity (New York Heart Association (NYHA) scale).

 The interim (1 month) follow-up visit will include a thorough review of adverse events associated with Remodulin therapy, functional class assessment, six minute walk distance, and serum BNP.

 Remodulin will be initiated at 1.

25 ng/kg/min and increased by 2-6 ng/kg/min weekly to a target dose of 40 ng/kg/min.

 If the initial infusion rate cannot be tolerated it will be reduced to 0.

625 ng/kg/min.

 Changes in drug dose will be at the discretion of the investigators following review of interim events.

 If necessary, the dose may be decreased by 2 ng/kg/min every two days as tolerated.
