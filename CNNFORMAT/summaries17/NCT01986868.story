(thirdQuint)Identification of Adverse Plaque Characteristics by Coronary MR Angiography.

 This pilot study will examine 20 stable patients who have undergone a clinically-indicated coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) for suspected Coronary Artery Disease.

 They will be invited to undergo a research coronary Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan with contrast(CMRA).

 Based upon the subject's heart rate, a beta blocker may be administered as its use has been shown to be effective in producing better images as it widens the arteries.

 Researchers will use newly developed non-invasive coronary MRA techniques to compare information shown on the research CMRA with the clinical CCTA.

 While CCTA has been demonstrated to be able to provide data on adverse plaque characteristics (APC's), the ability of CMRA to evaluate these features is not established.

 Identification of Adverse Plaque Characteristics by Coronary MR Angiography@highlight

This is a pilot study to determine whether coronary magnetic resonance angiography(CMRA)can identify adverse plaque characteristics (buildup of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood) seen on coronary computed tomography angiography(CCTA) and evaluate whether there is a relationship between the adverse plaque characteristics and the presence of coronary artery wall inflammation.
