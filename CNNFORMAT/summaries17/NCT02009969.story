(firstQuint)Serial Comparisons of Abdominal and Neurological MRI Scans.

 Abdominal weight gain is a significant side effect of antipsychotic medications.

 It has even been suggested to be part of the pathology of severe mental illnesses.

 Studies have shown that in persons with bipolar disorder, increased body mass index (BMI) is associated with irregular changes in the brain.

 This association has not been tested in persons with psychosis.

 In this study, we will be measuring abdominal fat distribution as measured by MRI to see if this is associated with abnormal brain morphology.
