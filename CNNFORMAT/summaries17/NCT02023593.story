(firstQuint)FOLFIRI as Second Line Chemotherapy for Metastatic Esophageal Carcinoma.

 Although there are no standard second-line treatment for metastatic esophageal carcinoma, some studies have showed that irinotecan, fluorouracil may be effective in treating patients with metastatic esophageal carcinoma after failure of first-line treatment.

 Since irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor.

 Giving more than one drug may be more effective.

 In this phase II trial, the investigator would like to observe the efficacy and safety of FOLFIRI(Irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin ) as second-line treatment for metastatic esophageal carcinoma.
