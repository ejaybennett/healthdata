(fifthQuint)Pelvic Belt Effects on Osseous Anatomy, Muscule Activation and Ground Reaction Forces.

 The sacroiliac joint is among the most frequently involved anatomical structure in low back pain.

 Pelvic belt anatomy makes the sacroiliac joint more vulnerable to be involved in chronic painful conditions.

 However, the anatomical and functional correlate of sacroiliac joint pain is yet undetermined.

 According to the guidelines of International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), painful conditions should primarily be managed conservatively.

 However, existing studies fail providing sound evidence on the effects of conservative devices to therapy sacroiliac joint pain.

 In the study, a total of 17 patients suffering from sacroiliac joint pain and 17 controls were investigated by means of magnetic resonance imaging, EMG, health surveys and ground reaction force measurements.

 A pelvic compression belt was administered in two levels of compression and the corresponding magnetic resonance imaging, EMG and ground reaction force data were measured.

 Pelvic Belt Effects on Osseous Anatomy, Muscule Activation and Ground Reaction Forces@highlight

Hypothesis I: The anatomic alignment of the pelvic bones, the electromuscular activation of limb muscles and ground reaction forces are different in patients with sacroiliac joint pain, as compared to healthy controls.

 Hypothesis II: The application of pelvic belts alters the alignment of the pelvic bones, the electromuscular activation of the limb muscles or ground reaction forces.

 Hypothesis III: The effects proposed in hypothesis II are different in patients with sacroiliac joint pain, as compared to healthy controls.
