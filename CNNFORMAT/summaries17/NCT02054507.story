(fifthQuint)Prematurity Related Risks of Cognitive Impairment at School Age.

 Long term follow-up of vulnerable children such as infants born prematurely are generally studied without taking into account the social, familial and care resources available in the child environment.

 Thus, the main purpose of this study is to evaluate prematurely born children cognitive development at school age, with regards to birth conditions but also to related social situation, intra family relationships, modalities of care and utilization of care resources.

 The study will be divided into 3 parts: 1.

 Children born prematurely in our level III referral Center will undergo psychometric evaluation at 8 to 11 years of age by routine test (WISC IV).

 The relationship between cognitive scores and neonatal characteristics will be determined and compared with the results of schoolmate control children, born at term.

 2.

 The quality of parent and child relationship will be evaluated by standardized questionnaire (Perinatal PTSD Questionnaire).

 This questionnaire allows evaluating persistent perinatal stress trauma related to prematurity.

 3.

 An anthropologic study of care and utilization of care resources will be performed within the follow-up network taking care of these children.

 This part will use semi-directive interviews of caregivers involved in the follow-up network.

 This study should allow to better correlate prematurely born children outcome with their global environment and propose improvements in care resources utilization for a better development.
