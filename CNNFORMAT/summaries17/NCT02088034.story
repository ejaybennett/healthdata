(firstQuint)Intervention to Promote Weight Loss in Latinas At-risk for Diabetes.

 The goal of the proposed research is to compare two evidence-based strategies for preventing type 2 diabetes - promotora-led lifestyle intervention and metformin - vs.

 usual care (UC) among Latinas in a "real world" setting.

 The aims of this study are to 1) develop a protocol-based, promotora-led lifestyle intervention (PLI) to promote weight loss in at-risk Latinas, and assess its feasibility; 2) compare changes in weight and cardiometabolic markers-hemoglobin A1C, fasting lipids, blood pressure-from baseline to 1 year between at-risk Latinas randomly assigned to the PLI group versus metformin and usual care (UC) groups; and 3) understand the social and cultural context surrounding weight-related behaviors among Latinas at-risk for diabetes.

 The investigators hypothesize that Latinas assigned to PLI and metformin will have greater weight loss (primary outcome) and greater improvements in cardiometabolic markers from baseline to 1 year than those randomized to UC.

The overarching goal of this project is to develop and test a behavioral intervention delivered by promotoras to help at-risk Latinas lose weight and prevent diabetes.
