(secondQuint)FIRM as a Stand-alone Procedure in the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.

 After a pilot/implementation study consisting of 10 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF); 20 patients with paroxysmal AF will be included in a within-patient trial.

 This study will be followed by a similar comparison in 20 patients with persistent or longstanding persistent AF.

 The AF driving sources will be visualized by a novel sequential bi-atrial panoramic contact mapping technique.

 Unipolar signals will be recorded by a 64-polar basket catheter (FIRMap(R), Topera.

 Inc.

), then processed and the activation patterns visualized (RhythmView(R) 3D Electrophysiologic Mapping System, Topera, Inc.

).

 Focal impulse and rotor modulation (FIRM) will then be performed with standard irrigated radio frequency catheter ablation until rotor or focal impulse elimination is confirmed by repeat FIRM mapping.

 Treatment efficacy will be assessed with continuous heart rhythm monitors (Reveal XT(R), Medtronic, Minneapolis, USA) implanted 3 months prior to ablation, and freedom from AF defined as AF burden <1% at follow-up at 12, 24 and 30 months.

 FIRM as a Stand-alone Procedure in the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation@highlight

The FIRM Study Oslo will in two sequential within-patient trials investigate the efficacy of focal impulse and rotor modulation (FIRM) as a stand-alone procedure in the treatment of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation, evaluated by continuous pre- and post-procedural heart rhythm monitoring.
