(fifthQuint)The Effectiveness of Computerized Auditory Training Programme on Children With Auditory Processing Disorder.

 This prospective study incorporated a parallel group design that randomly assigned participants identified with CAPD to an auditory training (AT) group or a no intervention (Control) group.

 Both groups were matched for age and gender.

 Baseline measures were conducted prior to the randomisation process.

 Participants from the AT group were given a 3-month home therapy using a CBAT programme developed for this study, while participants from the control group received no intervention for the same period of time.

 Apart from regular school attendance and activities, all participants were requested to discontinue any other auditory-based interventions, which might affect the outcomes of this study.

 All the participants were assessed again after the conclusion of the training period.

 After the end of the intervention, participants from the AT group were requested to undergo a no-intervention phase for a period of 3 months before another assessment.

 This was intended to examine the sustainability of any improvement made through the CBAT programme.

 An auditory test and two validated questionnaires were used as outcome measures, administered at baseline, and at post-3 months (immediately post-intervention).

 The Effectiveness of Computerized Auditory Training Programme on Children With Auditory Processing Disorder@highlight

The current study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a Computer-based auditory training (CBAT) intervention for children with Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) by comparing the changes in auditory processing (AP) and functional listening skills of these children immediately post-intervention, to that of the untrained controls.

 The AP skills of the trained group were evaluated again at 3 months post-intervention to examine the sustainability of any improvements made from the CBAT intervention.

 I hypothesised that after intervention, children from the auditory training (AT) group would improve in their AP skills, and that improvement would be greater than the changes in AP skills of those untrained controls.

 I also hypothesised that the improvement made from the intervention would sustain for at least 3 months after the end of intervention.

 Finally, I examined if the training outcomes are predictable from any underlying factors such as the initial AP, language, or cognitive skills of these children.
