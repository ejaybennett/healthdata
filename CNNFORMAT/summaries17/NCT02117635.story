(fifthQuint)Pilot Investigation of Stem Cells in Stroke Phase II Efficacy.

 Design: This Phase II efficacy trial is a multi-centre, open label, single arm, non-comparative design, administering a single dose of CTX cells 2 to 3 months post-ischaemic stroke with follow-up over 12 months.

 The trial will be overseen by an independent DSMB.

 The DSMB will adjudicate at predetermined intervals whether a patient has satisfied the primary response criterion and whether the ongoing safety profile justifies continuation or modification of the study.

 At least 21 patients will be enrolled to receive CTX DP (20 million cells) by stereotaxic intra-striatal injection ipsilateral to the location of the MCA ischaemic stroke.

 Pre-treatment selection of patients: Men and women, aged 40 or more, supratentorial ischaemic stroke or a stroke with elements of both in an area perfused by the MCA (i.

e.

 stroke due to ischaemia resulting in infarct located in the basal ganglia, internal capsule, or corona radiata or a stroke due to ischaemia resulting in infarction of part of the cerebral cortex).

 Patients with a first stroke within the past 4 weeks (at time of consent) satisfying the following criteria: Modified NIHSS Motor Arm Score of 2 (some effort against gravity), 3 (no movement against gravity) or 4 (no movement) for the paretic arm post ischaemic stroke; Clinical diagnosis of stroke confirmed by physician using neuro-imaging (computerised tomography or magnetic resonance imaging).

 A Score of 0 or 1 for test 2 of the ARAT at visit 1 and 2 using the affected arm.

 Treatment: One patient will be treated at one time.

 A single dose (20 million) of CTX DP cells will be administered intracranially via stereotaxic neurosurgery.

 Post-treatment follow-up: Patients will be followed for 12 months post-implantation.

 End-points: The primary endpoint of the trial is efficacy, using ARAT.

 Secondary endpoints are efficacy and safety.

 Outcome measures for efficacy include Fugl-Meyer, NIHSS, BI and RFA.

 Safety will be assessed by incidence of relevant adverse events monitoring patient's general physical condition and clinical measures (temperature, pulse rate and rhythm, ECG, blood pressure, full blood count, liver function tests, serum urea and electrolytes), immunological response and concomitant medications at the 7 follow-up visits to the clinic in the first year after treatment.

 Post-trial follow-up: Annual correspondence with family practitioners; Life-long follow-up for new diagnosis of cancer, site of primary tumour, and survival via National Cancer Registry.

 Pilot Investigation of Stem Cells in Stroke Phase II Efficacy@highlight

The primary aim of this Phase II trial is to determine whether it is sufficiently likely that CTX DP treatment at a dose level of 20 million cells improves the recovery in the use of the paretic arm in acute stroke patients to justify a subsequent larger prospectively controlled study.

 This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intracerebral CTX DP at a dose level of 20 million cells in patients with paresis of an arm following an ischaemic middle cerebral artery (MCA) stoke.

 Eligible patients will have no useful function of the paretic arm a minimum of 28 days after the ischaemic stroke (a modified NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) Motor Arm Score of 2, 3 or 4 for the affected arm).
