(secondQuint)Clinical Value of Noninvasive Intracranial Pressure Measurement.

 Non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements with Vittamed 205 aICP meter will be compared to simultaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure measurements during lumbar puncture.

 Measures of pressure in mmHg will be compared.

 These measurements will be compared in chronic daily headache, normal pressure hydrocephalus and multiple sclerosis patients groups.

 For stroke patients noninvasive measurements will be compared with cerebral lesion in brain MRI/CT.

 Clinical Value of Noninvasive Intracranial Pressure Measurement@highlight

The aim of the study is to evaluate accuracy and precision of non-invasive intracranial pressure measurement device (Vittamed 205) for selected patients compared with cerebrospinal fluid pressure measured during lumbar puncture
