(fifthQuint)DLBS1033 for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients.

 Subjects in this study will be screened consecutively and eligible subjects will be randomized into two groups and receive the investigational drug, DLBS1033 at a dose of 490 mg three times daily or its placebo in addition to standard therapy for 28-days course of therapy.

 DLBS1033 for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients@highlight

This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, and controlled clinical study to investigate the effects of DLBS1033 in conjunction with standard therapy compared to standard therapy alone in acute ischemic stroke patients.

 It is hypothesized that the improvement in functional outcomes as measured by NIHSS and BI as well as the improvement in haemostatic parameters as measured by thrombocyte aggregation test (TAT), fibrinogen, and d-dimer in DLBS group will be significantly greater than those in the control group.
