(secondQuint)Selinexor in Initial or Relapsed/Refractory Richter's Transformation.

 Multi-center, Phase 2, single arm, open-label study of oral selinexor monotherapy in patients with Richter's transformation, arising in the setting of prior CLL, documented by histologically confirmed lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL) and immunoblastic variants.

 Eligible patients must have had at least one prior regimen for CLL.

 Approximately 50 patients are anticipated to be treated in this study.

 Eligible patients following screening will receive selinexor orally twice weekly (e.

g.

, Monday and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday) at a dose of 60 mg.

 The selinexor dose may be increased to 80 mg after Cycle 1 unless clinically contraindicated.

 Patients may continue in multiple treatment cycles at a given dose; there is no maximum treatment duration.

 Each cycle is 28 days.

 Dose adjustments will be made as appropriate by the investigator.
