(thirdQuint)Cognitive Status in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease's Patients.

 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a pathology with a systemic impact with a progressive evolution that is characterized by the presence of chronic airflow obstruction.

 Patients with COPD may have problems with cognitive functioning, either globally or in single cognitive domains, such as information processing, attention and concentration, memory, executive functioning and self-regulation.

 Several studies have determined the prevalence of cognitive impairment in COPD compared to healthy control subjects, reaching very high levels, 36% of COPD patients with mild cognitive impairment compared with 12 % non- COPD subjects.

 Cognitive Status in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease's Patients@highlight

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic condition involving an impairment in functionality and in the execution of activities of daily life.

 The hypothesis of this study is to examine the relationship between cognitive status and clinical profile (respiratory, sleep quality, nutritional status) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in two different moments: exacerbation or stable situation.
