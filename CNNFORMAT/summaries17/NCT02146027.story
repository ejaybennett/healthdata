(thirdQuint)Once a Day Use of Lactobacillus Casei Shirota on HIV-infected Patients Infected Patients.

 In this study, HIV-infected patients with poor recovery of CD4+ T cells and successful viral control after treatment with antiretroviral therapy will be enrolled to receive once a day Lactobcillus casei Shirota or placebo in a double-blind, randomized fashion.

 The main objective is to investigate whether the continuous, once a day, 12-weeks use of Yakult product containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota could affect immunological parameters in HIV-infected patients on suppressive antiretroviral treatment with poor CD4+ T cell recovery.

 A total of 48 volunteers will be followed for 12 week after initiation of daily use of Lactobcillus casei Shirota or placebo, randomized in a 1:1 ratio.

 We hypothesize that use of the Yakult product containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota after 12 weeks of continuous use will increase the level of CD4+ T-cells, at least, 50 cells/mm.

 We also propose to investigate several markers of immune response, including T cellular activation and NK cells function, and changes in the intestinal microbiota.

 Once a Day Use of Lactobacillus Casei Shirota on HIV-infected Patients Infected Patients@highlight

In this study, HIV-infected patients with poor recovery of CD4+ T cells and successful viral control after treatment with antiretroviral therapy will be enrolled to receive once a day Lactobcillus casei Shirota or placebo in a double-blind, randomized fashion.

 Immune parameters will be monitored for 12 weeks in both arms.

 The main outcome is CD4+ T cell recovery.

 Secondary outcomes will include NK cells and T cells immune parameters.
