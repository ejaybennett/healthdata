(secondQuint)The Efficacy of the Kyrobak for Chronic Low Back Pain (LBP-2).

 The Kyrobak is an electrically operated, continuous passive motion device including a platform that performs angular oscillations.

 The Kyrobak is used at home as an aid to relieve mild-to-moderate low back pain.

 The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of daily home use of the Kyrobak for 3 weeks and to assess the sustained efficacy 1 week later.

 The evaluation will include the level of pain using the numerical rating scale (NRS), Digital Posturography, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Static Surface Electromyography (SEMG), a condition-specific low back pain disability status by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and subject satisfaction.

 The Efficacy of the Kyrobak for Chronic Low Back Pain (LBP-2)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Kyrobak continuous passive motion home-use device in relieving low back pain, improving proprioception (balance and fall prevention) and improving the symmetry of muscle function on either side of the spine.
