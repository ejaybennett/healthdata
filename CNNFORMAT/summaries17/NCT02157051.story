(fifthQuint)Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With HER2-Negative Stage III-IV Breast Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the safety of intradermal administration of up to 3 escalating doses of STEMVAC (CD105/Yb-1/SOX2 CDH3/MDM2-polyepitope plasmid DNA vaccine) in patients with HER2-negative advanced stage breast cancer.

 II.

 To determine the most immunogenic dose of STEMVAC in patients with HER2-negative advanced stage breast cancer.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine whether a STEMVAC T helper 1 cells (Th1) polyepitope plasmid based vaccine elicits a persistent memory T cell response and whether immunity can be further enhanced/maintained by two additional STEMVAC vaccines (boosters) given 3 and 9 months after the priming regimen.

 II.

 To evaluate whether STEMVAC vaccination modulates T regulatory cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC).

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive CD105/Yb-1/SOX2/CDH3/MDM2-polyepitope plasmid DNA vaccine with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhuGM-CSF) intradermally (ID) every 28 days for 3 months and booster vaccines at 6 and 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up twice yearly for 5 years.

 Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With HER2-Negative Stage III-IV Breast Cancer@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of multiantigen deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) plasmid-based vaccine in treating patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative stage III-IV breast cancer.

 Multiantigen DNA plasmid-based vaccine may target immunogenic proteins expressed in breast cancer stem cells which are the component of breast cancer that is resistant to chemotherapy and has the ability to spread.

 Vaccines made from DNA may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.
