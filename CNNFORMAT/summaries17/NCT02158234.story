(fifthQuint)Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy and Concurrent Cisplatin for Re-Irradiation of Unresectable, Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinomas of Head and Neck.

 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a relatively new radiation technique in which a few very high doses of radiation are delivered to small, well-defined tumors.

 It has been used effectively in other cancers like lung and liver.

 The goal is to deliver a radiation dose that is high enough to kill the cancer while limiting radiation to surrounding healthy organs.

 The daily dose of radiation is 2-3 times greater than conventional radiotherapy, but it is given for only 5 days over a 2 week period.

 Conventional radiotherapy is given over 6-7 weeks.

 The chemotherapy drug, cisplatin is used as a radiation sensitizer and will be given before each of the 5 radiation treatments.

 Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy and Concurrent Cisplatin for Re-Irradiation of Unresectable, Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinomas of Head and Neck@highlight

This study involves another course of radiation (called re-irradiation) to the participant's tumor.

 The type of radiation is called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).

 The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of different doses of SBRT given along with the chemotherapy drug, cisplatin.

 The researchers want to see which dose of radiation will work best in controlling the growth of head/neck cancer.

 The usual treatment for head/neck cancer that has grown is surgery and/or more radiation with various chemotherapy drugs.
