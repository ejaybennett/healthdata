(fifthQuint)Self-management to Improve Function Following Amputation.

 Self-management interventions have been successful in improving outcomes across a broad variety of chronic illnesses including arthritis, asthma, diabetes, and hypertension.

 Initial evidence of the effectiveness of self-management following limb loss is promising, but limited.

 Only one published trial to date has examined self-management for amputees.

 The Promoting Amputee Life Skills (PALS) project, conducted by members of the current study team, designed and implemented an 8-week group-based intervention to improve self-management following limb loss.

 The current proposal builds upon previous research that has demonstrated the efficacy of the PALS self-management intervention, but addresses important next questions: 1.

 Is the PALS self-management intervention appropriate for Veterans, specifically considering the very high prevalence of diabetes and vascular disease? 2.

 Can it be housed and delivered within a health care system as opposed to existing community support groups? 3.

 Will the intervention be more effective for individuals who are new amputees? 4.

 Will a shorter format that also incorporates an option for video teleconferencing retain the efficacy of the original PALS intervention? This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the efficacy of VETPALS.

 Study staff will screen and enroll Veterans with recent lower extremity limb loss within the last 6 months.

 Each participant will complete a baseline interview and then is sequentially placed into a cohort of 6-10 participants; each cohort will be randomized to the VETPALS group based self-management program (intervention) or an individual education support program (control).

 Once participants complete the randomized arm and follow-up assessments, they are free to participate in the other group.

 This ensures participants are offered both programs and are not deprived of a potentially valuable healthcare service.

 Self-management to Improve Function Following Amputation@highlight

Lower extremity amputations are a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, loss of function and reduced quality of life.

 Self-management (defined as the process by which an individual adopts an active role in managing the symptoms, treatment, consequences, and lifestyle changes inherent in living with a chronic condition) is an important mechanism for improving health and reducing disability.

 This study will evaluate a 5-week group-based self-management intervention for Veterans with lower extremity limb loss (VETPALS) and determine its impact upon physical and psychosocial functioning, patient activation, self-efficacy, problem solving, quality of life and positive affect.

 This study represents one of the only prospective randomized controlled trials of a behavioral intervention for individuals with limb loss.

 It is expected that results will be used to inform the integration of self-management interventions into the VA Amputation System of Care.

 The specific primary hypotheses are: 1.

 Individuals randomized to VETPALS will display greater improvements from baseline in physical functioning as measured by the MFA-SF than Veterans in the individual education support condition post-intervention and at a 6 month follow-up.

 2.

 Individuals randomized to VETPALS will display greater improvements from baseline in psychosocial functioning as measured by the PHQ-9 than Veterans in the individual education support condition post-intervention and at a 6 month follow-up.
