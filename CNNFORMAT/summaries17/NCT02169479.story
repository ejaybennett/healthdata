(secondQuint)Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic Interaction Between Each of Three Diferente Single Doses of BIA 9-1067 and a Single-dose of Immediate-release 100/25 mg Levodopa/Carbidopa.

 Single centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study with four consecutive single-dose treatment periods.

 The washout period between doses was to be at least 14 days.

 On each treatment period, after completion of pre-dose assessments, BIA 9-1067/Placebo was to be administered concomitantly with the dose of Sinemet(R) 100/25; post-dose assessments were to be completed and subjects were to be discharged 72 h post-dose.

 Subjects were to attend four treatment periods and were to receive a different dose of BIA 9-1067 (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg) or placebo during each of these treatment periods.
