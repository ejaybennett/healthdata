 1.

 Treatment as Usual (TAU), 2.

 rapid abstinence initiation (RAI) or 3.

 The Effect of Cognitive Enhancement as a Precursor to Computer Based Training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT4CBT)@highlight

The investigators are conducting a randomized clinical trial of rapid abstinence initiation and cognitive control training as a precursor to our new web-based version of the CBT4CBT (Computer Based Training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) program to evaluate its effectiveness relative to standard outpatient counseling at the Midwestern Connecticut Council of Alcoholism (MCCA).

 CCT will be used to assess attention, working memory and inhibitory control and the computer-based training program (CBT4CBT) focuses on teaching basic coping skills, presenting examples of effective use of coping skills in a number of realistic situations in video form, and providing opportunities for patients to practice and review new skills while receiving cocaine abuse treatment.
