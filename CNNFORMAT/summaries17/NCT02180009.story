(firstQuint)Dynamic Changes of Tim-3 on Monocytes and Soluble Tim-3 in Patients With Sepsis.

 In this study, we will collect the peripheral blood of 1,3,5,7,10,14 day after diagnose of sepsis.

All the patients rolled in this study will be divided into three groups which is sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock group according their severity.

 Then,the flow cytometry will be used to detect the express of Tim-3 on monocyte and ELISA will be used to exam the plasm soluble Tim-3.

IL-6,IL-10,IL-12 and TNF-in the peripheral blood will also be detected.

 We would like to find a new marker to predict the severity and prognosis of sepsis patients.

 Dynamic Changes of Tim-3 on Monocytes and Soluble Tim-3 in Patients With Sepsis@highlight

In this study, the investigators will dynamically detect the expression of an immune regulator- T cell Ig and mucin domain protein 3 (Tim-3) in patient with sepsis.
