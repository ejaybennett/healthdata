(secondQuint)Impact of Breakfast Composition on Glycemic and Incretin Responses in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes.

 Twelve habitual breakfast consumers with type 2 diabetes (T2D) were recruited for the study.

 They completed two, 7-day conditions in random order with a minimum of a 7-day washout period between study days.

 They consumed either a high protein (PRO) or high carbohydrate (CHO) breakfast for 6 days of acclimatization, and on the seventh day, they reported to the lab at 0700 hours following a ~12 hour overnight fast and underwent forearm catheterization before a baseline blood draw.

 The participants consumed the respective breakfast at ~0730 hours.

 Four hours post-breakfast, subjects consumed a standard lunch meal.

 Blood samples were taken continuously throughout the 8-hour test day.
