(secondQuint)A Positron Emission Tomography Occupancy Study Using Ligand [11C]AS2471907 and Following Oral Dosing of ASP3662.

 This is a two-part study where Part 1 will assess the test/retest variability of the ligand ([11C]AS2471907).

 Part 2 will assess the level and time-course of enzyme occupancy following ASP3662 dosing.

 Subjects will be confined to the clinic for up to 2 days.
