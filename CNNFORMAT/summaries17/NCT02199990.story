(fifthQuint)The Effect of Propofol or Etomidate on Cognitive Function for 1-3 Years Old Children.

 1.

 by selecting the aged 1 to 3, 100 cases of patients with elective surgery, were randomly divided into the propofol group (P group), the etomidate group (group E), all the 50 cases, healthy age 50 cases of children (blank control group, group C) were studied; 2.

 the children's intelligence equation of the People's Republic of China neuropsychological test: P, E group of preoperative 1 day before operation, postoperative day 3, 3 months neuropsychological test, observe and evaluate patients POCD is happening; Correspond to the experimental group in the same period in group C, i.

e.

, the first test (1 d) preoperatively, 4 days after the second test (3 d) after operation, 3 months after the third test (3 months), observed and compared with experimental neuropsychological testing of variation; 3.

 laboratory of brain damage index determination: extract internal jugular venous blood in preoperative and perioperative finish 5 ml, with double antibody immune sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) method of determination of serum S - 100 beta protein levels, rapid determination of amino acid analyzer, plasma Glu, GABA levels; 4.

 statistical analysis: use SPSS13.

0 statistical software for children with cognitive function before and after operation and serum S - 100 beta protein and serum Glu, GABA levels change research results should carry on the analysis of variance, P < 0.

05 for statistical significance.

 5.

 clear rapid development period of infants receive propofol and etomidate on plasma according to beta protein after intravenous anesthesia and Glu, GABA expression and its relationship between the change of cognitive function and clarify all according to propofol and etomidate intravenous anesthesia on the brain is in rapid development period of infant short-term and long-term postoperative cognitive function and its possible mechanism, the influence of safety for children suffering from anesthesia, and to provide theoretical basis for the rational use of drugs.

 The Effect of Propofol or Etomidate on Cognitive Function for 1-3 Years Old Children@highlight

Based on China's guangxi guilin for a hernia operation in 1 to 3 years old preschool children propofol and etomidate on behavioral and cognitive function after intravenous anesthesia in according to beta protein in serum and plasma glutamate (Glutamic acid, Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (Gamma aminobutyric acid, GABA) level of observation, the rapid development period children's cognitive function after anesthesia short-term and long-term change process and its possible mechanism is studied, for the current international debate on "anesthetics effects on developing kids brain nerve" research hot spot in the city of clinical basis and research argument, for pediatric anesthesia clinical safety, provide theoretical basis for the rational use of drugs.
