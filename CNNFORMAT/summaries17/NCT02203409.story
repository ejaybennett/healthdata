(secondQuint)Laparoscopic Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy.

 Background: Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) is a breakthrough in the field of hepatobiliary surgery in recent years,which stimulates the remnant liver volume(RLV) grew by 74%-87.

2% in 9 to 13 days.

The published literature reported that the two stages of ALPPS are the conventional laparotomy surgery,Patients need to undergo the injury of two open operations in a short time.

 The incidence of postoperative complications and mortality rate is as high as 53% -73% and 12%-27%.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the results with laparoscopic ALPPS procedure in a single center, with special emphasis in validity, feasibility and limitations.

 Results: Clinical data include: operation time, intraoperative blood loss, volume of blood transfusion, complications and mortality, postoperative liver function, long-term curative effect and survival time were collected and analysed.

 Statistical method:groups t-test ,univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis, mixed linear regression, Cox survival analysis ,Kaplan-Meier survival analysis,Log-rank survival curves were used.

 Laparoscopic Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy@highlight

The purpose of this research is evaluate the results with laparoscopic ALPPS procedure in a single center.

 The validity, feasibility and limitations were assessed objectively through our clinical prospective study.

The investigators expect laparoscopic ALPPS is safe, effective and feasible.
