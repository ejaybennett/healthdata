(secondQuint)Use of Passive, Adaptive, and Active Prosthetic Knees in Persons With Unilateral, Transfemoral Amputation.

 An interrupted time-series trial with pre/post baseline assessments, randomized crossover of interventions, and within-phase repeated measures is used to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the Ossur Power Knee II and the Ossur Rheo Knee in individuals with unilateral, transfemoral amputation.

 A rigorous and clinically-meaningful experimental protocol is applied to verify study participants receive appropriate training, experience, and assessment in each knee condition.

 A suite of standardized and ad-hoc physical performance tests, patient-reported questionnaires, and monitoring technologies were carefully selected to assess important, clinically-relevant participant outcomes.

 Comparative effectiveness of three prosthetic knee interventions are evaluated using direct measurement (i.

e.

, timed tests), observed clinical ratings (i.

e.

, subjective assessments of gait quality) and self-report instruments (i.

e.

, health status surveys).

 Analyses will focus on identifying differences between control system technologies inherent to each type of prosthetic knee (i.

e.

, passive [mechanical], adaptive [magnetorheological], and active [power]).

 Outcomes will be used to establish recommendations for which activities and patients knees are most appropriate or likely to produce a desired effect.

 Use of Passive, Adaptive, and Active Prosthetic Knees in Persons With Unilateral, Transfemoral Amputation@highlight

The goals of this study are to assess measured, observed, and self-reported outcomes achieved through the use of passive (mechanical), active(motorized) and adaptive (magnetorheological) prosthetic knee control systems in individuals with unilateral, transfemoral amputation.
