(secondQuint)Phase I Study of Bortezomib With G-CSF for Stem Cell Mobilization in Patients With Multiple Myeloma.

 The purpose of this phase I study is to define the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib and its mobilization effects when given with G-CSF for stem cell mobilization in multiple myeloma patients.

 We hypothesize that bortezomib, in addition to increasing the number of mobilized stem cells, will optimize final apheresis product by decreasing myeloma cell contamination.

 Therefore, all multiple myeloma patients rather than multiple myeloma patients with G-CSF mobilization failure will be the target of this study.

 Phase I Study of Bortezomib With G-CSF for Stem Cell Mobilization in Patients With Multiple Myeloma@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to determine the highest dose of a drug called bortezomib that can be given with a drug called G-CSF before stem cell collection to help in the mobilization of stem cells.
