(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of Pyridostigmine on Patients With Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 3.

 Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the second neuromuscular disease meet in children.

 SMA is a genetically transmitted disease inducing muscular weakness predominating on shoulders and hips.

 Currently, there is no effective therapy to slow the progression of the disease.

 SMA is due to a neuron motor attempt of the spinal cord and recently it has been demonstrated a neuromuscular junction (NMJ) involvement, according to recent studies.

 EMOTAS study aim to understand if NMJ abnormalities could have an impact on motor performance and fatigue in SMA type 3 ambulatory patients by electromyogram and to improve by non-invasive therapy quality of life of patients.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of anti-cholinesterase therapy on the motor function in SMA type 3 patients with impaired neuromuscular junction (NMJ).
