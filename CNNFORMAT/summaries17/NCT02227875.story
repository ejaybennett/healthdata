(secondQuint)Non-inferiority Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Mylan's Insulin Glargine With Lantus in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (INSTRIDE 2).

 This trial is a multi-center, open-label, randomized, parallel group trial in patients with T2DM comparing the efficacy and safety of Mylan's insulin glargine with that of Lantus(R).

 Patients with an established diagnosis of T2DM per ADA 2014 criteria and who satisfy the selection criteria will be included in the trial.

 This will be followed by a 24-week randomized, comparative, parallel-assignment treatment period with Mylan's insulin glargine or Lantus(R) (in addition to other anti-diabetic drugs).

 After the treatment period, there will be a follow-up visit; 4 weeks after the patient has been put back on approved medications.

To test whether Mylan's insulin glargine once daily is non-inferior to Lantus(R) once daily (both administered in combination with other anti-diabetic drugs) based on the change in HbA1c from baseline to 24 weeks
