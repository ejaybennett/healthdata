(secondQuint)A Study of Obinutuzumab(GA101) in Combination With High-Dose Methylprednisolone(HDMP) in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia(CLL) Patients (GA101 & HDMP).

 This is an open label phase Ib/II clinical trial to determine the safety and clinical activity of the GA101 - Obinutuzumab in combination with high-dose methylprednisone (HDMP).

 We will evaluate dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first month of therapy as part of the phase Ib of this study.

 In the phase II we will determine response rate in an intention to treat analysis.

 In this study we will include CLL patients that have never received treatment as well as patients that have failed previous treatments.

 A Study of Obinutuzumab(GA101) in Combination With High-Dose Methylprednisolone(HDMP) in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia(CLL) Patients (GA101 & HDMP)@highlight

We hypothesize that GA101 - Obinutuzumab in combination with HDMP is well tolerated and will induce similar if not higher response rates than the ones observed in Rituximab plus HDMP studies (Castro et al.

, 2009, Castro et al.

, 2008).
