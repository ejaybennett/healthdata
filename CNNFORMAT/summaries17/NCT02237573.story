(fifthQuint)Impact of Handing to Patients a Copy of the Consultation Report on Their Medicine Consumption.

 In France, 90% of General practitioners' (GPs) consultations end with prescription of drugs (versus only 43,2% in Netherlands).

 A french medical thesis published in 2013 showed that drugs prescriptions were not a priority for patients.

 Rather than medicine's prescription, patients preferred attentive listening associated with personalized advices from their GPs.

 Several studies also showed that a commercial relationship exists between doctors and patients.

 The prescription is like an exchange currency against the patient money.

 We aim to assess the impact of handing to patients with viral gastroenteritis or upper respiratory tract infections, a copy of the consultation report on their medicine consumption.

 Impact of Handing to Patients a Copy of the Consultation Report on Their Medicine Consumption@highlight

In France, patients with benign viral infections (ie: gastro enteritis and/or rhinopharyngitis, etc.

) often receive several prescriptions from their doctors, although there is evidence that these medicines are not efficient.

 We hypothesize that patients could be reassured by health advices, especially if they are written.

 In addition, we believe that doctors would feel less guilty for not prescribing drugs if they could hand written consultation reports to patients, in these situations.
