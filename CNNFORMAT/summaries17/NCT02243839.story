(thirdQuint)Thrombolytic Therapy Versus Surgery for Obstructive Prosthetic Valve Thrombosis.

 Two different randomization group have been defined and patients with obstructive prosthetic valve thrombosis are included in each group randomly.

 In the first arm, thrombolytic therapy (TT) is performed to the patients with obstructive prosthetic valve thrombosis.

 The TT regimen depends on the functional status of the patient.

 In patients with NYHA class III-IV dyspnea low dose, relatively faster TT regimen (25 mg tPA/6 hours) is performed.

 In patients with NYHA class I-II dyspnea TT with low dose and ultra slow infusion of tPA (25 mg tPA/25 hours) is performed.

 During TT, patients are followed up with transesophageal echocardiography in every 24 hours.

 In the second arm, redo valve surgery is performed for obstructive valve thrombosis.

 This multicenter study is conducted in Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery Departments of Kosuyolu Kartal Heart Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey, Siyami Ersek Heart Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey, Ankara Heart Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey, Izmir Ataturk Heart Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey, Erzurum Ataturk University Faculty of Medicine, Erzurum, Turkey, Diyarbakir Dicle University Faculty of Medicine, Diyarbakir, Turkey and Kars Kafkas University Faculty of Medicine, Kars, Turkey.

 Informed consent is taken from all patients.

 Thrombolytic Therapy Versus Surgery for Obstructive Prosthetic Valve Thrombosis@highlight

Prosthetic heart valve thrombosis is a serious complication with high mortality and morbidity The best treatment of PVT is controversial, although surgery and thrombolysis options have been available.

 In this randomized and multicenter study, the investigators compared thrombolytic therapy versus surgery for the treatment of patients with obstructive prosthetic valve thrombosis.
