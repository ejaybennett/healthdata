(firstQuint)Impact of Colchicine Therapy on Arrhythmia Recurrence After Acute Pericardial Effusion.

 RFCA was started as a rhythm control of atrial fibrillation about 10 years before and the superiority of RFCA to medical treatment has been continuously reporting, so RFCA is globally performed nowadays.

 Acute pericardial effusion could occur during RFCA as complication, that might be developed to cardiac tamponade needed immediate pericardiocentesis.

 The inflammation developed after pericardiocentesis might be associated with the recurrences of atrial fibrillation, it could be presumed by the frequent occurrence of atrial fibrillation after open-heart surgery.

 The inflammation can be suppressed by administration of colchicine and the effects of colchicine have been proven to decrease the development of atrial fibrillation.
