(firstQuint)The Effect Of Aspirin On Survival in in Patients Undergoing Chronic Hemodialysis.

 This study prospectively evaluate the impacts of low dose aspirin on survival and cardio-cerebral vascular events in a large cohort of Chinese patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis.

 Between January 2008, consecutive patients with hemodialysis with aspirin were enrolled.

We examine the association of aspirin with all-cause mortality in patients matched by propensity scores using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox models in "intention-to-treat" analyses.
