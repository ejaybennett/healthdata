 The purpose of PreSSUB II is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, feasibility, reliability and cost-effectiveness of in-ambulance telemedicine during Paramedic Intervention Team transportation of patients with suspicion of acute stroke.

 The implementation of expert stroke support in the pre-hospital arena using in-ambulance telemedicine is an innovative approach that opens up new perspectives and allows continuous guidance by a stroke specialist throughout the acute stroke care continuum.
