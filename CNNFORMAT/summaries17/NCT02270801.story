(firstQuint)Recombinant Human Thrombopoietin (rhTPO) in Management of Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Pregnancy.

 The investigators are undertaking a single-center, non-randomized, non-controlled trial of 30 ITP patients in pregnancy from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University.

 ITP patients in pregnancy who failed to respond to prednisone, IVIG and developed refractoriness to platelet transfusion will be given rhTPO intravenously at a dose of 300U/kg every day.

 Dose will be tapered to 300U/kg every other day when platelet count rise over 50*10^9/L.

 Maintenance will be continued after delivery and the dose will be further reduced to 300U/kg per week.

 Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms will be evaluated before and after treatment.

 Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study.
