(thirdQuint)Evaluation of the Dose Received by the Prostate With in Vivo Dosimetry in Patients Treated With Daily IGRT Associated With IMRT Using Two Repositioning Techniques for Localized Prostate Cancer.

 10 participants will receive a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) repositioning, while the other 10 will receive a kV imaging of fiducial marker repositioning.

 The principal objective is to evaluate and compare the dose received by the prostate using two repositioning techniques.

 Evaluation of the Dose Received by the Prostate With in Vivo Dosimetry in Patients Treated With Daily IGRT Associated With IMRT Using Two Repositioning Techniques for Localized Prostate Cancer@highlight

This study evaluates the dose received by the prostate with in vivo dosimetry when delivering image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) associated with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for patients with localized prostate cancer using two repositioning techniques: fiduciary markers or soft tissues.
