(fifthQuint)Evaluation of Oscillatory Positive Expiratory Pressure (oPEP) in Bronchiectasis and COPD.

 Cough and sputum production are common in Bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), both of which are associated with significant morbidity and other adverse clinical outcomes.

 Airway clearance techniques (ACTs) such as afforded by oscillatory Positive Expiratory Pressure (oPEP) (Aerobika (R)) aim to remove sputum from the lungs, however evidence of their efficacy during stable disease is unclear.

 The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of four times daily Positive Expiratory Pressure maneuvers over three weeks in individuals with bronchiectasis and COPD with chronic sputum production.

 The oPEP device (Aerobika (R)) combines positive expiratory pressure therapy and airway vibrations to help mobilize pulmonary secretions.

 oPEP therapy enforces a resistance to exhalation at the mouth while the airway vibration technology transmits movements upstream during exhalation so that airway walls may become free from mucus.

 An adjustable dial allows users to adjust the frequency and the flow resistance based on their individual needs.

 Subjects will take a device home and use four times daily during the active part of the study.

 We hypothesize that daily oPEP use will significantly improve dyspnea, movement of mucus, SGRQ score, and 6MWD after three weeks of four times daily administration.

 This is a randomized cross-over unblinded study in 30 subjects: ten with bronchiectasis and 20 with COPD (with chronic bronchitis and chronic mucus production identified).

 Five subjects from the Bronchiectasis group and ten from the COPD group will start with oPEP and use for three weeks.

 All subjects will crossover at Visit Two after three weeks of oPEP therapy or three weeks of no therapy.

 Each subject will visit the centre on three occasions: Baseline, Crossover Visit, and Final Visit for approximately one hour each and will perform: 1) spirometry and plethysmography, 2) 6MWT, and 3) health status evaluation using a self-administered SGRQ.

 Subjects will first provide written informed consent and will complete: 1) SGRQ after inhaling 2-4 puffs (200-400 mu g) of the short-acting bronchodilator (eg.

 Salbutamol), 2) plethysmography and spirometry 35 (five minutes) post-salbutamol.

 Vital signs will be documented and subjects will rest for approximately 15 minutes before the six-minute walk test (6MWT) post-salbutamol.

 Subjects will be given an oPEP therapy system (Aerobika (R)) to use at home, four times per day.

 Instruction and training on the use of the device will be given at the baseline visit.

 Subjects will be required to return the device upon completion of the study.

 Evaluation of Oscillatory Positive Expiratory Pressure (oPEP) in Bronchiectasis and COPD@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of four times daily Positive Expiratory Pressure (oPEP) (Aerobika (R)) maneuvers over three weeks in individuals with bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with chronic sputum production.

 The investigators hypothesize that four times daily positive expiratory pressure using the Aerobika (R) will significantly improve dyspnea, movement of mucus, St.

 George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score, and six-minute walk distance (6MWD) after three weeks of four times daily administration.
