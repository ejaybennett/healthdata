(thirdQuint)Ulthera System for Treating Axillary Hyperhidrosis.

 This study is a prospective, single-center, randomized clinical trial.

 Up to 20 subjects who are naive to Ultherapy for treatment of hyperhidrosis will be enrolled and treated at a 2.

0mm depth at two different treatment densities (Group A and Group B).

 Group A will include up to 10 treated subjects.

 Subjects receiving treatment in a 3 x 4 grid, 12 treatment squares, 60 lines of treatment per square, at one treatment depth (2.

0mm), at 0.

30 J of energy.

 Group B will include up to 10 treated subjects.

 Subjects receiving treatment in a 3 x 4 grid, 12 treatment squares, 40 lines of treatment per square, at one treatment depth (2.

0mm), at 0.

30 J of energy.

 Gravimetric sweat production measures and starch iodine tests will be completed at baseline, treatment visit #2, and at all follow-ups for all study groups.

 Digital images of the starch iodine test will be obtained.

 Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) scores will be obtained at baseline, each treatment visit, and at all follow-ups for all study groups.
