(thirdQuint)Effect of Bioskin Ten-7 vs.

 Standard Treatment on Patient Reported Outcomes and Cytokine.

.

 Once consented, the patient is assigned to either Group A or Group B.

 Group A patients will receive standard treatment only and will not be prescribed a knee brace.

 Group B patients will receive standard treatment and the Bioskin Ten-7 knee brace.

 On Day 0, the patient will be assigned to one of the 2 groups using a 1:1 assignment.

 VAS, WOMAC, Oxford Knee Score, KOOS questionnaires will be administered and a sample of the patient's synovial fluid will be sent to labs for cytokine and cell count analysis.

 All patients will record use of NSAIDs and for Group B, the start and end time of brace use will be recorded.

 All patients will return in 8 weeks to assess efficacy of treatment.

 All patients will return their diaries, complete the same validated outcome measures as Day 0 and undergo a repeat synovial fluid analysis.
