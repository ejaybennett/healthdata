(thirdQuint)Identification of Predictive and Prognostic Markers for Lung Cancer With Metastases.

 The investigators want to make genome analysis of tissue samples.

 This involves analysing the RNA, DNA methylation, for example in cancer cells.

 This will provide information regarding somatic changes in cancer cells, such as mutations.

 All of the investigators analysis will be cancer-focused, with the goal of increasing understanding of the heterogeneity.

 The investigators will therefore perform analysis of blood samples if possible, to identify predictive markers in blood samples.

 This will then be the miRNA, RNA expression or protein expression in blood samples.

The project aims to compare the histopathological and molecular characteristics of tumour tissue from metastases with similar analyses of the primary tumour in the lung, where it is available.

 The investigators will therefore perform analysis of blood samples if possible, to identify predictive markers in blood samples.
