(secondQuint)The Leaky Lung Test.

 A cohort of subjects with asthma and healthy controls will be exposed to inhaled mannitol according to FDA approved protocols for bronchoprovocation.

 Mannitol will be measured in the bloodstream and urine and used to determine an airway permeability index.

 This is a proof of concept study and not a trial of new therapeutics.

This is a clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that measuring the absorption and excretion of inhaled mannitol will provide a clinically useful marker of airway epithelial permeability in asthma.
