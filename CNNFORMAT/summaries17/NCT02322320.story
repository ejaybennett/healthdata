(fifthQuint)Continued, Long-Term Follow-Up and Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy for Patients on BMT CTN 0702 Protocol (BMT CTN 07LT).

 This study is designed to compare long-term outcomes among patients randomized on the BMT CTN 0702 protocol (NCT01109004).

 All patients who consent will be followed for death, progression, Second Primary Malignancies (SPMs), and Quality of Life (QOL).

 Patients who do not consent to the long-term follow-up mechanism or who have experienced progression on the BMT CTN 0702 study will be followed through the standard Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) long-term follow-up mechanism.

 Additionally, patients who are eligible and are willing to continue with lenalidomide as maintenance therapy will be provided lenalidomide free of charge.

 These patients will continue to receive lenalidomide as maintenance therapy until disease progression or discontinuation due to toxicity, death, or withdrawal from the study.

 The endpoints assessed will include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), incidence of second primary malignancies (SPM) and health quality of life (QOL).

This study is designed to compare long-term outcomes among patients randomized on the BMT CTN 0702 protocol (NCT01109004), "A Trial of Single Autologous Transplant with or without Consolidation Therapy versus Tandem Autologous Transplant with Lenalidomide Maintenance for Patients with Multiple Myeloma".

 It is hypothesized that use of novel anti-myeloma agents will improve long-term progression-free survival (PFS) after high-dose melphalan followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as compared to a second autologous transplantation.
