(firstQuint)Percutaneous Irreversible Electroportion in Unresectable Liver Cancer Close to Diaphragmatic Dome.

 Single-arm pilot clinical trial.

 Patients will be subjected to irreversible electroporation (IRE) as the sole treatment of liver cancer close to diaphragmatic dome.

 This pilot study was designed to study the feasibility and safety of treatment as an alternative therapeutic IRE in the treatment of neoplastic nodules in the liver, with particular reference to close to diaphragmatic dome, where the current therapeutic arsenal is inadequate or counter-indicated.
