(firstQuint)A Single-center, Prospective,Randomized Study of Antiplatelet Effects of Ticagrelor Versus Clopidogrel in Patients With Dual Anti-platelet Therapy After Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.

 Patients undergoing coronary artery surgery routinely receive aspirin therapy, as a standard treatment for preserving bypass graft patency.

 Although the dual antiplatelet therapy post CABG has not been recommended by guideline, present studies indicated the patients could benefit from the dual anti-platelet therapy.

 Using clopidogrel+aspirin could significantly reduce the early saphenous vein graft occlusion.

 Many surgeons empirically prescribe dual anti-platelet therapy in spite of the indeterminacy of the clinical effects.

 ticagrelor is a novel, reversibly binding, oral, direct-acting P2Y12-receptor antagonist.

 The ONSET/OFFSET Study also shows that ticagrelor achieved much rapid and greater platelet inhibition than high-loading-dose clopidogrel in patients with stable CAD.

This study is designed to demonstrate that the onset of the antiplatelet effect of 90mg bid dose ticagrelor is more rapid and greater than 75 mg qd dose clopidogrel in patients undergoing CABG surgery.
