(firstQuint)Treatment Outcome in Early Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis.

 Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease characterised by excessive connective tissue in the skin (causing skin thickening called 'scleroderma'), muscle, joints and internal organs.

 A number of different drugs with effects on the immune system (known as 'immunosuppressants') are currently being used by clinicians in the treatment of early diffuse cutaneous SSc, but all can have significant side effects.

 We want to know whether any one is definitely effective and, if so, which is the most effective.

The aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of commonly used immunosuppressant treatments for early diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (SSc).
