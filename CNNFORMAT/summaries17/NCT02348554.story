(thirdQuint)A Smartphone Application to Evaluate Energy Expenditure and Duration of Activities for Overweight and Obese People.

 There is a growing interest in evaluating physical activity and energy expenditure (EE) to provide feedback to the user.

 The use of mass-market sensors such as accelerometers offers a promising solution for the general public due to the growing smartphone market over the last decade.

 Two previous studies allowed to propose a function named PredEE, which has been tested on normal-weighted volunteers.

 This EE estimation function has been tested and improved with data collected from 43 overweight volunteers equipped with smartphones and two or three research sensors (Fitmate, Armband and Actiheart in controlled conditions, and Armband and Actiheart in free-living conditions).

 Research sensors' data serves as reference during the evaluation and improvement of the proposed function.

 This EE estimation function using the smartphone technology is dedicated to light- and moderate-intensity activities, and the investigators believe it can be a new way to help people controlling their daily physical activity level.

The aim of this study was to validate functions for estimating energy expenditure in controlled and free-living conditions.

 This method was based on accelerometry data acquired from smartphones worn in a trouser pocket.

 The developed functions have been compared to the estimations provided by three research devices named Fitmate, Armband and Actiheart.
