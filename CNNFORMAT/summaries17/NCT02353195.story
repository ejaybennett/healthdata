(firstQuint)Effects of Radio-frequency in Patients With Myofascial Chronic Neck Pain.

 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

 Setting: University community.

 Patients with myofascial chronic neck pain with active MTrP in one upper trapezius muscle were involved.

 The patients were randomly divided into two groups: a radiofrequency group (RFG), who (14 patients) received 8 sessions of a monopolar capacitive resistive radiofrequency (MCRRF) application over the upper trapezius muscle and ten patients received 8 sessions of placebo radiofrequency (PG) over the same muscle.

 Main outcome measures: Visual analog scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI) and cervical range of motion (pre-treatment, immediately post-first session treatment and post-treatment.
