(thirdQuint)Mitral Implantation of TRAnscatheter vaLves.

 Design: A prospective pilot study enrolling extremely high surgical risk patients with symptomatic severe calcific mitral valve disease undergoing implantation of an Edwards Sapien XT or SAPIEN 3 valve in the mitral position.

 There are two arms in this study evaluating two separate patient populations described below: - Native Mitral Valve with severe Mitral Annular Calcification (MAC): Patients with symptomatic severe disease of a native mitral valve due to severe mitral annular calcification.

 - Valve in ring: Patients with symptomatic failing surgical rings resulting in severe mitral regurgitation or stenosis.

 The delivery approaches include: standard transeptal, modified transeptal approach with a guidewire externalized through a sheath percutaneously placed in the left ventricle, surgical trasnapical and surgical transatrial delivery approach with or without surgical resection of the anterior MV leaflet (in the native mitral valve arm).

 The MITRAL Trial site investigative team (heart team) consists of dedicated representatives from cardiac surgery, interventional cardiology, echocardiology, neurology, study coordination and other multi-disciplinary team members consistent with a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) model.

 Endpoints Most endpoints were defined following the Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium (MVARC) recommendations.

 The primary safety endpoint is technical success at exit from the cath lab and procedural success at 30 days.

 - Technical success (at exit from the cath lab) is defined as: - Successful vascular and/or TA access, delivery and retrieval of the transcatheter valve delivery system - Deployment of a single valve - Correct position of transcatheter valve in the mitral annulus - Adequate performance of the prosthetic heart valve (MVA > 1.

5 cm2) without residual mitral regurgitation grade 2 (+) - No need for additional surgery or re-intervention (includes drainage of pericardial effusion) - The patient leaves the cath lab alive - Procedural Success (30 days) in defined as: - Device success at 30 days - No device/procedure related SAE's including: death, stroke, MI or coronary ischemia requiring PCI or CABG, stage 2 or 3 AKI including dialysis, life threatening bleeding, major vascular or access complications (arterial, venous, or TA - any event requiring additional unplanned surgical or transcatheter intervention), pericardial effusion or tamponade requiring drainage, severe hypotension, heart failure or respiratory failure requiring intravenous pressors or invasive or mechanical treatments such as ultrafiltration or hemodynamic assist devices including intra-aortic balloon pump or left ventricular assist device, or prolonged intubation for 48 hrs, or any valve-related dysfunction, migration, thrombosis, or other complication requiring surgery or repeat intervention.

 - Device success is defined as: - Stroke free survival with original valve in place - No need for additional surgery or re-intervention related to the procedure, access or to the replacement valve - Proper placement and intended function of the replacement valve, including - No migration, fracture, thrombosis, hemolysis or endocarditis - No replacement valve stenosis (valve area > 1.

5 cm2, MV gradient cent Individual patient success at one year is defined as: Device success AND all of the following: - The patient returns to the pre-procedural setting - No re-hospitalizations or re-interventions for HF or the underlying MV condition (including HF hospitalization or HF hospitalization equivalents, drainage pleural effusions, new listing for heart transplant, VAD or other MCS) - NYHA improvement of at least 1 class vs.

 baseline - KCCQ improvement > 10 vs.

 Baseline - 6MWT improvement > 50 meters vs.

 baseline The secondary safety and effectiveness endpoint is a non-hierarchical composite of various adverse events, as well as each individual event listed below.

 The secondary endpoint will be evaluated at two time points: (1) acute, covering events occurring out to 30 days or hospital discharge, whichever is longer; and (2) longer-term, covering events from 31 days to 1 year.

 The specific components of the composite are: - all stroke and TIA - myocardial infarction - major vascular complication (MVARC) - life-threatening bleeding (MVARC) - reoperation or catheter-based intervention for: valve thrombosis, valve displacement, or other valve placed procedure-related complication - hemolysis - endocarditis - moderate or severe central mitral insufficiency 2 (+), and/or moderate or severe perivalvular leak causing 2 (+) mitral insufficiency - significant mitral stenosis (mean MVG >10 mmHg) - permanent pacemaker insertion - new aortic valve dysfunction - new LVOT gradient 20 mmHg, or 20 mmHg increase from baseline LVOT gradient.

The purpose of this trial is to establish the safety and feasibility of the Edwards SAPIEN XT cent and SAPIEN 3 cent device and delivery systems in patients with severe symptomatic calcific mitral valve disease with severe mitral annular calcification who are not candidates for standard mitral valve surgery.
