(thirdQuint)Effect of the Height of the Operating Table During Spinal Anesthesia.

 Sixty patients will be recruited undergoing elective surgery under spinal anesthesia.

 The patients will be randomly allocated to one of four groups: Group U, L, X, and N.

 These acronyms indicate the heights of the operating table which set at the needle insertion point of anesthetists, namely the level of umbilicus, lowest rib margin, xiphoid process, and nipple in a standing posture.

 The angle between the patient's skin and the spinal needle will be measured by the protractor in the coronal and sagittal plane.

 The anesthesiologists will be asked to record the subjective general discomfort graded by Numeric Rating Scale.

 And the degree of neck, lower back, knee, and elbow flexion of the anesthesiologists will be measured by taking pictures during procedure.

 Effect of the Height of the Operating Table During Spinal Anesthesia@highlight

The purpose of this study is to analyze the accuracy of needle insertion and the discomfort during different ergonomic conditions faced by anesthesiologists during spinal anesthesia.

 In particular,the investigators intend to compare the angles between the patients' back and the inserted spinal needle in the coronal plane at different operating table heights.
