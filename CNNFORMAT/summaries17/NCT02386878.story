(fifthQuint)HIV/AIDS Orphaned and Vulnerable Children Public Health Evaluation.

 The study will apply a mixed-methods approach involving two primary components: 1) an impact evaluation using a community-randomized controlled trial (CRCT); and 2) a detailed analysis of intervention costs, linked to the impact evaluation to determine the cost-effectiveness of these interventions.

 For the CRCT, sixty World Vision drop-in centers which deliver standard care were randomly assigned to one of four study conditions: IPTG, Vhutshilo, IPTG+Vhutshilo, and control.

 Approximately 1600 adolescent OVC aged 14-17 years (current beneficiaries at the drop-in centers) and their caregivers were eligible to participate in the study at baseline.

 Participants were visited three times including the baseline survey.

 Follow-up data collection was conducted in two rounds.

 The first round took place 8 months after the baseline survey and immediately following intervention exposure.

 A second follow-up round took place a year later, allowing assessment of both the immediate and longer-term impact of the interventions.

 Participants were interviewed at home in Xhosa or Sesotho.

 Caregivers in the sample completed face-to-face interviews with trained interviewers, while adolescents complete surveys used a mix of face-to-face interviewing and audio computer-assisted self-interview technology (ACASI).

 HIV/AIDS Orphaned and Vulnerable Children Public Health Evaluation@highlight

The PHE study is a two-year longitudinal study evaluating two interventions for reducing depression and HIV risk behaviors among highly vulnerable adolescents in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.

 Research suggests that children affected by AIDS are at heightened risk of HIV infection relative to their peers; however, evidence on how best to address HIV prevention and psychological health among this population is lacking.

 This study examines the efficacy of both a psychological and behavioral intervention, alone and in combination, on related outcomes among vulnerable youth age 14-17.

 A mixed methods approach is applied, including a community-randomized controlled trial with a factorial design, a cost-effectiveness analysis, and a qualitative component.

 At baseline data collection in January 2012, more than 1000 adolescents and their caregivers were interviewed; these participants were invited to take part in two more survey rounds designed to examine both the immediate and long term effects of the interventions.

 Support for this research was provided by USAID under Grant No.
