(secondQuint)An Exploratory Study of Treatment Sensitivity and Prognostic Factors in a Efficacy and Safety Study of mFOLFOX6 + Bevacizumab Versus.

 mFOLFOX6 + Panitumumab Therapy in Patients With Chemotherapy-nave Unresectable Advanced or Recurrent Colorectal Cancer.

.

 The drug being tested in this study is called Panitumumab.

 This exploratory study will investigate biomarkers which may be predictors of efficacy and safety of treatment with mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab versus.

 mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab therapy in patients with chemotherapy-naive unresectable advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer.

.

 Tumor tissue samples obtained from the participants who enrolled in the safety/efficacy study of Panitumumab + mFOLFOX versus bevacizumab + + mFOLFOX (PARADIGM Study) and provided consent for this additional study will be used.

 Mutations, amplification and rearrangement of predefined tumor-associated genes will be investigated using DNA collected from tumor samples used for assessing RAS mutations and plasma free DNA collected before administration of cycle 1 and at the discontinuation of the protocol treatment in the main study.
