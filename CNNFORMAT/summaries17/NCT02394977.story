(thirdQuint)Effect of the Cardio First Angle Device on CPR Outcomes.

 The investigators sought to determine if the addition of a CPR feedback device to routine manual CPR would impact the quality and consistency of chest compression and patient survival.

 We conducted a randomized, controlled, single-blinded study of patients undergoing CPR for cardiac arrest in the mixed medical-surgical ICUs of four academic teaching hospitals.

 Patients were randomized to receive either standard manual CPR or CPR using the Cardio First Angel cent (CFA; INOTECH, Nubberg, Germany) feedback device.

 Recorded variables included return of spontaneous circulation, adherence to CPR guidelines and quality of CPR, nurse satisfaction and CPR associated morbidity.

The investigators conducted a randomized, controlled, single-blinded study of patients undergoing CPR for cardiac arrest in the mixed medical-surgical ICUs of four academic teaching hospitals in Tehran, Iran from June 1 to October 31, 2014.

 Patients were randomized to receive CPR with either standard manual compression, or compression with real-time audiovisual feedback using the Cardio First Angel cent device.
