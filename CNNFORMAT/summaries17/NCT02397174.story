(fifthQuint)Mediterranean Diet Versus Hypocaloric Diet in PCOS.

 PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive age women, that is often associated with chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance.

 The central importance of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of the syndrome has been established by several in vivo and in vitro studies.

 No data are available for the best therapeutical approach for metabolic dysfunction of PCOS.

 The new guidelines for the management of metabolic risk in PCOS strongly recommended that overweight/obese women with PCOS should lose weight changing their lifestyle.

 Although calorie-restricted diets are currently recommended to reach the healthy weight, there are still unsatisfied data regarding the best dietetic regimen that should be suggested.

 In this study, our purpose is to compare two nutritional protocols in order to find the best dietetic approach for improving clinical, metabolic and hormonal outcomes in pcos women.
