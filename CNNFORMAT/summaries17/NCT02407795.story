(firstQuint)Conventional With Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Pain Reduction and Quality of Life in Spinal Metastases.

 Study population: patients with painful spinal metastases from solid tumors without spinal cord compression or cord instability.

 Objective: This study will test the hypothesis that stereotactic radiotherapy gives a better and longer lasting reduction of pain, local control and therewith a better quality of life.

 This in order to optimize and to individualize the treatment options for the patient.

 Study design: Complaints due to pain will be analysed using the validated Dutch Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and side-effects will be recorded using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

 In addition to this the quality of life will be analysed using the EORTC QOL-C15-PAL and EORTC QLQ-BM22 questionnaires.

 For analysis of cost-effectiveness the EQ-5D will be used.
