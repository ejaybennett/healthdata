(firstQuint)High-Shear Microfluidic Thrombosis Assay.

 It is estimated that approximately 25% of people are resistant to aspirin, or do not respond to its effect.

 These individuals have a four fold higher risk of a heart attack or stroke compared to those who respond to aspirin.

 Current tests for determining those who are aspirin resistant are not reliable.

 This study is assessing the effectiveness of a new assay in determining the rate and time it takes for people who are or are not on aspirin in forming a blood clot.
