(firstQuint)Development and Validation of in Vitro Cell-based Bioassays for Nuclear Receptor Activation.

 In vitro cell-based bioassays may be a technique to measure serum androgen or estrogen bioactivity.

 In this study investigators are collecting serum (and if possible, urine) samples from different cohorts of patients, before and/or after treatment.

 The aim is to measure androgens, estrogens and SHBG as well as in vitro bioactivity with newly developed cell-based bioassays, and to compare different techniques to each other as well as to clinical endpoints available in the patient's Electronic Health Record.

 Development and Validation of in Vitro Cell-based Bioassays for Nuclear Receptor Activation@highlight

This is a prospective biobank set up to collect serum from patients with disorders associated with changes in androgens, estrogens or sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), before and/or after treatment.
