(secondQuint)Efficacy of Wound Care and Reduction of Wound Complications by Use of AQUACEL Ag Surgical Dressing in MIS TKA.

 Traditional adhesive dressing (Mepore(R); Molnlycke Health Care) for low limb arthroplasty wounds had blistering up to 26%.

 The jubilee dressing, which consisted of a highly absorbent Hydrofiber inner layer and (Aquacel; ConvaTec Inc.

) and a viscoelastic hydrocolloid outer layer (DuoDERM Extra Thin; ConvaTec Inc.

), was introduced for lower limb arthroplasty wounds with lower blistering rate (2% vs.

 18%) and lower surgical site infection (1% vs.

 3%) compared to traditional adhesive dressing.

 A new modern dressing regime (Aquacel Ag Surgical dressing; ConvaTec Inc.

) also reported longer wear time, less dressing change and less blistering.

 In our institution, the standard wound care after TKA was an antimicrobial dressing (Sofra-Tulle(R); Royal Chem.

 & Pharm.

 Co.

, Kaohsiung, Taiwan) in the inner layer and gauzes in the outer layer.

 The investigators hypothesized that AQUACEL(R) Ag Surgical dressing would have a significant improvement in the efficacy of wound care and wound complications compared with traditional Sofra-Tulle(R) dressings after MIS-TKA.
