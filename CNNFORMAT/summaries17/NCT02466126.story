(secondQuint)Effectiveness and Implementation of Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in CBOCs.

 Depression is a serious health condition that places tremendous burden on patients and healthcare systems and is especially prevalent in Veterans.

 In 2008, the VHA released the Uniform Mental Health Services Handbook (Handbook 1160.

01) in an effort to expand services for Veterans with depression, including those in primary care and CBOC settings.

 The VA remains a national leader in mental health services, but the provision of psychotherapy within VA is limited, especially for rural Veterans and those cared for in CBOCs.

 The VA has invested significant resources to improve access to high-quality mental health care, including a rapid expansion into CBOCs.

 Currently, there is a need to work with clinicians and stakeholders to address practice barriers related to mental health practices in CBOCs.

 A recent survey of 4,200 mental health providers in VA found that, although robust expansion and improved quality of mental health care services has occurred, access to proven effective psychotherapies in CBOCs remains a focused area for improvement.

 The study will examine whether existing VA CBOC mental health clinicians, with training and support, can effectively administer a structured brief cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT) intervention for Veterans with clinically elevated symptoms of depression.
