(firstQuint)Effect of GM1 in Prevention of Taxanes Induced Neurotoxicity in Operable Breast Cancer.

 Taxanes is a key agent in the treatment of breast cancer.

 However, peripheral neuropathy markedly limits the use of taxanes.

 There are no way to relieve or eliminate taxanes-related neurotoxicity.

 Monosialotetrahexosyl ganglioside (GM1) present a role of neuroprotective properties.

 This multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed to assess the efficacy of GM1 for preventing taxanes induced neurotoxicity in operable breast cancer patients who received taxanes-based adjuvant chemotherapy.
