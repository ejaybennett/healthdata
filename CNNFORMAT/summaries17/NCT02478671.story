(firstQuint)Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to Assess Radial Artery Compression and Arterial Perfusion While TR Band is Applied.

 In this study, the diameter of each subjects' radial artery will be measured using MRI imagery at varying degrees of radial artery compression by adjusting the amount of air injected into a Terumo TR Band.

 In addition, using pulse oxymetry, the perfusion waveform will be measured and recorded also while the subjects have a TR Band in place on their wrists.
