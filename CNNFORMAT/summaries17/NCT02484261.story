(thirdQuint)Monitoring and Treatment of Relapsed Leukemia Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Children.

 Patients will be enrolled on this study at the time of transplantation.

 Following HSCT, CD34+ chimerism in peripheral blood will be monitored in real time at scheduled intervals.

 If chimerism of CD34+ cells diminishes post-HSCT or clinical signs or symptoms of relapsed leukemia, relapse in bone marrow will be confirmed, after which immunosuppression will be withdrawn and treatment initiated with bortezomib and pravastatin.

 Patients will be monitored for disease response until 1 year post-HSCT or post-study therapy.

 Patients with confirmed relapse post-HSCT will also be eligible to enroll and receive novel combination.

 Monitoring and Treatment of Relapsed Leukemia Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Children@highlight

This study aims to monitor patients for relapse of the leukemia following allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) in order to identify patients early in relapse, with a low burden of disease, when interventions may be more successful by monitoring of peripheral blood lineage specific chimerism.

 Once disease has been confirmed, patients will initiate a novel combination of bortezomib and pravastatin.
