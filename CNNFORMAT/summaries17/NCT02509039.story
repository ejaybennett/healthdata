(secondQuint)A Study of CC-122 to Assess the Safety and Tolerability in Japanese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).

 This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study that will evaluate the safety, tolerability, (Pharmacokinetics) PK, and preliminary efficacy of CC-122 in Japanese subjects with advanced solid tumors or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).

 Subjects will receive ascending dose levels of CC-122 from Cycle 1 onwards to measure PK and to determine safety and tolerability.

 An initial cohort of at least three subjects will be given CC-122 at a dose of 2.

0 mg on an intermittent dosing schedule (5 continuous days out of 7 days per week) and 3-6 subjects will be enrolled in subsequent dose levels.

 Dose escalation for subsequent cohorts will proceed according to a standard dose escalation design (3+3 design) (Storer, 1989) to establish initial toxicity.

To determine the safety and tolerability of CC-122 when administered orally to adult Japanese subjects with advanced solid tumors or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).
