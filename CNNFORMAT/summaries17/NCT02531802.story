(firstQuint)Enterotoxigenic Escherichia Coli (ETEC) ETVAX Vaccine Trial in Bangladesh.

 This Phase I/II trial will serve to assess whether ETVAX is safe and provides mucosal as well as systemic immune responses against the key protective antigens when tested in different age-groups in Bangladesh.

 This study provides an opportunity to test the safety profile of a mucosal adjuvant, double-mutant LT (dmLT), in adults and children, as well as provide the opportunity to potentially assess the ability of dmLT to further enhance the mucosal and systemic antibody responses to key antigens in the ETVAX vaccine among age groups in developing country sites, like Bangladesh, that have proved refractory to oral immunization with enteric vaccines.

 In addition, this study also allows for the evaluation of the potential dose-sparing effect of dmLT when combined with a lower dose of vaccine.

 Finally, this clinical trial is considered an essential study along the critical path of the overall clinical development plan before determining whether the vaccine can be tested for protective efficacy in children in developing countries.

The purpose of this study is to determine if the ETEC vaccine ETVAX with and without dmLT adjuvant is safe and immunogenic in adults, children, toddlers and infants in Bangladesh.
