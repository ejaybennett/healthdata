(secondQuint)Effect of Use of Ureteral Access Sheath on Levels of Netrin-1 in Patients Undergoing RIRS.

 This study will include patients aged between 18 and 65 who will undergo retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) due to renal stone(s).

 A total of 60 patients (male or female) will be recruited, and will be randomized into 2 groups consisting of 30 patients in each group.

 The first group of patients will undergo RIRS with a ureteral access sheath (UAS) positioned prior to surgery; and the second group will undergo RIRS without UAS.

 As use of UAS decreases the pressure in the renal pelvis during RIRS, it is aimed to evaluate whether using UAS or not affects the kidney functions.

 Besides the routine kidney function tests, namely urea and creatinine, and Netrin-1 (more specific and early marker of kidney function) will be used to assess the differences in the kidney functions.

 Preoperative blood urea, creatinine and Netrin-1 levels and urine Netrin-1 levels will be studied for all patients.

 After the surgery, blood urea and creatinine levels will be again studied as well as blood Netrin-1 levels at postoperative 48th hour; and urine Netrin-1 levels at postoperative 24th hour.

 Effect of Use of Ureteral Access Sheath on Levels of Netrin-1 in Patients Undergoing RIRS@highlight

In this study, it is aimed to evaluate whether use of a ureteral access sheath (UAS) during retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) due to kidney stone has any effect on protecting the kidney functions by measuring blood and urine and Netrin-1 levels.
