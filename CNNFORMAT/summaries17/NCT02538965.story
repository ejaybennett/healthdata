(thirdQuint)A Study of Lenalidomide in Pediatric Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, Phase 2, Simon's Optimal two-stage design study, with an Optional Extension Phase (OEP), that will assess the activity, safety and Pharmacokinetics (PK) of lenalidomide in pediatric subjects from 1 to 18 years of age with second or greater Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (rrAML).

 A total of 43 evaluable subjects (18 subjects in Stage 1 and an additional 25 subjects in Stage 2) are required for assessment of the primary endpoint.

 To allow for subjects found to be unevaluable for the primary endpoint due to an incorrect diagnosis, not having a disease assessment post screening, or who discontinued prior to receiving lenalidomide, up to 4 additional subjects may be enrolled for a maximum of 47 evaluable subjects across approximately 70 sites.

 Approximately 50% of enrolled subjects will be younger than 12 years of age to provide adequate PK data for this age subset.

 If during Stage 1, at least 3 of 18 subjects achieve a morphologic complete response (either CR or CRi) within the first 4 cycles of study treatment, then the study will proceed to Stage 2; otherwise, the study will be terminated.

 Similarly, if at the final analysis, at least 8 of 43 evaluable subjects across Stages 1 and 2 achieve a response (CR/CRi) within the first 4 cycles of study treatment, it will be concluded that lenalidomide has sufficient activity in pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) to warrant subsequent study.

 The optional extension phase (OEP) will allow subjects who demonstrate clinical benefit, as assessed by the Investigator at the completion of 12 cycles of lenalidomide therapy, to continue receiving oral lenalidomide until they meet the criteria for study discontinuation.

 In the OEP, only safety, dosing, concomitant medications/procedures, and second primary malignancies (SPMs) will be monitored.

To determine the activity of lenalidomide in the treatment of pediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory AML (with second or greater relapse or refractory to at least 2 prior induction attempts) measured by morphological complete response defined as either a CR or CRi within the first 4 cycles of treatment.
