(secondQuint)Glycemic Control and Treatment Satisfaction Using Finesse Versus Pen for Initiating Bolus Insulin Dosing in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients Not Achieving Glycemic Targets on Basal Insulin With/Without Anti-Hyperglycemic Agents.

 Patients sub-optimally controlled on basal insulin (with/without other antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs)) will be randomized 1:1 to either Finesse or pen to initiate bolus insulin dosing and followed for a 44-week intervention period.

 Patients will have both basal and bolus doses of insulin adjusted throughout the trial, as is clinically indicated, based on an easy to follow insulin dosing algorithm.

 After the final endpoint evaluation at week 44, patients will crossover to the alternate bolus insulin delivery device for 4 weeks and complete a patient preference survey at week 48.

 Glycemic Control and Treatment Satisfaction Using Finesse Versus Pen for Initiating Bolus Insulin Dosing in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients Not Achieving Glycemic Targets on Basal Insulin With/Without Anti-Hyperglycemic Agents@highlight

To compare glycemic control and treatment satisfaction using a novel bolus insulin patch (Finesse) versus a pen for initiating and managing bolus insulin dosing in patients with T2DM not achieving glycemic targets on basal insulin with/without anti-hyperglycemic agents.
