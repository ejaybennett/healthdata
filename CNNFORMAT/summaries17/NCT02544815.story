(fifthQuint)Digoxin Short Term Treatment Assessment Randomized Trial in AHF.

 AHFS management is challenging given the heterogeniety of the patient population, absence of a universally accepted definition, incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology, and lack of evidence based guidelines.

 The majority of patients appear to respond well to initial therapies consisting of loop diuretics and vasoactive agents.

 however, this treatments failed to decrease post-discharge mortality and readmission rates which represent the most important goal in AHFS.

 In the last few years, many drugs has been tested in AHFS setting trying to adress this issue, however results has been disappointing in term of efficacy and / or safety.

 Although evidence supports the beneficial effects of digoxin on hemodynamic, neurohormonal, and electrophysiological parameters in patients with CHF, recent publications has rose concerns about its safety profile and therefore decreasing its use.

 The effects of digoxin alone or in combination with other vasodilators are seen within few hours of its administration and result in increased cardiac output, decreased pulmonary wedge pressure, increased ejection fraction, and improved neurohormonal profile without changes in blood pressure.

 All this findings made us rose the question of whether digoxin is effective or not in short term treatment of acute heart failure ?.

 Digoxin Short Term Treatment Assessment Randomized Trial in AHF@highlight

AHFS management is challenging and most of the used drugs has failed to decrease post-discharge mortality and readmission rates which represent the most important goal in AHFS.

 Digoxin processes many characteristics of a beneficial drug for heart failure, however recent publications has rose concerns about its safety profile and therefore decreasing its use.

 Whether digoxin is efficient and safe in short term treatment of acute heart failure is a question that should be studied.
