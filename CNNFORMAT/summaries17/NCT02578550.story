(thirdQuint)A Bioequivalence Study of Darunavir, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir Alafenamide, in the Presence of Cobicistat in Healthy Participants.

 This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study in 96 healthy adult participants.

 The study consists of 2 treatment sessions.

 Participants will receive in one session a single dose of darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) 800/150/200/10 milligram (mg) tablets as fixed-dose combination (FDC) and in another session Darunavir (DRV) as 1x 800 mg tablet, Emtricitabine/ tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF) as 1x 200/10 mg FDC tablet, and Cobicistat (COBI) 150 mg as 1x 150 mg tablet all under fed conditions.

 Treatment sessions will be separated by a washout period of at least 7 days.

 The duration of the study for an individual participant will be at least 12 days, Screening and Follow-up not included.

 Participants safety will be monitored throughout the study.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics and pivotal bioequivalence of Darunavir (DRV) 800 milligram (mg), Emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) 10 mg when administered as a fixed-dose combination (FDC) (D/C/F/TAF) relative to the separate agents (DRV 800 mg tablet formulation and FTC/TAF 200/10 mg FDC) in the presence of 150 mg Cobicistat (COBI), under fed conditions, in healthy participants.
