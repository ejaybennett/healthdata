(fifthQuint)Optimizing Text Messaging to Improve Adherence to Web-Based Cessation Treatment.

 This study is comprised of 2 active phases, all conducted with registered users on BecomeAnEX.

org, a well-established smoking cessation website.

 Phase I involves the initial development and optimization of the text message intervention.

 The investigators will examine the impact of 4 experimental text message intervention features on smokers' adherence to a web-based cessation intervention during the first 3 months of program enrollment.

 The investigators will utilize a full factorial design where participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 levels of each of the following features: 1) personalization (yes/no), 2) integration (yes/no), 3) dynamic tailoring (yes/no), and 4) message intensity (standard vs.

 decreasing).

 The primary outcome in Phase I will be a composite metric of utilization.

 Phase II involves a 2-arm randomized trial that compares WEB alone to WEB plus the text message intervention from Phase I that yields optimal adherence (WEB+OA_TXT).

 The randomized trial will use a repeated measures design, with assessments at baseline, 3, 9, and 15 months.

 Follow-ups at 3, 9, and 15 months correspond to 0, 6, and 12 months post-treatment.

 The primary outcome is 30-day point prevalence abstinence (ppa) at 9-months.

 The investigators will assess and validate smoking status at all follow-ups.

 Other outcomes include motivation to quit, quit attempts, and continuous abstinence.

 Optimizing Text Messaging to Improve Adherence to Web-Based Cessation Treatment@highlight

This study is comprised of 2 phases to study the impact of a text message system on overall adherence to a web-based smoking cessation program.

 Phase I uses a full factorial design to identify the most optimal text message intervention to maximize adherence to the BecomeAnEX.

org smoking cessation program.

 Phase II is a randomized controlled trial that compares regular BecomeAnEX users to those who will receive the optimized text message intervention (from Phase I) in conjunction with BecomeAnEX for impact on long-term abstinence.
