(firstQuint)The neoClose Abdominal Closure vs Carter-Thomason Trial.

 Both the neoClose abdominal closure to the standard Carter-Thomason closurewill be used to close 12 mm camera and stapler port sites upon completion of a robotic assisted laparoscopic gastric bypass.

 The procedure requires a 12 mm port be placed in the midline approximately 3 cm cephalad to the umbilicus and a second in the right mid abdomen.

 Port sites will be closed as defined as the inability to palpate a fascial defect and the incision being air tight upon carbon dioxide insufflation.
