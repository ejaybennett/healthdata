(thirdQuint)A Trial of Daily Ultraviolet Therapy to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk Factors.

 Epidemiological studies suggest that sunlight reduces all cause mortality, and particularly cardiovascular mortality.

 The investigators have previously shown vasodilatation and a transient fall in blood pressure following irradiation of human volunteers with 2 standard erythemal doses of UVA radiation.

 This was independent of vitamin D and temperature rise and correlated with a nitric oxide synthase independent mobilisation of NO stores from the skin to the systemic circulation.

 In this randomised, sham-controlled, cross-over double blind study, they will measure whether twice daily UVA administration can produce a sustained fall in BP and other cardiovascular risk factors in a cohort of pre-hypertensive patients.

 A Trial of Daily Ultraviolet Therapy to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk Factors@highlight

The investigators have shown that a single dose of ultraviolet irradiation (as found in sunlight) will lower blood pressure for around one hour.

 They are now testing whether daily UVA for two weeks will produce a sustained fall in BP in patients with high blood pressure.

 They will also measure the effect of daily UVA on other cardiovascular risk factors.
