(thirdQuint)Study Comparing Two Different Schedules of Palbociclib Plus Second Line Endocrine Therapy in Women With Estrogen Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 The standard or usual treatment of this type of breast cancer is endocrine therapy.

 Palbociclib is a new type of drug for breast cancer.

 Laboratory tests as well as studies in animals and people show that it may help slow the growth of breast cancer.

 The most widely tested regimen of Palbociclib for patients with metastatic/advanced breast cancer is 125 mg every day for 21 days out of a 28 day cycle in combination with standard endocrine (hormone) therapy.

 This study explores if administering a lower dose of palbociclib - 100 mg given every day of a 28 day cycle in combination with standard endocrine (hormone) therapy - may result in more tumour shrinkage and be better tolerated.

The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of endocrine therapy and Palbociclib at a daily dose of 100 mg will result in a better response to therapy with fewer dose interruptions than the proposed dosing regimen of 125 mg daily for 21 days out of a 28 day cycle in combination with endocrine therapy.
