(fifthQuint)IL-32 Levels in Patients With Chronic Periodontitis.

 The purpose of this study was to investigate IL-32 levels in the GCF and saliva of patients with chronic periodontitis and to evaluate changes after nonsurgical periodontal therapy.

 Twenty-seven CP and 27 periodontally healthy controls were enrolled in this study.

 Periodontitis patients received nonsurgical periodontal treatment.

 GCF and saliva sampling and clinical periodontal parameters were assessed before and a month after treatment.

 IL-32, IL-10 and TNF- levels in GCF and saliva were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

 Unstimulated salivary samples were collected using standard techniques.

 About 2 mL whole saliva was collected in disposable tubes and centrifuged immediately to remove cell debris (10,000 g x 10 minutes).

 The supernatants (50 mu L each) were stored at -40C until analyzed.

 GCF samples were collected from a mesio-buccal and disto-palatal site on each tooth.

 In the CP group, the samples were obtained from patients at areas with 5 mm CAL, 6 mm PD and 30% bone loss.

 In the healthy group, GCF samples were collected from teeth exhibiting PD mu l eppendorf centrifuge tube and stored at -40C until analyzed.

 IL-32 Levels in Patients With Chronic Periodontitis@highlight

Interleukin-32 (IL-32) is a recently described cytokine that is a strong inducer of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-.

 A previous report have reported that Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived LPS significantly up-regulated IL-32 expression compared with the unstimulated cells in monocytes (THP-1 cells).

 They suggested that IL-32 may contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.

 In the present study the investigators hypothesized that IL-32 levels may increase in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and saliva of patients with chronic periodontitis compared with healthy controls and these levels may decrease together with treatment.
