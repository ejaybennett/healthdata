(firstQuint)Study of Chemoradiotherapy for Inoperable Locally Advanced (Stage /a) Thymoma or Thymic Carcinoma.

 Complete resection is difficult to achieve without damaging the main organs in some locally advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma.

 The previous trials have showed that radiotherapy was significantly associated with prolonged OS and chemotherapy is playing an increasing role in treatment of patients with advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma.

 However, whether or not concurrent chemoradiotherapy is safety in locally advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma is still unknown.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma.
