(fifthQuint)Prospective Pilot Study of Floseal for the Treatment of Anterior Epistaxis in Patients With (HHT).

 Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by abnormal blood vessel development.

 This dysplasia manifests as mucocutaneous telangiectases and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVM).

 The most common symptom is epistaxis occurring secondary to telangiectases in the nasal mucosa in more than 90% of HHT patients.

 Heterogeneity exists in the severity of epistaxis experienced by HHT patients; therefore, treatments and management strategies can vary.

 For minor bleeding, conservative management may include preventing drying of the nasal mucosa with the use of ointments and humidification.

 In some cases, topical or systemic estrogen may also be used to improve the stability of the nasal mucosa, thereby reducing bleeding.

 Commonly, anterior nasal packing is used as a non-surgical management strategy to control major bleeding.

 When medical management strategies have failed, laser coagulation of the telangiectases or septodermoplasty may be considered however, these solutions are temporary as telangiectasia are known to recur.

 In the acute setting, embolization may be used to occlude the abnormal vasculature while maintaining blood flow to the surrounding tissue; however, this is also not an effective long-term solution.

 Severe and difficult to manage epistaxis has been effectively treated using the modified Young's procedure where closure of the nostril is achieved by suturing together circumferential skin and mucosa flaps.

 Floseal hemostatic matrix (Floseal(R)) is a hemostatic agent that consists of two major components.

 The first are gelatin granules that swell when they come into contact with blood or other wet surfaces creating a tamponade effect.

 The second is a high concentration of human thrombin that promotes natural clot formation by converting fibrinogen to fibrin.

 Floseal(R) is hydrophilic and therefore adheres well to wet tissues.

 It is indicated for use as an adjunct surgical hemostat and it has recently been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for epistaxis.

 A prospective, randomized, controlled trial compared Floseal(R) to nasal packing in the treatment of acute anterior epistaxis.

 The results showed Floseal(R) to be better at initially controlling epistaxis and resulted in fewer rebleed events within a seven day follow-up period.

 Patients also reported less pain and greater overall satisfaction with Floseal(R) as compared with nasal packing.

 Similarly, two prospective studies have evaluated the use of Floseal(R) for the treatment of posterior epistaxis.

 These trials also showed Floseal(R) treatment to be an effective treatment for posterior epistaxis.

 Furthermore, the use of Floseal(R) was associated with substantial institutional cost savings.

 In summary, Floseal(R) has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for posterior epistaxis, regardless of origin within the nose.

 Recently, Floseal(R) has been used in patients with HHT.

 This case series showed that patients with anterior epistaxis due to HHT could self-administer Floseal(R) to treat recurrent anterior epistaxis at their home without a contact with the medical system, as would customarily occur.

 This directly leads to an improvement in the quality of life of the patients in this study.

 Impairment of the quality of life for patients with HHT is a significant concern.

 Compared to the normative population, all subscales of SF36, but bodily pain, have been shown to be significantly poorer in the HHT patients.

 Studies of HHT substantiate that disease severity is associated with poorer QoL in these patients.

 Treatments for epistaxis that can improve the quality of life for patients with HHT are needed.

 Prospective Pilot Study of Floseal for the Treatment of Anterior Epistaxis in Patients With (HHT)@highlight

Current management strategies for severe and recurrent epistaxis secondary to Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) include surgical procedures, and uncomfortable nasal packing, both of which are often only short-term solutions.

 Floseal(R) may provide a non-invasive and less painful treatment option for epistaxis in HHT patients.

 This hemostatic agent has been shown to be an effective intraoperative hemostatic agent in a number of surgical procedures including endoscopic sinus surgery.

 It has also been shown to be favorable over nasal packing at controlling acute anterior epistaxis.

 Though the efficacy of using Floseal(R) for epistaxis in HHT patients has been proven anecdotally in the literature it has yet to be proven in a prospective clinical trial.

 The results of this pilot study will provide insight into the efficacy of using Floseal(R) in the management of severe epistaxis in HHT patients and to assist in the development of a full-scale prospective clinical trial.
