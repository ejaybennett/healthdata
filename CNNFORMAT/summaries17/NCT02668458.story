(secondQuint)Comparison of Pre-oxygenation of NIV and HFNC Therapy for Intubation of ICU Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure.

 Design: Clinical randomized, open, multicenter, comparative trial, with parallel groups aimed at evaluating a medical device.

 Selection of patients admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, requiring endotracheal intubation.

 Randomized study, inclusion in two groups: NIV or HFNC.

 Experimental group: NHFC group, preoxygenation by NHFC: oxygen flow rate of 60 L / min and 100% FiO2.

 Control group: NIV group, preoxygenation by NIV: pressure support set for an exhaled tidal volume of 6-8 ml / kg of ideal body weight, PEEP of 5 cm H2O and FiO2 at 100%.

 Duration of participation of each patient: 28 days.

 Comparison of Pre-oxygenation of NIV and HFNC Therapy for Intubation of ICU Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure@highlight

The aim of the study is to evaluate the incidence of severe hypoxemia episodes during the intubation procedure with two methods of pre-oxygenation: 1.

 NIV (Non Invasive Ventilation) 2.

 HFNC (High-flow nasal canula oxygen therapy)
