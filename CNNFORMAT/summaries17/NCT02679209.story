(firstQuint)Evaluation of Amnion Chorion Membrane and Demineralized Bone Matrix Putty Allograft in Periodontal Intrabony Defects.

 Twenty-two patients suffering from advanced chronic periodontitis were included in this randomized controlled clinical trial.

 Each subject contributed had two- or three-walled intrabony defects.

 Patients were randomly assigned into two groups; bioresorbable membrane or bone allograft.

 Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively.

 Radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline and at 6 months postoperatively.
