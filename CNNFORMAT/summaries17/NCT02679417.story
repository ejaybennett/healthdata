(thirdQuint)The Effects of Type of Exercise in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.

 Increasing prevalence of overweight and obese worldwide, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is commonly diagnosed in daily clinical practice.

 Weight reduction has been the only strategy established thus far to reduce hepatic lipid levels.

 Thus, dietary restriction and exercise focusing on weight reduction is recommended as the cornerstone for managing NAFLD.

 Recent reports have indicated that increased exercise greatly reduces hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation and the related oxidative stress levels outweigh those achieved by dietary restriction alone.

 Clear guidelines for such a "lifestyle physical activity" for NAFLD management are currently lacking.

 The type of physical activity such as, aerobic or resistant exercise required to reduce liver fat content remains unclear.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether aerobic exercise should provide improvement of hepatic fat content and inflammation as well as metabolic profiles and anthropometric parameters better than resistant exercise.
