(thirdQuint)Ultra-long Acting Bronchodilator Therapy in Smoking Asthmatics.

 Cigarette smoking in asthma is associated with poorer asthma control and a higher frequency of asthma attacks.

 Despite this, smoking cessation rates are very low due to the highly addictive nature of tobacco smoking.

 Asthma in smokers is particularly challenging to manage because it is resistant to the beneficial effects of inhaled corticosteroids, the main treatment for asthma.

 Unfortunately, there is no guideline consensus regarding how to best manage asthmatics who smoke.

 Research studies in asthma tend to exclude smokers because of concerns about recruiting patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

 Hence, there is an unmet need for research studies in asthmatics who are unable to stop smoking.

 In view of the above, we propose to assess the effects of two different types of bronchodilators (inhalers which help open up the airways), in asthmatics who continue to smoke.

 Participants will receive both of the following drugs for 2-4 weeks in random order, with a 2-3 week washout period in between: Olodaterol which is a new long-acting bronchodilator.

 Olodaterol combined with tiotropium (dual bronchodilators).

 We wish to compare these inhalers using a sensitive pulmonary function test called impulse oscillometry.

Single centre, open-label, random order, cross-over trial, recruited over a period of approximately 2 years.

 Sufficient participants enrolled to complete 16 adults.

 Withdrawn subjects may be replaced.

 This clinical trial will assess the effects of ultra-long acting bronchodilator therapy in smoking asthmatics taking inhaled corticosteroids.

 This will be via a pulmonary function test called impulse oscillometry.
