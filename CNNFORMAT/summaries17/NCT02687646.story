(secondQuint)Clinical Trial With MSC for Graft Versus Host Disease Treatment.

 Multicenter, open, non -controlled clinical trial.

 It is a phase I-II trial to assess the safety and efficacy of sequential infusion of allogeneic MSCs from adipose tissue, expanded "in vitro" platelet lysate in the treatment of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell trasplantation, who have developed a refractory graft versus host disease to first line of treatment.

 This is a prospective, multicenter, open to patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation in Spanish hospitals, with one cohort of patients who receive four sequential doses of MSC.

 Clinical Trial With MSC for Graft Versus Host Disease Treatment@highlight

Sequential administration of MSCs obtained from adipose tissue is an effective and safe treatment for acute graft versus host disease refractory to first-line treatment.

 Furthermore the infusion of these cells produces a biological pattern in patients that relates to the clinical response.
