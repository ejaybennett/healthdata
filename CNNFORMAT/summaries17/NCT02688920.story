(firstQuint)Intraluminal Imaging of Duodenal Layer Morphometry in Patients With and Without Type 2 Diabetes.

 Study Objectives 1.

 To assess duodenal layer (mucosa, submucosa and muscularis) thickness differences between patients with and without type 2 diabetes using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT).

 2.

 To assess duodenal layer thickness differences between patients with type 2 diabetes.

 3.

 To assess duodenal layer thickness differences as a function of measurement location along the length of the duodenum.

 4.

 To compare measurements obtained by endoscopic ultrasound, to those obtained by optical coherence tomography.

 Intraluminal Imaging of Duodenal Layer Morphometry in Patients With and Without Type 2 Diabetes@highlight

This observational study is conducted to determine how the duodenal layer thicknesses (mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis) vary with several factors in patients with and without type 2 diabetes.
