(fifthQuint)Peer Mentoring in Promoting Follow-up Care Self-Management in Younger Childhood Cancer Survivors.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Adapt problem-solving skills training (PSST) with peer mentoring to improve adolescent and young adult (AYA) self-management of long-term follow-up care.

 II.

 Evaluate the feasibility of the self-management + peer mentoring program in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT).

 III.

 Assess preliminary efficacy of the peer mentoring program vs.

 widely available print brochure.

 OUTLINE: PHASE 1: Participants (providers, survivors, and caregivers) complete a 60 minute interview to help adapt PSST to focus on AYA self-management of care.

 PHASE 2: Patients are randomized to 1of 2 arms.

 ARM I: Patients complete the adapted PSST peer mentoring intervention comprising a videoconference or phone call with the peer mentor followed by secure text messaging weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly for 2 months.

 ARM II: Patients receive tailored survivorship educational materials from the Children's Oncology Group patient education "Health Links" as well as a brochure with self-management strategies entitled: "Moving Into Adult Health Care: A Guide for Young Adults With and Without Disabilities" via email or postal mail.

 Patients also receive general health tips (e.

g.

, exercise and nutrition recommendations) via text message weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly for 2 months.

 Peer Mentoring in Promoting Follow-up Care Self-Management in Younger Childhood Cancer Survivors@highlight

This partially randomized pilot trial studies peer mentoring to see how well it works in promoting follow-up care self-management in younger childhood cancer survivors.

 Childhood cancer survivors require lifelong follow-up care to identify, monitor, and treat medical and psychosocial late effects stemming from their cancer, its treatment, and lifestyle factors.

 A peer mentoring program may improve disease knowledge, health motivation, problem-solving skills, stress management, and communication with caregivers and providers in adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.
