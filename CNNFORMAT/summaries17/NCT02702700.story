(fifthQuint)Photo-induction as a Means to Improve Cisplatin Delivery to Pleural Malignancies.

 The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of intrapleural Visudyne(R)-mediated photo-induction as a means to selectively increase tumor uptake of systemically administered Lipoplatin cent in patients with primary or secondary pleural malignancies.

 The secondary objectives are: Assessment of treatment efficacy as measured by dyspnea reduction, pleural effusion free survival as well as local relapse rate, progression free and median overall survival.

 Analysis of the pleural intratumor penetration of Lipoplatin cent by repeated biopsies for Lipoplatin concentration measurements before and after Visudyne(R) treatment as well as vessel modulation related parameters (pericyte coverage, vessels morphology).

 Photo-induction as a Means to Improve Cisplatin Delivery to Pleural Malignancies@highlight

This clinical study aims to explore intrapleural low-dose Visudyne(R)-mediated photodynamic therapy (photo-induction) as a pathway to promote the uptake of systemically administered Lipoplatin cent in pleural malignancies of patients undergoing video-assisted talcage for their malignant pleural effusions.

 Photo-induction is expected to overcome the chemo-resistance of pleural malignancies for cisplatin-based chemotherapeutics and thereby improve local tumor control.
