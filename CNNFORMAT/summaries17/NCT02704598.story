(secondQuint)Comparison Between Xarelto Versus Warfarin in the Recanalization Rate of Deep Venous Thrombosis in Patients Legs.

.

 In this study the patients with lower limbs deep venous thrombosis are assigned and randomized in two groups: Group 1 - Patients are submitted to oral anticoagulation with Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) for at least 6 months.

 Group 2 - Patients are undergoing oral anticoagulation with Warfarin for 6 months.

 These two drugs are approved by FDA in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis.

 The primary outcome is to assign the recanalization rate of the veins in the two groups, using Duplex ultrasound.

 The patients are also evaluated within symptoms, clinical signs, such as edema, limb swelling, pain, return to habitual activities.

 Inclusion criteria: deep venous thrombosis in patients that does not have other important diseases, such as cancer, thrombophilic states, until the age of 80.

 Exclusion criteria: cancer, thrombophilic states, mental disorders, age superior 80 years, contraindication to oral anticoagulation.

 The primary outcome is within 1 year after the Deep venous thrombosis.

@highlight

This is a prospective, randomized study, aiming to evaluate patients with Deep Venous Thrombosis in lower limbs and the recanalization rates evaluated with DUPLEX ultrasound, as so the clinical outcomes in patients submitted to oral anticoagulation with Rivaroxaban versus Warfarin.
