(fifthQuint)Comparing Pregnancy Outcomes in Good Prognosis Patients Between Fresh and 'Freeze-All' Single Blastocyst Transfers.

 This will be a randomized controlled trial involving good prognosis infertility patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) +/- intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

 Good prognosis is defined as: age 12, antimullerian hormone (AMH) > 15 pmol/L, cycle day 3 follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 2000 pmol/L, lead follicle > 14 mm in diameter, and will be continued until time of hCG trigger.

 Timing of hCG (5000-10,000 IU) administration will occur once at least three lead follicles have diameters > 17 mm.

 Oocyte retrieval will be performed 36 hours after hCG administration.

 Fertilization will utilize either routine IVF or ICSI, depending upon the etiology of infertility and the quality of sperm.

 With ICSI, only mature oocytes will be inseminated.

 Embryo evaluation will occur per the clinic's standard protocols.

 Embryo assessment on day 5 post-fertilization will dictate final eligibility for study enrollment.

 Consenting participants with 3 or more cryopreservation-quality blastocysts (2BB or higher, graded according to Gardner's criteria) will then be randomized to either fresh single embryo transfer (SET) (and cryopreservation of all good quality supernumerary blastocysts) or a single frozen embryo transfer (FET) delayed to the subsequent menstrual cycle following cryopreservation of all of the good quality blastocysts.

 All FET cycles will be performed under a standard endometrial preparation protocol involving vaginal estradiol administration for approximately 14 days.

 Luteal support in either fresh or FET cycles will be with vaginal micronized progesterone, 200 mg vaginally 2-3 times daily, starting the day following fresh ET, and 6 days prior to FET, once documented endometrial thickness of 8 mm or more is achieved.

 The best quality blastocyst will be transferred first.

 Should the best blastocyst not survive warming in the FET group, the second-best blastocyst will be used.

 All cryopreservation will be performed by vitrification.

 Luteal phase progesterone will continue until either 10 weeks gestation (in an ongoing pregnancy) or until a documented negative serum hCG level drawn 14 days after the date of embryo transfer.

 With a documented positive hCG serum level, the participant will undergo a transvaginal ultrasound at 7 weeks gestation to document number of gestational sacs (implantation) and clinical pregnancy rate (positive fetal heart beat).

 Confirmation of ongoing pregnancy (beyond 12 weeks gestation) will be obtained by review of hospital records for ultrasounds performed for nuchal translucency measurements or anatomic assessment.

 Randomization at the blastocyst stage is chosen to avoid cycle cancellation if randomized earlier.

 All participants will be randomized by an intention to treat approach.

 All other components of the IVF/ICSI cycle including stimulation medications, monitoring protocols, etc.

 will be at the discretion of the participant's primary IVF physician; while this information will be documented it will not constitute criteria for enrollment.

 Each successive enrolled participant to be randomized will choose a sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelope and be assigned to either the freeze-all or fresh transfer groups, based upon the envelope contents derived using computer generated block randomization, utilizing random block sizes of 4 and 6 participants, with a 1:1 allocation.

 The envelop contents will be provided by an independent individual not involved in study recruitment or clinical care of the participants.

 Comparing Pregnancy Outcomes in Good Prognosis Patients Between Fresh and 'Freeze-All' Single Blastocyst Transfers@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether the chances of becoming pregnant are better when day the single best day 5 embryo (blastocyst) resulting from an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle is transferred into the uterus immediately, or after freezing the embryo and transferring it into the uterus in a subsequent cycle, separate from the ovarian stimulation used in the IVF cycle.

 The investigators hypothesize that in good-prognosis patients, vitrified-warmed elective single embryo transfer will result in higher implantation, clinical and on-going pregnancy and live birth rates than fresh elective single embryo transfer at the blastocyst stage.
