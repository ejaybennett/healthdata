(secondQuint)Modulation of H-reflex After Application of Electric Currents in Healthy People.

 In the last years several experimental studies have evidenced that the transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) in peripheric application can cause a decrease of spasticity and modulation of H-reflexes.

 But if the application is in the central nervous system the results are different.

 So the purpose of this study is quantify the modulation of the excitability of alpha moto neurone when the application of the current is in the central nervous system compared with a sham group.

 Modulation of H-reflex After Application of Electric Currents in Healthy People@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determinate whether the application of electric currents produce changes in the excitability of alpha moto neurone.

 Moreover evidence whether the effect of the electric currents can change the tone of the muscle under stimulation in healthy volunteers
