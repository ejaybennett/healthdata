(fifthQuint)MDSC Clinical Assay in Finding and Monitoring Cancer Cells in Blood and Urine Samples From Patients With or Without Localized or Metastatic Bladder Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate a novel clinical assay (MDSC clinical assay) to detect cancer associated immune cells in the peripheral blood of patients as a means to better detect and monitor malignant bladder cancer in patients.

 II.

 Estimate mean MDSC level, intra-patient variability, and inter-patient variability, for 3 groups of subjects with variable bladder cancer disease status at baseline.

 III.

 In patients with known localized, muscle-invasive bladder cancer who undergo surgical treatment: to determine the change in MDSC level from baseline to after treatment including surgery.

 IV.

 In patients with known metastatic bladder cancer who undergo systemic treatment: to determine the change in MDSC level from baseline to after 4 cycles of treatment compared to the change in tumor burden as evaluated by radiographic imaging.

 V.

 In patients with no history of cancer: to determine the changes in MDSC levels from baseline to after 4 months.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Compare MDSC level measurements to urine cytology analysis at baseline and after treatment to determine whether the two tests correlate in any of the 3 groups of patients defined in this study.

 OUTLINE: GROUP I: Patients without cancer undergo collection of blood and urine samples for analysis via MDSC clinical assay at baseline, 1 week, and 4 months.

 GROUP II: Patients with localized bladder cancer undergo collection of blood and urine samples for analysis via MDSC clinical assay at baseline, 1 week, and within 4 weeks after cystectomy.

 GROUP III: Patients with metastatic cancer undergo collection of blood and urine samples for analysis via MDSC clinical assay at baseline, 1 week, and within 4 weeks after completion of 4 courses of systemic chemotherapy.

 MDSC Clinical Assay in Finding and Monitoring Cancer Cells in Blood and Urine Samples From Patients With or Without Localized or Metastatic Bladder Cancer@highlight

This pilot research trial studies how well myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) clinical assay works in finding and monitoring cancer cells in blood and urine samples from patients with or without localized or metastatic bladder cancer.

 Studying samples of blood and urine from patients with or without bladder cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer and may help doctors improve ways to diagnose and treat patients.
