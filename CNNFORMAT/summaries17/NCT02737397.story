(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy of a Combination Product for the Prevention of Veisalgia.

 Some people who consume alcohol in moderation experience veisalgia.

 These symptoms include a long list of adverse effects that include headache, fatigue and thirst.

 The mechanism by which these effects occur has not been fully elucidated.

 Although, it has been documented that alcohol causes the release of a large number of substances into the blood stream that cause a number of physiologic changes.
