(thirdQuint)Effect of the Pelvic Loin Musculature Training on the Dynamic Hip Stabilization.

 This study aims to determine the effect of a stability program target, with the training of the MLP region on pelvic stability.

 Materials and Methods: We recruited 20 volunteers of both sexes were randomly divided into control group (CG) and training group (TG).

 The evaluations were performed before and after training the MLP.

 The training was held four isometrics series with a time of 30 seconds with 30 seconds rest in between reps during 10 sessions distributed twice weekly.

 Effect of the Pelvic Loin Musculature Training on the Dynamic Hip Stabilization@highlight

Introduction: The stability of the pelvis is of great importance in body balance as a whole, can be improved by training the pelvic muscles fillet (MLP), which is characterized by low intensity isometric synchronous and the deep muscles of the trunk.

 This study aims to determine the effect of a stability program target, with the training of the MLP region on pelvic stability.
