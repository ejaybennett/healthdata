(thirdQuint)Pilot Study of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS).

 Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been demonstrated to: 1.

 successfully treat fatigue in adults with MS, and 2.

 improve learning ability and other aspects of cognitive functioning in healthy controls and in participants with a range of medical disorders.

 Cognitive impairment in MS remains a major treatment challenge and a trial of tDCS combined with a cognitive training program to treat MS-related cognitive impairment is warranted.

 However, one barrier for the study of tDCS has been the need for the participant to travel to the study site for each tDCS administration.

 To address this issue, the biomedical company Soterix, has recently designed a remote-delivery tDCS device designed for use in clinical trials.

 Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to establish a protocol for remotely-supervised in-home tDCS delivery for studies with MS participants.

 Established safety and feasibility of remotely-supervised tDCS delivery will facilitate the next steps of larger controlled trials, in both MS as well as other conditions, to determine efficacy and appropriate real-world use.

 Pilot Study of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)@highlight

This study will test the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with a cognitive training program, remotely-delivered using a telemedicine protocol in 60 adults with multiple sclerosis (MS).

 The study will evaluate the efficacy of tDCS to evaluate two of the most debilitating symptoms of MS: cognitive impairment and fatigue.
