(thirdQuint)Phase Ib Study to Evaluate PRS-080 in Anemic Chronic Kidney Disease Patients.

 This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose phase Ib study in anemic stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients requiring hemodialysis.

 Eligible subjects will undergo screening assessments and PRS-080#22-DP will be administered by intravenous infusion.

 The study will consist of 3 dose cohorts of 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, and 8 mg/kg body weight with 8 subjects in each cohort.

 Using a standard 6+2 design, 6 subjects in each cohort will be randomized to PRS-080#022-DP and 2 subjects in each cohort will be randomized to placebo.

 The decision to escalate the dose will be based on an interim analysis of clinical safety and safety laboratory data.

 Safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics as well as potential immunogenicity will be investigated.

 Phase Ib Study to Evaluate PRS-080 in Anemic Chronic Kidney Disease Patients@highlight

Anticalins(R) are engineered human proteins that are able to bind specific target molecules.

 The Anticalin PRS-080#022-DP to be investigated in this study is directed against hepcidin and is intended for the treatment of anemia of chronic disease.

 This Phase Ib study shall investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single administration of PRS-080#022-DP in anemic stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients undergoing hemodialysis.
