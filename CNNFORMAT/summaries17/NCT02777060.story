(thirdQuint)Exploring the Effectiveness of Sensor-based Balance Training on Patient Outcome Measures.

 Individuals suffering from certain disorders/diseases including diabetes, arthritis, cancer, osteoarthritis, stroke, Parkinson's disease, cognitive impairment or brain Injury are more likely to experience a fall or a fall-related injury than healthy individuals during to impaired postural stability or diminished joint perception.

 Under certain circumstance they may also experience pain, depression, anxiety, and a decreased quality of life.

 The investigators' research has been designed to provide exercise training using non-invasive body-worn sensors (similar to those used in an iPhone(R)) to provide real-time visual information about joint motion in a virtual environment.

 These sensors will be worn using a vest, t-shirt or elastic band.

 The investigators will, 1) assess changes in participant's perception of lower extremity position while they perform these exercises; 2) motivate and guide simple exercise performance in the clinic/home, using an interactive game-like scheme; and 3) assess changes in participant's postural stability and gait as a result of provided exercise training.

 The information gathered will provide new understanding about more helpful rehabilitation strategies that improve postural stability in patient population.

 Exploring the Effectiveness of Sensor-based Balance Training on Patient Outcome Measures@highlight

Explore the benefit of the game-based virtual reality system in improving lower extremity kinematics and balance in patients suffering from disease/disorders including Diabetes, Cancer, Multiple Sclerosis, Arthritis, Parkinson's disease, Cognitive Disorders, Brain Injury, Stroke or Frailty.

 A four to six weeks of training with 2 training session/week will be provided.
