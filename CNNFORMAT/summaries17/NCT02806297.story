(firstQuint)Trial of the Effect of Timing of Cholecystectomy During Initial Admission for Mild Gallstone Pancreatitis.

 The purpose of this study is to perform a single-center randomized trial to compare laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) within 24 hours of presentation versus after clinical resolution during index admission for mild gallstone pancreatitis on clinical and patient-reported outcomes.

 Additionally, this study aims to determine patients' values and preferences that influence decision-making regarding treatment options for gallstone pancreatitis.

 Hypothesis: During index admission for mild gallstone pancreatitis, early cholecystectomy within 24 hours of presentation regardless of symptoms or laboratory values versus after clinical resolution results in a shorter 30-day total hospital length of stay.
