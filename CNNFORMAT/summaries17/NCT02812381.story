(fifthQuint)Efficacy of Neuromuscular Bandage Technique Against Jones Technique After the Supraespinatus Muscle Tendon Suture.

 Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of the KT technique against Jones (Strain-Counterstrain or SCS) technique in patients with the suture of the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle.

 Design: Test clinically controlled, randomized, masking of intervention by double placebo and blind to the subject of the essay and the Studio analyst.

 METHOD: Patients with supraspinatus tendon suture are randomly divided into two groups: a group treated with KT (n = 18) and other treated with SCS (n = 18).

 The treatment was applied the 1st, 4th and 8th day of physical therapy session.

 All patients were evaluated the 1st and the 12th day of the session with the visual analog scale of pain (VAS), with the scale of Disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) to assess the functionality and active direction-finding (ROM) to assess travel articulate.

The suture of the supraspinatus tendon is a common surgery that requires physical therapy for back pain and functional impairment to such surgery.

 Kinesiotaping technique (KT) is being used to treat myofascial trigger points that appear after surgery and for the treatment of physiotherapy in the supraspinatus muscle and deltoid.

 To evaluate the effectiveness of KT technique over the technique of Jones (Straincounterstrain or SCS) in patients undergoing suture the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle.
