(thirdQuint)Atrial Fibrillation and Characterization of Blood Platelet.

 AF is associated with decreased quality of life and an increased risk of thromboembolic events.

 AF is the leading cause of embolic stroke.

 Identification of factors that may influence blood coagulability in these patients could better identify therapeutic targets to optimize anticoagulation.

 Platelets play a major role in the coagulation process, their study may provide valuable information.

 Moreover microparticles from platelet activation are known to have pathophysiological effects including effects on thrombosis and inhibition of fibrinolysis.

 It has also been shown that the microparticles have a role in endothelial dysfunction and generation of inflammatory condition which are associated with atrial fibrillation.

 Investigators propose in this project, a comparative study between AF patients and healthy volunteers.

 Complete characterization of platelet (morphology, platelet function, platelet proteome) and microparticles levels will be perform.

 Different site blood sampling (systemic or cardiac) will be done in patients during their ablation procedure.

 Patients will be followed during their hospitalisation.

 Atrial Fibrillation and Characterization of Blood Platelet@highlight

Arterial thromboembolism constitutes a major risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) requiring antithrombotic therapy.

 Platelets and microparticles (MPs) are important for hemostasis and thrombosis, their role during AF is not well known.

 The principal objective of this study is to compare morphologic, functional and proteomics characteristics of blood platelet between AF patients and healthy volunteers.
