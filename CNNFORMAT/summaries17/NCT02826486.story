(firstQuint)Study Assessing Safety and Efficacy of Combination of BL-8040 and Pembrolizumab in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients (COMBAT/KEYNOTE-202).

 This will be an open-label, single arm, phase IIa study in subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

 The study will include 30 subjects with unresectable metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

 The study consists of two periods: - Monotherapy period: One week, with BL-8040 administered daily on days 1-5.

 - Combination therapy: Three week cycles of a combination of BL-8040 administered three times a week (TIW) and pembrolizumab administered once every three weeks.

 Subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be enrolled and receive BL-8040 monotherapy for five days followed by a combination treatment of BL-8040 and pembrolizumab.

 During the monotherapy period, eligible subjects will receive daily subcutaneous (SC) injections of BL-8040 (1.

25 mg/kg) on days 1 - 5.

 From Day 8 subjects will begin a combination period consisting of treatment with SC BL-8040 (1.

25 mg/kg) three times a week (TIW) and pembrolizumab (200mg) once every three weeks.

 The combination therapy will continue for up to two years, or until progression, clinical deterioration or early termination, whichever comes first.
