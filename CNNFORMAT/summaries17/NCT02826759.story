(fifthQuint)Serum Sphingolipidomic Analyses in Healthy, Diabetic and Prediabetic Subjects.

 The first purpose of this study is to determine whether serum sphingolipid metabolites associate significantly with the weight among type 2 diabetes.

 60 patients with diagnosed type 2 diabetes will be recruited.

 The serum concentrations of sphingolipid metabolites of 20 type 2 diabetic patients with obesity will be compared to age- and sex-matched series of 40 type 2 patients without obesity.

 The second purpose of this study is to determine whether serum sphingolipid metabolites associate significantly with the process and severity of type 2 diabetes.

 The serum concentrations of sphingolipid metabolites of 20 subjects with type 2 diabetes will be compared to age-, sex- and BMI-matched series of healthy and pre-diabetic subjects.

 Investigators speculate that the serum concentration of sphingolipid metabolites are positively related with the progression of diabetes.

 In order to discover why serum sphingolipid metabolites correlates with the progression of diabetes, detailed information on HbA1c, duration of diabetes history and insulin resistance defined by homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) will be analysed.

 These three parameters may affect the serum concentrations of sphingolipid metabolites.

 Serum Sphingolipidomic Analyses in Healthy, Diabetic and Prediabetic Subjects@highlight

This study is designed to compare the serum sphingolipidomic analyses in healthy, pre-diabetic and diabetic subjects.

 age, sex and BMI are matched among these three groups.

 As ceramide, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate and sphinganine are involved in inflammation, immunity and cancer, investigators proposed a hypothesis that sphingosine-1-phosphate and other sphingolipids may be associated with the progress of type 2 diabetes.

 sphingolipids may be a biomarker for diabetes.
