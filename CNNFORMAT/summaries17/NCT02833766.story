(thirdQuint)Anti-EGFR-immunoliposomes Loaded With Doxorubicin in Patients With Advanced Triple Negative EGFR Positive Breast Cancer.

 Advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly chemosensitive disease displaying a dismal short-term prognosis with more than three quarters of patients in progression 12 months after the initiation of conventional chemotherapy.

 Approximately 2/3 of TNBC are expressing EGFR and breast cancer, including TNBC, is a disease highly sensitive to anthracyclines.

 Furthermore, data from a phase I trial, in 26 patients with different solid tumors, show very little toxicity and signs of efficacy of anti-EGFR-IL-dox.

 The EGFR assessment will be performed centrally and only patients with EGFR positive tumors will be included.

 The patients will be treated with the anti-EGFR-IL-dox until progression and followed-up according to standard practice for patient with TNBC.

The main objective of the trial is to determine the efficacy of doxorubicin-loaded anti-EGFR immunoliposomes as first-line therapy in patients with advanced triple Negative, EGFR positive breast cancer.

 In this proof of concept trial, all patients will have an administration of the doxorubicin-loaded anti-EGFR immunoliposomes (anti-EGFR-IL-dox) every 28 days, until progression or unacceptable toxicity.
