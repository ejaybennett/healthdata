(fifthQuint)Effects of Diet on Brain Processing.

 Specific Aims: In medically stable, older (> 50 years) HIV patients with cognitive impairment, this study will: Overall: Test the feasibility of recruitment, retention, and adherence to a ketogenic diet versus patient choice diet (PCD) intervention.

 Primary: Compare the impact of a 12-week KD versus PCD on: 1.

 Cognitive function (at 12 weeks).

 2.

 Inflammation (at 12 weeks).

 3.

 Cardiometabolic profile (at 12 weeks).

 4.

 Persistence of cognitive effects (at 18 weeks).

 Secondary: In a subsample (n = 5; experimental group): 5.

 Examine the changes in neural activity and neurocognitive functioning as demonstrated via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), after a 12 week KD diet.

 6.

 Assess the level of agreement between NIH Neurocognitive Tests and MRI in the assessment of neurocognitive functioning.

 INNOVATION: Brain metabolism regulation and reduced neural inflammation via dietary approaches have only recently been explored in the treatment/management of progressive cognitive disorders in humans.

 Preliminary results in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients suggest that the use of ketones for brain fuel improves brain metabolism and cerebral perfusion as well as reduces accumulation of harmful brain proteins20 To date, the effects of a KD in cognitively impaired older HIV patients have not been explored.

 In addition, this study proposes the use of MRI testing to examine the longitudinal, physiologic changes in the brain of cognitively impaired, older HIV patients consuming a KD for 12 weeks.

 Moreover, this study will utilize the new FDA-approved Magnetom Prisma 3T MRI system to better visualize small-scale neural brain abnormalities.

 Research Design and Methods Design/Setting: Using an experimental design, a total of 20 older (> 50 years), stable HIV participants (CD4+ lymphocyte count > 350 cells/mm3 for at least two years and prescribed their current cART regimen for at least six months) with self-identified "forgetfulness" and demonstrate cognitive impairment (score 3 drinks/day), past medical history of mental disorders (i.

e.

, schizophrenia, bipolar), neural injury (i.

e.

, cerebral vascular accident or traumatic brain injury), dementia, Parkinson's, diabetes mellitus, hearing impaired, or any other condition that contraindicates participation.

 Due to the inconclusive evidence regarding the influence of statin drugs on cognition, statin use will not be exclusionary.

 Recruitment: Fliers that provide basic study and PI contact information will be posted in the lobby/exam rooms of the 1917 Clinic.

 A telephone screening interview will be completed for all interested individuals.

 During the screening, cognitive impairment will be determined via administration of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Assessment-Modified (TICS-M).

 TICS-M is a 13-item tool for assessment of cognitive function in older adults.

 A score cell responsiveness will be derived via OGTT at baseline/week 12.

 Analysis of Glucose, C-peptide, and Insulin: Concentrations of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide will be analyzed in the UAB Diabetes Research Center (Core Director: B.

 Gower, Primary Mentor).

 Glucose will be measured in 3 mu L sera using the Glucose oxidase method on a Stanbio Sirrus analyzer (Stanbio Laboratory, Boerne, TX).

 Insulin will be assayed in 50- mu L aliquots using immunofluorescence on a TOSOH AIA-II analyzer (TOSOH Corp, S.

 San Francisco, CA).

 C-peptide will be assayed in 20- mu L aliquots using the TOSOH analyzer.

 Lipids: Total, high density cholesterol (HDL) and triglycerides will be measured using SIRRUS analyzer (Stanbio Laboratory, Boerne, TX); low density lipoprotein will be calculated using the method of Friedewald.

 Inflammation Markers: Assessed by immunoassay in fasting morning sera before and after the intervention.

 High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) will be assessed by turbidometric methods by using a SIRRUS analyzer (Stanbio Laboratory), with reagents obtained from Pointe Scientific, and TNF-a and IFNy, IL-1B, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12p70 by using electrochemiluminscence (Meso Scale Discovery).

 Urine Ketones: Presence of acetoacetic acid (ketones) assessed via Precision XTRA Ketone Monitoring System.

 All participants will monitor capillary glucose daily for first two weeks and then weekly.

 Results will be documented on log sheet and returned to study staff.

 Participants will be contacted via telephone on weeks 4 and 8 to remind of ketone log submission.

 Procedures: Eligible participants will be randomized to either the experimental (n = 10) or control group (n = 10) and scheduled for baseline data collection.

 Laboratory, demographic, and anthropometric assessments will be completed UAB's Clinical Research Unit (CRU).

 Baseline data will include: demographic questionnaire, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), inflammatory assays and lipid panel as well as an anthropometric evaluation.

 In addition, participants will be provided training related to the assessment of urine ketones, including a visual aid/handout that displays the color rubric and corresponding numeric value.

 Even though all snacks and meals for the KD group will be provided, experimental group participants will receive nutritional counseling related to the KD and provided with handouts that highlight important components of a KD so that participants can remain adherent to the intervention even if eating in a restaurant or in other social settings.

 After completion of the aforementioned items, participants will be escorted to the UAB Hospital cafeteria and provided a voucher for breakfast prior to completion of cognition assessments.

 After breakfast completion, participants will return to the CRU for completion of the cognitive battery in a private conference room.

 Completion of the questionnaires will be completed on a laptop computer that is secured by PGP Whole Disk Encryption(R) software to ensure participant confidentiality/privacy.

 After completion of the cognitive battery, individuals randomized to the experimental group and willing/eligible to undergo MRI testing, will be escorted to the UAB Highlands radiology department.

 Delivery of meals/snacks (week 1) will begin the week following baseline data collection.

 Bi-weekly phone conferences will be conducted with all participants to maintain participant contact as well as to assess for intervention adherence, challenges, and answer questions.

 In addition, all participants will complete a urine ketone assessment on weeks 4 and 8 and report those findings during conference calls.

 Note: Participants prescribed medications known to cause abnormal urine color (i.

e.

, azo dyes, nitrofurantoin, and riboflavin) or affect the results (levodopa, hydrozyqinaline, methyldopa/captopril) or who report difficulty distinguishing differences between colors will return to UAB's CRU for serum ketone analysis at weeks 4 and 8.

 In addition, a survey will be administered to the KD group to determine what participants liked and did not like about the diet (week 12).

 All participants will be compensated for their time as follows: 1) Baseline and post intervention (wk 12) laboratory and cognitive assessments, $50/visit (N = 20); 2) MRI completion (n = 5), $50/scan; 3) Ketone assessment (wks 4 and 8, n = 20), $10 each; and 4) Six-week post intervention cognitive assessment (wk 18), (N = 20), $25.

 Dietary Intervention: KD: Meals/snacks will be provided/prepared by the UAB Clinical Research Unit's Bionutrition Department, a unit that employs two Dietitians who are all registered through the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and licensed in their perspective states.

 Food will be delivered weekly via a courier in appropriate food transportation coolers.

 The UAB Bionutrition Department is has a wealth of experience in research feeding study implementation including studies requiring specialized meal plans.

 Meals will be matched for energy content to maintain current energy balance and consist of 50 years.

 Next steps: An important reason for conducting this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and determine initial data for the primary outcomes, in order to perform a sample size calculation for a larger trial.

 The mean and the standard error of the difference between the changes of KD group and PCD group will be used for the sample size calculation to reach an 80% power.

 In addition, the study protocol, data collection questionnaires, randomization procedure, recruitment and consent, and acceptability of intervention will be evaluated.

 Findings and the tested/improved protocol of this study will support an R21/R01 mechanism (i.

e.

, PAR-15-280/PAR-15-282: Multidisciplinary Studies of HIV and Aging) that will include and expand upon following specific aim and hypotheses: Specific aim: Compare the cognitive, cardiometabolic, and neural structural effects of a KD versus PCD in medically stable, older (> 50 years) HIV patients with cognitive impairment.

 It is postulated that, in comparison to the control group, older (aged > 50 years) HIV positive, cognitively impaired individuals randomized to the KD will demonstrate the following: Hypothesis 1: Improved cognition.

 Hypothesis 2: Decreased insulin, glucose, and systemic inflammation as well as improved insulin sensitivity.

 Hypothesis 3: Heightened neural activity as observed by MRI.
