(fifthQuint)Prospective Validation of the ROX Index.

 This is a second part of the initial study PF(AG)101/2011 where the investigators created the ROX index to predict the need of failure with HFNC treatment in patients with ARF secondary to pneumonia, and the investigators want to validate ROX index with this second prospective cohort results.

 The recruitment period is over.

 One hundred ninety one patients treated with HFNC in the valitaditon cohort were included.

 ROX index > or equal to 4.

88 measured at 2, 6 or 12 hours afther HFNC initiation was consistently associated with a lower risk of MV.

 CART analysis provided a simple algorithm to discriminate high-intermediate-low risk groups.

 ROX index has, therefore, been validated to classify risk patients with ARF secondary to pneumonia treated with HFNC according to their risk for intubationl.

 Prospective Validation of the ROX Index@highlight

Multicentric cohort study recruiting patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory failure (ARF) and receiving treatment with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC).

 This is a second part of the initial study PF(AG)101/2011 where the investigators created the ROX index to predict the need of failure with HFNC treatment in patients with ARF secondary to pneumonia, and the investigators want to validate ROX index with this second prospective cohort results.
