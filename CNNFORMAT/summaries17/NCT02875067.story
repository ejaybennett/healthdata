(firstQuint)Safety & Efficacy Study of Combination of Pembrolizumab and Lenalidomide, in Patients With Relapsed Non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin Lymphoma.

 There is an emerging clinical data to confirm that Programmed death-1 (PD-1)blockade is safe and viable in lymphoma.

 The investigators hypothesize that the novel immune platform of pembrolizumab and lenalidomide, will be safe and well tolerated in patients with Relapsed Refractory (RR) Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and that this combination will result in a complete response (CR) rate of 50% in patients with RR HL.
