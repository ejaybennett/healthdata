(fifthQuint)Cohort Study on A Following-up System of Native Arteriovenous Fistulae.

 The Following-up System of AVF includes 3 stages.

 In the 1st stage, before AVF surgery operation, the contents of Following-up System of AVF include history, physical exam, ultrasonography detection.

 The assesment results will guide the methods of the AVF surgery operation.

 In the 2nd stage, before AVF puncture firstly and 3 months after AVF operation, the contents of Following-up System of AVF include physical exam and ultrasonography detection.

 The results will help the nurses and doctors make a decision of the method of AVF puncture.

 In the 3rd stage, during the following 2 years after AVF puncture successfully, the contents include physical exam and ultrasonography detection regularly.

 The adequacy of hemodialysis by using AVF will be assessed by urea clearance index (Kt/V).

 The data of patients in other hemodialysis centers will be recorded and compared to the patients in experiment group.

 Cohort Study on A Following-up System of Native Arteriovenous Fistulae@highlight

A cohort including more than 100 maintenance hemodialysis patients will be followed up according to a certain Following-up System of Native Arteriovenous Fistulae (AVF) prospectively.

 The assessment results of the Following-up System of AVF help the physicians make decisions of AVF surgery and puncture methods.

 The results of this study would identify the effect of the system on survival of AVF.

 Other 100 hemodialysis patients from other centers will be treated by routine protocol and compared to the experiment goup.
