(secondQuint)A Phase 2 Trial of High-dose Ascorbate for Pancreatic Cancer (PACMAN 2.

1).

 One of the standard treatments for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma is nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine.

 This standard therapy administers chemotherapy once per week for three weeks; patients then get a 'rest week' to complete the cycle (1 cycle = 4 weeks).

 This study adds 75 grams of ascorbate (vitamin C, sometimes called pharamcological ascorbate because the dose is so high) to standard therapy.

 The ascorbate is administered intravenously - through a vein in the arm.

 Participants will: - receive 75 grams of ascorbate 3 times per calendar week for each week of the chemotherapy cycle.

 - undergo imaging which is standard for their cancer and therapy.

 This can include CT scans, PET scans, and X-rays - provide blood samples to determine the biological effects, if any, the ascorbate has on the body during therapy.

 This active therapy portion lasts until the disease progresses and a new treatment needs to be adopted - this can be months to years.

 If disease progresses, participants go back to standard follow-up for their caner and the new/additional therapy their doctors prescribe.

 However, it is very important we remain in contact with participants; they will have life-long follow-up for this study.

 A Phase 2 Trial of High-dose Ascorbate for Pancreatic Cancer (PACMAN 2.

1)@highlight

This clinical trial adds high-dose ascorbate (vitamin C) to the standard of care regimen for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (a type of pancreatic cancer).

 All subjects receive high-dose ascorbate in addition to the standard treatment.
