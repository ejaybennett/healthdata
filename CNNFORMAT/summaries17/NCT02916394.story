(firstQuint)In Vivo IGF-1R Molecular Imaging Using [68Ga]- Labelling Anti-IGF-1R Affibody Molecule.

 The goals of investigators are to evaluate the use of [68Ga]-labelling Anti-IGF-1R Affibody Molecule as a novel PET/CT radiotracer to monitor IGF-1R expression status.

 The investigators want to evaluate the use of [68Ga]-labelling Anti-IGF-1R Affibody Molecule in IGF-1R expression cancer imaging in adult cancer patients (colon cancer ,NSCLC,gliomas cancer patients)with different IGF-1R expression status.
