(secondQuint)Liver and Biliary Tumor Tissue Registry.

 The study establishes a tissue and blood registry at Mayo Clinic Florida to support translational investigations into the biology, etiology and prognosis of liver and biliary masses such as through the use of patient-derived xenografts.

 Patients having surgery to remove a liver or biliary mass or having a biopsy of a mass or lesion will be asked to donate a portion of the removed mass for research purposes.

 Only portions of the mass not required for clinical diagnostic evaluation, or surgical waste, will be used in this research study.

 The tissues acquired will be stored and used for any specific, hypothesis driven protocols that are IRB approved.

 Serum and plasma samples may also be obtained at enrollment.

 Clinical patient data from medical charts that may be correlative to outcomes will be collected and stored in a password secure data base.

 Data will be extracted from medical records charts.

Patients having surgery to remove a liver or biliary tissue mass or having a biopsy of a mass or lesion will have a tissue sample collected and stored for future research of liver and biliary diseases.

 A blood sample may also be collected at the time of enrollment.
