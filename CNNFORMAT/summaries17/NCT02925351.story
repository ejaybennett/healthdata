(fifthQuint)Fluorine F 18 Clofarabine PET/CT in Imaging Patients With Autoimmune or Inflammatory Diseases.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine how fluorine F 18 clofarabine (18F-clofarabine) is distributed in the body, in patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

 II.

 Determine whether 18F-clofarabine can be used to image patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorine F 18 clofarabine intravenously (IV) and undergo a single PET/CT scan for up to 120 minutes.

 Fluorine F 18 Clofarabine PET/CT in Imaging Patients With Autoimmune or Inflammatory Diseases@highlight

This pilot trial studies how well fluorine F 18 clofarabine positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in imaging patients with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.

 Fluorine F 18 clofarabine is an imaging agent or tracer which may be taken up by inflammatory tissue in the body.

 Diagnostic imaging, such as PET/CT scans, can be used to measure the amount of injected tracer that is taken up by inflammatory tissue.

 PET/CT scan may help to determine how fluorine F 18 clofarabine is distributed throughout the body.
