(fifthQuint)Psychiatric Comorbidity.

 Patients with multiple otolaryngology complaints experience psychosocial distress.

 This psychosocial distress can have an adverse effect on treatment outcomes for the primary complaint and on the overall patient experience.

 It can result in greater costs for more care that may not be best-directed.

 This has implications not only for the patients, but also for providers' quality metrics.

 Data will be collected via surveys and a chart review.

 New patients at the Duke Clinic 1F and Duke Raleigh Otolaryngology will be asked to complete the BSI-18, patient control scale, and disease specific outcome measure upon patient intake by the clinic nurse.

 The CG-CAHPS Visit Survey 2.

1 will be completed at the conclusion of the clinical encounter.

 Patient participation consists of these surveys on their initial visit only.

 The PI and/or a resident will conduct a chart review of these patients looking for history of psychiatric diagnoses and/or related prescriptions.

 Patients who have psychiatric diagnoses and/or prescriptions in the chart will be considered to have their needs "met", in that they are receiving care.

 Data regarding diagnoses and prescriptions will also be entered into REDCap.
