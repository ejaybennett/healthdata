(secondQuint)DISsection RE-entry Evaluation With Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds in CTO.

.

 This is a pilot study, with the aim of hypothesis generation.

 This research aims to establish the feasibility and safety of treating chronic total occlusions using dissection and re-entry techniques in combination with everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (Absorb BVS).

 Primary aims of the study are: - To demonstrate a low rate of Target Vessel Failure (stent thrombosis, restenosis or late closure) at 12 and 24 months after CTO PCI and stenting with the Absorb BVS - To demonstrate a high degree of endothelial stent strut coverage at 12 and 24 moths after CTO PCI and stenting with the Absorb BVSThe primary outcome measure is.

 DISsection RE-entry Evaluation With Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds in CTO.

@highlight

Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is increasingly effective to treat Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) lesions in coronary arteries.

 This trial will examine modern dissection and re-entry approaches to treat more complex CTO lesions with the Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS).
