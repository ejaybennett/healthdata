(thirdQuint)Study to Nivolumab Following Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy.

 [Phase Ib] After preoperative CRT, to sequentially administer nivolumab in combination for patients with locally advanced resectable rectal cancer.

 To evaluate the safety of nivolumab in sequential combination therapy, the onset of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the safety of subsequent surgical therapy, and to decide on a recommended dose (RD) for the phase II part.

 [Phase II] To evaluate the efficacy and safety when nivolumab is sequentially administered in combination at the RD determined in the phase Ib part, following preoperative CRT in patients with locally advanced resectable rectal cancer and to identify biomarkers related to the therapeutic response.

 To also evaluate the safety of surgical therapy.

 Study to Nivolumab Following Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy@highlight

This is a phase Ib/II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to investigate the safety, efficacy, and proof of concept (POC) of monotherapy with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody drug, as a sequential therapy following chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with capecitabine and subsequent surgical therapy in patients with locally advanced resectable rectal cancer.
