(firstQuint)The Bioavailability of Rifampicin in (FDCs) Widely Used in South Africa to Treat Drug-susceptible (TB).

 In this study the 4- and 2-drug FDCs (for intensive and continuation phases respectively) widely used within the South African treatment program will be evaluated in a comparative bioavailability study against a single drug rifampicin product registered by the South African Medicines Control Council.

 A three-way, single dose, cross-over study will be conducted in 24 healthy volunteers.
