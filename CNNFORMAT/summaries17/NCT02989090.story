(fifthQuint)Electronic Patient Notification of Remote ICD Data: Impact of Patient Engagement on Outcomes in the Merlin.

Net.

 Currently, patients receive a letter by postal mail from their physician's office with a statement about their ICD status.

 The St.

 Jude Medical ICD data is managed by the Merlin.

net cent remote monitoring system and maintained in the database with periodic transfer to the healthcare providers EHR system.

 This is the first large study that will evaluate the impact of transferring information from the ICD manufacturer's remote monitoring system directly into a patient's ePHR for the purpose of making select information readily available to patients in the form of a report, called the ICD Patient Notification Summary.

 The ICD Patient Notification Summary will be transmitted to the healthcare providers' EHR system (Epic) from Merlin.

net cent as part of the data flow pathway to the patients' ePHR (MyChart).

 This will ensure that the Arrhythmia Diagnostic Center (ADC) clinic and other healthcare providers will be able to view the same information that the patients will receive.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS 1) SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PATIENTS a.

 Study Population: The study population is comprised of all adult, ambulatory PPG-Cardiology patients who are being remotely monitored for their St.

 Jude Medical ICD through the Merlin.

net cent system.

 The study will include three groups; one intervention group (Group A) and two control groups (Group B and Group C).

 Patients who are willing to have an active MyChart account will be randomized into one of the two groups (Group A or Group B).

 Those patients who initially declined a MyChart account at enrollment or do not have computer and/or Internet access will be enrolled into the third group (Group C).

 Each study group will comprise of approximately 100 patients for a total N=300.

 The research staff will identify patients satisfying the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study.

 Currently participating in another Parkview study that involves other ePHR use.

 Intervention Component i.

 Feasibility: The investigators will assess intervention feasibility by monitoring successful delivery of remote monitoring ICD data via the ePHRs of the intervention group patients.

 ii.

 Data Collection: 1.

 Group A- Intervention Group: Data will include the number of ICD reports from Merlin.

net cent (per standard of care) during the study period and the number of reports processed by the ADC.

 The number of transmissions of the ICD Patient Notification Summaries to the ePHR as well as the number of patient views (electronic access) will be provided by Epic.

 Additional data may be obtained from MyChart regarding patient ePHR usage including: 1.

 Number of successful ePHR logins 2.

 Number of unsuccessful ePHR logins 2.

 Group B- Control Group: Data will include the number of ICD reports from Merlin.

net cent (per standard of care) during the study period and the number of reports processed by the ADC.

 Data will also include the number of ICD Patient Notification Summaries mailed to the participant by research staff.

 Additional data may be obtained from MyChart regarding patient ePHR usage including: 1.

 Number of successful ePHR logins 2.

 Number of unsuccessful ePHR logins 3.

 Group C- Control Group: Data will include the number of ICD reports from Merlin.

net cent (per standard of care) during the study period and the number of reports processed by the ADC.

 The number of ICD reports will be provided by the ADC at PPG-Cardiology.

 No data will be obtained from MyChart because these patients have either declined or do not have computer and/or Internet access to have an active MyChart account.

 Quantitative Component i.

 Patient Interaction: Baseline: Patients from the intervention group and control groups will answer a baseline survey.

 The baseline survey will assess socio-demographic characteristics, patient engagement, and patient satisfaction with the current standard of care as well as patient perceptions about receiving remote monitoring ICD data in their ePHR.

 The survey will be administered either paper-based or online, using a secure online survey program, Survey Monkey.

 Patient engagement will be assessed using the short form Patient Activation Measure (PAM) survey copyrighted by Insignia Health.

 The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) is a validated survey tool developed by Judith Hibbard, PhD, MPH of the University of Oregon, which assesses the degree a patient acts as an active agent in their own health care.

 PAM is associated with improved health outcomes6.

 Follow-up: Patients will respond to two follow up surveys in approximately 3 months and 6 months from the baseline survey.

 The follow up surveys will assess patient engagement, patient satisfaction and perceptions with the ICD Patient Notification Summary or current standard of care as well as technology acceptance, depending on the group randomization.

 Technology acceptance will be assessed using the Technology Acceptance Model as a framework and will explore patient attitudes regarding ease of use, usefulness and intentions to use the ePHR and ICD Patient Notification Summary.

 The Technology Acceptance Model is a commonly used model, originally developed by Fred Davis and Richard Bagozzi, which predicts technology acceptance based on the user's perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the technology for a specific purpose 7,8.

 Data Collection: Chart review will be performed to collect past and current data regarding patient's socio-demographic characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory and interventions, and healthcare utilization.

 These data points will help provide background and descriptive information to supplement the other components of the study.

 ICD-related data and events as well as measurement and classification of clinic calls will be assessed starting six months prior to the study period and continuing throughout the study period.

 The amount and type of healthcare utilization in relation to cardiac care will be collected.

 Data related to the use of MyChart will also be collected.

 Jude Medical ICD through the Merlin.

net cent system.

 Electronic Patient Notification of Remote ICD Data: Impact of Patient Engagement on Outcomes in the Merlin.

Net@highlight

Remote monitoring of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for patients has led to efficient, safe, and satisfying analysis of their device and cardiac status; resulting in an overall improvement in the quality of care for such patients.

 Despite the efficacy of remote monitoring of ICDs and the satisfaction of patients and providers with the process, there is a desire from patients to have access and view ability of the data their ICD is transmitting.

 However, methods for making ICD device data directly available to the patients are not currently in place.

 This study aims to elicit the impact of standardized remote monitoring ICD data to patients through an electronic personal health record (ePHR) on patient engagement, healthcare utilization, and patient-provider communication.

 For this study, patients with an ICD manufactured by St.

 Jude Medical and that are undergoing remote monitoring through the remote management system, Merlin.

net cent , will receive a standardized format of their electronic remote monitoring ICD data in MyChart, the ePHR used at Parkview Health.

 The standard format for the electronic remote monitoring ICD data, as it is delivered to the patient, will be termed the ICD Patient Notification Summary.

 Additionally, provider attitudes and perceptions regarding the value of the Patient Notification Summary, its impact on clinic workflow, and patient-provider communication will be collected.
