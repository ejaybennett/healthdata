(secondQuint)RELVAR Effects on Parasternal Muscle Activity, Diaphragm, and Ventilation in Severe COPD.

 In adults with severe, minimally reversible bronchitis or emphysema (COPD), there is progressive hyperinflation of the lungs with associated flattening and inefficiency of the major respiratory muscle, the diaphragm.

 These changes limit physical activity and exercise, and provoke shortness of breath - dyspnea.

 These debilitating symptoms are often significantly lessened with ultra long acting combination bronchodilators, even in adults where the bronchodilator does not produce any measurable improvement in either airflow or lung hyperinflation.

 This symptomatic improvement in adults with severe, minimally reversible COPD may occur because of a direct benefit of the bronchodilator on respiratory muscles and ventilation.

 This study examines the effect of the ultra long acting bronchodilator fluticasone furoate/vilanterol trifenatate upon the upper anterior chest wall respiratory muscles (parasternals), the diaphragm, and breathing pattern.
