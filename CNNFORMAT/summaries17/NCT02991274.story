(firstQuint)ARTEMIS DIANE T790M (An Amino Acid Substitution at Position 790 in EGFR, From a Threonine (T) to a Methionine (M)) Mutation at Hospital Laboratories in Comparison With Central Laboratory.

 This is a multi-center testing study.

 800 patients from 80 different hospital sites will have local T790M testing by different molecular testing platforms and have central testing by Cobas platform.

 These two sets of data (local T790M testing and central T790M testing) will be analysed and compared to assess the concordance of these T790M testing platforms.

The study primary objective is to assess the concordance of T790M resistance mutation testing from hospital-based laboratories with T790M resistance mutation testing from a central laboratory.
