(fifthQuint)Rolapitant as an Antiemetic in Malignant Glioma Patients Receiving Radiotherapy and Temozolomide.

 All eligible subjects should receive a planned total dose of 54-60 gray (GY) of radiation and 75 mg/m2 of TMZ daily for a total of six weeks.

 Patients will be randomized to receive one of two antiemetic treatment sequences: sequence A that involves administration of ondansetron alone for 3 weeks followed by a single dose of rolapitant (day 22) plus daily ondansetron for 3 weeks or sequence B that involves a single dose of rolapitant (day 1) plus daily ondansetron for 3 weeks followed by 3 weeks of daily ondansetron alone.

 The study has one primary endpoint: complete response (CR) rate.

 Participation in this study may result in reduced chemo-radiation induced nausea and vomiting, however, risks include the common side effects of rolapitant including decreased appetite, neutropenia, dizziness, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, stomatitis, and anemia.

 Rolapitant as an Antiemetic in Malignant Glioma Patients Receiving Radiotherapy and Temozolomide@highlight

The purpose of this phase 2 study is to assess the efficacy and patient satisfaction of oral rolapitant plus ondansetron vs.

 oral ondansetron monotherapy in malignant glioma (MG) patients receiving standard of care radiation (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) therapy.

 This is a randomized phase 2 trial of rolapitant plus ondansetron vs.

 ondansetron monotherapy for the prevention of chemo-radiation induced nausea and vomiting in primary MG subjects receiving RT and concomitant multi-dose TMZ.
