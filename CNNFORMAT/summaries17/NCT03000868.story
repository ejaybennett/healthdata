(secondQuint)Comparison of Small Colorectal Polyp Removal Using Cold EMR With Hot EMR.

 Colorectal polyps are considered as precancerous lesions and endoscopical resection is currently the treatment of choice when it is possible.

 Colorectal polyps are classified into diminutive polyps (1cm in diameter).

 There are several endoscopical treatment methods: cold biopsy forceps polypectomy, cold snare polypectomy, hot biopsy forceps polypectomy, hot snare polypectomy, and endoscopic mucosal resection.

 Cold polypectomy means mechanical removal of the polyp with snare or biopsy forceps without the use of electrocautery, and hot polypectomy means removal of the polyp with the use of electocautery.

This study evaluates the efficacy of small colorectal polyp removal using cold endoscopic mucosal resection with hot endoscopic mucosal resection.

 Half of the participants will receive cold endoscopic mucosal resection, while the other half will receive hot endoscopic mucosal resection.
