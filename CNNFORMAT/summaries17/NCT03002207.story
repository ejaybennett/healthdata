(secondQuint)Repairing the Defect of Intervertebral Disc With Autologous BMSC and Gelatin Sponge After Microendoscopic Discectomy for Lumbar Disc Herniation.

 The participants with lumbar disc herniation diseases are treated by Microendoscopic discectomy, and they are divided into four groups depend on whether the defect is repaired with Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell (BMSC)/gelatin sponge or not and whether the defect is sutured or not.

 In the first group,the defect of intervertebral disc is repaired with Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell (BMSC)/gelatin sponge and sutured.

 In the second group, the defect of intervertebral disc is repaired with autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell (BMSC)/gelatin sponge but not sutured after discectomy.

 In the third group, the defect of intervertebral disc is sutured but not repaired with autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell (BMSC)/gelatin sponge after discectomy.

 In the four group, the defect of intervertebral disc is neither sutured nor repaired with autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell (BMSC)/gelatin sponge after discectomy.

 Repairing the Defect of Intervertebral Disc With Autologous BMSC and Gelatin Sponge After Microendoscopic Discectomy for Lumbar Disc Herniation@highlight

In this prospective study the investigators seek to evaluate clinical outcomes after repairing the defect of intervertebral disc with autologous BMSC/gelatin sponge during microendoscopic discectomy for participants of lumbar disc herniation.
