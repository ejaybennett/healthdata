(fifthQuint)Chronic Pain, Life Style Factors and Quality of Life.

 Chronic pain co-occurs with risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, depression, smoking and sleep problems.

 Nutrition and low physical activity may predispose to chronic pain.

 To gain information on the life style factors of adult chronic pain patients referred to university hospital or central hospital pain clinics in Finland, 477 patients have been recruited to the study.

 The patients fill in questionnaires on sociodemographic factors, pain, medication, use of health services, physical activity, smoking, use of alcohol or other substances, sleep, quality of life, nutrition and psychological factors at their first visit to the pain clinic.

 Height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and pulse are measured by the study nurse.

 A blood sample for analysis of blood sugar, cholesterol (total, LDL, HDL), triglycerides, HbA1c and sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) is taken.

 The pain clinician records the pain diagnosis, medication and other methods of pain management chosen.

 The patients will be sent follow-up questionnaires at 2 years and 5 years after baseline.
