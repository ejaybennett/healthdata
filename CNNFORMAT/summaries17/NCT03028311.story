(fifthQuint)Feasibility of Single Session In-Room Yttrium-90 Radioembolization Diagnostic Angiography and Treatment.

 If you agree to take part in this study, you will have standard-of-care tests and procedures as a part of the planning for SIR-Spheres treatment.

 The SIR-Spheres treatment delivers radiation directly to the liver by a catheter placed in an artery in the groin.

 A catheter is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large artery while you are under local anesthesia and are mildly sedated.

 Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail.

 If you are one of the first 2 participants enrolled in this study, you will have your treatment over 2 sessions within 2-4 weeks, which is the standard of care.

 During your first session, an extra 10 minutes will be added to your standard imaging for research purposes.

 Each visit should take about 6 hours to complete.

 You will have about 2 hours of standard of care tests and imaging and will be asked to stay in the hospital for 1-2 hours after the procedure to recover from the anesthesia.

 The procedure itself should take about 2 1/2 hours to complete.

 If you enroll after the first 2 participants, you will have your treatment in 1 session.

 The visit should take about 8 hours to complete.

 During this visit, you will have about 5 hours of standard of care tests and imaging.

 You will be asked to remain in the hospital for 1-2 hours after the procedure to recover from the anesthesia.

 The procedure itself should take about 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours to complete.

 You will sign separate consents for the tests, procedures, and SIR-Spheres treatment that further explains the procedures and risks.

 The standard of care tests will include blood draws for routine testing.

 Follow-Up: You will be called by the study staff 1 month after your SIR-Spheres treatment to ask how you are doing and if you are having any side effects.

 The phone call should last about 10 minutes.

 At about 3 months and 6 months after the treatment, you will return to the clinic for a physical exam.

 Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 Length of Study: You will be off study after the follow-up visits.

 Feasibility of Single Session In-Room Yttrium-90 Radioembolization Diagnostic Angiography and Treatment@highlight

You are being asked to take part in this study because you have liver cancer or cancer that has spread to the liver are scheduled for SIR-Spheres treatment (Yttrium-90 radioembolization treatment).

 The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving SIR-Spheres treatment to patients with liver cancer in the same session rather than over 2 sessions, which is the standard of care.

 This is an investigational study.

 The SIR-Spheres is delivered using FDA approved and commercially available methods.

 It is investigational to learn if the procedure can be safely performed in a single session.

 Up to 12 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
