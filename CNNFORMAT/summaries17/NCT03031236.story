(fifthQuint)Reduce Childhood Maltreatment and Promote Development.

 Hypothesis to be tested: This integrated intervention will a) improve children's growth, hemoglobin, micro-nutrient status (vitamin B12 and folic acid), cognitive, motor, language and social-emotional development, b) minimize maltreatment of children by parents, c) improve positive parenting and d) reduce mothers' stress and depressive symptoms compared to control group.

 Objectives: Primary: This integrated intervention will - Improve cognitive, motor, language and social-emotional development of children - Minimize maltreatment of children by the caregivers Secondary: This integrated intervention will bring following benefits in intervention group compared to control group- On children- - Improve height, weight and head circumference - Improve hemoglobin, vitamin B12 and folic acid status, On mothers (primary caregivers) - Reduce mothers' stress and depressive symptoms - Improve positive parenting practices Background of the Project including Preliminary Observations: The rate of global acute malnutrition is 16% while the rate of stunting in Bangladesh is as high as 41% in mu g, vitamin D 5 mu g, vitamin E 5 mg, vitamin C 30 mg, thiamine 0.

5 mg, riboflavin 0.

5 mg, niacin 6 mg, pyridoxine 0.

1 mg, copper 0.

56 mg, selenium 17.

0 mu g and iodine 90 mu g) supplementation at household level (90 sachets of over 6 month-period).

 (iii) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Intervention to help mothers change their negative behaviour and to improve self care, child care, income generation activities, will follow the "Thinking Healthy Program" model of Rahman and colleague using cognitive behavior therapy (CBT).

 CBT will improve maternal behaviour leading to "positive parenting" and prevention of maltreatment.

 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is an "evidence-based and structured form of talking therapy that aims to alter the cycle of unhelpful or unhealthy thinking (cognition) and the resulting undesirable actions (behavior).

" Cognitive Behavioral Therapy specifically focused on "changing thinking style toward positive" and not associated with any medication.

 CBT found to be effective in managing or treating not only depression, also a variety of other conditions-e.

g.

 mood, personality, stress, eating habit, tic etc.

This approach with rural mothers of similar context showed positive impact on child outcome in Pakistan, which is culturally and economically similar to Bangladesh.

 CBT is aimed to alter the cycle of negative thinking of people to positive direction.

 The cycle of negative thoughts usually breaks in two ways by using Cognitive and Behavioral aspect of the therapy - - Cognitive aspect of CBT: This focuses on altering ways of thinking of a person (mother) that includes thoughts, beliefs, ideas, attitudes, assumptions, mental imagery, and ways of directing her attention.

 - Behavioral aspect of CBT: This focuses on helping the mother to face the challenges and the opportunities that facilitates child-raising with a sound and clear mind- and then to take necessary actions that are likely to have desired outcomes.

 This model is proven to be an effective approach in breaking the cycle of depression and improving confidence, coping strategies and assertiveness in poor community with low resource setting.

 The cycle is broken through two ways of CBT- cognitive aspect (directing attention to positive direction) and behavioral aspect (helping to meet challenges).

 d) Final assessment, data entry and data analysis: After 11 months of intervention, the participants will be invited again in the centre for end line assessment.

 The same assessment tools will be used as in the base line.

 Simultaneous data entry will continue in SPSS software.

 After data cleaning, preliminary analysis will be done according to following plan.

 All the baseline variables will be used to compare between lost and tested groups as well as the intervention and control groups.

 The two time-point assessment will also provide information about within group changes.

 Some variables e.

g.

 HOME, mother-child interaction, parenting, childcare etc.

 will be used either as mediator or as outcome in separate analyses Outcome Variables: On Mothers- 1.

 Maternal stress and depressive symptoms using CES-D at baseline and at the end.

 2.

 Self Esteem assessment using Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale at baseline and at the end in test centre 3.

 Information about child maltreatment by parents will be collected at baseline during screening at home and at the end.

 4.

 Home observation for measurement of environment (HOME) at household level, twice (at baseline and at the end) On Children- 1.

 Child's cognitive, motor and language assessment using Bayley-III and behavioral assessment during test using Wolke's Behavior Rating Scale, at baseline and at the end in test centre.

 Children will accompany their mothers to the centre.

 (45 min) 2.

 Children's Micronutrient status (vitamin B12 and folic acid) at baseline and at the end in test centre 3.

 Children's Hemoglobin status 4.

 Children's height, weight, MUAC, head circumference at baseline and at the end Covariates- 1.

 Socio-economic variables (asset index/ quintile) 2.

 Demographic variables (housing/ sanitation) 3.

 Maternal nutritional status (BMI) 4.

 Child's age and sex 5.

 Compliance on micro-nutrients and dietary recall 6.

 Morbidity Sample Size Calculation and Outcome (Primary and Secondary) Variable(s) Considering 5% level of significance, 80% power, an improvement of 0.

4 SD in children's developmental outcome based on our previous experiences, an ICC of 0.

01 and 30% drop outs, we need to enroll 150 mother-child duos in each group as per equation below- 2(SD)2 n = ---------------- X f () (M1-M2) 2 n: sample required, SD: 16 (based on previous data of Bayley Score) : 5% level of significance : 80% power f= * M1-M2 = Difference = 6.

4 points (based on previous studies) So the calculated n=100 Considering the clustering we need to adjust this sample size by multiplying the above value (100) by the design effect.

 Design Effect = 1 + [(m-1) * ICC m corresponds to the average number of infants per cluster.

 Assuming there are on average 10 mother-child duos/cluster.

 Using ICC = 0.

01, the design effect = 1 + [(10-1) * ICC = 1 + 0.

9 = 1.

09 Therefore new sample size = 100*1.

09= 109 per group , considering 30% drop-out the sample size per group is around 150 infants in stimulation group and 150 infants in control group.

 Data Analysis icddr,b scientists and co-investigators of this research project will analyze the data using Stata/SPSS.

 All data will be checked for normality.

 Log transformation will be done if not normally distributed.

 Indices will be created where it is required (eg: SES index, housing index etc).

 Pearson's correlations will be conducted to examine the association between age of the child and each developmental measure.

 A comparison will be done between the socio-demographic characteristics of the intervened and control groups using t-test for continuous variables and 2 for categorical variables.

 Partial correlation will be used controlling age and sex to examine association of different covariates with developmental scores.

 Finally, multi-level regression analyses will be done.

 In each regression analysis, the outcome will be the final developmental score, with age at enrollment, the relevant initial scores, and intervention as predictors.

 Again, comparison will be done between the treatment effect in intervention and control groups.

 All variables that will be different between intervention and control groups at baseline and will correlate with the developmental outcomes and will address high co-linearity among the covariates in all analyses.

 The main outcomes are children's cognitive, language and motor development measured on Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development.

 In addition it is expected that an improvement in growth, home stimulation and mother's positive parenting.

 It is also expected that improvement of the hemoglobin and micro-nutrient status (vitamin B12 and folic acid) over 150 children in the intervention group by the end of the project.

 At the same time it is expected of a reduction on mothers' stress and depressive symptom and rate of maltreatment of children by parents.

 A cost analysis will be conducted based on the success indicators, cost per successful outcome will be calculated from total cost of intervention program.

 Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) Researcher group do not expect the low risk activities of this study to put the study population at increased risk of adverse outcomes, however any human activity can have unforeseen untoward consequences.

 researchers will actively monitor the impact of the intervention on the population.

 The primary objective of these evaluations is to understand practices, knowledge, and attitudes towards the interventions.

 researchers will include questions in the evaluations that ask if they have noted any adverse outcomes.

 If the field team learns of any adverse outcomes they will be trained to report them to the study team the same day they learn of them.

 Ethical Assurance for Protection of Human rights The project will have to be approved by the Institutional Review Board of icddr,b.

 Investigator group will collect written informed consent in Bengali from the parents before starting data collection.

 Research group will ensure confidentiality when collecting data on sensitive issues like maternal depression.

 Hard copies of the data will be kept in a locked cabinet only accessible to the investigators.

 The electronic data will not have the name and other identifiable information.

 Clinically depressed mothers will be referred to counsellors or psychiatrists as needed.

 Children with mental retardation or developmental disabilities will be referred to proper places for treatment.

 Reduce Childhood Maltreatment and Promote Development@highlight

Background (brief): 1.

 Burden: The uniqueness of each child is tremendously influenced by interaction between nature and nurture during critical period of brain development that promotes foundation of brain architecture through neuronal connections.

 2.

 Knowledge gap: Young children in Bangladesh are prone to multiple physiological and psycho-social risk factors e.

g.

 poverty, maltreatment, malnutrition, disease, parental illiteracy, maternal depression and lack of stimulation, all of which are preventable.

 Little is reported about any comprehensive package of development that addresses most of these early childhood risks and promotes optimum early childhood development (ECD).

 3.

 Relevance: The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate an integrated, low cost, and feasible center based approach that focuses on positive parenting of children during early life that will promote early stimulation, minimize childhood maltreatment, boost up of maternal self-esteem and healthy thinking and improve health and nutritional (HN) status of children.

 Hypothesis (if any): This integrated intervention will promote maternal child-care practices and mental health that will finally improve their children's growth, micro-nutrient status, early brain development compared to control group.

 Objectives: To see the effect of an integrated intervention (ECD + HN) on growth, micro-nutrient status, child development along with effect on maternal child-care practices and mental health.

 Methods: Randomly selected 2 groups will be identified as intervention and control (150 mothers' from15 clusters in each group).

 Mothers of 8-23 months old children living in slums and practice harsh child-disciplining will be identified as study population.

 The mothers of intervention (ECD+HN) group will receive fortnightly group sessions for 11 months that will include combined messages on a) psycho-social stimulation, b) positive parenting to prevent child maltreatment and c) cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for positive thinking, d) health and nutrition messages and e) 15 micro-nutrient sprinkle supplement.

(90 sachets of over 6 month-period).

 The control group will only receive the usual health messages provided by the government.

 Outcome measures/variables: - Children's cognitive, motor, language and socio-emotional development; anthropometry; hemoglobin and micro-nutrient status (serum vitamin B12, iron and folic acid) - Mother s' parenting practices, depressive symptoms, self-esteem and child-maltreatment.
