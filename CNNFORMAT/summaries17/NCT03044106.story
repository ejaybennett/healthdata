(fifthQuint)Cranial Laser Reflex Technique for Hamstring Function.

 First Visit.

 The research staff will schedule all study visits in the Neurophysiology Lab or other appropriate site in the UNC Healthcare system or medical school.

 The baseline phase of the first visit will include review of inclusion/exclusion criteria and the components of the study.

 Those who wish to sign the consent will complete a brief questionnaire on their activity level, history of hamstring injuries, and perceived hamstring tightness.

 Randomization/Random Allocation.

 Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and give consent will be randomized to one of the following for the first treatment period: 1) active CLRT; or 2) sham laser.

 At the first intervention visit, the research assistant will enter the subject's assigned ID into an online computer program (selected by study biostatistician) to determine assignment to one of the two periods.

 The study biostatistician will use computer-generated random numbers to generate the allocation sequence using random blocks of random sizes.

 The program documents treatment assignment in an un-editable form including a date stamp.

 Post Randomization.

 After randomization, subjects will be asked to complete the three functional hamstring tests: KEA, HHD, and PPT.

 Subjects will have direct contact with the investigator and research assistant at each visit to facilitate adverse event reporting.

 Assessments.

 KEA: The 90-90 Knee Extension Angle test is a functional assessment designed to assess lower extremity flexibility and is considered the gold standard for hamstring length.

 The participant will be in the supine position on a treatment table.

 The tested extremity (the right leg in each subject) will be placed in a 90 hip and 90 knee position with the contralateral lower extremity placed flat on the table.

 A digital inclinometer will be consistently placed at the level of the medial malleoli and the superior pole of the patella.

 The examiner will maintain 90 of hip flexion.

 Pelvic position will be monitored by palpation of the anterior superior iliac spine and lumbar spinous processes to maintain a neutral pelvic position.

 The examiner will passively extend the knee to the point of a ''strong, but tolerable stretch," as reported by the subject.

 The examiner will read the angle of the inclinometer and record the mean value of three attempts.

 A greater angle indicates greater degree of flexibility.

 Hand held Dynamometry (HHD) is currently considered a reliable and valid measurement of peak muscle contraction.

 The subject will be prone on the table with right leg bent to 90.

 The tester will place the dynamometer (microFET2; Hoggan Health Industries, Salt Lake City, UT) at the heel of the participant and apply force to the heel, gradually increasing in 3 to 5 seconds.

 Participants will be instructed to resist the applied force and maximally contract the hamstring muscle against the HHD device.

 The test ends once they are no longer able to resist the force and the leg begins to move (break point).

 The investigator will record the mean value of three attempts.

 Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT) is a reliable, accurate and valid method for measuring muscle pain sensitivity and response to treatment.

 The digital algometer (FDX, Wagner Instruments, Greenwich, CT) is a hand-held muscle tester with a range of 0-100 lbf that consists of a padded disc with a diameter of 0.

5" attached to a microprocessor-control unit that measures peak force (pounds or kilograms).

 The unit has a digital readout for peak-applied pressure and provides a built-in calibration routine that verifies a valid calibration.

 In order to determine PPT, the researcher will apply the tip of the algometer to a tender spot in the participant's hamstrings and increase the amount of pressure until the participant verbally informs the researcher when the sensation of pressure became pain.

 At this point the algometer is removed and the peak force recorded.

 The mean of three repeated measures will be reported.

 Intervention: Cranial Laser Reflex Technique (CLRT) is a novel complementary and alternative (CAM) medicine intervention for musculoskeletal conditions that incorporates principles of laser acupuncture with chiropractic cranial reflexology(26).

 Developed in 2006 by Dr.

 Nick Wise (PI), CLRT has been incorporated into clinical practice by hundreds of practitioners around the world.

 It involves non-invasive laser stimulation of a distinct cranial microsystem discovered by chiropractors.

 It was postulated that these cranial reflexes are similar in nature to acupuncture points and would likewise respond to photobiomodulation (PBM) from a low level laser.

 Clinical experience by the PI and others confirmed that cranial reflexes are indeed responsive to low doses (0.

5-5 J/cm2) of laser light: the length, strength, and pain in a specific muscle could be improved rapidly, even in cases of chronic post-stroke muscle spasms.

 Procedure: Subject will don protective eyewear and remain in the prone position.

 The hamstring reflexes are two lines on the posterior portion of the top of the head, approximately 2 cm long and 2 cm apart, running parallel to the sagittal suture (fig.

 1).

 The posterior end of the reflexes can be located by finding the vertex, or CZ point in the standardized 10-20 EEG system, and moving laterally approximately 1 cm.

 Sequence: In order to determine the optimal direction of stimulation, the investigator will first perform a brief manual muscle test of the hamstring.

 The subject will bend knee to 90 degrees.

 The investigator will quickly drag a finger along the cranial reflex for the extremity to be tested with moderate pressure, swiping first from anterior to posterior (a-b).

 The subject will be asked to contract the hamstring and resist the investigator's attempt to straighten the leg for 2 seconds.

 Then the investigator will swipe quickly in the opposite direction (b-a) and repeat the muscle test.

 The direction that provides the stronger response as determined by the investigator will be used for the laser stimulation for that subject.

 If the a-b direction is chosen, the aperture of the laser probe will be placed at point (a), turned on and moved to point (b) at a speed of approximately 2 cm/s.

 The laser will be turned off and quickly returned to point (a), turned on and moved to point (b) again.

 This will be repeated for a total of 30 times.

 If the manual muscle test response was equivocal, the laser will be left powered on as the probe is moved for a total of 15 passes in each direction.

 The probe will make light contact with the scalp during the powered laser pass, moving aside as much hair as possible.

 Device: The treatment device to be used in this study is a Class IIIB 810nm 200mW near-infrared GAAlAS diode laser (THOR Photomedicine Ltd, Great Britain) that is currently marketed in the US.

 The laser probe is FDA-cleared and classified as a non-significant risk device.

 The spot size is 0.

0364 cm2, and the treatment time is 30 seconds.

 Current best-practice recommendations for laser acupuncture(35) recommend a dosage between 1-4 J/cm2 per point.

 Since the CRP is a line of 2 cm, for the purposes of calculating dosage, we will treat it as a series of 10 connected points each with a diameter of 2mm.

 With the scanning rate of 2cm/s, each "point" on the line will receive 1/10 of each pass, totaling 3s (out of 30s total) exposure time per point.

 The dose per point for this intervention is calculated to be approximately 1.

65 J/cm2.

 There will be a one-week washout and the subject will return for the second treatment period.

 Primary Outcome: 90-90 Knee Extension Angle Test.

 KEA is a functional test designed to assess lower extremity flexibility and is considered the gold standard test for assessing hamstring length (53).

 Results will be recorded as degrees of knee flexion angle.

 A clinically significant effect size is an increase of 5 degrees.

 Secondary Outcomes Handheld Dynamometry.

 HHD is currently considered a reliable and valid measurement of peak muscle contraction.

 The subject will be prone on the table with right leg bent to 90 and will maximally contract the hamstring muscle for 4-5 seconds against the HHD device.

 The investigator will record the mean value of three attempts.

 Pain Pressure Threshold.

 PPT is a reliable, accurate and valid method for measuring muscle pain sensitivity and response to treatment(54).

 In order to determine PPT, the researcher will apply the tip of the algometer to a tender spot in the participant's hamstrings and increase the amount of pressure until the participant verbally informs the researcher when the sensation of pressure became pain.

 At this point the algometer is removed and the peak force recorded.

 The mean of three repeated measures will be reported.

 An increase in PPT signifies an increase in pain tolerance.

 Additional Variables Age, gender, activity level, perceived hamstring tightness, perceived hamstring flexibility and perceived hamstring strength will be assessed at baseline and subsequent follow up visit.

 Sample Size and Power: Based on previously published results(55), we would consider a mean increase of 5 on the KEA (e.

g.

, from 135 to 140) to be clinically meaningful, and we assume a common standard deviation of 15.

 We further assume that correlation between repeated measurements from the same individual will be at least 0.

75 (likely a conservative assumption).

 Under these assumptions, enrolling 38 participants would provide at least 80% power using a two-sided test at the 0.

05 level.
