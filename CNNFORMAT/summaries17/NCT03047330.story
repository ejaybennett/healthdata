(secondQuint)Menopausal Sleep Fragmentation and Body Fat Gain.

 While obesity is highly prevalent in midlife and older women, with rates increasing markedly after age 40 and body fat increasing in half of women during and after the menopause transition, factors causing these changes are not well understood.

 Reduced total sleep time has been shown to adversely impact biomarkers of obesity, but the effect of the highly prevalent menopause-related sleep fragmentation secondary to hot flashes on metabolism and eating behaviors in humans is not known.

 We will use experimental paradigms to isolate the impact of menopause-related sleep disruption, as well as that of hot flashes and estrogen withdrawal, metabolic biomarkers of body fat gain and on eating behaviors, results of which will inform strategies to prevent body fat gain and improve cardio-metabolic health outcomes in women.

 Menopausal Sleep Fragmentation and Body Fat Gain@highlight

This study aims to investigate the impact of menopause-related sleep fragmentation on metabolic biomarkers of body fat gain.

 The investigators hypothesize that experimental sleep fragmentation will result in an adverse leptin response as a metabolic biomarker for body fat gain.
