(thirdQuint)Lactobacillus Plantarum in Preventing Acute Graft Versus Host Disease in Children Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine efficacy of orally-administered Lactobacillus plantarum (LBP) in preventing the development of gastrointestinal (GI) acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) in children and adolescents undergoing initial allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine whether orally-administered LBP decreases the incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD following alloHCT.

 II.

 To determine whether LBP administration maintains intestinal integrity as measured by mean plasma citrulline levels and reduction in mucosal barrier injury (MBI) bacteremia.

 III.

 To measure the effects of LBP on the intestinal flora phylogenetic composition during and after alloHCT using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene deep sequencing.

 IV.

 To measure effects of LBP on intestinal flora function during and after alloHCT using metagenomic and metabolite profiling.

 V.

 To measure proposed immunomodulatory effects of LBP in mean plasma levels of alloreactive-induced inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IFNgamma, TNFalpha, etc) in patients receiving LBP compared to placebo.

 VI.

 To determine whether LBP administration reduces hospital days within the first 100 days post hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

 VII.

 To determine whether LBP administration reduces the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in alternative donor HCT patients.

 VIII.

 To define the safety of orally administered LBP strains 299 and 299v in alternative donor HCT patients as measured by incidence of Lactobacillus plantarum bacteremia.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive Lactobacillus plantarum strains 299 and 299v orally (PO) or through nasogastric (NG) or gastronomy (G) tube once daily (QD) on day 1 of transplant conditioning regimen to 56 days post alloHCT.

 Patients undergo alloHCT at day 0.

 ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO or through NG or G tube QD on day 1 of transplant conditioning regimen to 56 days post alloHCT.

 Patients undergo alloHCT at day 0.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 120 days.

 Lactobacillus Plantarum in Preventing Acute Graft Versus Host Disease in Children Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant@highlight

This randomized clinical trial studies how well Lactobacillus plantarum works in preventing acute graft versus host disease in children undergoing donor stem cell transplant.

 Lactobacillus plantarum may help prevent the development of gastrointestinal graft versus host disease in children, adolescents, and young adults undergoing donor stem cell transplant.
