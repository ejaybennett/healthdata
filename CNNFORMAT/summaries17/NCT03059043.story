(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of A Viscoelastic-free Method for Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) Implantation.

 Implantable Collamer Lens(ICL) implantation has been proved to be an effective refractive option for surgical correction of high myopia.

 Currently, standard method utilizing the viscoelastic agent to fill and maintain the anterior chamber during the implantation, this requires an additional step to remove the viscoelastic agent at the end of the surgery and may cause the intraocular pressure spike in the early post-operative phase due to the incomplete removal of the viscoelastics.

 The new method is viscoelastic-free, which can be achieved by using balanced salt solution irrigation during the implantation.

 This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial to compare the safety and efficacy of the viscoelastic-free method with the standard method.

 Subjects enrolled in the study will be randomized to receive either viscoelastic-free method or standard method, and the clinical outcomes of two groups will be assessed at several follow-ups: 2 hours, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post-operatively.

 Safety and Efficacy Study of A Viscoelastic-free Method for Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) Implantation@highlight

This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of a viscoelastic-free method for Implantable Collamer Lens(ICL) implantation to treat high myopia.

 Subjects were randomly assigned either to the new method group or to the control group which uses the standard method for implantation.

 The post-operative data are collected for analysis.
