(fifthQuint)Pembrolizumab, Radiotherapy, and Chemotherapy in Neoadjuvant Treatment of Malignant Esophago-gastric Diseases (PROCEED).

 Enrolled patients will receive three doses of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks).

 The first dose of pembrolizumab will be administered approximately 14 days prior to initiating radiotherapy.

 The second dose will be administered three weeks later (week 1 of chemoradiation).

 The third dose will be administered 3 weeks later (week 4 of chemoradiotherapy).

 Pembrolizumab will be given every 3 weeks and may be given at the same time as systemic therapy.

 All patients will receive radiation treatment (45Gy in 25 fractions at 1.

8 Gy/fraction) using image-guided radiation therapy with concurrent, weekly carboplatin (AUC 2) and paclitaxel (50mg/m2 of BSA).

 Restaging will be performed per standard of care approximately 4-8 weeks after completing chemoradiotherapy.

 Resection will be performed approximately 6-12 weeks after completing chemoradiotherapy per standard of care.

 Postoperatively, three additional cycles of pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) will be administered as adjuvant therapy.

This is a single-institution, prospective phase II trial with an initial safety run-in to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab combined with chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced esophageal and gastric cancers (EGC).

 Chemoradiation therapy (45Gy in 25 fractions with concurrent, weekly carboplatin [AUC 2] and paclitaxel [50mg/m2 of BSA]) with three cycles of pembrolizumab will be administered as neoadjuvant therapy.

 These patients will also receive three cycles of adjuvant pembrolizumab after surgical resection
