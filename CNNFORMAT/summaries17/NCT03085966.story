(firstQuint)Autologous Immune Cell Therapy in Combination With LHRH-a in Patients With mCRPC.

 Autologous dendritic cells (DC) are known to activate other immune cells, such as central memory T cells (Tcm cells), that are able to mount an attack against cancer cells.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of patients' own immune cells combined with the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists (LHRH-a) for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
