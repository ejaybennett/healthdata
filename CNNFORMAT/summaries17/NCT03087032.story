(secondQuint)Effects of Adding Liraglutide vs Insulin Glargine to Prandial Insulin in Type 2 Diabetes Patients.

 An increasing number of patients with type 2 diabetes are treated with insulin.

 Patients with diabetes receiving intensive insulin therapy with various combinations of basal and prandial insulin can be caught in a vicious but common cycle, whereby insulin requirements increase over time, and this in turn contributes to weight gain and hypoglycemia and further increases in insulin dosing.

 At this stage, clinicians observe a practical limit to the efficacy of insulin titration alone on glucose-lowering and often add or continue metformin to reduce insulin resistance.

 Injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), such as liraglutide, are a relatively new addition to our treatment armamentarium.

 These drugs improve glucose control and insulin sensitivity and contribute to weight loss.

 Treatment with basal insulin plus GLP-1RAs is well-established in diabetes guidelines and may be as effective as adding prandial insulin therapy.

 When GLP-1 RAs are started, a preemptive reduction in insulin dosage by 25% to 30% in patients with HbA1c < 9% may reduce the risk for hypoglycemia.

 In patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes treated with high doses of premix insulin, Is basal-prandial insulin therapy the option treatment algorithm? Such an intensification strategy carries risk of increased hypoglycaemia and weight gain, both of which are associated with worse long-term outcomes.

 What is the effect of adding liraglutide on HbA1c levels? There have been no randomized, controlled trials of the use of a GLP-1 RAs in conjunction with prandial insulin, and such use is not incorporated in the new American Diabetes Association recommendations.

 To investigate and evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adding Liraglutide vs insulin Glargine to prandial insulin in type 2 diabetes patients treated with premixed Insulin.

 The present 24-week, prospective, open-label, randomized, multicenter, parallel group trial will be preformed.
