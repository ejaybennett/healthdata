(thirdQuint)Cold Induced Activation of Brown Adipose Tissue in Humans.

 The field of human brown adipose tissue (BAT) research is focused on activation of BAT as a means of manipulating energy expenditure and potentially anti-obesity and anti-diabetic properties of the tissue.

 This is well established in rodent studies and explained as due to the specific brown fat uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1).

 Despite increasing evidence that indicates a metabolic regulatory role of BAT in humans, BAT activation/recruitment is not fully understood and even less is known about the endocrine capacities of human BAT.

 Cold induced brown fat activity will be assessed with PET/MR scans and validate an infra-red thermography camera, as well as perform a proteomic screening using blood samples under these two intervention days.

 15 healthy lean male subjects will serve as their own control in a cross-over randomized control study, including a pre-examination day, a thermoneutral-day and a cooling test-day with cold exposure followed by a PET/MR scan to determine BAT activity.

 An extra cooling day is applied for the external validation of the infrared thermography camera.

 Blood samples and abdominal fat-biopsies will be taken at thermoneutral condition and under cold stimulation of brown fat.

This study investigates cold-induced brown fat activation assessed using PET/MR scans.

 Subjects will participate in an acute cooling intervention day and a thermoneutral intervention day with PET/MR scans on both days.

 A secondary purpose is to make a validation of an infrared thermography camera by comparison of skin temperatures and SUV of the supraclavicular brown adipose tissue.
