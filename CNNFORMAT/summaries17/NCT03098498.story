(secondQuint)Impact of Debridement Invasiveness on Attachment Gain After Antiinfective Periodontal Therapy.

 The concomitant removal of subgingival calculus and soft bacterial biofilms in a one-stage procedure might impair periodontal healing in deep infrabony pockets due to the mechanical disruption of demineralized bone sections at the bottom of periodontal lesions.

 This randomized controlled clinical trial therefore aims at comparing the resulting attachment gain 6 months after one-stage antiinfective periodontal therapy comprising the concomitant subgingival removal of soft bacterial biofilms and calculus with a two-stage approach removing subgingival calculus only 6 weeks after the initial removal of soft subgingival bacterial biofilms.

This study compared the gain of periodontal attachment after concomitant one-stage removal of bacterial biofilms and subgingival calculus with a two-stage procedure removing subgingival calculus 6 weeks after the initial removal of soft subgingival bacterial biofilms.
