(fifthQuint)Yttrium Y 90 Glass Microspheres PET/CT in Imaging Patients With Liver Tumors.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the image quality of yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (90Y) PET/CT post SIRT images as compared to technetium Tc-99m albumin aggregated (99mTc MAA) SPECT/CT.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the superior accuracy in both distribution and dosimetry of 90Y PET/CT post SIRT imaging compared to 99mTc MAA planar and SPECT/CT imaging.

 OUTLINE: Immediately after standard of care SIRT, patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres and undergo PET/CT over 30 minutes.

 Yttrium Y 90 Glass Microspheres PET/CT in Imaging Patients With Liver Tumors@highlight

This clinical trial studies how well yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in imaging patients with liver tumors.

 Images produced by PET/CT may provide better information about the distribution of particles, such as yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres, delivered for selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) compared to the technetium Tc-99m albumin aggregated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT images.
