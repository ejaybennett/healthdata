(secondQuint)PVI Based Intraoperative Fluid Management in Head and Neck Free Flap Reconstructive Surgeries.

 A sample size of 80 taken and computer generated random allocation done to divide the patients in two groups(40 each).

 Head and neck onco surgery patients undergoing resection and reconstruction with radial artery free flap and antero lateral thigh free flap of duration 4-6 hours taken for surgery.

 Group B to receive intravenous fluid according to body weight stating at the rate 6-8 ml/kg/hr.

 Group G to receive intravenous fluid according to Pleth variability index value(4-11).

Blood loss up to 10% replacement by colloids.

 Comparison of following parameters: Demography, haemodynamics,urine output .

blood lactate, ph, oxygenation index ,thromboelastography (TEG), blood sugar, flap sugar .
