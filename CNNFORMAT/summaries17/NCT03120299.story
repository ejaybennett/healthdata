(secondQuint)The Effect of Omega-3 FA on Hypertriglyceridemia in Patients With T2DM(OCEAN).

 In the present study, about 350 type 2 diabetes patients with hypertriglyceride will be enrolled from multiple centers in China.

 Randomization was computer generated and stratified by center.

 After screening, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned into one of the following two groups: Omega-3 fatty acids capsules ( 2pills bid) and placebo capsules (2pills bid).

 Blood, feces and urine samples will be collected before and after treatment.

 Triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, HDL-C, HbA1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) will be measured.

 Blood metabolomics profiles of lipids, amino acids, bile acids, the change of gut microbiota, and pharmacogenomic components and parameters will be evaluated too.
