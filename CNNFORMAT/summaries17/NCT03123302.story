(thirdQuint)Our Anesthesia Experience During MRI Scan.

 In this study we aim to investigate the influence of patient characteristics and anesthesia choice on possible complications in patients undergoing MRI under sedation.

 After one of the routine sedation protocol used in our department is chosen and applied according to the physical status of the patient and the physicians decision, the study recruitment will begin in the recovery area.

 Patient characteristics (age, gender, weight, height), ASA (American Society of Anethesiology) classification, associated diseases will be recorded .

 After the procedure is completed all the complications during the 2 hours waiting period in the recovery room will be recorded.

 If any complications (i.

e.

 nause, vomiting, itching, urinary retention, headache, agitation, weakness, dizziness, hiccups, bronchospasm, bradycardia, abdominal pain) develop the observation period will be extended until the patient fully recover.

 Whether the patient received radiocontrast material or not will also be recorded.

 The patients will be called by phone at the first week after the procedure and the status of the complications, any epileptic seizure attack, or increase in the number of seizures, any admission to emergency room or any in patient admission to the hospital will be recorded.
