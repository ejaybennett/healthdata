(firstQuint)Allogeneic Human Cells (hMSC) Via Intravenous Delivery in Patients With Mild Asthma.

 A Phase 1 investigation will be performed to test the safety of two doses of bonemarrow derived MSCs (20,000,000 and 100,000,000) administered via peripheral intravenous infusion.

 Group 1: 3 subjects will receive a single administration of allogeneic hMSCs: 20 million cells delivered via peripheral intravenous infusion Group 2: 3 subjects will receive a single administration of allogeneic hMSCs: 100 million cells delivered via peripheral intravenous infusion Interim safety analysis will be performed four weeks after the 1st subject is enrolled in each cohort.

 Continued safety and tolerability with review of adverse events (AEs) will be assessed at each visit.

 Efficacy parameters (pulmonary function tests, DLCO, lung volumes, 6MWT, and dyspnea/QOL questionnaires) will be assessed every 4 weeks until study completion.

 Clinical laboratory tests to assess safety will be performed at every visit.
