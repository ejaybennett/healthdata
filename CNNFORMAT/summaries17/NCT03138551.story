(secondQuint)Examining Relationships Between Family Mealtime and Feeding Outcomes in Young Children With Sensory Food Aversions.

 This pilot study will collect rich data from twenty participants on the feasibility and effects of a novel intervention, the Mealtime PREP, which has a dyadic focus on both the young child and the parent participants.

 The investigators will collect video recorded child meals in the home during a baseline period (under normal circumstances), during parent-training (while parents are practicing skills learned), and following parent training (when therapist support is withdrawn).

 This in depth examination of child meals will provide valuable information to guide the optimization of this intervention approach for future trials.
