(thirdQuint)Adductor Canal Block After Total Knee Replacement - a Suture-method Catheter vs a Standard Catheter vs a Single Bolus.

 The aim of the study is to compare the clinical effects of three different administration forms for an ACB: repeated intermittent boluses through a Certa catheter (CC) versus repeated boluses through a standard catheter (through the needle) (SC) versus a single bolus (SB).

 Our dual hypothesis is that repeated boluses through a catheter (either Certa or standard catheter) reduces opioid consumption (primary outcome), as well as reduces pain scores, enhances ambulation and muscle strength compared with a single bolus, and that the Certa catheter is superior to a standard catheter.

In this study we wish to investigate the analgesic effect of the administration of 0.

2% ropivacaine for an adductor canal block as repeated boluses (20 ml every 8 hours) through a new suture-method catheter or a standard perineural catheter compared with a single bolus (20 ml), in patients following primary total knee arthroplasty.
