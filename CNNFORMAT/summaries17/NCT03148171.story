(fifthQuint)Project PrEP-R: Network Support to Engage and Retain Younger Black MSM in PrEP Care.

 Project PrEP-R will recruit, consent and randomize 160 men, with 80 men randomized to each arm of the study.

 Men randomized to the control condition will receive standard PrEP care at each clinical site.

 Men randomized to the experimental condition will receive standard PrEP care and also will be asked to recruit a supportive contact from their social network.

 The support contact will then be engaged in a brief intervention designed to support their friend/family member around PrEP Care.

 Men and support contacts in the PrEP-R intervention also will receive booster sessions via telephone and text.

 All participants will complete surveys at baseline and at three and twelve months post intervention.
