(secondQuint)Different Epidural Initiation Volumes.

 90 minutes after combined epidural spinal catheter insertion, three different volumes (5 mL, 10 mL, and 20 mL) are administered with a patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) device through the epidural catheter.

 For each group, 0.

625% bupivacain + 2 1/2g/mL fentanyl, is administered.

 The visual analog scale, first analgesic demand time, the number of PCEA requirement per hour, morphine requirement, nausea-vomiting, itching, motor block, hypotension, and total consumed analgesic, and ephedrine amounts of the patients are recorded in the recovery room and at postoperative 2, 4, 6, 12 hours.

 Different Epidural Initiation Volumes@highlight

The aim of this study is to compare the effect of different epidural initiation volumes on postoperative pain scores, local anesthetic requirements, and motor block in patients who undergo patient controlled epidural analgesia for postoperative pain after cesarean section.
