(secondQuint)Immediate and Delayed Intrauterine Balloon in the Prevention of Adhesion Reformation After Hysteroscopic Adhesiolysis.

 Objectives To compare the efficacy of placing an Intrauterine Balloon immediately after surgery and delayed Intrauterine Balloon Dilatation Therapy after surgery in the prevention of adhesion reformation after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis.

 Patients The patients will be recruited from two centers, namely, the HysterscopyCenter of the Fuxing Hospital and TianTan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.

Before the surgery all patients with suspected Asherman syndrome will undergo preoperative evaluations, including a detailed history of the menstrual pattern, any previous intrauterine surgery, and reproductive history, as well as trans-vaginal ultrasonography.

The severity and extent of intrauterine adhesions will be scored according to a classification system recommended by the American Fertility Society (AFS) (1988 version).

 The inclusion criteria include [1] women aged 18-40 years; [2] moderate to severe intrauterine adhesion (AFS score5); [3] first episode of hysteroscopic adhesiolysis in the investigators hospital; [4] written consent obtained; and [5] agreement to have second-look hysteroscopy.

 The exclusion criteria include [1] minimal adhesion (AFS score 2 test.

 The reduction of AFS score in the two groups will be compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.

 A p value of < 0.

05 will be considered statistically significant.

 All statistical analysis will be carried out with the use of SPSS 21.

0.

 Outcome measures The primary outcome measure will include the degree of intrauterine adhesions and AFS score at follow-up.

 The secondary outcome measures will include the change of menstrual pattern after surgery and the need for re-operation.

The third outcome measures will include any complications including any clinicalinfection.

 Data processing and analysis The researchers will ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data by minimizing the number of personnel who handle subject data.

 In addition, computer data will be encrypted as required to maximize security, while paper documents will be locked in filing cabinets, with only authorized personnel having access to the information.

 Ethical considerations IUB dilatation has been published as a novel technique with no untoward complications identified to date.

 The procedure will be performed according to the methodology available in the literature and the study has gained approval from the local ethical committee.

 Consent All subjects will be given a detailed explanation of the study and sufficient time to consider participants.

 A written consent form will be signed by the patient and retained in the investigators confidential records.

 Immediate and Delayed Intrauterine Balloon in the Prevention of Adhesion Reformation After Hysteroscopic Adhesiolysis@highlight

In this prospective, randomized, controlled study, the investigators wish to compare the efficacy of immediate and delayed intrauterine balloon (IUB) therapy in the prevention of adhesion reformation after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis.
