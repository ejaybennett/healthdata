(fifthQuint)Children's Surgery in Sub-Saharan Africa.

 Introduction Research Collaboratives PaedSurg Africa aims to recruit surgeons and allied health professionals undertaking neonatal and paediatric surgery (PS) across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) - an area heavily neglected in global health prioritisation.

 Such research collaboratives are being increasingly utilised as a highly effective and efficient method of collecting large volume prospective data in a short period of time.

 A great recruitment incentive will be ethical group co-authorship of published results for all research collaborators.

 Global Paediatric Surgery In 2015, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (LCoGS) highlighted that 5 billion people worldwide do not have access to safe, affordable surgical care.

 The same year, the World Health Assembly (Resolution 68.

15) incorporated emergency and essential surgery and anaesthesic care within 'Universal Health Coverage'.

 In concordance with this, plans have arisen to exponentially scale up access to surgical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

 Children's surgery has yet to be formally recognised within these plans despite children forming up to 50% of the population in LMICs.

 SSA has the highest unmet need for surgical care in the world at 41 million cases per year (29% of the worlds unmet need).

 9% of the global surgical burden of disease is attributable to congenital anomalies.

 It is estimated that 2.

6 million children are born with a congenital anomaly in SSA each year.

 Hence, in order for the world to achieve the LCoGS goal of 80% coverage of surgical care by 2030, there must be a focus on scaling up neonatal and PS care in SSA where a significant proportion of the burden of surgical disease lies.

 To date there has been limited data published on neonatal and PS in SSA.

 Nwomeh et al undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of neonatal surgery in SSA and identified just 13 prospective studies and 38 retrospective studies between 1995 - 2014.

 The majority of these were single institutional studies, many with limited numbers.

 The results highlight poor outcomes with mortality rates of over 50-100% for conditions such as gastroschisis, which has mortality rates consistently under 4% in high-income countries.

 Similarly, the limited literature on PS in SSA highlights significantly poorer outcomes for common conditions such as appendicitis, intussusception and inguinal hernia.

 Surgery has largely been overlooked in global health prioritisation and funding, likely because of the perception of prohibitive cost and complexity of care.

 Conversely, recent health economic studies have amply demonstrated the overall cost-effectiveness of PS procedures; for instance investing in a paediatric inguinal hernia repair is similar to administering a tetanus vaccine or treating a patient with malaria in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYS)/ US$.

 This study aims to collect prospective data on five common neonatal and PS conditions across SSA, all of which have low morbidity and mortality (M&M) in high income countries (HICs), but reported poorer outcomes in SSA.

 It will be the first neonatal and PS cohort study across SSA and will undoubtedly form one of the largest prospective data sets in this region of the world.

 The five conditions to be studied are gastroschisis, anorectal malformation, appendicitis, inguinal hernia and intussusception.

 Gastroschisis The incidence of gastroschisis is increasing worldwide, as are the number of these patients presenting to hospital in SSA.

 In Pretoria, South Africa, there was a 35-fold increase in patients presenting with gastroschisis from the early 1980's to late 1990s.

 Centres such as Harare, Zimbabwe, report receiving up to 3-4 cases per week.

 The true incidence of gastroschisis is unknown in SSA, however studies suggest the incidence, at least in some regions, appears to be similar to HICs.

 With a prevalence of 5.

4/10,000 births, we can estimate that 1440 cases will be born each month in SSA.

 Mortality rates for gastroschisis have fallen dramatically in HICs from 60% in the 1960's to less than 4% today.

 This has resulted from improvements in neonatal resuscitation and peri-operative management, awareness of complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome, and the provision of parenteral nutrition (PN).

 Gastroschisis has been suggested as a bellwether procedure for neonatal surgery capacity in low resource settings because there are usually no co-morbidities, yet the condition tests all the key elements that go into the successful management of a newborn with a surgical condition.

 The data available regarding gastroschisis in SSA suggests significantly poorer outcomes than in HIC.

 Mortality rates have been reported as: 60% Malawi, 57-75% Nigeria, 84-100% Zimbabwe, 100% Uganda, 100% Cote'd'Ivoire.

 Mortality in South Africa is lower at 12-43%.

 In an international survey of gastroschisis, two thirds of the 25 institutions in SSA stated their mortality rate was >75% and the remaining third stated it was between 50-75%.

 There is great variation in the management of gastroschisis across the globe and even between surgeons within the same institution.

 Primary closure rates vary from 16%, particularly in centres where routine use of preformed silos (PFS) have been adopted, to 92%.

 The majority of staged closure in SSA is undertaken using a surgical silo; PFS are utilised less due to lack of availability and training.

 Some surgeons recommend primary palliative care in SSA.

 A randomised control trial of primary closure versus PFS has reported they have similar outcomes, however there is a trend towards fewer ventilator days with the latter.

 A meta-analysis highlighted that the studies with least selection bias show that PFS is associated with fewer ventilator days (P24 hours.

 In Kenya the main duration of symptoms at presentation was 5 days (1-14).

 It was noted that the median delay for those who died (6.

4%) was 5-days versus 3-days in those who survived.

 Surgical site infections following laparotomy for intussusception have been reported as high as 37.

5%.

 Management varies widely in SSA.

 In HICs most centres undertake air enema reduction (AER) as primary management in cases without peritonitis, perforation or non-responsive shock.

 This has been shown to be 1.

48 times more effective than hydrostatic reduction (61% and 44% respectively).

 Centres in SSA with access to AER report good success rates; in a study in Ghana AER was successful in 59-67% cases and their mortality rate was 2%.

 They note that AER costs 20% of the fee for surgical management.

 A study from Nigeria reports offering hydrostatic reduction to 40% of cases, where it is successful in 64%.

 They also highlight the significant cost savings.

 Ahmed et al in Egypt describe their simple AER equipment with a pressure release value at 120mmHg.

 They report an 88.

2% success rate with no complications.

 Wiersma and Hadley advocate the use of AER in the operating theatre, which has improved their reduction rate to 53% from 22%.

 Aim: To compare outcomes of five common neonatal and paediatric surgical conditions between SSA and HICs.

 Objectives: 1.

 To undertake the first multi-centre prospective cohort study across SSA to compare outcomes of common paediatric surgical conditions with benchmark data from HICs.

 2.

 To identify context appropriate interventions and peri-operative factors associated with an improved outcome.

 3.

 To form a research collaboration of paediatric surgeons and allied health professionals across SSA and help to enhance research capacity.

 4.

 To raise awareness and provide advocacy for neonatal and paediatric surgical care within global health prioritisation, planning and funding.

 Methodology Authorship: PaedSurg Africa constitutes a network of surgeons and allied health professionals who work with children requiring surgery across sub-Saharan Africa.

 This methodology is based on an equal partnership model previously described in the Lancet and utilised by a number of national and international collaboratives.

 Publishing journals will be asked to make all co-authors PubMed citable.

 Articles will be published under 'PaedSurg Africa Research Collaboration'.

 At the end of the article co-authors will be listed under the following headings: - Lead investigators: collaborators who have contributed to the study protocol, data analysis and write-up of the manuscript.

 - Country leads: collaborators who have recruited several sites in their country to contribute to the study.

 - Local investigators: collaborators who have gained ethical approval for the protocol in their centre and collected data at their site including patient identification and data completion with follow-up of mortality and complications.

 The study invites up to three local investigators per institution per month of data collection.

 Collaborator Recruitment: Primary recruitment will be through the lead investigators' personal contacts, which span many centres and countries across SSA, and the Pan-African Paediatric Surgical Association (PAPSA) mailing list.

 Research collaborators were recruited at the Global Initiative for Children's Surgery (GICS) Conference hosted by the Royal College of Surgeons of England, May 2016.

 A further recruitment drive will be undertaken at the PAPSA Conference in Nigeria (September 2016) where the research proposal will be presented, investigators actively sought, and REDCap sign-up, app download and project set-up achieved.

 Data Collection Tool: Prospective data will be collected over a 1-month period utilising the free, user-friendly, secure database, REDCap.

 The tool includes a Smartphone app that allows offline data collection.

 Data collection sheets that can be printed for written data collection and later uploaded will also be provided.

 Data collection will be open for any continuous 1-month period between October 2016 to April 2017, to optimise uptake.

 A pilot study will be run in August/ September 2016 at five institutions in SSA.

 Conditions Studied: The five conditions selected are common congenital or acquired neonatal and paediatric surgical conditions with low morbidity and mortality in HICs.

 Consequently surgical interventions for these conditions carry high avertable DALYs and cost-effectiveness ratios, as saving the life of a neonate or child with minimal long-term disability can permit a lifetime of labour and income for their family and their country's economy.

 Limited, mostly retrospective, individual institutional studies suggest significantly poorer outcomes of these conditions in SSA.

 Validation: At 5% of collaborating centres, one additional research collaborator will be asked to identify patients and upload the study data independent to the other research collaborator(s) at their centre.

 This data will be collected on a separate REDCap validation database and the inputted data will be cross-checked with that entered into the main database.

 Only patients with over 90% of data inputted will be included in the study.

 Data can be initially uploaded and completed at a later date prior to submission if any data is missing.

 Questionnaire Data: A short questionnaire will be undertaken by all research collaborators at the time of project sign up regarding the facilities and resources available at their institution.

 Estimated Population: Estimated patient numbers per centre during a 1-month study period are: 1-2 gastroschisis, 1-2 anorectal malformations, 11 appendicitis, 14 inguinal hernias, 1 intussusception (29 patients per centre).

 We aim to include a minimum of 50 centres, which would generate 1450 patients.

 Estimates were calculated using the mean number of patients presenting per month to all institutions from SSA who have published data on these conditions.

 Data Analysis: Power calculations were undertaken to determine the minimum detectable differences in mortality between SSA and benchmark data from HICs.

 These confirm that the study is adequately powered to detect a difference in mortality of each of the five conditions between SSA and HICs at a 5% significance level and 80% power.

 Outcomes in SSA compared to HICs will be presented as relative risks and significant differences determined using Chi-Squared analysis.

 Multi-level, multivariate logistic regression analysis will be utilised to identify context appropriate interventions and peri-operative factors associated with improved outcomes.

 For example: does availability of air enema reduction significantly reduce mortality from intussusception in the SSA context and if so, by how much? Results will be presented as odds ratios.

 Data will be adjusted for confounding factors such as delay in presentation.

 P<0.

05 will be deemed significant.

 Ethics: Full ethical approval for the project has been granted by the host centre, Kings College London Research Ethics Committee.

 Research collaborators in SSA will be required to receive approval for the project at their own centres according to local ethical regulations and provide evidence of this in order to submit data.

 If no formal ethics or audit committee exists, collaborators must provide written consent from the Director of the Hospital or Head of Surgical Department.

 All data will be anonymous.

 Data will not be identifiable at individual surgeon, institution or country level.

 Outcome: The results from this study can be used to advocate for enhanced neonatal and paediatric surgical care in SSA, at an institutional level, country level via 'National Health Strategic Plans' and at an international level.

 This is vital to ensure neonatal and paediatric surgery are appropriately prioritised over the coming 15-years as access to surgical care in low- and middle-income countries is scaled up following publication of the LCoGS and the WHA resolution 68:15.

 Participation in this international project will help to enhance research capacity amongst surgeons, anaesthetists and allied healthcare professionals across SSA.

 Formation of the PaedSurg Africa Research Collaboration will provide the infrastructure for future research projects and interventional studies to help improve outcome.

 Children's Surgery in Sub-Saharan Africa@highlight

Background: Five billion people worldwide do not have access to safe, affordable surgical care.

 A significant proportion live in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where up to 50% of the population are children.

 There is limited literature on neonatal and paediatric surgery in SSA and children's surgery does not appear on any of the National Health Strategic Plans for the 47 independent countries across SSA.

 Objectives: To form a collaboration of surgeons and allied health professionals involved in children's surgery across SSA and collectively undertake the largest prospective cohort study of paediatric surgery in this region.

 Materials and Methods: Data will be collected via REDCap website on all patients with gastroschisis, anorectal malformation, appendicitis, inguinal hernia and intussusception, during a 1-month period of collaborators choice between October 2016 to April 2017, with a 30-day follow up until the end of May 2017.

 Estimated study population: 1450 patients from 50 institutions.

 Full ethical approval has been granted by the host centre; local ethical approval will be required at collaborating centres for participation.

 All collaborators will be co-authors.

 Primary outcome will be in-hospital all-cause mortality.

 Secondary outcomes will include post-intervention complications.

 Data will be collected on institutional facilities, patient demographics, duration from condition onset to presentation, peri-operative resuscitation, intervention and outcome.

 Differences in outcomes between SSA and benchmark data from high-income countries will be calculated using chi-squared analysis.

 Multi-level multivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to identify interventions and peri-operative factors associated with improved outcomes; p<0.

05 will be deemed significant.

 Outcome: Results will be used to advocate for enhanced children's surgical services in SSA.

 We shall identify context-appropriate interventions associated with improved outcome.

 The collaboration will help to enhance research capacity in the region.
