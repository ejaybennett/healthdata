(thirdQuint)AtRial Cardiopathy and Antithrombotic Drugs In Prevention After Cryptogenic Stroke.

 ARCADIA is a multicenter, biomarker-driven, randomized, double-blind, active-control, phase 3 clinical trial of apixaban versus aspirin in patients who have evidence of atrial cardiopathy and a recent stroke of unknown cause.

 Eleven hundred subjects will be recruited over 2.

5 years at 120 sites in the NINDS StrokeNet consortium.

 Subjects will be followed for a minimum of 1.

5 years and a maximum of 4 years for the primary efficacy outcome of recurrent stroke and the primary safety outcomes of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and major hemorrhage other than intracranial hemorrhage.

 AtRial Cardiopathy and Antithrombotic Drugs In Prevention After Cryptogenic Stroke@highlight

Objectives - Primary: To test the hypothesis that apixaban is superior to aspirin for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke and atrial cardiopathy.

 - Secondary: To test the hypothesis that the relative efficacy of apixaban over aspirin increases with the severity of atrial cardiopathy.
