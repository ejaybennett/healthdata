(fifthQuint)Treatment of Chronic Migraine Headaches.

.

 A combination of dexamethasone, lidocaine and thiamine (pat.

), may bring changes in the pattern of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve signaling at the level vasa nervorum.

 These changes may down-regulate the hyperexcitable sympathetic signals at the level of adventitia and consequently the medial layer of vasa nervorum and providing long term relief from migraine headaches.

 However, a bilateral and simultaneous treatment of trigeminal and occipital nerves in migraine and craniofacial neuralgia using a combination of dexamethasone, thiamine and lidocaine has been rarely studied.

 The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of concomitant administration of dexamethasone, lidocaine, and thiamine compounds into the trigeminal nerve branches, the greater and lesser occipital nerve for the treatment of chronic migraine, and craniofacial neuralgia.

The purpose of the study is assessment of the safety and efficacy of the De-Novo therapy in the treatment of craniofacial neuralgia and migraine headaches.

This is an open-label study of simultaneous administration of combination of dexamethasone, lidocaine, and thiamine into the trigeminal nerve branches as well as greater and lesser occipital nerve bilaterally in one session.

 Patients who meet the exclusion and inclusion criteria are eligible for trial if they have experienced chronic migraine and craniofacial pain not responding to other prior therapies.
