(secondQuint)Vivacit-E Post-market Follow-up Study.

 Safety will be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events.

 Performance will be determined by assessment of the overall pain and functional performances, survivorship, health status and radiographic parameters of all enrolled study subjects who receive the Vivacit-E HXPE Liner with the Continuum acetabular shell.

 In addition, the implanted Vivacit-E HXPE Liners will be evaluated for bedding in, and linear and volumetric wear by the Martell 2-D method at 6 weeks and 1, 2, 4, & 5 years postoperatively.

 Pain and functional performance will be measured using the Harris Hip and High Activity Arthroplasty Scores.

 Survivorship will be based on removal or intended removal of the device and through analysis of radiographs, and health status will be determined by evaluation of the EQ-5D.

 Vivacit-E Post-market Follow-up Study@highlight

The objectives of this study are to obtain clinical performance (outcomes) data and survivorship for commercially available Vivacit-E (HXPE) liners.

 This will be done by analysis of polyethylene wear, validated outcome measurement tools, radiographs, and reported adverse events data.
