(thirdQuint)The Effect of a Probiotic Strain on Aspirin-induced GI Damage.

.

 The trial includes a run-in period of two weeks duration followed by a six weeks intervention period where a probiotic strain/placebo and Aspirin is co-administered.

 After the 6 weeks, probiotic strain/placebo is given for two additional weeks to investigate the potential effects of the probiotic strain on intestinal healing after long-time Aspirin use.

 Subjects will participate in the trial for a total duration of 10 weeks including the run-in phase.

 Besides the screening visit, the trial will consist of 6 visits.

 After having given their written informed consent, subjects will complete screening procedures to evaluate their eligibility for participation in the trial and complete a run-in period of two weeks duration to washout possible pre-trial probiotics and/or use of medication.

 After baseline assessments at Visit 2, subjects will start daily intake of 300mg Aspirin and also be randomly assigned to 8 weeks daily intake of active or placebo product in a ratio of 1:1.

 The Effect of a Probiotic Strain on Aspirin-induced GI Damage.

@highlight

This trial is a single-site, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-armed, parallel-group trial in healthy, adult volunteers.

 The trial will investigate the effect of daily intake of a probiotic strain versus placebo when co-administered to daily intake of 300mg of Aspirin.

 The objective is to investigate the ability of the probiotic strain to attenuate and/or reverse Aspirin-induced deterioration of the small intestine.
