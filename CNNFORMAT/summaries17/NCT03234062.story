(fifthQuint)Developing a Biomarker Panel to Assess Choline Nutritional Status.

 Choline (Cho) is an essential nutrient and most Americans' diets do not achieve the recommended intake.

 Diets low in Cho are associated with liver and muscle disease and with suboptimal fetal development, while diets too high in choline may be associated with increased risk for heart disease.

 Cho has several important functions.

 It is (i) a source of methyl-groups needed to make the primary methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine; (ii) a part of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (acetylCho); and (iii) a component of the major phospholipids in membranes (phosphatidylCho and sphingomyelin).

 The Cho derivative, phosphatidylCho (PtdCho) is a main constituent of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and is required for VLDL secretion and the export of fat from liver.

 Cho also is important for normal fetal development.

 Cho is a required nutrient and in 1998, an Adequate Intake (AI) and a Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) for Cho was established In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set a Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) for Cho based on the AIs as part of the new Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods (published in the Federal Register on May 27, 2016; FDA-2012-N-1210-0875, Federal Register Number:2016-11867).

 The AI/RDI varies by age and gender, but is 550 mg/d in adolescent and adult men and 425 mg/d in adult women (more in pregnant and lactating women) and 400 mg/day for adolescent women.

 Self-reported dietary intake is very hard to measure accurately, and for Cho this research group have demonstrated that self-report can significantly underestimate actual intake.

 There is no validated biomarker for choline status (the availability of the various forms of Cho needed to sustain optimal cellular function); measurement of plasma Cho concentrations is not adequate plasma choline is homeostatically regulated.

 Based on extensive preliminary and published data this group identified a panel of potential biomarkers that could be used to assess Cho status, and now they propose studies to validate this biomarker panel against measures of Cho pool size using isotope dilution.

 The largest stores of Cho are located in the liver, and mass resonance spectroscopy of liver has been used in the past to assess Cho status in humans.

 This method is not practical for use as a biomarker in clinical or public health practice as it is expensive and the availability of the instrumentation is limited.

 Liver biopsy is risky and not practical, making measurement of hepatic Cho and Cho metabolites concentrations a poor choice for assessing Cho status.

 Measurement of Cho concentrations in plasma alone is not an adequate marker for Cho status because Cho concentrations drop quickly to 70% of normal when a person is fed a low Cho diet, but do not decrease further with more severe depletion even in people starved for 7 days.

 The concentrations of PtdCho and sphingomyelin also decrease in people fed a low Cho diet, but these phospholipids alone are not adequate biomarkers for Cho status because they are carried as part of plasma lipoproteins, and vary in concentration with changes in fat and cholesterol transport by these particles.

 Thus, such measurements are useful but not sufficient as biomarkers for Cho status.

 Perhaps there is a panel of biomarkers that together will more accurately and reliably reflect Cho status.

 By making measurements in people fed incrementally reduced amounts of Cho, and comparing the biomarker measures to body total Cho pool size assessed using isotope dilution (a proxy for the availability of the various forms of Cho), investigators will be able to identify the combination of biomarkers and algorithm for calculating a Cho status score that best predicts total Cho pool size, and therefore predicts choline nutritional status (the availability of the various forms of Cho needed to sustain cellular function).

 In this pilot study, they are seeking to test a method for using stable isotope dilution to measure body choline stores, and then ask how this measure correlates with a panel of biomarkers in plasma and with liver fat measured using Fibroscan(R).

 Using isotope dilution can provide an estimate of the size of the body pool of Cho.

 Our proposed method is conceptually similar to the method for measuring total body water from a bolus dose of labeled water.

 Similar methodology was used recently in studies of metabolic flux of Cho in pregnant women.

 Isotope dilution is a well-established method used to estimate pool size for other nutrients, such as vitamin A.

 Similar to vitamin A, the major storage pools for Cho are in the liver, and ingested Cho is rapidly absorbed and accumulated by liver.

 This pilot study tests a method for using stable isotope dilution to measure body choline stores, and it correlates this measure with a panel of biomarkers in plasma and with liver fat measured using Fibroscan(R).

 People who eat diets low in choline should deplete their choline (Cho) stores, and measurement of Cho pool size using isotope dilution should reflect this depletion.

 The investigator will identify a biomarker panel that correlates well with measured Cho pool size across the range of different degrees of depletion.

 Developing a Biomarker Panel to Assess Choline Nutritional Status@highlight

People who eat diets low in choline (LC) should deplete their choline (Cho) stores, and measurements of Cho pool size using isotope dilution should reflect this depletion.

 Investigators will identify a biomarker panel that correlates well with measured Cho pool size across the range of different degrees of depletion.

The investigators propose that, as body stores of Cho diminish, cells and organs will reach the point when metabolism/function in the cell is altered, and that this will result in a progression of changes in biomarkers that reflect Cho status.
