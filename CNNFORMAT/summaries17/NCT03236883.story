(firstQuint)Nonmyeloablative Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer.

 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been successfully used for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancy.

 In recent years, non-myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (NST) has been introduced to treat solid tumors due to the Graft-versus tumor effect.

 In this study, the investigators try to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NST in the treatment of unresectable pancreatic cancer patients.
