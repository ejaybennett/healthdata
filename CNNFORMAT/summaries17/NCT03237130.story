(firstQuint)Prediction of Lymphatic Metastasis in Esophageal Cancer by CT Radiomics.

 This study proposes to establish an image feature extraction and selection method for identifying lymph node metastasis of esophageal cancer.

The study will consider the relationship between the main lesion and the suspected lymph node, extract association characteristics in order to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the CT radiomics-based prediction model for identifying metastasis lymph nodes.

 The study includes the construction of CT radiomics-based prediction model and the validation of the prediction model.
