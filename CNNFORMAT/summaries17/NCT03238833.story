(secondQuint)Poor Ovarian Responders Undergoing IVF Using Luteal Ovarian Stimulation Versus Follicular Ovarian Stimulation.

 Multiple follicular wave theory proposed by Baerwald et al.

 implied that follicle recruitment may occur in the luteal phase of menstrual cycle.

 Therefore, luteal phase ovarian stimulation (LPOS) was considered as a potential feasible stimulation method during in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle.

 In the beginning, in order to avoid delaying cancer treatment, LPOS was applied for fertility preservation of cancer patients, showing no difference in numbers of oocyte retrieved, mature oocytes and fertilization rate between luteal or follicular phase stimulation.

 In the recent, LPOS was used for infertility women, suggesting that LPOS owned quite good IVF outcomes.

 In previous studies, premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, a major reason worsening ovarian quality in poor ovarian responders (PORs), was seldom found in LPOS.

 High progesterone in luteal phase may aid in suppressing premature LH surge.

 An updated research claimed that numbers of oocyte retrieved, mature oocytes and fertilized oocytes in LPOS significantly increased when compared to follicular ovarian stimulation.

 Therefore, the investigators presumed that LPOS was a more effective method than follicular stimulation in PORs.

The investigators attempted to compare the clinical outcomes and cumulus genes expression in poor ovarian responders undergoing luteal ovarian stimulation or follicular ovarian stimulation in in vitro fertilization cycles.
