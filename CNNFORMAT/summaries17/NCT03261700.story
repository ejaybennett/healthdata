(fifthQuint)Recovering From Intimate Partner Violence Through Strengths and Empowerment (RISE).

 Women are the fastest growing group of VHA patients, with their population recently increasing by 80%.

 Women Veterans (WV's) are at higher risk for IPV than their non-Veteran peers, with that 1 in 3 WVs report lifetime IPV, compared to 1 in 4 women in the general U.

S.

 population.

 Research reports up to 30% of WVs experience past-year IPV.

 As a result, WVs are considered an important population for IPV screening and counseling interventions.

 In response, VHA Women's Health Services (WHS) and the IPV Assistance Program of Care Management and Social Work Services (CMSWS) are implementing IPV screening programs for women and are seeking an effective intervention to implement into care.

 Extant brief counseling interventions for IPV result in minimal effects on patients' health and safety.

 A recent review of IPV screening trials highlighted insufficient intensity of post-disclosure counseling interventions, concluding that existing interventions are too brief, unstructured, and generic.

 Such minimal intervention effects of the current standard of care have led leaders in the field to call for the development and testing of new and more comprehensive IPV interventions, especially for delivery in conjunction with primary care.

 The Recovering from IPV through Strengths and Empowerment (RISE) intervention fills this need.

 The PI, a clinical psychologist and health services researcher with expertise in and national recognition for IPV research and care, has developed an innovative IPV intervention to respond to this need.

 Recovering from IPV through Strengths and Empowerment (RISE) is based on the healthcare needs and preferences of WVs who have experienced IPV.

 RISE was developed using rigorous methods, building on the evidence base from the applicant's HSR&D CDA and on input of VHA primary care and behavioral health experts.

 RISE is based on empowerment, a highly relevant intervention model for women who experience IPV.

 It is an individualized, variable-length, modular-based intervention addressing key factors: - safety planning, - educating about the health effects of IPV, - improving coping and self-care, - enhancing social support, - making difficult decisions, and - connecting with resources.

 RISE incorporates aspects of Motivational Interviewing, an evidence-based approach designed to facilitate behavior change that is widely used in VHA for numerous health issues.

 This timely three-year proposal addresses the critical gap in current IPV care.

 It will refine and formally evaluate RISE using established methods for rapid and efficient effectiveness testing, including a Hybrid 1 randomized clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate RISE that simultaneously gathers information on barriers to and facilitators of implementation.

 The study is guided by the first two phases of the Replicating Effective Programs (REP) framework, pre-conditions and pre-implementation.

 These phases emphasize tailoring interventions with stakeholder input and iterative cycles of pilot testing within routine practice conditions.

 Use of the REP framework will maximize the likelihood that RISE-should its effectiveness be demonstrated-can easily be integrated into routine care in VHA.

 The Specific Aims of this study are as follows: 1.

 Tailor and refine RISE to accommodate differences in service structures and personnel in different primary care settings through input from a Stakeholder Advisory Board, focus groups with WVs (four groups; n=24-32), and qualitative interviews with providers (n=24).

 2.

 Conduct a formative evaluation of RISE with WVs (n=up to 20) to inform the development of a user-friendly, tailored implementation protocol and intervention manual.

 3.

 Examine the effects of RISE on WVs' (n=60) individual psychosocial outcomes (e.

g.

, empowerment, self-efficacy, health symptoms, service use, and quality of life) in an RCT that compares RISE to an information/referral condition.

 3a.

 Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of RISE in the context of the RCT.

 This study provides the groundwork to examine the effectiveness of RISE.

 The data will be used to demonstrate whether the effects of RISE appear promising to support a future-large scale effectiveness-implementation RCT, including the range of effect sizes that would be reasonable to expect in a future trial.

 This is a multi-site study.

 The project will be conducted at two Women's Health Practice-Based Research Network (PBRN) sites that have adopted IPV screening - the Women's Health Centers (WHC) at VA Boston Healthcare System and VA Connecticut Healthcare System.

 The investigators use two sites to better inform the refinement of RISE and understand variation in implementation characteristics, since the investigators are focusing on implementation at the early stages of intervention refinement and evaluation.

 The sites also differ in provider types within the clinic, which will allow us to refine and evaluate RISE in ways that accommodate diverse clinical structures and practices in VHA to maximize flexible delivery.

 Recovering From Intimate Partner Violence Through Strengths and Empowerment (RISE)@highlight

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major health concern for women Veterans.

 IPV is associated with numerous physical and mental health conditions.

 VHA is implementing IPV screening programs to identify female patients who experience past-year IPV.

 Despite strong evidence that screening increases detection of IPV, less is established about how to intervene following IPV disclosure in health care settings, in order to improve health outcomes.

 Existing healthcare-based interventions result in minimal effects on health and well-being, likely because they are too brief and generic.

 In response, the PI has developed Recovering from IPV through Strengths and Empowerment (RISE), based on the IPV-related health care needs and preferences of women Veterans.

 RISE is designed to be delivered in primary care and is an individualized, variable-length, modular-based intervention that addresses - safety planning; - education on the health effects of IPV; - increasing coping skills and self-care; - enhancing social support; - making difficult decisions; and - connecting with resources.

 This study is aimed at refining and evaluating RISE for use with female VA patients who have experienced past-year IPV.

 This brief counseling intervention is intended to be administered in conjunction with primary care, as this is a frequent point of healthcare contact for women Veterans and where disclosure of IPV is most prevalent.
