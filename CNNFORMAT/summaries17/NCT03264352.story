(fifthQuint)Intervention for High-normal or Borderline-elevated Blood Pressure in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes.

 The IPAD trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.

 12,000 patients will be recruited over three years with a median follow up of 3.

5 years.

 IPAD tests the hypothesis that antihypertensive medical therapy in adult patients with type 2 diabetes, whose seated BP ranges from 130 to 149 mm Hg systolic and 90 mm Hg diastolic, results in 35% reduction in the incidence of stroke, which is the primary endpoint.

 Secondary endpoints of this study include: a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal MI, hospitalization for heart failure and hospitalization for unstable angina; each single event listed above; all-cause mortality; renal dysfunction; diabetic retinopathy that needs interventional operation; peripheral arterial diseases; new on-set atrial fibrillation or flutter; cancer; change of health-related quality of life; cost-effectiveness of medications.

 Inclusion criteria for the study include T2DM patients aged between 35 and 75 years within the aforementioned BP ranges.

 The sitting systolic BP should decrease by at least 10 mm Hg systolic and to 130 mm Hg, using titration and combination of the double-blind study medications consisting of an angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker Allisartan (240 mg/day), a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (amlodipine 5-10 mg/day), and a hydrochlorothiazide (12.

5-25 mg/day).

 In the control group, placebo tablets will be used.

 Across the whole study, 282 primary endpoints are expected to occur.

 Interim analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis at the accumulation of every 100 primary endpoints.

 At the completion of the trial, both an intention-to-treat and a per-protocol analysis will be performed.

 Intervention for High-normal or Borderline-elevated Blood Pressure in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes@highlight

Lowering of blood pressure (BP) in high-risk hypertensive individuals reduces major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events.

 Diabetic patients with hypertension benefit from BP lowering treatment.

 The present trial,IPAD in brief, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study involving 12,000 patients to be recruited over three years and to be followed up for a median of three years and a half.

 IPAD tests the hypothesis that antihypertensive medications in adults with type 2 diabetes, whose seated BP 130-149 mm Hg systolic and below 90 mm Hg diastolic, results in 35% difference in the incidence of stroke.

 During follow-up the sitting systolic pressure should be decreased both by at least 10 mm Hg and lower than 130 mm Hg, by titration and combination of the double-blind study medications of an angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker Allisartan (240 mg/day), a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (amlodipine 5-10 mg/day), and a hydrochlorothiazide (12.

5-25 mg/day).

 In the placebo group, identical tablets will be used similarly.
