(secondQuint)Single and Multiple-Ascending Dose Study of CRN00808 in Healthy Volunteers.

 The single-dose phase initiates with ascending doses of an oral solution followed by a 3-way crossover food effect and bioavailability (capsule formulation) cohort.

 Serum IGF-1 levels and GHRH-analog stimulated GH levels will be assessed as pharmacodynamics measures.

 The first multiple-dose (7 days dosing) cohort will be initiated after the PK and safety data are available from the single-dose phase.

 Subsequent multiple-dose cohorts will have 10 days of dosing.

 Serum IGF-1 level and GH levels will be assessed as pharmacodynamics measures.

 The last cohort in the study is midazolam drug-drug interaction study.

 The dose will be selected based on review of all pharmacokinetic and safety data for the single-dose and multiple-dose cohorts completed.

 On Day 1, 8 subjects will receive a single oral 2 mg dose of midazolam.

 Starting on Day 3 through Day 8, subjects will receive daily doses of CRN00808.

 On Day 9, subjects will be administered CRN00808 and 2 mg midazolam together.

 Single and Multiple-Ascending Dose Study of CRN00808 in Healthy Volunteers@highlight

This single-center study will be conducted in 3 phases: a single-ascending dose phase (up to 8 cohorts, 8 subjects/cohort), a multiple-dose phase (up to 5 cohorts, 9 subjects/cohort), and a midazolam drug-drug interaction phase (one cohort of 8 subjects).
