(secondQuint)The efcacy of the Integrated Water Jet Channel Colonoscopy in Water Exchange Method.

 When the WE method colonoscopy were done with the accessory channel for both infusing and suctioning of water.

 The water had to be suctioned or infused alternatively and increaed the insertion time.

 With the new designed endoscopy that integrated a separate water jet channel for infusing water, infusing and suctioning of water can be done at the same time.

 Besides, water jet pumping system could provide a powerful jet to help us open the collapse lumen and keep an appropriate distance between the mucosa and the lens, thus preventing loss of visualization.

 It will help the colonoscopist to find the way during insertion.

This prospective randomized controlled trial compared integrated water jet channel colonoscopy with traditional accessory channel colonoscopy in cecal insertion time among patients undergoing WE method colonoscopy.
