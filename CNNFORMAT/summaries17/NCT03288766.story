(thirdQuint)SHERLOCK 3CG Diamond Tip Confirmation System.

 This study is intended to confirm the accuracy of the SHERLOCK 3CG cent Diamond TCS with the addition of MODUS II (SLM2) software to eliminate the need for post-procedural chest x-ray (CXR) in adult subjects with cardiac abnormalities that alter presentation of the P-wave.

 Atrial fibrillation will be the primary target while data on pacemaker driven rhythms and other arrhythmia types will also be collected to explore overall performance.
