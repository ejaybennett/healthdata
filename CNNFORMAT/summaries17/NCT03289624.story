(fifthQuint)SHARE for Persons With Chronic Conditions and Their Family Caregivers.

 This project offers a unique and timely opportunity to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the SHARE-Chronic Conditions psycho-social intervention.

 The project will adapt the SHARE intervention, for use with dyads facing the challenges of chronic conditions.

 The six-session SHARE-CC program will be implemented and evaluated using a randomized controlled trial with 240 participants in northern Ohio, the San Diego and San Francisco Bay areas in California, and New Jersey.

 The SHARE-CC intervention addresses the need for a structured approach that targets both members of a care dyad and empowers them to be actively involved in current and future care planning.

 It has great potential to not only improve psychosocial outcomes for families, but to also impact healthcare decision-making and utilization.

 Persons with chronic conditions and their caregivers will be interviewed prior to (Time 1) and after participating (approximately 4 months post-Time 1) in the SHARE-CC intervention or PWCC control group.

 SHARE for Persons With Chronic Conditions and Their Family Caregivers@highlight

SHARE-CC is an intervention for families facing the challenges of chronic conditions.

 SHARE-CC (Support, Help, Activities, Resources, and Education) addresses the need for both members of a care dyad to be actively involved in current and future care planning.

 This intervention aims to increase knowledge of services, improve communication skills and well-being, and facilitate the understanding of care values and preferences in order to create a mutually agreed upon care plan.

 This intervention will be tested in a randomized control trial.
