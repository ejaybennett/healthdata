(secondQuint)Measurement of Refractive SE Following Implantation of LS313 MF30 IOL.

 This is a post market study without invasive interventions.

 The patients have been treated with cataract surgery and MIOL Implantation at least 3 months ago.

 They will be invited for only one follow up visit to measure the postoperative refraction with different Autorefractor-Keratometers, a Manual Refractometer, the test device "iTrace" and with determination of the subjective refraction for distance and near with the appropriate corrections at the Department of Ophthalmology in Neubrandenburg, Germany.

 Measurement of Refractive SE Following Implantation of LS313 MF30 IOL@highlight

This Study determines the most precise method for measuring post-operative refraction following implantation of the asymmetric multifocal LS-313 MF30 comparing the results of Refraction of the different Autorefractor Keratometers with the subjective measurements for distance and near.
