(thirdQuint)A Self-efficAcy Intervention to reDuce Injecting Risk behAviour and hePatitis c reinfecTion Rates.

 The intervention will entail completing a volitional help sheet.

This will create implementation intentions, which are self-regulatory strategies taking the form of "if-then" plans (i.

e.

 situation-solution plan).

 Injecting risk behaviour scores and self-efficacy scores will be analysed for differences between intervention and control groups.

 To control for contact-time with the researchers, participants in the control group will spend approximately 20 minutes with the researcher exploring Zimbardo's time perspective constructs (ZTPI, Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999) and completing the short Zimbardo's time perspective inventory (Orosz et al.

 2017).

 The inventory was selected because the cognitive processes involved in accessing time constructs will also be activated in the intervention group for the planning of coping strategies and goal achievement during future injecting risk situations.

 The study also aims: - To assess the variability in injecting risk behaviour as explained by subjective norms, social connectedness and group identification constructs; - To assess the variability in intervention effectiveness as explained by changes in mental health, illness perception subjective norms, social connectedness, and group identification; - To determine the difference in therapeutic alliance between care pathways and to establish its mediating role on injecting risk behaviour, SVR rates and HCV reinfection rates.

The study evaluates the use of implementation intentions to increase self-efficacy and reduce injecting risk behaviour in a sample of injecting drug users on treatment for hepatitis C (HCV).

 The overall aim is to reduce HCV reinfection rates.

 The primary objective is to identify lower injecting risk behaviour scores in patients on treatment for hepatitis C receiving the psychosocial intervention compared to the same patient group assigned to the control group.
