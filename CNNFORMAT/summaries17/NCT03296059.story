(firstQuint)Transfusion of Red Blood Cells for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS) in Neonates.

 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the serious complications in critically ill neonates.

 It can result in severe hypoxemia refractory to mechanical ventilation.

 There are few options for mechanical ventilation for such situations such as high frequency oscillation ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

 The aim of the present study is to determine whether transfusion of red blood cells can decrease the mortality in neonate with ARDS.
