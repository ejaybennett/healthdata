(firstQuint)The Influence of Cholecystectomy on Secretion of Incretin Hormones.

 This is an observational, parallel-group study in 30 patients with gallstone disease and 10 healthy control subjects.

 In patients undergoing cholecystectomy a 4h-meal test (liquid mixed meal) will be conducted at baseline (1-2 weeks before surgery) and again within 4 weeks after the cholecystectomy.

 Healthy subjects will be submitted to a single 4h-meal test.

 Secondary endpoints include changes in plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon, GIP, PYY, gastrin, CCK, fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19) and bile acids.

 Furthermore, secondary endpoints include changes in gastric emptying (evaluated by the paracetamol method).

The effect of cholecystectomy on postprandial plasma GLP-1 responses (primary endpoint) and glucose metabolism will be evaluated in 30 patients planned to undergo elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
