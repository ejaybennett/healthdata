(thirdQuint)Study of the Efficacy, Safety and Quality of Life After TOOKAD Soluble (VTP) for Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer.

.

 This is a single center, single-arm, open-label, 60-month follow-up phase IIb clinical trial.

 The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the absence of biopsy detectable Gleason grade 4 or 5 prostate cancer tumors anywhere in the prostate gland on 12-month, post-treatment biopsy following TOOKAD(R) Soluble-VTP.

 Men with Gleason score 7 (3+4) prostate cancer on one half of the prostate will receive TOOKAD(R) Soluble VTP under general anesthesia.

 Treatment will consist in hemiablation procedure designed to destroy the lobe of the prostate gland that contains the Gleason score 7 (3+4) cancer.

 Afterwards, patients will be followed for 5 years (60 months) with clinical evaluation, questionnaires on QOL, erectile and urinary functions, and PSA testing.

 In addition, treatment outcomes will be assessed based on prostate biopsy results at 3, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after the TOOKAD(R) Soluble treatment.

 All patients will undergo biopsy at 3 and 12 months.

 If the Month 3 biopsy is positive for any cancer, patients will be allowed a single re-treatment by TOOKAD(R) Soluble VTP to one or both lobes.

Single center, single-arm, open-label, 60-month follow-up phase IIb clinical trial.

 Men with localized prostate cancer will receive TOOKAD(R) Soluble VTP under general anesthesia.

 To evaluate the absence of biopsy detectable Gleason grade 4 or 5 prostate cancer tumors anywhere in the prostate gland on 12-month, post-treatment biopsy following TOOKAD(R) Soluble-VTP in men with prostate cancer Gleason score 7(3+4).
