 Besides, the impact of the duration of tea consumption has not yet been investigated in the aforementioned studies.

 The present study was conducted as a retrospective research to investigate the relationship between both tea consumption amount and time and renal stone disease.

 Information on tea consumption was obtained by four closed-ended questions in questionnaires, and the diagnosis of renal stones was established on the results of abdominal sonography.
