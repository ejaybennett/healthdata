(thirdQuint)Sleep To Reduce Incident Depression Effectively.

 This project will assess the acute and long-term effectiveness of dCBT-I on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) sleep parameters: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), sleep onset latency, and wake after sleep onset in an insomnia cohort including those at elevated risk for depression (e.

g.

 high sleep reactivity, low SES, minority).

 This will be tested by administering internet-based dCBT-I to people with insomnia and adding face-to-face CBT-I in non-remitters (ISI > 10), as well aS comparing the RDoC sleep outcomes to an attention control group post-treatment and at 1 year follow-up.

 This study will also determine the acute and long-term effectiveness of face-to-face CBT-I for insomnia in non-responders to dCBT-I on RDoC sleep outcomes relative to a comparison group post-treatment and at 1-year follow-up.

 This study will also determine the effects of dCBT-I and CBT-I using a stepped-care model for prevention of incident depression and depression relapse.

 The 1-year rate of depression of both dCBT-I and CBT-I will be compared to a control group.

 This study will also evaluate changes in nocturnal rumination as a modifiable behavior (post-treatment) that mediates the effect of insomnia treatment on subsequent depression risk.

 This will also determine the moderating effects of important depression risk factors (e.

g.

 race, SES) on the change in sleep and depression outcomes.

 Sleep To Reduce Incident Depression Effectively@highlight

This project will assess the effectiveness of a stepped-care model (i.

e.

 digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (dCBT-I) followed by face-to-face CBT-I) in improving severity of insomnia and sleep outcomes in an insomnia cohort, including those at higher risk of depression.

 This project will also investigate the effectiveness of this stepped-care model in prevention of depression and any potential mediation by rumination as a modifiable behavior.
