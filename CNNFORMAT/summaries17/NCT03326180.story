(secondQuint)Study of Peri-Articular Anaesthetic for Replacement of the Knee.

 The trial design is a patient-blinded multi-centre, active comparator, randomised controlled two-arm parallel group superiority trial of liposomal bupivacaine plus bupivacaine hydrochloride versus bupivacaine alone for post-operative pain in patients undergoing knee replacement surgery.

 Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio.

 The randomised controlled trial (RCT) design is robust and reduces any potential bias.

 Patients will be blinded as to which treatment they receive.

 Blinding of patients is possible as they will be under general anaesthetic for their knee replacement surgery at the time of the drug administration.

 Blinding of surgeons, who administer the medication and outcome assessors was not necessary as the primary outcome is a patient reported outcome measure.
