(fifthQuint)Spatial Neglect and Delirium After Stroke.

 Delirium assessment and prevention has a tremendous impact on hospitalization outcomes and health care costs.

 Delirium is a multi-component syndrome characterized by an acute reduction in cognitive functioning, affecting awareness, thinking, attention, and memory.

 Stroke survivors, representing 17% of the US population aged 65 and over (CDC, 2012), are at major risk for developing delirium (up to 50% incidence in right-hemisphere stroke).

 Further, about 50% of right-hemisphere stroke patients experience spatial neglect, impairing safety and recovery.

 This study investigates a potential neural mechanism explaining the high incidence of both delirium and spatial neglect after right-hemisphere stroke.

 The study hypothesis is that the brain networks for arousal and attention, comprised of ascending projections from the mesencephalic reticular formation and integrating right-dominant dorsal and ventral cortical and limbic components, may be affected in these disorders.

 The study assesses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and behavioral data in right hemisphere stroke survivors.

 It is predicted that impaired activity and structural integrity of the brain networks for arousal and attention will correlate with behavioral signs of delirium and spatial neglect.

 The study will be conducted at two sites recruiting an acute (n=45) and a subacute (n=30) patient samples.

 The findings of this study have the potential to impact stroke care by providing a critical biomarker and behavioral profile of post-stroke delirium.

 This may alert clinicians to initiating preventive care and targeted interventions in patients who are at high risk of hospital morbidity and loss of independence.

 Study Hypotheses Hypothesis 1: It is hypothesized that a lesion-deficit analysis will reveal that in patients with delirium and/or spatial neglect, right-brain areas within the attention, orientation, and arousal networks are affected by stroke lesions.

 Hypothesis 2: Because it is hypothesized that both disorders stem from a dysfunction of common brain networks, it is expected that spatial neglect severity will be a predictor of delirium severity, controlling for relative lesion size and stroke severity Hypothesis 3: Both spatial neglect and delirium severity will be correlated with functional connectivity among the brain areas within the attention, orientation, and arousal networks.

 Hypothesis 4: Based on evidence from prior work in post-surgical delirium patients, neglect and coma patients, it is hypothesized that the integrity of white matter connections among brain regions comprising the cortical and subcortical networks for attention, orientation, and arousal is inversely correlated with the severity of delirium and spatial neglect.

 Planned Analyses: Hypothesis 1: To examine the critical network components affected in post-stroke delirium, the study will examine participants' structural scans.

 The structural scans recorded in the study will include a T1-weighted and a T2-weighted FLAIR image for 30 subacute stroke par-ticipants.

 In addition, clinical scans will be obtained for the 45 acute stroke participants, resulting in 75 total brain scans.

 Structural lesions will be mapped using a semi-automated lesion mapping in MRIcron package, where each brain voxel will be scored in a binary fashion as lesioned or non-lesioned.

 Three-dimensional lesion masks will be fed into VLSM 2 software implemented in Matlab (Voxel Lesion Symptom Mapping).

 For the pseudo-continuous outcomes, such as the Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT) and Confusion Assessment Method-Severity (CAM-S) scores, a t-score will be computed testing whether lesion in a given brain voxel predicts higher or lower severity score.

 For the binary outcomes, such as delirium diagnosis, for each voxel a Leibermeister measure will be computed testing whether a given lesioned voxel predicts delirium vs.

 no delirium across all participants.

 The analysis will serially travel through the brain voxels and conduct a test in each voxel.

 The voxels will be thresholded such that only those that co-occur in at least 5 patients will be considered.

 In a typical lesion study this will result in hundreds of voxels considered across participants.

 The final results are corrected for multiple comparisons using False Discovery Rate of p 6 months post-stroke) and 18 subacute (< 1 month post-stroke) participated in the pilot study.

 R-squared value of .

26 was obtained for the association between delirium and neglect severity.

 This gives an effect size (Cohen's f2) of .

35.

 With this effect size, there is over 99% power to observe the effect, assuming a sample size of 75 patients and an alpha of .

05 (Hypothesis 2) To estimate power of our lesion deficit analysis (Hypothesis 1), data was simulated using 15%, 30%, and 50% as proportion of the participant sample in whom the same voxel will be lesioned.

 Leibermeister approach was applied to compute p-values for testing the null hypothesis of no association between voxel lesion status and delirium status.

 With 75 participants (Acute+Subacute Sample) there is over 80% power to detect an effect, assuming that at least 30 percent of the sample have the same lesion, and the lesion is between 40-100 voxels, forming a tight cluster.

 These are reasonable assumptions given past studies.

 In the pilot study, a general linear model that included as regressor delirium or neglect severity score was applied to the 16X16 ROI connectivity measure matrix for each participant.

 The resulting t-scores for the between-subjects effects were in the range of 4.

61 to 7.

88 for the BIT measure and 7.

07 to 9.

31 for the CAM-S.

 These t-scores correspond to a large effect size.

 Using a Cohen's f of .

35 (large effect) to estimate power for linear multiple regression, with 4 predictors, an alpha level of .

05, and a two-tailed test, it is estimated that there will be 87% power to observe this effect, given a sample of 30 participants (Acute sample) (Hypothesis 3).

 A previous study reported thalamus fractional anisotropy (FA) of .

315 (.

026) in delirious compared to .

333 (.

023) in non-delirious patients.

 These values correspond to a large Cohen's d effect size.

 Assuming that FA values in a similar range will be observed, there is excellent power to detect these effects with a linear multiple regression model.

 Based on average patient flow, is is estimated that up to 20 patients will be screened monthly for study eligibility at each site.

 Based on recruitment rates of the pilot sample, it is estimated that 10-20% of the screening sample will be consented.

 Factoring in a conservative dropout estimate of 25-40%, it is more than likely that the proposed study sample will be recruited.

 To account for patient attrition, the study will over-recruit the target sample by 5 patients.

 Estimated rates of delirium and neglect after right brain stroke are around 50% .

 Therefore, around 50 of the study sample is expected to have neglect, delirium, or both.

 In addition to using delirium/neglect status as a dichotomous variable, quasi-continuous severity scores for each variable will be used, which will increase the power to detect associations between these two disorders and brain lesion locations.

 Spatial Neglect and Delirium After Stroke@highlight

The goal of this study is to understand what brain mechanisms become disrupted when stroke survivors experience delirium.

 Delirium is an acute reduction in attention and cognition, associated with poor recovery, longer hospitalization and even death.

 One major factor increasing the risk of delirium after stroke may be spatial neglect occurring after stroke on the right side of the brain.

 Spatial neglect affects awareness, orientation, and movement.

 The study will test the hypothesis that the right-dominant brain networks for arousal and attention are affected in both of these disorders.

 It is expected that the activity and structural integrity of these brain networks will correlate with behavioral signs and severity of delirium and spatial neglect.

 To test this hypothesis, the study will measure spatial neglect and delirium symptoms in 45 acute (NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue ) and 30 subacute (Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation) stroke survivors and evaluate brain scans for these participants.

 This study may contribute to knowledge about brain bio-markers of delirium, which will greatly aid in delirium detection in stroke and other disorders.
