(firstQuint)Use of Sodium Bicarbonate in Patients Treated With Topiramate.

 Children on topiramate are at a risk of renal tubular acidosis and subsequent development of renal stones.

 Sodium bicarbonate has been shown to reduce renal tubular acidosis in other populations.

 To date, no data exist on the efficacy of correction of renal tubular acidosis in pediatric patients on topiramate.

 We are proposing to investigate the efficacy of 4 weeks of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy to reduce tubular acidosis in patients on topiramate.
