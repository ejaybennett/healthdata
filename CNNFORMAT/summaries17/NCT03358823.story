(firstQuint)Study on the Brain Network of Angelman Syndrome.

 1.

 The patients recruitment: from Chinese Agnelman syndrome patients group (Angelhome : angelman225@126.

com) 2.

 Fistly all patients will entry the online questionnaries, all patients will be carified by telephone ,and parts of will be carified face to face.

 All the information will be enterd in the Angelman syndrome database, based on the information , we will analyze and summarize the relationship of phenotype and genotype.

(n=200).

 3.

 The patients who go through informed consent , will be scaned the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and recored the Neural-EEG .

 The patients will divided in to four group according to the genotype (1.

 deletion of 15q11-13; 2 UPD of 15q11-13; 3.

 ID 4.

 Ube3a mutation ) .

 the Brain Network of Angelman Syndrome based on Multi-modal Brain Image and Neural-EEG Data,analysis the difference of four genetic group.
