(firstQuint)Pre-Screening Study to Identify MTAP Loss in Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphoma.

 Study AG270-PS-001 is a pre-screening study to identify subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma in which the MTAP protein has been lost.

 Subjects whose tumor tissue has lost the MTAP protein may be considered for future enrollment into a Phase 1 clinical study of an experimental drug, AG-270, that is designed to inhibit the growth of tumors lacking this protein.

 Identification of the loss of MTAP will rely solely on the evaluation of archival tumor tissue samples by IHC.

 This study is therefore non-interventional.
