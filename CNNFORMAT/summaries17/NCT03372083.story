(thirdQuint)Safety Study of Crushed Deferasirox Film Coated Tablets in Pediatric Patients With Transfusional Hemosiderosis.

 - The study will include a screening period (from Day 0-14) with two visits at least 7 days apart to assess eligibility of patients that are chelation naive or on a prior iron chelator treatment other than DFX.

 For Patients on DFX treatment prior to study entry only one screening visit (screening visit 1) will occur to determine eligibility.

 Any current chelation therapy except deferasirox will be discontinued to undergo a 5-day washout period prior to commencing a 24 week treatment period with crushed deferasirox FCT.

 - All patients will have weekly visits for the first month to monitor renal function.

 Hepaticfunction will be assessed biweekly during the first month.

 Thereafter, monthly safety assessments will be performed, including the monitoring of serum ferritin values and trends in order to adapt patient treatment.

 Eligibility, application of dosing standards and adjustments, as well as safety and serum ferritin assessments as specified in the protocol, will occur in accordance with the EU label throughout the study.

 - Patients will continue therapy up to 24 weeks.
