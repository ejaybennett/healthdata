(thirdQuint)Psoriatic Arthritis Research Collaborative: Biologic Sub-Study.

 Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that can be associated with devastating outcomes including irreversible joint damage.

 The management of a patient with PsA is extremely challenging due to the high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity.

 The ultimate goal of this proposal is to prepare pragmatic trials in PsA trials that will encompass all relevant subgroups of patients.

 The aims of this study specifically focus on responses to biologic therapy among patients with PsA and determining the optimal set of outcome measures for PsA trials.

 Psoriatic Arthritis Research Collaborative: Biologic Sub-Study@highlight

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis with substantial variation in clinical features.

 We propose a multicenter collaborative approach to better understand the phenotypes and current management of PsA in the United States.

The central goal of this proposal is to obtain the data necessary to design a pragmatic trial in PsA.
