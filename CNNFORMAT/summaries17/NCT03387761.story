(thirdQuint)Neo-Adjuvant Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma COmbination-immunotherapy.

 This is a Phase Ib single-arm trial to evaluate the safety of short-term preoperative therapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab in patients with high-risk resectable urothelial cancer (upper urinary tract allowed), defined as: - T3-4aN0 OR - T1, cN+ OR - T1, any N, resectable retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis The primary endpoint of this trial is safety.

 We will determine the number of patients that have surgical resection at < 12 weeks, as this is an endpoint that is clinically meaningful for this population.

 patients.

 Patients will be receiving: - Day 1: Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (wk1) - Days 22: Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg + Nivolumab 1 mg/kg (wk4) - Day 43: Nivolumab 3 mg/kg (wk 7) - Day 57-71: Radical cystectomy or nefro/ureterectomy with appropriate lymph node dissection (wk9-11) In the initial phase, 12 patients will be enrolled and followed until resection.

 If toxicity is manageable, enrolment will continue to a total of 24.

 CT scans will be required at baseline and week 7 to evaluate response to immunotherapy.

 Post-cystectomy, a post-cystectomy study visit including laboratory tests will be performed on day 7 to evaluate toxicity.

 Patients attend their final study visit for physical examination and laboratory testing 28 days post-surgery.

 After this final visit, patients will be followed according to standard clinical guidelines.

 Tumor biopsies/material preservation is required at baseline and during surgery.

 An important secondary endpoint is translational.

 The main testable hypothesis is that a significant percentage of nonresponse can be explained by immune-inhibitory processes.

 Absence of immune infiltrates, presence of significant numbers of regulatory T-cells and presence of significant numbers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells will be compared between responders and nonresponders.

 The efficacy will be defined as the percentage of pathological complete response (pCR) at cystectomy (secondary endpoint).

In this single-arm trial we will investigate the safety of short-term preoperative therapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab in patients with high-risk resectable urothelial cancer.

 We will determine the number of patients that have surgical resection at <12 weeks, as this is an endpoint that is clinically meaningful for this population.

 24 patients will be included.

 All patients will be receiving a sequenced scheme of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab.
