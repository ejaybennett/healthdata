(fifthQuint)68Ga PSMA PET for Patients With Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer.

 This study evaluates PSMA-HBED-CC labelled with Gallium-68, abbreviated 68Ga PSMA.

 This is a radiotracer that attaches to receptors in the membrane of prostate cancer cells.

 The 68Ga PSMA is identified using a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner.

 It is believed that 68Ga PSMA will identify prostate cancer more precisely than normal imaging methods (MRI, CT, or ultrasound).

 Imaging is key to successful treatment - disease must be identified to be treated.

 Men who have biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer are invited to test 68Ga PSMA.

 Participants undergo the 68Ga PSMA PET scan before further treatment.

 Clinical information, including any MRI, CT, or ultrasound imaging and biopsy/surgery information, will be used to determine if the 68Ga PSMA PET imaging was better than the standard imaging.

 The study team will collect this information for about 1 year after the PSMA scan.

 Depending on findings, participants may be invited back for a second 68Ga PSMA scan.

 This is done if the first scan showed positive lymph nodes or soft tissue metastases but a surgery or biopsy result does not.

 The results from these scans will be shared with the participant.

 Results will also be entered into the participant's medical record and shared with the treating oncologists.

 68Ga PSMA PET for Patients With Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer@highlight

This study investigates if a new drug (PSMA) makes prostate cancer easier to identify in positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging.

 If this works, prostate cancer treatments can be prescribed that match the location of the disease.

 PSMA is radiolabeled with Gallium-68 (Ga-68).

 This means a participant receives a small dose of radiation from the drug - less than the annual radiation limit for a medical worker.

 To test this new drug, participants will receive an injection of Ga-68 PSMA and then have a PET scan.

 This PET scan, and the reported results, will be entered into the medical record and shared with the treating oncologists.
