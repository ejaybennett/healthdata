(thirdQuint)Assessement of Viral Shedding Duration After a Respiratory Tract Infection in Oncology and Hematology Patients.

 The development of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests has greatly improved the diagnosis of respiratory tract viral infections by increasing its sensitivity and the diversity of viral species detected.

 However, there are few data concerning respiratory tract viral infections amongst hematology and oncology patients.

 Especially, the duration of viral shedding following an infection has not been much studied whereas it is a source of inter-individual transmission between immunocompromised patients who are more likely to develop severe disease.

 Studies conducted so far concerned mainly hematology patients.

 They have shown that viral carriage could last up to one month and a half in some patients with hematological malignancy.

 The aim of this study is to determine the duration of the viral shedding in patients from hematology and oncology units after a respiratory tract viral infection for the ten main viruses involved in order to better manage these infections and to better prevent their transmission.

 Assessement of Viral Shedding Duration After a Respiratory Tract Infection in Oncology and Hematology Patients@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess the duration of the viral shedding in hematology and oncology patients after a respiratory tract viral infection.

 This duration has not been much studied in that population whereas it is probably longer than that in immunocompetent patients.

 Thereby it may be a source of transmission amongst these immunocompromised patients.
