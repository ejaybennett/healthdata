(fifthQuint)Flaxseed Consumption, Alone and in Combination With the Mediterranean-like Diet, on Some Indicators Related to Atherosclerosis.

 A randomized placebo controlled clinical trial will be conducted in Rajaie Cardiovascular Center in Tehran, Iran.

 After review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria and explanation of the design of the study, written consent form will be completed.

 The participants are 81 eligible coronary artery disease patients, aged 20-75 years.

 Intervention groups will be received 30 g/d flaxseed, alone, or with weekly Mediterranean-like diet menu and control group will be received capsules of wheat fiber as placebo for 3 months.

 Vascular endothelial function will be evaluated through measurement of flow mediated dilatation (FMD) in brachial artery and carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT) via ultrasound sonography and plasma level of asymmetric di-methyl arginine (ADMA).

 Fasting blood sample will be taken to measure malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid profile, high sensitive C-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines (Interleukine-6 [IL-6] and Tumor Necrosis Factor-a [TNF-a]).

 Flaxseed Consumption, Alone and in Combination With the Mediterranean-like Diet, on Some Indicators Related to Atherosclerosis@highlight

Flaxseed consumption has beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors.

 In addition, the benefit of the Mediterranean-like diet in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases has been shown.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of flaxseed consumption, alone and in combination with the Mediterranean-like diet, in adjunct to conventional medical treatment, in improving vascular endothelial function, plasma lipid profile and high sensitivity c-reactive protein of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.
