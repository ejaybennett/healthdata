(fifthQuint)Clinical Concordance Study Between Watson for Oncology and Clinician Practice.

 This study was approved by the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University ethics committee.

The investigators would randomly selected cancer patients, including lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer,rectal cancer,cervical cancer and ovarian cancer patients, from the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University database according to the criteria of Watson for Oncology(supplementary materials).

 Case data would be extracted and input into the Watson system.

 WFO provided therapeutic recommendations in three categories: recommended, for consideration, and not recommended.

 Data would be analyzed retrospectively to compare the WFO's recommendations and actual therapeutic regimen in the hospital.

 Some actual regimen applications that were not available in WFO will be defined as "physician's choice".

 Overall, physician's recommendations would be defined as concordant with WFO if they corresponded to the recommended or consideration categories and as non-concordant if they corresponded to the not recommended or not available categories.

 Clinical Concordance Study Between Watson for Oncology and Clinician Practice@highlight

At present, Watson for Oncology has been applied in 14 countries worldwide, including China, the United States, Holland, Thailand, India, Korea, Poland, Slovakia and Bangladesh.

 In a double-blind study involving 362 patients in India, treatment recommendations from Watson for Oncology (WFO) performed a high degree of consistency with their multidisciplinary tumor board.

 The investigators would recruit cancer patients diagnosed as lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer,cervical cancer or ovarian cancer according to the criteria of Watson for Oncology ,using the updated version of Watson for Oncology to explore the concordance of therapeutic regimen between WFO and physicians in the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University.
