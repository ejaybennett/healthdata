(firstQuint)Effects of Total Parenteral Nutrition on Skeletal Muscle Genomics.

.

 Randomized study investigating alterations in muscle protein metabolism at provision of parenteral nutrition.

 The study uses a genomic/transcriptomic/proteomic approach to evaluate factors related to activation of skeletal muscle protein synthesis.

 Patients scheduled for major gastrointestinal surgery are included.

 Muscle specimens are collected during surgery.
