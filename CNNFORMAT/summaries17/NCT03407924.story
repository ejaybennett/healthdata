(secondQuint)Exercise and Rehabilitation After Traumatic Brain Injury.

 Exercise-based therapies can promote recovery of function and are easily implemented in the clinical rehabilitation setting.

 This study will determine if exercise facilitates recovery by improving markers of neuroplasticity and decreasing neuroinflammatory responses.

 The investigators will also determine if variations in genes involved in neuroplasticity, memory and inflammation influence the responsiveness to exercise and rehabilitation.

 Particular genetic polymorphisms involved in neuroplasticity and inflammatory responses will be evaluated.

 Recovery will be determined by assessing cognitive function, life quality and balance.

 Exercise and Rehabilitation After Traumatic Brain Injury@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of exercise on recovery after traumatic brain injury.

 Investigators will determine if exercise enhances rehabilitation by increasing substances (proteins) that can facilitate recovery.
