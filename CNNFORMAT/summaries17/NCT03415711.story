(fifthQuint)PRObiotic VSL#3 for Maintenance of Clinical and Endoscopic REMission in Ulcerative Colitis.

 This is a Phase II a, parallel-groups, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, dose finding study in subjects with UC in remission.

 Two different oral doses of VSL#3(R) added to standard therapy (5-ASA) will be investigated compared to standard therapy (5-ASA) plus placebo (in a 1:1:1 ratio).

 All patients will receive standard therapy for maintaining remission.

 39 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment arms for the 12-month treatment period as following: - group A: 13 patients will receive mesalamine 2.

4 g/day in once daily administration plus VSL#3(R) 450 billion sachet, two sachets per day for 12 months (900 billion of bacteria per day) - group B: 13 patients will receive mesalamine 2.

4 g/day in once daily administration plus VSL#3(R) 450 billion sachet, two sachets twice a day (1800 billion of bacteria per day) for 12 months - group C: 13 patients will receive mesalamine 2.

4 g/day in once daily administration plus placebo for 12 months.

 Subject participation in this study will be approximately 20 months which includes up to a 8-week screening period, a 12-month treatment period, and a 6-month follow-up period.

 At the conclusion of the 12-month treatment period, subjects will continue in the 6-month follow-up period (telephone contact conducted after 6 months).

 PRObiotic VSL#3 for Maintenance of Clinical and Endoscopic REMission in Ulcerative Colitis@highlight

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by chronic inflammation limited to colonic mucosa.

 Its pathogenesis is not still clear, even if a multifactorial aetiology has been advocated.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy of two different doses of VSL#3(R) added on standard therapy (5-ASA) in maintaining remission in an adult population of patients with UC, compared with the standard therapy (5-ASA) plus placebo.

 The investigators hypothesized that adding VSL#3(R) to mesalamine would lead to higher remission rate at long-term evaluation.
