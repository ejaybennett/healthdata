(secondQuint)Custom Cutting Block Instrument vs Regular Instrumentation Total Knee Replacement (TKR).

 This is a randomized controlled trial.

 Patients will be randomized to have their knee implanted using either the patient-specific custom cutting blocks or the regular instrumentation system.

 Functional and radiographic outcomes will be assessed in a blinded fashion.

 The Smith and Nephew Legion Primary(R) total knee system will be used in both groups; this is an implant with a good long term track record based on the Genesis II design.

 All surgeons have used and are familiar with the regular instrumentation.

 They will be instructed in the use of the patient-specific custom cutting blocks prior to study initiation.

To determine if the use of patient-specific custom cutting blocks for implantation of total knee components results in improved limb alignment and component positioning compared to regular instrumentation.
