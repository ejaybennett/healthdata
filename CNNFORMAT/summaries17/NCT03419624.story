(thirdQuint)The Potential of Dapagliflozin Plus Exenatide in Obese Insulin-resistant Patients.

 In this proof-of-concept study the potential of treatment with Dapagliflozin plus Exenatide added to high-dose intensive insulin therapy compared to Placebo added to high-dose intensive insulin with active insulin up-titration for change in HbA1c from baseline to week 28 shall be explored and generate initial data on the primary outcome.

 We hypothesize that SGLT-2 inhibition and GLP-1 receptor agonism may be a rational combination therapy that addresses a broad range of pathophysiological defects associated with T2DM in obesity and may reduce HbA1c levels in patients with severe insulin resistance.

 In a third treatment arm, patients will be treated with Exenatide monotherapy added to high-dose intensive Insulin therapy to study additive effects of Dapagliflozin and Exenatide.
