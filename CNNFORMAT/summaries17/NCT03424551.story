(thirdQuint)Effects of Vibration on Presynaptic Inhibition.

 This study will include 15 patients with spastic spinal cord lesions and 15 healthy control.

 Soleus T-reflex, soleus H-reflex, soleus tonic vibration reflex (TVR), and reflex muscle response induced by whole body vibration will be evaluated this study.

 To obtain the H-reflex response, the posterior tibial nerve in the popliteal region will be stimulated by using a stimulator (FE155 Stimulator HC ADInstrument, Oxford UK) with 1 ms-pulse current.

 The records will be taken with the Ag / AgCl electrodes (Kendall (R)Coviden, self-adhesive electrodes) placed on skin according to the SENIAM protocol.

 To obtain T-reflex response, an electronic reflex hammer (Elcon 100-150 Germany) will be used.

 After H-reflex and T reflex records at rest, to obtain Tonic vibration reflex, local vibration will be applied to the Achilles tendon at 50,100,120 and 150 Hz.

 To obtain the reflex response induced by Whole body vibration, vibration will be applied at 28, 31, 34 and 37 Hz.

 Posterior tibial nerve stimulation will be performed again to determine Hmax during whole body vibration and local vibration.

H-reflex records will be taken while the subject is sitting on a chair.

 The data will be recorded with the PowerLab data acquisition device (ADInstrument Oxford UK).

 For Whole-body vibration, PowerPlate Pro5 (London UK) will be used.

 Effects of Vibration on Presynaptic Inhibition@highlight

The aim of this study is to demonstrate whether whole body vibration-induced muscle activity is a reflex response in patients having spasticity due to the spinal cord injury.

 Hypotheses of this study: Unlike healthy cases, in patients with spastic spinal cord lesions 1.

 Local vibration-induced tonic vibration reflex response disappear 2.

 The the whole body vibration- induced reflex muscular response disappear
