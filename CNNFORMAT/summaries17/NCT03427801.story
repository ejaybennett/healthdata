(firstQuint)Effect of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent Therapy in Patients Receiving Palliative Care of Chronic Kidney Disease.

 Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) has been commonly used to manage patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis.

 The effects of ESA, however, are unclear.

 This study compares the result of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) versus supportive care for chronic kidney disease patients receiving palliative care.

 The investigators design a retrospective observational study to evaluate the effect of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in treating anaemia of renal disease among adult patients receive palliative care instead of dialysis.

 The primary objective is to assess whether ESA can reduce the transfusion burden and hospitalization.
