(fifthQuint)Just TRAC It! Transitioning Responsibly to Adult Care Using Smart Phone Technology.

 Many adolescents and young adults living with chronic health conditions lack knowledge about their medical condition and confidence communicating with health care providers.

 Despite various positions statements on transition by the Canadian Pediatric Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association, there is limited evidence on the impact and effectiveness of transition interventions.

 Due to the convenience and accessibility of technology, adolescents embrace technology-based interventions to aid in their disease management and to improve their transition experience.

 However, there is a paucity of evidence-based apps in contrast to countless existing apps that are not evidence-based, which act as a barrier to physicians prescribing them.

 There is a pressing need for credible evidence on the effectiveness and value of health apps in improving self-management skills in adolescents.

 Instead of redesigning a mobile app, the Just TRAC It! encourages youth to use existing functions on their personal phones to track their health information.

 This information is easily retrievable when visiting health care providers and can help youth take ownership in managing their own health.

 This free option, using the technology already on most phones, can be used for any patient population or disease category.

 The use of Just TRAC It! allows youth to electronically document all medical information that would previously be printed on their MyHealth Passport, but may offer additional functionality in terms of learning to manage their health.

 Further investigation is warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of Just TRAC It! on improving patient knowledge, self-management skills, and transition readiness.

 The Stollery Children's Hospital is an international leader in pediatric to adult cardiology transition research, with two randomized clinical trials completed (CHAPTER 1 Trial, Mackie et al, Heart 2014 and CHAPTER 2 Trial, Mackie et al, BMC Cardiovascular 2016) and a 3rd in progress.

 The Just Trac It! Trial is an extension of our prior work.

 The results of the CHAPTER 1 Trial inform the current standard of care for transition interventions currently offered to all 16-18 year olds in our program who have had prior cardiac surgery, and this standard of care is the "usual care" (control) group for the Just Trac It! Study.

 Just TRAC It! Transitioning Responsibly to Adult Care Using Smart Phone Technology@highlight

The Just TRAC It! study (Transitioning Responsibly to Adult Care using smart phone technology) is a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the impact of using smart phone technology in combination with the nurse led transition intervention, versus the current standard of care (nurse led transition intervention including MyHealth Passport), on preparing adolescents with chronic cardiac disease to successfully transition from pediatric to adult cardiology care.

 "Just TRAC it!" is a mobile-health intervention designed to teach youth to manage their health using existing functions on their mobile devices.

 We propose to conduct a nurse-led intervention that encourages adolescents to use "Just TRAC it!" while addressing the healthcare transition needs of 16-18 year olds.
