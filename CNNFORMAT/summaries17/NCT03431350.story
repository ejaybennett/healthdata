(secondQuint)A Study of Niraparib Combination Therapies for the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.

 This multicenter study will evaluate safety and efficacy of niraparib in combination with other anti-cancer agents.

 The first combination study will combine niraparib with the anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 monoclonal antibody, JNJ-63723283 (niraparib combination therapies) in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

 This study will be conducted in 2 parts: in Part 1 (dose selection), participants will be enrolled to explore 2 doses of niraparib and JNJ-63723283; and Part 2 (dose expansion) will evaluate the combination therapy in an expanded number of participants.

 In Part 2, participants will be enrolled into 2 cohorts, biomarker positive and biomarker negative.

 The study will have 4 phases: A Prescreening Phase, a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow-up Phase.

 Study evaluations will include efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK), PK/pharmacodynamics, biomarkers, safety and tolerability.

 Participants' safety and efficacy during Part 1 will determine the doses used for Part 2.
