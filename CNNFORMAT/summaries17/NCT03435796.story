 Long-Term Follow-up Protocol for Subjects Treated With Gene-Modified T Cells@highlight

This is a prospective study for the long-term follow-up (LTFU) of safety and efficacy for all pediatric and adult subjects exposed to Gene-modified (GM) T cell therapy participating in a previous Celgene sponsored or Celgene alliance partner sponsored study.

 Subjects who received at least one GM T cell infusion, will be asked to roll-over to this LTFU protocol upon either premature discontinuation from, or completion of the prior parent treatment protocol.
