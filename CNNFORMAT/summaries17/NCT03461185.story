(thirdQuint)Anti-angiogenesis Combine With EGFR-TKI in Advanced Non-squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause from cancer in China.

 Epidermal growth factor receptor Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) have been approved to treat NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation as first-line therapy.

 However, a large proportion of patients would become acquired resistant of EGFR-TKI after about one year although initially sensitivity.

 Anti-angiogenesis therapy plus EGFR-TKI has been demonstrated valid and safe in NSCLC patients.

 Apatinib, endostatin, anlotinib belong to anti-angiogenesis drugs and can inhibit tumor growth.

 In this study, we plan to recruit NSCLC patients who are assessed as stable disease ( according to RECIST) under treatment of EGFR-TKI.

 Then, these patients would be divided into two groups: single EGFR-TKI or EGFR-TKI plus anti-angiogenesis drugs.

 Progression free survival, overall survival and safety are our evaluation events.

 Anti-angiogenesis Combine With EGFR-TKI in Advanced Non-squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

Epidermal growth factor receptor Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) have been approved to treat NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation as first-line therapy.

 However, the acquired resistance of EGFR-TKI is a common and severe problem.

The study explore the superiority of anti-angiogenesis drugs (Apatinib, endostatin, anlotinib) plus EGFR TKI versus single EGFR-TKI.
