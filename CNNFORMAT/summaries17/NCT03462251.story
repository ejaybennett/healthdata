(thirdQuint)Ribociclib and Aromatase Inhibitor or Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab for Metastatic Breast Cancer in First Line.

 This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, two-arm, multicenter, interventional phase III trial in Germany.

 The study will include adult, postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with visceral metastases, who received no prior therapy for advanced disease.

 160 patients will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 (stratified by the presence of lung and / or liver metastases) to receive Arm A: a combination of ribociclib and AI; OR Arm B: paclitaxel +/- bevacizumab Treatment will be continued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or death.

 Progression-free survival (PFS) will be based on tumor assessments by local radiologists/investigator using RECIST v1.

1 criteria.

 Treatment might be continued beyond RECIST-defined progressive disease (PD) in case of negligible or clinically irrelevant disease progression according to the investigator's discretion until clinically relevant disease progression or symptomatic deterioration.
