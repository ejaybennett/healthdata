(secondQuint)The Influence of the Crown-implant Ratio on the Crestal Bone Level and Implant Secondary Stability.

 The patients participating in the study (n=30) had one single tooth implant - a short (OsseoSpeed cent L6O4 mm, Implants) or a regular implant (OsseoSpeed cent L11 and L13O4 mm, DENTSPLY Implants) - placed in the maxilla.

 The evaluation was based on clinical and radiological examination.

 The crown-to-implant ratio was determined by dividing the length of the crown together with the abutment by the length of the implant placed crestally.

 Mean crown-to-implant ratios were calculated separately for each group and its correlation with the MBL (marginal bone loss) and stability was assessed.

 The authors compared the correlation between the C/I ratio values, MBL and secondary implant stability.

The aim of the study was to determine whether implant length and the crown-to-implant (C/I) ratio influence implant stability and the loss of the surrounding marginal bone, and whether short implants can be used instead of sinus augmentation procedures.
