(secondQuint)Comparison of Two Volar Plating Systems for Distal Radius Fractures.

 This study represents a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing two different systems of volar plate osteosynthesis in patients with distal radius fractures.

 Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the present study provided they give their consent.

 Informed written consent will be obtained.

 Envelopes will be prepared containing equal number of cards representing either the conventional or the novel plating syste.

 On the morning of the surgery a randomly picked envelope decides allocation one of the study groups.

 Patients will be blinded to treatment until completion of the study.

 Patients allocated to the control group receive Aptus 2.

5(R) volar plate for distal radius fractures (Medartis AG, Basel, Switzerland), while patients in the study group will receive the plating system INTEOS 2.

5(R) (Hofer GmbH and Co KG, Austria).

 In the control group, the pronator quadratus muscle will be cut prior mounting of the plate, while in the treatment group the plate will be inserted underneath the pronator quadratus leaving the muscle intact.
