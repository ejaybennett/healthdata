(firstQuint)Freezing of Gait, Cognition and Asymmetry?.

 Alteration of cortical circuits in PD leads to cognitive dysfunctions associated with the development of FoG.

 The asymmetric degeneration of the corticostriatal dopaminergic circuits affects differently cognition in PD patients with right side (RPD) and left side (LPD) motor symptoms onset.

 The study was aimed to investigate the role of cognition and asymmetric dopaminergic depletion in FoG.
