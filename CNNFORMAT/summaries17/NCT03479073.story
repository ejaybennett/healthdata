(firstQuint)Risk Factors of Stroke or Systemic Embolism After Atrial Fibrillation Ablation.

 Since catheter ablation for AF reduces the burden of AF effectively, several studies have demonstrated that catheter ablation not only improves the quality of life but also reduces the risk of stroke and all cause mortality.

 However, until now the guideline has recommended the continuation of oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy in patients who are at risk of stroke or systemic embolism (SE) based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score, even though they have sinus rhythm following catheter ablation.

 The aims of this retrospective study is to assess the rate of stroke/SE during follow-up period after AF ablation and identify the independent risk factors for stroke/SE in patients who underwent catheter ablation for AF.
