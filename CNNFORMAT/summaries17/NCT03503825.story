(fifthQuint)[Tc-99m]-RPI-087 as an Imaging Marker in Osteoarthritis of the Knee Compared to Healthy Volunteers.

 This is a Phase 1, non-randomized, open label, single centre clinical trial.

 6 healthy volunteers (3 male and 3 female,4 study visits) and 6-18 subjects with Osteoarthritis of the knee (3 study visits) will be enrolled.

 At visit 2, all subjects will have knee pain assessed, using a visual analogue scale, prior to receiving a single, 925 MBq (25 mCi)+/-10% dose of[Tc-99m)-RPT-T-087 injection.

 Knees will be imaged with a SPECT/CT camera at specified time-points post injection.

 Safety monitoring will include vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory tests (serum biochemistry, haematology, urinalysis) and adverse event monitoring.

 Additionally, HVs will have whole body planar imaging and blood sampling conducted at Visit 2 and 3 to evaluate bio-distribution, estimate dosimetry and measure clearance of total activity over time in blood samples.

 A final follow-up visit will be conducted by phone interview.

 Once 6 HVs and 6 KOA participants have completed the study, a blinded assessment of the image data will be conducted to determine whether any more KOA subjects should be imaged.

 [Tc-99m]-RPI-087 as an Imaging Marker in Osteoarthritis of the Knee Compared to Healthy Volunteers@highlight

The main purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of T-087.

 The study will enroll 6 healthy volunteers (HVs) and 6-18 subjects with KOA.

 All eligible subjects will receive an intravenous injection of the radioactive investigational product (T-087), followed by SPECT/CT imaging of the knees and blood tests and clinical assessments for safety monitoring.

 Healthy volunteers will also have their whole body imaged and have extra blood drawn to determine where T-087 goes in the body.

 These additional procedures will be done on the same day as the ip administration, and repeated the following day.

 All subjects will have a final follow-up phone call within 2- 3 business days following the ip administration.
