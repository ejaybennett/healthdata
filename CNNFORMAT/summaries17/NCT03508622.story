(secondQuint)Group Telehealth Weight Management Visits for Adolescents With Obesity.

 Background As noted above, EMPOWER is a multi-disciplinary, team-based clinic model, involving physicians, psychologists, registered dietitians (RDs), and physical therapists (PTs) providing tertiary care management of obesity.

 Data from the first two years of EMPOWER show that patients with four or more visits (n=109) experienced a decrease in average BMI z-score (-0.

09SD).

 This, though modest, is promising; however, both cost and patient retention present significant challenges to EMPOWER and other tertiary care pediatric obesity programs, and may be barriers to further progress.

 Much administrative personnel time is consumed in working with insurers in order to authorize visits, and nevertheless, this type of hospital-based care is poorly reimbursed.

 Getting to Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) is often a major challenge for our patients, due to the large urban sprawl of Los Angeles, traffic, limited and expensive parking, and poor public transportation.

 Frequent visits result in missed work and school days, a burden to families.

 Adolescent patients face even greater challenges, as they learn to manage their own health and balance the emotional and social changes required in the transition to adulthood, with family and parental expectations and limitations.

 Telehealth technology presents an innovative, cost-effective, and often highly-engaging alternative to in-person visits, which bypasses many of the logistical difficulties of getting to CHLA.

 Moreover, adolescents today are highly attuned to, and aligned with, digital and mobile technologies, and are natural consumers of media in this format.

 There is strong evidence from numerous published studies that telehealth can be an effective tool for chronic disease management.

 Additionally, many youth with obesity are significantly socially isolated, and our current individual patient-provider model does not effectively address this isolation in the way we expect a group session will; various published studies of group treatment have demonstrated inter-participant support and positive effects of social interaction.

 While Empower's current model leads to successful weight management in many of its patients, that success is often modest, as alluded to above; and for some of patients, it simply does not work.

 With this study, the investigators intend to pilot a group telehealth model targeted at adolescents with obesity.

 Specifically, the investigators aim to: 1.

 Pilot a new care delivery model for CHLA EMPOWER patients using group telehealth visits.

 2.

 Assess the feasibility of using telehealth with adolescent patients 3.

 Test the efficacy of group appointments using telehealth Hypotheses: 1.

 Use of shared medical appointments via telehealth is a feasible, cost-effective care delivery model for adolescents being treated for obesity.

 2.

 Efficacy of this model will be comparable to, or better than, standard multi-disciplinary in-person visits.

 This will be measured by: a.

 Clinical and anthropomorphic data: i.

 Changes in Body Mass Index (BMI), BMI percentile, and BMI percent of the 95th percentile ii.

 Change in blood pressure percentile iii.

 Change in hemoglobin A1C, ALT, triglycerides b.

 Quality of life c.

 Self-efficacy d.

 Satisfaction 3.

 Attendance to telehealth visits will be better than attendance to standard in-person visits, as measured by no-show rates and same-day reschedules Methods and study design: Youth 14-18 years of age who meet EMPOWER clinic criteria and consent to the study will be prospectively randomized to the intervention telehealth group (n=24) or the standard EMPOWER group (n=24).

 Since the investigators do not expect a statistically significant difference in BMI change between the telehealth intervention and standard EMPOWER, power calculations were conducted on change scores in Quality of Life indicators.

 Using Optimal Design software v1.

77 and specifying a = 0.

05, anticipated effect size = 0.

40, between-group variance ranging around 0.

05, and controlling for effects of the covariates on Quality of Life outcomes at 3 and 6 months, it is expected that 24 participants per condition will provide a moderate power to identify a treatment effect for proof of concept purposes.

 The intervention group will receive: - Group telehealth sessions twice per month for 6 months.

 The group sessions will be 60 minutes and involve delivery of a semi-structured curriculum including topics such as nutrition education, reducing barriers to physical activity, and mindfulness techniques.

 Sessions will be facilitated by EMPOWER providers (physicians, psychologists, RDs, and PTs) who will use a combination of: 1) motivational interviewing techniques, modified for the group setting, 2) supportive exploration of barriers to behavior change and 3) setting SMART goals.

 - Brief individualized coaching by the program coordinator between sessions via telephone or email.

 It will be comparable to the personalized feedback and motivation provided in standard EMPOWER.

 - Parent telehealth sessions once a month.

 It is widely recognized that teens' families must be willing to make changes in order to increase their child's chances for success in weight management.

 More practically, most food is purchased and prepared by parents or older family members, so it is essential that they receive education and support as well.

 - Intervention group participants will also be given Bluetooth enabled scales and will be asked to weigh in once a month.

 Comorbidities such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, PCOS, and NAFLD will be managed remotely through prescriptions and follow-up lab work and/or imaging coordinated with the patients' primary care physicians.

 Control subjects will receive the standard EMPOWER model consisting of monthly in person clinic visits where they meet individually with a combination of providers (physician, RD, PT, and/or psychologist).

 Both intervention and control participants will have in-person visits at baseline, 3 and 6 months to measure weight, vertical growth, and blood pressure, and complete questionnaires assessing quality of life, self-efficacy and satisfaction.
