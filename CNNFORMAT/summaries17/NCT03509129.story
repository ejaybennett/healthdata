(secondQuint)Columbia Moves Physical Activity.

 This 3-month randomized controlled trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of a novel, technology-oriented physical activity intervention characterized by existing social networks and a team competition.

 Participants will be recruited via emails, fliers, and word of mouth.

 They will be randomized to a technology-mediated physical activity treatment (TECH) or a treatment which receives an identical intervention as TECH plus a study designed team competition for physical activity promotion (TECH+COMP).
