(fifthQuint)Palliative Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in Advanced Incurable Breast Cancer.

 Study design: Prospective interventional phase I/II study Study area: Tata Medical Center, Kolkata Aims and objectives: Primary objective To assess the toxicity using CTCAE version 4 and LENTSOMA toxicity criteria, in advanced incurable breast cancer patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy schedule of 35 GY in 10 fractions Secondary objectives 1.

 response rate after radiotherapy measured using the PERCIST criteria at 3 months.

 2.

 Change in quality of life measured using trial outcome index (TOI) at 2 weeks after radiotherapy.

 3.

 Measure the change in PHQ4 score at 2 weeks after radiotherapy.

 To assess the impact of hypofractionated breast radiotherapy schedule of 35 GY in 10 fractions over 2 weeks on quality of life in advanced incurable breast cancer patients using FACT B scores PHQ4 questionnaire To assess the feasibility of voluntary breath hold technique for heart sparing in left sided breast cancer patients.

 To biobank tissue and blood for future radiobiology tests Consent: All patients will be recruited after obtaining informed consent.

 Sample size: A total of 30 patients will be recruited in this phase I/ II study.

 Among these 30 patients at least 10 patients will be recruited with left sided breast cancer on which feasibility of voluntary breath hold technique for heart sparing will be tested.

 Statistical analysis: Given that this is a phase I/II study a 30 patients sample is used as a feasibility study.

 Primary end point of this study is acute toxicity and secondary endpoint is radiological response, quality of life after radiotherapy ( from baseline) .

 Acute toxicities are defined as toxicities happening during and at 3 months after radiotherapy.

 Medcalc version 12 will be used for statistical analysis.

 Paired Student t test (2-tailed) was applied to compare the results from the different time points.

 The level of significance will be taken as P /= 2 for brachial plexus).

 Minimum , maximum and median dose to the left anterior descending artery will be recorded for left sided breast cancer patients undergoing voluntary breadth hold technique.

 In case where optimal dose constraints criteria for heart and lung could not be met in order to cover the gross tumour volume in breast or axilla; essential criteria should be met ( V10.

5 Gy for lung <31%, V8.

75 Gy for heart <11%).

 Assessment of toxicity: Acute toxicity will be assessed weekly during radiotherapy then monthy for 1st three month after completion of radiotherapy.

 Acute toxicity will be graded according to CTCAE version 4 toxicity criteria.

 If CTCAE Gr 3 desquamation is seen the patient will be reviewed weekly until the desquamation is resolved to CTCAE gr 1 or less.

 If the patient somehow fails to attend for the toxicity assessment, a telephone questionnaire will be asked to assess grade of skin toxicity.

 Modified LENT-SOMA scale will be used for scoring various grades of late effects occurring in brachial plexus after radiation therapy at 3 months,6 months and 1year .

 Assessment of response: Clinical assessment: Tumour size measurement will be done pretreatment and 3 months after completion of radiotherapy.

 Patients will be assessed for symptoms like breast pain, ulcer, arm oedema , shoulder stiffness and others at baseline .

 If the patients have any of these symptoms then : for Pain in breast visual analogue scale will be used to score the pain (score 0-10), ulcer and arm oedema will be graded according to CTCAE version 4, shoulder stiffness will be recored as yes/no response.

 Symptom assessment will be repeated at 2 wks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

 Radiological assessment: All patients will have a baseline regional PET-CT scan of breast (including axilla and supraclavicular fossa) done before start of radiotherapy and three month after completion of radiotherapy another regional PET-CT scan of breast will be done.

 Response will be assessed using PERCIST 1.

0 criteria .

 Assessment of quality of life: Quality of life will be assessed by using FACT B scale and anxiety/mood symptoms will be assessed by a 4 question screen (PHQ4) before start of radiotherapy, after completion of radiotherapy and 3 month, 6 months and 1 year after completion of radiotherapy.

 For patients who are unable to travel, the quality of life rating will be done over telephone for the 3 months, 6 months and 1 year follow up.

 Follow up:Weekly during radiotherapy, then monthly for 1st three months, then 3 monthly for two years, then 6 monthly for next 3 years.

 Data Safety Monitoring An independent data safety monitoring committee (IDMC) will be instigated to monitor the progress of the trial.

 Two radiation oncologists, a surgeon and a lay person will be in the committee to ensure safety of patients.

 The IDMC will meet in confidence after a first phase of recruitment of 6 patients (20% of the sample size).

 The second meeting will be done after 10 patients are recruited and the third meeting after 20 patients recruited.

 A report of the findings and recommendations will be produced following each meeting and a summary of the minutes will be submitted to the PI, and if required, the Institutional review board.

 Liability/Indemnity/Insurance: Indemnity arrangements will be made as required.

 Palliative Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in Advanced Incurable Breast Cancer@highlight

This prospective phase I/II study to assess the clinical toxicity and investigate the clinical response of breast cancers to a 10 fraction hypofractionated course of radiation therapy in advanced incurable breast cancer patients.

 This study would also investigate the feasibility of voluntary breath hold technique for heart sparing in left sided breast cancer patients.

 An intervention radiation therapy dose of 35 Gray in 10 fractions over 2 weeks, 5 fractions per week, 1 fraction per day will be studied within this clinical trial.

 Primary objective of the study is to assess the toxicity using CTCAE version 4 and LENTSOMA toxicity criteria, in advanced incurable breast cancer patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy schedule of 35 GY in 10 fractions .

 Secondary objectives are 1.

 response rate after radiotherapy measured using the PERCIST criteria at 3 months.

 2.

 Change in quality of life measured using trial outcome index (TOI) at 2 weeks after radiotherapy.

 3.

 Measure the change in PHQ4 score at 2 weeks after radiotherapy.

 Additionally to assess the feasibility of voluntary breath hold technique for heart sparing in left sided breast cancer patients and to biobank tissue and blood for future radiobiology tests.

 A total of 30 patients will be recruited in this study.

 Among these 30 patients at least 10 patients will be recruited with left sided breast cancer on which feasibility of voluntary breath hold technique for heart sparing will be tested.

 Patient will be followed up weekly during radiotherapy, then monthly for 1st three months, then 3 monthly for two years, then 6 monthly for next 3 years.
