(secondQuint)Influence of Injection Technique of Premixed Insulin on Glucose Excursion in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

 A total of 60 patients with type 2 diabetes who used premixed insulin will enrolled in this study.

Measure their blood pressure,height and weight, BMI, liver and kidney function, blood lipids, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, 2 hour postprandial glucose,fasting C peptide, 2 hour postprandial C peptide, fasting glucagon, 2 hour postprandial glucagon,fasting serum insulin,2 hour postprandial serum insulin,urinary albumin and insulin antibodies.

The first and second days,the patients inject premixed insulin themselves,the specialist nurse graded the patient's injection technique score.

The third and the fourth days the nurse change a new insulin with the same types maintain the same injection dosage.

The patient need perform continuous glucose monitoring system(CGMS) for 96-hours.

 Influence of Injection Technique of Premixed Insulin on Glucose Excursion in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus@highlight

To compare patients and nurses using insulin pen injector to inject premixed insulin respectively, using continuous glucose monitoring system to evaluate the glucose excursion in the two sets, study the relationship between glucose excursion and inject technique in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
