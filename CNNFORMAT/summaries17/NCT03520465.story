(thirdQuint)Utility of a Supraaponeurotic Mesh as Prophylaxis of the Midline Eventration After an Oncological Colorrectal Resection.

 Randomized prospective experimental study, in which we evaluate patients with CRC who underwent elective intervention for supra-infraumbilical midline laparotomy in order to: Main objective: - To assess the effect of the prophylactic mesh in the eventration rate diagnosed by CT at one year after surgery in patients with CRC who underwent elective intervention for supra-infraumbilical midline laparotomy.

 Secondary objectives: - To compare the appearance of complications in the control group and in the experimental group.

 - Compare costs derived from short and long-term mesh placement in both groups.

 We consider as treatment the supra-aponeurotic mesh positioning (experimental group), and compare it to the standard closing with slow absorption monofilament.
