(secondQuint)The Effects of Elliptical Cross Training Bike for Stroke Patients.

 In a single-blind, randomized controlled intervention, patients were randomly assigned to an active cycling group (ACG, n=25) five times a week combine with conventional al physical therapy or a control group (CG, n=25) with conventional physical therapy 3 weeks of training in the center.

 All outcome measures were administered at the beginning of the study, at the end of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd week.

 All participants will be divided two groups.

 One group will be experiment with conventional physical therapy as control group (CG), the other group will active cycling as active cycling group (ACG) with elliptical Cross Trainer & Exercise Bike after conventional physical therapy.

 Baseline assessment of muscle tone by Myoton-3, Modified Ashworth Scale used as a simple measure of spasticity; Barthel Index scale for performance in activities of daily living; Berg Balance Scale to measure balance; the upper and lower limb subscale of the Fugl-Meyer assessment for motor function of extremities; and BTS G-WALK was used to measure gait parameters.

 The data will be collect before session.

To investigate the effects of elliptical cross bike exercises combine conventional physical therapy on gait, postural control, balance, muscle tone, spasticity, quality of life, motor functioning, functional activity, and ADL in post stroke patients.
