(thirdQuint)Referred Pain Areas in Subjects With a Recovered Radius Fracture.

 Musculoskeletal injuries, nociception and pain can increase the sensitivity of the central pain mechanisms, which can be extended even after tissue recovery.

 However, little is known about the status of these central pain mechanisms once subjects are fully recovered from the tissue injury and pain.

 This information would help to explain pain conditions in which recurrence of the pain episodes is common (e.

g low back pain or shoulder pain).

 Pressure-pain thresholds have been widely used in pain research to test the sensitivity of the pain system.

 Additionally, referred pain has been shown as a valid biomarker for the sensitization of the pain system.

 The aim of the present study is to investigate pressure pain sensitivity and referred pain patterns of individuals with a history of recovered fracture, compared with healthy controls.

 Referred Pain Areas in Subjects With a Recovered Radius Fracture@highlight

The purpose of the present study is to investigate pressure algometry and pressure-induced referred pain areas in pain free individuals with a history of distal radius fracture (fully recovered) compared with age and gender matched healthy controls without history of fracture.

 It is hypothesized that individuals with a recovered radius fracture will have a facilitated referred pain patter towards the wrist but normal pressure pain sensitivity.
