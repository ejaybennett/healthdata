(firstQuint)Accuracy of Computer Guided Versus Conventional Ridge Splitting of Horizontal Deficient in Maxillary Anterior Alveolar Ridge.

 PICO P- Horizontal deficient alveolar ridge in Anterior Maxillary Region I- Computer guided surgical cutting guide C- Conventional alveolar ridge splitting O- Clinical outcome and radiographic outcomes Primary outcome: Accuracy In computer Guided: CBCT will performed pre-operative and post-operative for measure the difference of degree in superimposition after ridge splitting.

 In conventional method: Ridge mapping will applied in preoperative clinical evaluation, and measure in post-operative, the difference in splitting will calculate in millimeter (mm) Secondary outcome: Thickness of buccal cortical plate In both technique CBCT will performed and measuring the Both Buccal and palatal cortical bone in millimeter(mm).
