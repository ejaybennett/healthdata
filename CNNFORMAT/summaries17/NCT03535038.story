(firstQuint)Measurement of Intravascular Volume Using USG of IVC Diameter Compared to VPW Chest X-ray.

 Approval from Ethical Committee of Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia was acquired prior conducting the study.

 Validation and reliability test were done for USG operators by assessing IVC in 20 patients supervised by intensivists.

 Subjects were given informed consent before participating in the study.

 Subjects underwent the chest x-ray examination with supine position.

 The measurement of VPW was done by radiologists, considered normal if the value is 53 5 mm, overload if VPW > 71 mm.

 The subjects then underwent the IVC diameter measurement using USG Philips En Visor C, with transthoracal subcostal approach.

 The result is considered normal if IVC diameter is 1.

5 - 2.

5 cm and overload if >2.

5 cm, otherwise the subjects is excluded.

 If the IVC can not be done, subjects will be excluded.
