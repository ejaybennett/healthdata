(firstQuint)Intraoperative Cryoanalgesia for Extended Pain Management Following Thoracotomy.

 The ICE Study is a single institution pilot study designed to compare standard therapy (i.

e.

, thoracic epidural) versus a novel approach (i.

e.

, Cryoanalgesia combined with thoracic epidural) to address the need for better management of acute and long-term pain in the general thoracic surgery patient population.

 The study's primary objective will be to demonstrate if the new intraoperative pain management approach [i.

e.

, intercostal Cryoanalgesia in conjunction with thoracic epidural] provides superior short-term and long-term analgesia efficacy in patients undergoing unilateral thoracotomy as compared to the current institutional standard of care (i.

e.

, thoracic epidural).

 Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 design.
