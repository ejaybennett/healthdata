(firstQuint)Trigger Point Dry Needling vs Trigger Point Dry Needling With Intramuscular Electrical Stimulation.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate if trigger point dry needling with intramuscular electrical stimulation is more effective in decreasing pain and disability in individuals with sub-acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) than with trigger point dry needling alone.

 The investigators are using a within subjects randomized crossover study that will recruit 30 active duty military personnel or beneficiaries from William Beaumont Army Medical Center and all associated clinics.

 The investigators hypothesize that individuals with LBP will exhibit larger improvements in pain and disability when receiving trigger point dry needling with intramuscular electrical stimulation than when receiving trigger point dry needling alone.
