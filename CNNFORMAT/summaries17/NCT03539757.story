(secondQuint)Development of Novel MRI Methods for Detecting, Discriminating, and Measuring Liver Fibrosis and Congestion in Fontan Patients.

 The purpose of this study is to develop noninvasive MRI methods for detecting, discriminating, and measuring liver fibrosis and congestion in the adolescent and adult Fontan population by correlating quantitative imaging measurements with histopathologic data, using a cross-sectional approach.

 Over 5 years, approximately 40 pediatric and adult subjects (approximately 8 subjects per year) undergoing clinically-indicated liver biopsy for the evaluation of either 1) focal liver lesions/masses, or 2) suspected liver fibrosis/parenchymal disease will be recruited to participate in this study.

 Subjects will undergo research MR imaging within 2 weeks of the liver biopsy procedure.

 A variety of MRI biomarkers will be correlated with histopathologic data obtained from the clinically indicated liver biopsy.
