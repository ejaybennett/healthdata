(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Melatonin in Patients With Multiple Progressive Primary Sclerosis.

 Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system in young adults, has a huge social and health interest, especially the primary progressive (PP-) course, in which the disability is very fast accumulated and currently there are no available treatments in Spain.

 PP-MS is characterized by neuro-inflammation and, especially, by neurodegeneration, with brain atrophy as key feature.

 It has been proposed that PP-MS therapies should combine anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities.

 The investigators have shown that melatonin, an immunomodulatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective compound, ameliorates the disease and modulates the pathogenic/protective immune responses in a MS animal model.

 Moreover, melatonin caused a long-term improvement of disability on a PP-MS patient.

 Thus, melatonin could be of interest in the therapy of PP-MS.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using melatonin to treat PP-MS.

 Thus, the investigators propose a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study on the safety and efficacy of melatonin on PP-MS patients.

 The investigators will assess the daily administration of one oral dose of melatonin containing 300mg during 24 months on patients safety and and its effects over brain atrophy progression, Expanded Disability Status Scale scores, quality of life, MS symptoms, circadian impairment and levels of markers of CNS inflammation, axonal damage, Blood-brain barrier disruption and oxidative stress.
