(secondQuint)Mild Cognitive Impairment and Endurance Exercise in Parkinson's Disease.

 The overall purpose and objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that high intensity endurance exercise causes beneficial brain adaptation in patients with mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI).

 Aim 1 will determine the effect of high intensity endurance exercise on cognitive function and other clinical symptoms in PD-MCI.

 Aim 2 will determine the effect of high intensity endurance exercise on brain structure and function in PD-MCI.

 Aim 3 will determine the effect of high intensity endurance exercise on cortisol in PD-MCI.

 Aim 4 will determine the effect of high intensity endurance exercise on inflammation-related biomarkers found in blood in PD-MCI.

 Aim 5 will determine the effect of high intensity endurance exercise on peripheral levels of neurotrophic factors found in blood in PD-MCI.

 Mild Cognitive Impairment and Endurance Exercise in Parkinson's Disease@highlight

The overall objective of this study is to determine how high intensity endurance exercise affects both cognition and the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease as well as if certain brain structures and functions also change with this exercise.
