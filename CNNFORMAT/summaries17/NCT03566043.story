(secondQuint)RGX-121 Gene Therapy in Patients With MPS II (Hunter Syndrome).

 MPS II is a rare X-linked recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) gene .

 Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant idursulfase (ELAPRASE(R)) is the only approved product for the treatment of Hunter syndrome, however, ERT as currently administered does not cross the Blood Brain Barrier and is therefore unable to address the unmet need in MPS II patients with CNS (neurocognition and behavior) involvement.

 RGX-121 is designed to deliver a healthy gene to cells in the CNS and iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S) is then expected to be secreted by transduced cells which are then expected to cross-correct non-transduced cells by taking up the functional enzyme.

 This is a Phase I/II, first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation study of RGX-121.

 Two, one time doses of RGX-121 will be studied in approximately 6 pediatric subjects who have severe MPS II.

 Safety will be the primary focus for the initial 24 weeks after treatment (primary study period) whereupon, subjects will continue to be assessed (safety and efficacy) for up to a total of 104 weeks following treatment with RGX-121.

 RGX-121 Gene Therapy in Patients With MPS II (Hunter Syndrome)@highlight

RGX-121 is a gene therapy which is intended to deliver a functional copy of the iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) gene to the central nervous system.

 This study is a safety and dose ranging study to determine whether RGX-121 is safe and tolerated by patients with MPS II.
