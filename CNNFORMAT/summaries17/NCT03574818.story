(fifthQuint)Necitumumab in the Neoadjuvant Setting With Gemcitabine in Surgically Resectable - 14X-US-I001.

 The goal of this study is to explore whether it is possible to add a drug called necitumumab to standard treatment for patients with squamous cell lung cancer that can be surgically removed.

 This study is important because it will determine whether there is added benefit to giving necitumumab with chemotherapy before surgery.

 It is currently already known that chemotherapy given before or after surgery has better outcomes compared to only receiving surgery.

 Results from this study may help to develop more effective treatments for patients with squamous cell lung cancer.

 The U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved necitumumab in combination with chemotherapy drugs called gemcitabine and cisplatin to treat stage IV or metastatic squamous cell lung cancer, but the FDA has not approved necitumumab to treat squamous cell lung cancer that can be surgically removed.

 Analyzing the tumor cells from many cases of squamous cell lung cancer has shown that this cancer often has a special protein called EGFR.

 Necitumumab is a drug that targets EGFR.

 Results from a recent medical study showed that patients with stage IV or metastatic squamous cell lung cancer who received necitumumab with gemcitabine and cisplatin showed a small, but significant, improvement in survival.

 We believe trying to gather more information about the way necitumumab interacts with cancer cells will help to learn how to use necitumumab more effectively.

 This study will allow to see the effects of treating an earlier stage of squamous cell lung cancer using necitumumab with gemcitabine and cisplatin.

 It will also allow us to better analyze tumor cells after they have been treated with necitumumab and chemotherapy that are obtained after surgical resection.

 Other blood samples that will be drawn during the treatment will also allow to see the effect of necitumumab on both the body and the tumor cells and to observe any side effects that may result from this treatment.

This will be a single-arm study to primarily evaluate the feasibility of administering necitumumab added to gemcitabine and cisplatin as neoadjuvant treatment in treatment-naive patients with stage IB (tumor size >4cm), II or IIIA squamous NSCLC.

 Feasibility will be assessed by the proportion of patients able to proceed to surgery after administering necitumumab in the neoadjuvant setting.

 These patients would otherwise be offered standard adjuvant chemotherapy (without necitumumab) for squamous cell lung cancer.

 Determination of surgical resectability will be reviewed at a multidisciplinary thoracic tumor board, attended by surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, radiology, and pathology.
