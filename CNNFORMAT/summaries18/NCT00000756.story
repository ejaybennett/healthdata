(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Safety and Tolerance of Immunotherapy With Autologous, Ex-Vivo Expanded, HIV-Specific Cytotoxic T-Cells in HIV-Infected Patients With CD4+ Counts Between 100-400/mm3.

 Freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes from HIV-1-seropositive individuals frequently lyse autologous HIV-1-expressing cells or autologous cells infected with vaccinia vectors encoding HIV-1-specific proteins.

 Administration of these cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) may help prevent HIV disease progression.

 AMENDED 03/28/94: Patients are not accrued at the 25 billion CTL dose.

 Instead, a third cohort receives three infusions of 1 billion CTL 5-8 weeks apart.

 AMENDED 02/14/94: Patients infused with 1 or 5 billion CTL will be reinfused with 1 billion CTL 6-12 months later, and then followed for up to 12 weeks after the reinfusion.

 ORIGINAL DESIGN: Fifteen patients whose cells show an HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response are infused with autologous, ex-vivo expanded CTLs at a dose of 1, 5, or 25 billion cells (five patients per dose level).

 If one to three patients at a given dose develop acute toxicity, an additional three patients will be entered at that dose.

 If four patients at any given dose develop acute toxicity, the next lower dose will be designated as the MTD (if four patients develop acute toxicity in the first cohort, the study will be terminated).

 Patients are evaluated during infusion and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 weeks.

 Evaluation of the Safety and Tolerance of Immunotherapy With Autologous, Ex-Vivo Expanded, HIV-Specific Cytotoxic T-Cells in HIV-Infected Patients With CD4+ Counts Between 100-400/mm3@highlight

To determine the safety, tolerance, and feasibility of adoptive immunotherapy with autologous cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) in HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts between 100 and 400; to evaluate the immunologic, virologic, and clinical changes for up to 24 weeks following infusion of study therapy.

 Freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes from HIV-1-seropositive individuals frequently lyse autologous HIV-1-expressing cells or autologous cells infected with vaccinia vectors encoding HIV-1-specific proteins.

 Administration of these cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) may help prevent HIV disease progression.
