(fifthQuint)Interferon Alfa With or Without Isotretinoin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess the response rate and response duration of interferon alfa with vs without isotretinoin in patients with bidimensionally measurable progressive metastases from renal cell cancer.

 II.

 Assess the toxic effects of these regimens in this patients population.

 III.

 Determine the overall survival of this patient population treated with these regimens.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to participating center.

 Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

 Arm I: Patients receive interferon alfa subcutaneously daily.

 Arm II: Patients receive interferon alfa as in arm I plus oral isotretinoin daily.

 Treatment continues for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed until death.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 296 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Interferon Alfa With or Without Isotretinoin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of the cancer cells and slow the growth of kidney cancer.

 Isotretinoin may help kidney cancer cells develop into normal cells.

 It is not yet known whether interferon alfa plus isotretinoin is more effective than interferon alfa alone for kidney cancer.

 PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of interferon alfa with or without isotretinoin in treating patients who have metastatic kidney cancer.
