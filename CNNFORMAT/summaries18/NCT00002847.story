(thirdQuint)Interferon Alfa and Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the response and disease-free survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with subcutaneous interleukin-2 and interferon alfa.

 - Assess the toxicity of this regimen.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo nephrectomy if the diseased kidney makes up the bulk of the tumor burden.

 All patients receive subcutaneous interferon alfa on day 1 and interleukin-2 on days 3-5 of week 1, followed by reduced doses of interferon alfa and interleukin-2 on days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 2-6.

 Patients are assessed for response approximately 2 months after initiating therapy.

 Patients with stable or responding disease undergo a second course; those who continue to respond may receive additional therapy provided toxicity is limited.

 Patients are followed for survival.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 14 patients will be entered.

RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system to try to stop cancer cells from growing.

 Combining interferon alfa and interleukin-2 may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interferon alfa and interleukin-2 in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.
