(secondQuint)Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck.

 In this investigational research study investigators are attempting to develop a new chemo radiotherapy regimen in which radiotherapy and Taxotere will be combined after having received induction chemotherapy.

 Taxotere has never been given together with radiotherapy, the highest dose of Taxotere that can be safely used in this setting in unknown.

 Taxotere will be added to radiotherapy gradually as each subsequent group of 3-5 patients gets a larger dose.

 Taxotere doses will be increased until certain toxicities occur.

 This will help investigators determine the best way to combine Taxotere with radiotherapy and to use that knowledge to treat other patients with tumors like yours.
