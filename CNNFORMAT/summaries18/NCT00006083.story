(thirdQuint)Dalteparin to Prevent Complications in Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy Through a Catheter.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine if dalteparin will reduce the incidence of clinically significant catheter related complications (i.

e.

, asymptomatic catheter related thrombosis) in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy through a central venous catheter.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to treatment center and catheter placement (proximal to axilla vs distal to axilla).

 Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

 Arm I: Patients receive dalteparin subcutaneously (SC) daily.

 Arm II: Patients receive placebo SC daily.

 Treatment continues for 16 weeks or until catheter removal in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed for 30 days.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 345 patients (230 in arm I and 115 in arm II) will be accrued for this study over 6 months.

 Dalteparin to Prevent Complications in Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy Through a Catheter@highlight

RATIONALE: The use of dalteparin may be able to prevent complications caused by the use of a catheter to supply chemotherapy to cancer patients.

 It is not yet known if dalteparin is effective in reducing these complications.

 PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of dalteparin in preventing catheter-related complications in cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy through a catheter.
