(thirdQuint)Vaccine Therapy With or Without Sargramostim in Treating Patients With High-Risk or Metastatic Melanoma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Compare the safety of melanoma peptide vaccine with or without sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with high-risk or metastatic melanoma.

 - Compare changes in peptide-specific cellular and humoral immunologic profiles in patients treated with these regimens.

 - Compare tumor response in patients treated with these regimens.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive melanoma peptide vaccine comprising tyrosinase leader injected at 2 separate sites, Melan-A ELA injected at another site, NY-ESO-1a and NY-ESO-1b combined and injected at one site, and MAGE-10.

A2 injected at another site, intradermally once weekly on weeks 1-6.

 - Arm II: Patients receive vaccine as in arm I.

 Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning 2 days before each vaccination and continuing for 5 days.

 Treatment in both arms continues through week 6 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed at 2 weeks.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 18 months.

 Vaccine Therapy With or Without Sargramostim in Treating Patients With High-Risk or Metastatic Melanoma@highlight

RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

 Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood.

 Combining vaccine therapy with sargramostim may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or without sargramostim in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma.
