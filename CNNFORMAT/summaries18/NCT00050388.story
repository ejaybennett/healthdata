(secondQuint)Phase II Trial of Allovectin-7 for Head and Neck Cancer.

 Treatment - If you take part in this trial you will be treated for about four weeks.

 You will receive an injection of Allovectin-7(R) by needle, directly into your tumor.

 This will be repeated 14 days later.

 The injections may be given in a doctor's office.

 A week later, you will undergo surgery to remove the tumor.

 Your tumor will be measured before Allovectin-7(R) treatment and before surgery to see if Allovectin-7(R) was effective in shrinking it.

 This will be done by general physical exams and scans (such as X-ray scans).

 There will also be tests on the removed tumor to see if Allovectin-7(R) helped to boost the immune system to attack the cancer.
