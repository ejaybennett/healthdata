(thirdQuint)Edotecarin in Treating Women With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer That Has Not Responded to Chemotherapy.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the antitumor activity of edotecarin in women with anthracycline- and taxane-refractory or chemoresistant locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

 Secondary - Determine the time to tumor response and duration of response in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the clinical benefit of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

 Patients receive edotecarin IV over 1 hour on day 1.

 Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 2 months until disease progression.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 31-65 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Edotecarin in Treating Women With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer That Has Not Responded to Chemotherapy@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as edotecarin use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well edotecarin works in treating women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous chemotherapy.
