(fifthQuint)Neoadjuvant Docetaxel and Cisplatin Plus Chemoradiotherapy Followed By Surgery in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced, Resectable Esophageal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the effectiveness of neoadjuvant docetaxel and cisplatin and chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, in terms of pathological response rate, in patients with locally advanced, resectable esophageal cancer.

 - Determine the feasibility of this regimen, in terms of successful completion of therapy and survival at 30 days postoperatively, in these patients.

 Secondary - Determine the parameters of disease control in these patients and toxicity of this regimen and compare these parameters with published results.

 - Correlate early improvement of dysphasia after 1-2 courses of chemotherapy with predictive value with regard to tumor response and long-term disease control in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the clinical benefit of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 22.

 - Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning 21 days after the last dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV over 1 hour once a week and undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks.

 - Surgery: Patients undergo surgery 3-8 weeks after the final administration of radiotherapy.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline, day 22 of chemotherapy, day 1 of chemoradiotherapy, before surgery, and then every 3 months for 1 year.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 22-66 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and cisplatin, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.

 Giving combination chemotherapy with radiation therapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel and cisplatin together with chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery works in treating patients with locally advanced, resectable esophageal cancer.
