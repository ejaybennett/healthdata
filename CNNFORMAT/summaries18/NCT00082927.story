(fifthQuint)Single-Dose Local Radiation Therapy Compared With Ibandronate in Treating Patients With Localized Metastatic Bone Pain.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare pain response at 4 and 12 weeks post-treatment in patients with localized metastatic bone pain treated with single-dose ibandronate vs single-dose local radiotherapy .

 Secondary - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

 - Correlate urinary markers of osteoclast activity (pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline) with the clinical outcome of patients treated with these regimens.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, crossover, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to primary tumor type and participating center.

 Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive a single dose of local radiotherapy to the site of pain (8Gy/1f).

 - Arm II: Patients receive a single dose of ibandronate IV over 15 minutes.

 Patients who do not achieve a partial or complete response at 4 weeks crossover to the alternate arm.

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 4 and 12 weeks.

 Pain is assessed at baseline, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and then at 6 months.

 Patients are followed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and then at 6 and 12 months.

 Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 470 patients (235 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.

 Single-Dose Local Radiation Therapy Compared With Ibandronate in Treating Patients With Localized Metastatic Bone Pain@highlight

RATIONALE: Ibandronate may be effective in reducing bone pain caused by metastatic cancer.

 Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.

 It is not yet known whether ibandronate is more effective than standard treatment with radiation therapy in treating metastatic bone pain.

 PURPOSE: This phase III randomized clinical trial is studying ibandronate to see how well it works compared to single-dose local radiation therapy in treating patients with localized metastatic bone pain.
