(thirdQuint)Cisplatin and Flavopiridol in Treating Patients With Advanced Ovarian Epithelial Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the response rate, time to progression, and survival in patients with advanced ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer treated with cisplatin and flavopiridol.

 II.

 Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are accrued to two separate groups (Group 2 closed to accrual as of 3/10/06) .

 GROUP 1: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30 minutes and flavopiridol IV over 24 hours on day 1.

 Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 GROUP 2 (Closed to accrual as of 3/10/06): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30 minutes and flavopiridol IV over 24 hours on day 1.

 Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 3 years.

 Cisplatin and Flavopiridol in Treating Patients With Advanced Ovarian Epithelial Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer@highlight

This phase II trial is studying how well giving cisplatin together with flavopiridol works in treating patients with advanced ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and flavopiridol, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.
