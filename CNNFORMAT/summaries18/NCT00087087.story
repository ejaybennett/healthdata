(thirdQuint)Pemetrexed Disodium in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of pemetrexed disodium in patients with recurrent or persistent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer that failed higher priority treatment protocols.

 - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1.

 Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Beginning 7 days before and continuing until 3 weeks after the last dose of pemetrexed disodium, patients also receive oral folic acid daily and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B_12) intramuscularly every 9 weeks.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-22 months.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed disodium, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well pemetrexed disodium works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.
