(fifthQuint)Isolated Hepatic Perfusion With Melphalan Followed by Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Unresectable Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response and duration of response in patients with previously untreated unresectable liver metastases secondary to colorectal cancer treated with isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan followed by leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil.

 Secondary - Determine the patterns of recurrence (liver vs systemic) in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 - Correlate health-related quality of life with length of survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo exploratory laparotomy.

 Patients with evidence of carcinomatosis not previously visualized on scans but found on surgical exploration are removed from the study.

 All other patients then undergo isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP).

 Once IHP is established, melphalan is administered intra-arterially over 3-5 minutes and then circulated throughout the liver for 1 hour.

 Approximately 6-12 weeks later, patients receive systemic chemotherapy comprising oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV continuously over 22 hours on days 1-2.

 Courses with systemic chemotherapy repeat every 14 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after laparotomy, after completion of systemic chemotherapy, and then every 6 months thereafter.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 3-4 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months until disease progression.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving the drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan followed by combination chemotherapy works in treating patients with unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
