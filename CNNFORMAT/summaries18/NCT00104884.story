(thirdQuint)FR901228 in Treating Patients With Unresectable Stage III or Stage IV Malignant Melanoma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate in patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV malignant melanoma treated with FR901228 (depsipeptide).

 Secondary - Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as FR901228, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well FR901228 works in treating patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV malignant melanoma.
