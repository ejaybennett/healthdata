(firstQuint)Trial of Pre-operative Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Surgical Resection in Pancoast Tumors (JCOG 9806).

 Pre-operative radiotherapy has long been the community standard in Pancoast, or superior sulcus tumor.

 However, both complete resection rate (-50%) and long-term survival (-30%) are poor and unchanged for 40 years.

 Concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been shown to be beneficial in unresectable stage III non-small cell cancer.

 Surgery after induction chemoradiotherapy thus is a promising treatment strategy, and in fact, SWOG reported favorable results of this trimodality approach in superior sulcus tumor.

 The current trial is a Japanese, cooperative, multi-center, prospective one to evaluate its safety and efficacy.

 Trial of Pre-operative Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Surgical Resection in Pancoast Tumors (JCOG 9806)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the trimodality (concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection) approach in superior sulcus tumors.
