(thirdQuint)Titanium Surgical Mesh and MOSS-Miami Screws for Lumbar Fusion.

.

 This is a single arm multi-center study to determine the clinical success of the DePuy Spine Titanium Surgical Mesh with MOSS Miami Spinal Fixation System Pedicle Screws in the treatment of one or two adjacent levels of degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine (L2 - S1).

 Study Success is as a compound endpoint requiring: - Radiographic Fusion, - Improvement in Pain/Function, - Maintenance/Improvement in Neurologic Status, and - Freedom from Secondary Surgical Intervention.

 - The rate of Adverse Events must be no worse than in the control group as well.

 Secondary Endpoints Include: - Adverse Events - SF-36 Health Related Quality of Life - Disc Space Height - Work Status Comparison: Results will be compared to an historical control group treated with the Lumbar I/F Cage with VSP System.
