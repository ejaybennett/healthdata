(secondQuint)Statewide Implementation of Electronic Health Records.

 From the practices committed to implementing EHR in early 2005, we randomly selected 15 adult community-based primary care physicians.

 We selected 15 similar physicians in practices that were not planning to adopt in that time period.

 At each of these physicians' practices we documented rates of medication errors for one week prior to the implementation of an EHR using duplicate prescription pads.

 Two months after the implementation in the adopting group, allowing some time for familiarization with the tool, we collected two weeks of data using computer-based information (in the adopting arm) and duplicate prescriptions (in the non-adopting arm).

 Hypothesis: Adoption of Electronic Health Records through this program will reduce medication errors
