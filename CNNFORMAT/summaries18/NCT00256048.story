(thirdQuint)Efficacy of Nasojejunal Enteral Feeding in Critically Ill Patients.

.

 The study examines the area of enteral feeding in critically ill patients.

 Current standard enteral feeding practice is via a nasogastric with the addition of promotility agents for patients who fail to absorb their enteral nutrition.

 This study compares the efficacy of nasojejunal feeding feeding with nasogastric enteral feeding with the addition of promotility agents.

 The duration of feeding will be determined by the patients nutritional requirements and their general condition.

 However the data will be collected for duration of enteral feeding, 28 days or ICU discharge whichever occurs first.

 Efficacy of Nasojejunal Enteral Feeding in Critically Ill Patients.

@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if naso-jejunal feeding (feeding beyond the stomach) improves the efficacy of enteral feeding (feeding into the gut) in critically ill patients.

 The study hypothesis is that in patients who fail to establish enteral feeding via the nasogastric route, introduction of nasojejunal feeding will lead to more effective enteral feeding than the current regime involving staged introduction of promotility agents.
