(secondQuint)Treatment of Refractory Status Epilepticus.

 Refractory status epilepticus (SE) develops in 31%-44% of patients with SE, with a mortality of 16%-23%.

 Coma induction is advocated for its management.

 Propofol and barbiturates are the most used agents, but no comparative study has been performed.

 In consideration of the uncertainty regarding the relative effectiveness, despite several retrospective data, a prospective investigation is needed.

 The objective is to assess the effectiveness (SE control, adverse events) of a first course of propofol versus barbiturates in the treatment of refractory SE, in adults with refractory SE not due to cerebral anoxia.

 Comparison: Coma induction with standardized doses of propofol or barbiturates titrated towards burst-suppression on EEG, then assessment of the proportion of patients achieving a control of SE.
