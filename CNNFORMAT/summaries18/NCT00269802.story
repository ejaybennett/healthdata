(thirdQuint)A Multicenter Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of OROS Methylphenidate HCl, Ritalin (Methylphenidate HCl) and Placebo in Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) represents the most common neurobehavioral disorder in children, affecting 3% to 5% of the school-age population.

 Behavioral pediatricians, child psychiatrists, and child neurologists indicate that referrals for ADHD may constitute up to 50% of their practices.

 This is a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, placebo-controlled, active-controlled, three-treatment, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OROS(R) (methylphenidate HCl) with standard immediate-release Ritalin(R) (three times a day), and placebo, in children with ADHD.

 Patients are assigned to one of three treatments, depending upon their prestudy titrated therapeutic dose and regimen, and are treated for 28 days.

 Patients will be given OROS(R) (methylphenidate HCl), 18, 36 or 54 milligrams once daily, or Ritalin(R) 5, 10, or 15 milligrams (encapsulated/single capsule) three times a day, or placebo.

 Efficacy is evaluated in the community setting by teachers, parents and investigators using standardized attention and behavior scales and other assessments.

 The primary measure of effectiveness is the teacher's rating on study Day 27 on the IOWA Conners Inattention/Overactivity subscale.

 Additional measures of effectiveness include the IOWA Conners Oppositional/Defiance subscale ratings, peer interaction and other behavioral ratings, SNAP-IV ratings, global assessments of efficacy, investigator Clinical Global Impression (CGI), home situation and the parent satisfaction questionnaire.

 Safety evaluations include the incidence of adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, sleep quality, appetite, and the presence/severity of tics (hard-to-control, repeated twitching of any parts of the body or hard-to-control repeating of sounds or words).

 Patients will be given orally for 28 days: OROS(R) (methylphenidate HCl), 1, 2, or 3 of the 18 milligram tablets once daily, or Ritalin(R) 5, 10, or 15 milligrams (encapsulated/single capsule) three times daily, or placebo.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OROSA(R) Methylphenidate HCl as compared with placebo and standard immediate-release RitalinA(R) (taken three time per day) for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in children.

 Both OROSA(R) Methylphenidate HCl and RitalinA(R) contain the central nervous system stimulant, methylphenidate HCl.
