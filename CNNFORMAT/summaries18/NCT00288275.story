(fifthQuint)Correlation of the Chemoresponse Assay With PFS in Patients With Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian, Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer.

 The traditional treatment course for new cases of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer is cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy with paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin.

 Unfortunately, despite high initial response rates, the majority of patients recur and subsequent therapy is much less likely to be effective.

 The use of ineffective chemotherapy can result in unnecessary toxicity and costs, delay of more effective treatment, and the potential for the development of cross-resistance to additional drugs.

 The ability to individualize therapy by providing the treating physician with ex vivo response information on a panel of drugs should aid in the selection of effective therapy for individual patients, thus resulting in improved outcomes.

 Resistance to chemotherapy cannot be predicted by either clinical or histological examination.

 Historically, the ex vivo sensitivity and resistance of tumor cells has been evaluated as a tool for predicting the clinical response of the patient to therapy.

 In this study, chemotherapy drugs will be tested using both the Precision Therapeutics' ChemoFx Assay and the Yale Apoptosis Assay.

 The assay results will be compared to clinical outcomes that will be reported at regular intervals.

 Blood, tumor pathology slides, and excess tumor cells (if available) will be used to characterize common polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes as well as other molecular markers potentially associated with tumor response.

 This is a one-arm validation trial with a goal of approximately 256 evaluable patients recruited from multiple sites.

 Patients will be drawn from the Yale -New Haven Medical Center and multiple additional sites as needed to meet accrual goals.

 The patients will be treated with FDA approved drugs and/or drug combinations based on the medical judgment of the treating physician.

 The study is not randomized and the results of the assay will not be used in the decision process for which agent to select for treatment, but are made available to the treating physician upon further progression.

 Correlation of the Chemoresponse Assay With PFS in Patients With Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian, Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer@highlight

Chemoresponse assays (lab test) measure the effect that chemotherapy treatment has on a patient's cancer cells in the lab.

 This test has shown success in a retrospective study in predicting how an individual patient's tumor will respond to a given chemotherapy and how treatment utilizing an agent that the test said that a patient's cells would be sensitive too corresponds to a longer progression free interval.

 This study will determine the ability of two tests used to predict the success of chemotherapy in recurrent, persistent, or refractory cancer of the ovaries, fallopian tube(s) or peritoneum by measuring how long patients live without progression.
