(secondQuint)X-Chromosome Inactivation Status and Premature Ovarian Failure.

 Premature ovarian failure (POF) affects approximately 1% of women.

 For most women a cause is not found, but structural abnormalities of the X-chromosome commonly lead to POF, suggesting genes on the X-chromosome are necessary for normal ovarian function.

 It is known that certain gene mutations on the X-chromosome can lead to changes in the normal random pattern of X-chromosome inactivation in females.

 We propose to study X-inactivation patterns in a cohort of women with idiopathic POF, and compare their pattern to a mean age-matched cohort of women with normal menstrual function.

 We hypothesize that some women with POF will show skewed X-inactivation, suggesting a mutation on the X-chromosome as the etiology of their POF.

Women who are affected with premature ovarian failure will exhibit skewed X-chromosome inactivation patterns compared to women with normal menstrual function (as defined by being pregnant), indicating a possible X-chromosome defect.
