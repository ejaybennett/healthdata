 Block randomization will be used to randomize patients to one of two combinations.

 Group A will receive capsules containing 650 mg Acetaminophen plus 400 mg Ibuprofen.

 Group B will receive capsules containing 600 mg Acetaminophen, 15 mg caffeine and 60 mg codeine.

 Capsules are placed in identical dossettes containing a seven day supply.

 Patients are instructed to start taking their medications post-op and continue until they are pain free.

 All participants are given a series of blank Visual Analogue scales and Likert scales and instructed to record their level of pain intensity and pain relief four times per day for the entire week.

 Peri-operative pain management will be standardized.

 Patients will not receive pre-operative analgesics.

 Intra-operative analgesia will be intravenous opioids as selected by anaesthesiology.

 No local/regional anaesthesia will be used.

 Intravenous ketorolac will not be allowed for trial participants.

 All patients will receive intravenous opioid and anti-emetic if required in PACU.

 Any patients with peri-operative complications or other problems requiring admission or alternative analgesics will be excluded.

 T3AI-Pain After Breast Surgery@highlight

Current standard of care for post-operative analgesia after breast surgery in CDHA is Tylenol #3(R) (300 mg acetaminophen, 30 mg codeine, 15 mg caffeine per tablet).

 We are proposing to test the analgesic efficacy of acetaminophen plus ibuprofen against Tylenol #3(R) in patients undergoing outpatient breast surgery.
