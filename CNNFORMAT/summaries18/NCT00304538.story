(secondQuint)A Study of the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamic Activity of Very Low Dose-Glucagon in Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.

 Glucagon is currently used to treat severe hypoglycemia.

 DiObex believes that glucagon replacement therapy with very low doses of glucagon may prevent hypoglycemia without compromising effective glycemic control by insulin.

 In this study very low doses of glucagon will administered to Type I diabetics who use insulin pumps.

 The glucagon will be administered subcutaneously overnight for 6, 9 or 12 hours to see if the number of mild or impending hypoglycemia events can be safely decreased.

 Three different doses of glucagon will be compared to a control infusion.

The purpose of this study is to identify the safest dose of very low dose glucagon to prevent hypoglycemia in patients with Type I diabetes who use insulin pumps and to measure the the amount of glucagon in the blood and see how the body responds to the glucagon.
