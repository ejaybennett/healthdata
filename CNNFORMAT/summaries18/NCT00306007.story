(secondQuint)Evaluation of the Reliability, Validity, and Acceptability of the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy in a U.

S.

 Population of Women.

 The concept of "unplanned pregnancy" is used frequently in health research and policy.

 The majority of tools used to assess unplanned pregnancy planning have not been validated.

 Recently the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP) has been developed and validated.

 The LMUP had been found to be valid and reproducible, but has not been studied outside of the United Kingdom.

 If we are able to validate this measure in a U.

S.

 population, its use in studies will improve the quality of data about family planning in U.

S.

 women.
