(fifthQuint)Study of 3,5-Diiodothyropropionic Acid (DITPA) in Hypercholesterolemic Patients.

 INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND: In recent years, the need to achieve increasingly ambitious therapeutic goals for dyslipidemias has prompted the search for more potent pharmacological agents to lower circulating atherogenic lipoprotein concentrations and enhance reverse cholesterol transport (RCT).

 While mounting evidence supports the use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme reductase inhibitors (or statins) as the main stay of therapy for patients requiring lipid modification therapy, many patients remain under-treated or do not achieve the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommended goals.

1-5 Recognizing new and emerging data, NCEP III recently updated its guidelines to recognize the potential of a more aggressive low density lipoprotein (LDL) goal of -HDL.

 ApoA-I also stabilizes and increases the level of ATP-binding cassette A1 protein (ABCA1), which, in turn, promotes efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to nascent HDL-particles.

 Thyroid hormone increases apoA-I gene expression in liver and intestine, in part through a 5' flanking thyroid hormone response element.

35, 36 Thyroid hormone has also recently been shown to increased the scavenger class B type I receptor (SR-BI), another regulator of serum HDL concentrations and cholesterol flux, in livers of mice treated with either T3 or GC-1 (a thyroid hormone receptor modulator).

37 Finally, thyroid hormones are also known to increase activity of cholesterol 7-hydroxylase (CYP-7A1)38 which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis; in contrast, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have the opposite effect.

 This thyroid hormone-induced increase in CYP-7A1 would be expected to increase bile acid and cholesterol excretion, as has been observed in hyperthyroidism.

2 Previous Clinical Research Previous studies have investigated the therapeutic potential of thyromimetic compounds in lipid modification and heart failure.

14,15,40 Early clinical investigation focused on dextrothyroxine (D-T4), a D-isomer of thyroxine, which was thought to have similar actions, but produce less tachycardia and myocardial oxygen consumption.

40, 41 Although DT4 was commonly used as a cholesterol lowering drug in the 1970s,42 it is no longer used in clinical practice.

 The therapeutic effects of DT4 were evaluated in the Coronary Drug Project (CDP).

 The Coronary Drug Project was initiated in 1965, primarily to answer the prevailing question about the safety and efficacy of long term use of various cholesterol lowering agents in patients with coronary artery disease.

 The Coronary Drug Project was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, conducted between 1966 and 1975.

 It was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of five lipid-modifying drugs in 8,341 men, with a history of prior myocardial infarction (MI).

 Niacin, clofibrate, dextrothyroxine, and two estrogen regimens were evaluated in the study along with a placebo arm.

43, 44 DT4 was administered at 6.

0 mg /day.

 The primary endpoint was overall mortality at 5 years.

 After a mean follow-up of 36 months, because of a nonsignificant trend toward higher mortality in the DT4 arm compared with placebo, the DT4 arm was discontinued.

 As acknowledged by the original investigators, the observed DT4-placebo difference in overall mortality is not statistically significant as judged by the statistical methods utilized in this study.

44 Nevertheless, given the mortality trend and the low probability of eventual benefits, a decision was made to discontinue the DT4 arm.

 In discontinuing the DT4 arm, the study leadership recognized that the findings of the CDP left open the possibility that dextrothyroxine may be efficacious for a limited group of carefully selected myocardial infarction (MI) patients and for persons free of clinical CHD.

 44 The net effect of DT4 on serum lipids (the observed fall corrected for the concomitant rise for the placebo group) was a sustained significant fall from baseline levels.

 The decrease was approximately 12% in serum cholesterol levels and 15-20% in fasting serum triglyceride levels.

44 Following the study, it was revealed that the DT4 dispensed in the study contained less than 0.

5% of levothyroxine (approximately 30 mu g of levothyroxine).

44 Interestingly, it was later found that contamination of levothyroxine commercial preparations varied from lot to lot (from 0.

5% to 2.

3%).

45 Also, this "DT4" formulation had other significant thyromimetic effects, leading to TSH suppression that may have become clinically relevant with prolonged use.

47 Suboptimal dosing and thyrotoxic effects due to drug contamination may explain why more than 40% of the DT4 patients required a dose reduction.

3 DITPA DITPA (3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid) is an analogue of naturally occurring thyroid hormone (T3) that has been specifically designed to improve cardiac performance with a lower potential for tachycardia.

22, 40, 46 DITPA binds to the same thyroid hormone receptors and as T3 but with less affinity.

41 In pre-clinical animal post-infarction models, DITPA improved calcium handling, promoted angiogenesis, and attenuated abnormal left ventricular remodeling.

47-53 In a rat model of CHF, DITPA demonstrated increased cardiac output with increases in left ventricular dp/dt, comparable to effects seen with T4, but with significantly less tachycardia.

 In addition, there were increases in -myosin heavy chain (MHC) RNA gene expression induced by DITPA treatment.

41 When evaluated in combination with captopril, DITPA improved both cardiac output and dp/dt as well as increased the rate of LV relaxation when compared with captopril alone.

54 In a rabbit post-infarction model, DITPA decreased left ventricular end diastolic pressure and increased positive and negative dp/dt without changes in heart rate or left ventricular systolic pressure.

43 In the same model, use of DITPA prevented abnormal SERCA transport and abnormal contractile function associated with myocardial infarction.

42, 44 Recently DITPA was also noted to improve endothelial function following myocardial infarction, an action mediated through nitric oxide.

55 The objective of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility of DITPA, a thyroid hormone analogue, as a potential lipid modification agent.

 KNOWN AND POTENTIAL TOXICITIES: Since DITPA is a thyroid hormone analogue with thyromimetic actions, safety and side effect profiles may be similar to those observed with thyroid hormones T3 and T4 preparations (e.

g.

, liothyronine and levothyroxine).

 Although excess thyromimetic action is a theoretical side effect, it is also possible that tissue-specific hypothyroidism might result if the drug fails to have sufficient thyromimetic activity in a particular tissue.

 Due to pituitary effects of DITPA, a secondary lowering of TSH may result, which in turn may lead to decreased endogenous production of T4.

 The potential effects of such theoretical biochemical changes are unknown.

 Thus, DITPA safety will be diligently monitored throughout the study through multiple examinations, symptom scales, and laboratory evaluations.

 Based on the known effects of thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism, and the side effects of T3 and T4 preparations, potential side effects of DITPA may include: 1.

 Cardiovascular: palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest 2.

 Central nervous system: headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia 3.

 Dermatologic: hair loss, warm moist or dry skin, flushing 4.

 Endocrine: decreased bone mineral density, gynecomastia 5.

 Gastrointestinal: diarrhea or constipation, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests 6.

 General symptoms: fatigue, increased appetite, excessive sweating 7.

 Musculoskeletal: tremors, muscle weakness, proximal myopathy 8.

 Respiratory: dyspnea 9.

 Reproductive: menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility 10.

 Metabolic: weight loss or gain, heat or cold temperature intolerance, fever Please consult the most recent DITPA Investigator's Brochure (IB) including amendments for additional information.

 In addition, many drugs are known to affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism by altering absorption, synthesis, secretion, protein binding, and/or target tissue response, and may also alter the therapeutic response to thyroid hormone preparations such as levothyroxine.

 In addition, thyroid hormones and thyroid status may have varied effects on the pharmacokinetics and actions of other drugs.

 A list of drug-thyroidal axis interactions is provided in the prescribing information for marketed agents such as Synthroid(R) (levothyroxine sodium tablets, USP), Abbott Laboratories and Cytomel(R) (liothyronine sodium tablets), King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

 Study of 3,5-Diiodothyropropionic Acid (DITPA) in Hypercholesterolemic Patients@highlight

The natural thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are known to have a cholesterol-lowering effect.

 Their pharmacologic use for this purpose is limited, however, by their actions on other organs, including the heart, bone, and brain, where there can be side effects of excessive thyroid hormone action.

 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) is a thyroid hormone analog with relative selectivity for a form of the thyroid hormone receptor expressed in the liver, where it regulates several aspects of lipid metabolism, including the clearance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

 This study is designed to determine whether DITPA is safe and effective in achieving LDL cholesterol levels that are consistent with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) guidelines in patients who have not achieved those levels on conventional therapy, due to drug-resistant disease, drug intolerance, or both.

 This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

 Following a 4-week Pre-Randomization Phase with dietary counseling and a 2-week placebo run-in, eligible patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive DITPA (90 mg/day, 180 mg/day), or placebo for a total treatment duration of 12 weeks.

 Sixty (60) patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio (i.

e.

, 20 patients per treatment group): - DITPA at 90 mg/day (45 mg twice a day [BID] taken orally) - DITPA at 180 mg/day (90 mg BID taken orally) - Placebo (BID taken orally) Those patients randomized to receive DITPA at 90 mg/day will receive 45 mg/day for the first 2 weeks, followed by 90 mg/day for 10 weeks.

 Those patients randomized to receive DITPA at 180 mg/day will receive 45 mg/day for the first 2 weeks, followed by 90 mg/day for the next 2 weeks, and then 180 mg/day for 8 weeks.
