(fifthQuint)Conversion of CellCept to Myfortic: A Prospective Study in Liver Transplant Recipients.

 This is a prospective, single center, open-label, safety and tolerability study on the use of Myfortic after liver transplantation.

 Adult liver transplant patients who are experiencing GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort/pain, dyspepsia) attributable to CellCept are eligible to enter the study.

 CellCept will be discontinued and replaced with Myfortic.

 The duration of the study will be 3 months, and during this time, we will assess the incidence and severity of GI adverse events, the incidence and severity of bone marrow suppression (leukopenia), and the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection or disease in patients receiving Myfortic.

 Conversion of CellCept to Myfortic: A Prospective Study in Liver Transplant Recipients@highlight

The objective of this study is to determine the tolerability and safety of Myfortic in liver transplant patients.

 Patients receiving CellCept who have GI side effects will have CellCept discontinued and changed to Myfortic (Myfortic is a new drug similar to CellCept, except it is enteric-coated).

 Our hypothesis is that Myfortic has less GI side effects and will, therefore, be tolerated better than CellCept and also that Myfortic will have a comparable effectiveness to CellCept.
