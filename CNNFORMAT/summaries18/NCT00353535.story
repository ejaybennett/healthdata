(firstQuint)Total Lymphoid Irradiation (TLI) to Prevent Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)Recurrence in the Renal Graft.

 Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is resistant to treatment with immunosuppressants and after transplant, 40% of such patients have recurrences in renal allograft.

 The purpose of this trial was to use Total Lymphoid Irradiation (TLI) plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), cyclosporine A (CsA) and prednisone (PRED) to prevent recurrence.
