(firstQuint)A Safety and Efficacy of CCRT With Paclitaxel as Adjuvant Therapy to Post-Operative Advanced Endometrial Cancer Patients.

 Postoperative radiotherapy (RT) is the most used adjuvant treatment in high risk endometrial cancer (HREC), and it appears to reduce the incidence of pelvic relapses but doesn't seem to improve survival.

 Paclitaxel (P) has shown in vitro and clinical activity against endometrial cancer, and it is also a potent radiosensitizer by blocking dividing cells in G2/M phase.

 This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a treatment with concomitant weekly chemotherapy with paclitaxel and RT in high risk advanced endometrial cancer.
