(fifthQuint)Open-Label Extension Study Evaluating Long Term Safety in Patients With Type 1 Gaucher Disease Receiving DRX008A (ERT).

 Type 1 Gaucher disease, the most common form, accounts for more than 90% of all cases and does not involve the central nervous system (CNS).

 Typical manifestations of type 1 Gaucher disease include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bleeding tendencies, anemia, hypermetabolism, skeletal pathology, growth retardation, pulmonary disease, and decreased quality of life.

 Gene-Activated(R) human glucocerebrosidase (the long term safety of enzyme replacement therapy with DRX008A (GA-GCB; velaglucerase alfa) is produced in a continuous human cell line using proprietary gene-activation technology and has an identical amino acid sequence to the naturally occurring human enzyme.

 GA-GCB (velaglucerase alfa) contains terminal mannose residues that target the enzyme to the macrophages-the primary target cells in Gaucher disease.

 This study was designed to evaluate the long term safety of GA-GCB (velaglucerase alfa) in patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease.

Gaucher disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCB).

 Due to the deficiency of functional GCB, glucocerebroside accumulates within macrophages leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, and organ system dysfunction.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long term safety of enzyme replacement therapy with DRX008A (VPRIV(R), GA-GCB; velaglucerase alfa) in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease.
