(thirdQuint)Everolimus (RAD001) Therapy of Giant Cell Astrocytoma in Patients With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.

 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)is a genetic disorder with a birth incidence of approximately one in six thousand.

 Five to twenty percent of patients with TSC will develop astrocytoma, a slowly progressive tumor.

 They grow and cause damage to surrounding brain tissue, blockage of spinal fluid (hydrocephalus), blindness, trouble walking, seizures, and brain damage.

 If untreated, they can be fatal.

 Standard treatment involves surgery to remove the tumor; however surgery may itself cause brain damage, bleeding, or infection, as well as other complications.

 Studies have shown that everolimus suppresses the chemicals that cause tumors to grow in tuberous sclerosis, and may cause them to shrink.

 The primary objective of this study is to find out the effects of everolimus on astrocytomas in a six month trial in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis who have been diagnosed with an astrocytoma.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and potential side effects of everolimus (an experimental drug) on a person with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex who also has been diagnosed with a brain tumor (astrocytoma) The hypothesis is that the drug will cause the tumor size to decrease, and may have beneficial activity separate from effects on tumors in patients.
