(firstQuint)Comparison Between Recombinant Versus Urinary hCG for Ovulation Induction in High Responders.

 Urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (u-hCG) has been widely used to induce final oocyte maturation and to trigger ovulation in assisted conception.

 Recombinant technology has allowed the production of r-hCG inj which all urinary contaminants are absent.

 Hence, this would allow the safe subcutaneous administration of a compound with less batch-to-batch variation.

 This study will investigate the effectiveness of the recombinant hCG compared to the currently used urinary hCG.

The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of recombinant human chorionic gonadotrophin (rHCG) and urinary HCG (uHCG) in patients undergoing IVF cycles.
