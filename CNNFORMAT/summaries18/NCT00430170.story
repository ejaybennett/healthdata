(firstQuint)Does Caffeine Reduce Dipyridamole-Induced Protection Against Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury?.

 Dipyridamole has been proven to reduce targeting of Annexin A5 in responses to ischemic exercise, indicating protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury in humans (pharmacological preconditioning).

 Dipyridamole increases the endogenous adenosine level by inhibition of the nucleoside transporter (ENT-1).

 Activation of the adenosine receptor protects against ischemia-reperfusion injury.

 We hypothesize that endogenous adenosine mediates the protective effect of dipyridamole against ischemia-reperfusion injury.

 Therefore the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine will reduce the benefit of dipyridamole on forearm ischemia-reperfusion injury.

The purpose of this project is to explore the interaction between caffeine and dipyridamole on ischemia-reperfusion injury in the forearm.
