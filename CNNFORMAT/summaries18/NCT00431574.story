(thirdQuint)Antipsychotic Medication Extended Dosing Study.

 The present study is a 6-month, double-blind study of patients with schizophrenia stabilized on their current antipsychotic (monotherapy) for a period of at least 3 months.

 After providing informed consent, individuals will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms: regular daily antipsychotic dosing or active medication at the same daily dose every 2nd day.

 Various scales to measure clinical response and side effects will be administered at baseline, as well as every 2 weeks thereafter.

 Subjective scales will also be employed, and lab evaluations will include plasma antipsychotic levels at baseline and endpoint, as well as prolactin.

 Our sample size will be 20/group.

 Antipsychotic Medication Extended Dosing Study@highlight

In patients stabilized on their antipsychotic and demonstrating evidence of good clinical response, there will not be a significant change in symptoms if their medication is decreased to every 2 days rather than daily.

 This decrease in antipsychotic exposure will lead to a reduction in side effects, as well as improved subjective response to treatment.
