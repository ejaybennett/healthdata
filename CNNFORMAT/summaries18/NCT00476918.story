(firstQuint)Intravitreal Triamcinolone Acetonide for Diabetic Macular Edema.

 Patients with diabetic retinopathy suffer from visual acuity loss caused by diabetic macular edema.

 Intravitreal injected Triamcinolone Acetonide (steroid) reduces macular edema and increases visual acuity.

 The duration of its effect is however limited.

 Therefore, several injections are necessary.

 In this study a dosage dependency of triamcinolone acetonide (high dosage vs low dosage) is performed.

 The primary outcome parameters are the number of treatments and the efficacy of each injection.
