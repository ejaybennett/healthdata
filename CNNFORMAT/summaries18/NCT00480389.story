(fifthQuint)Pre-operative Administration of Sorafenib in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Undergoing Kidney Removal.

 This is a single centre, non-randomized, open label one arm pilot study of Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily given for 12 weeks preoperatively in patients with advanced metastatic kidney cancer scheduled for cytoreductive surgery.

 Patients will be fully staged for disease progression with Brain MRI, CT, whole body Bone Scans, Kidney ultrasound and biopsy.

 Additionally, patients' cardiac status will be evaluated pre-enrolment with an ECG and MUGA Scan.

 Once enrolled into the study, patients will have clinic visits on weeks 2, 8 and 12 for monitoring visits with vital signs and adverse event recording plus blood evaluations for hematology and chemistry.

 Patients will be called on weeks 3,5,6,7,9,10 and 11 to determine any changes in health status.

 Surgery will occur at week 13, after a one week washout from study drug.

 Patients will resume on study drug 6 weeks post operatively (or later, if wound is not completely healed).

 Patients will continue on study drug and will be monitored every 4 weeks until disease progression, as determined by bone imaging and CT.

 Pre-operative Administration of Sorafenib in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Undergoing Kidney Removal@highlight

The purpose of this study is to see if preoperative administration of Sorafenib reduces the size of the primary kidney tumour in patients with metastatic disease undergoing cytoreductive surgery.

 The study will also assess the safety of preoperative Sorafenib.

 The study drug, Sorafenib, will be given to patients preoperatively for 12 weeks.

 After a 1 week washout period the patient will then have their nephrectomy (kidney removed).

 Approximately 6 weeks following their nephrectomy, patients will resume on study drug until disease progression.
