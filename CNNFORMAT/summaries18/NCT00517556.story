(firstQuint)Continuous Administration of Oral Contraceptive, Primary Dysmenorrhea.

 It is well established that excess prostaglandin production in primary dysmenorrhea (PD) leads to ischemia of the uterine muscle, which consequently causes pelvic pain.

 A large number of drugs have been studied for pain relief in dysmenorrhea patients with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) being the most effective with the overall success rate of more than 75%.

 Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) are also an established treatment for PD with the success rate of 70%.

 Lately, OCP's have been used continuously in patients with endometriosis and had better pain control than traditional administration of OCP.
