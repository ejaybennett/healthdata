(thirdQuint)A Study of Liposomal Doxorubicin in Women With Breast Cancer Exploiting Tissue Doppler Imaging.

 The randomized LITE study will compare liposomal doxorubin versus standard epirubicin within a comprehensive adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in women undergoing treatment for breast cancer.

 The study will enrol a total of 80 patients, randomized 1:1 to liposomal doxorubin vs epirubicin.

 Standard and tissue Doppler imaging parameters will be appraised at transthoracic echocardiography will be used and will constitute the primary and co-primary end-points.

 In addition, other efficacy and safety end-points will be appraised, including disease free progression.

The randomized LITE study will compare liposomal doxorubin versus standard epirubicin in the treatment of female breast cancer.

 In order to detect as early as possible post-chemotherapy cardiotoxicity, tissue Doppler imaging parameters elicited at transthoracic echocardiography will be used and will constitute the primary and co-primary end-points.
