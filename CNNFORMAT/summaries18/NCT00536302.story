(thirdQuint)A Placebo-Controlled Study of Collagen Hydrolysate in Subjects With Knee Osteoarthritis (OA).

 This is a single-site, double-blind, pilot study to evaluate the sensitivity of MRI to detect cartilage structure and composition in subjects taking daily oral collagen hydrolysate (a nutritional supplement) or placebo for 48 weeks.

 30 subjects will be randomized to collagen hydrolysate or placebo (1:1 ratio).

 The goal is to evaluate, by MRI, knee cartilage and structure in all subjects.

 The primary functional outcome measure will be the WOMAC questionnaire and the primary pathological outcome measure will be knee cartilage structure and composition as measurements done by MRI imaging.

 Subjects will have contrast dGEMRIC MRIs done at Study Weeks -1, 24 and 48.

 A Placebo-Controlled Study of Collagen Hydrolysate in Subjects With Knee Osteoarthritis (OA)@highlight

This study is designed to evaluate, by MRI, knee cartilage and structure in all subjects.

 Half the subjects in this study will take collagen hydrolysate each day for 48 weeks and the other half of the subjects will take a placebo dose, that looks like and tastes like the collagen hydrolysate, each day for 48 weeks.

 MRIs will be taken at Study Weeks -1, 24, and 48.
