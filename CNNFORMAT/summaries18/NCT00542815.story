(secondQuint)A Study of MCI-196 in Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V Subjects on Dialysis With Hyperphosphatemia.

 Following completion of one of the Phase III studies (E07, E08 or E09) eligible patients will receive either MCI-196 for up to 52 weeks.

 The study is in two periods.

 The initial period allows flexible dosing for a period of 8 weeks.

 This will allow subjects to achieve individually optimised doses.

 After 8 weeks, subjects will continue flexible dosing with MCI-196 but with titration intervals every 4 weeks instead of every 2 weeks.

 Subjects previously exposed to MCI-196 will end the study at Week 40.
