(firstQuint)Short Term Outcomes From Minimally Invasive Surgery for the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.

 Patients who are undergoing or who have undergone minimally invasive surgery for atrial fibrillation will be followed prospectively.

 At 6 to 9 months, 1 and two years post surgery follow-up subjects will receive a trans-telephonic monitor to wear for approximately 1 month, and will submit transmissions on a daily basis.

 Episodes of atrial fibrillation will be documented during this time.

 The overall efficacy of the procedure will be assessed based on the freedom from atrial fibrillation at the time of transtelephonic monitoring.
