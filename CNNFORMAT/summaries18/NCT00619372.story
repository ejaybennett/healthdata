(firstQuint)Oral OKT3 in Combination With Beta-D-Glucosylceramide.

 Anti CD3 (OKT3): Is an approved drug for intravenous use in the treatment of solid organ transplantation.

 Preliminary data suggest that the oral administration of OKT3 in low dosages can exert an immune modulatory effect via activation of regulatory T lymphocytes.

 -D glucosylceramide [GC]: Is approved for oral administration and is currently being tested in three clinical trials.

 Recent data suggested that it can serve as an immunological adjuvant in various clinical settings and to augment the immune response via activation of regulatory T cells.

 This clinical trial has been designed to assess the safety of oral administration of OKT3 with and without co-administration of GC in healthy subjects.

 The use of two potential activators of regulatory T cells, may exert an additive effect, augmenting the systemic immune modulatory effect.
