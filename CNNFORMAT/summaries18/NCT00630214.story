(secondQuint)Prevention of Hypocalcemia in Patients Undergoing Total Thyroidectomy Plus Central Neck Dissection.

 Of patients with differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma, group D underwent total thyroidectomy alone and groups A-C underwent total thyroidectomy plus CND.

 The latter were randomized to oral calcium (3 g/day) plus vitamin D (1 mcg/day) (group A, n = 49), calcium alone (group B, n = 49), or no supplements (group C, n = 50).

 Hypocalcemic symptoms, serum calcium, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were compared among the groups.
