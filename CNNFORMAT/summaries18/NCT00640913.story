(secondQuint)Early Reversal of Defunctioning Stoma Trial.

 Patients undergoing low anterior resection of the the rectum for adenocarcinom (total mesorectal excision; TME) with a defunctioning loop stoma are assessed preoperatively and for 6 days postoperatively according to a trial protocol including daily clinical, physiological, and serological variables, and a rectal contrast study on day 6.

 If inclusion criteria are fulfilled, a decision is taken on day 7 to schedule reversal of the defunctioning loop stoma on postoperative day 14.

 This trial is considered a hypothesis generating pilot study of feasibility type and is no power calculation.

 The present trial will include 20 consecutive patients who accept participation.
