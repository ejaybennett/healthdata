(fifthQuint)Pre-shock Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation to Patients With Out-of-hospital Resuscitation, A Randomised Clinical Trial.

 1.

 Different from data from the Western countries, non-shockable rhythm (Asystole/pulseless electric activity) was responsible for most out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients(80%~90%) in metropolitan Taipei.

 2.

 Response time in Taipei emergency medical service was longer than 5 minutes.

 3.

 Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation rate were relatively low in Taipei.

 4.

 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is the only known method to save out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with asystole/pulseless electric activity.

 For those suffered from ventricular fibrillation/ ventricular tachycardia,previous studies revealed pre-shock cardiopulmonary resuscitation may have the potential to improve the outcome.

 5.

 Study hypothesis: Compared with current standard resuscitative sequence (basic life support protocol in Guideline 2005), longer pre-shock cardiopulmonary resuscitation provided to all out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients in Taipei may improve the outcome of them.

 Pre-shock Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation to Patients With Out-of-hospital Resuscitation, A Randomised Clinical Trial@highlight

1.

 Pre-shock cardiopulmonary resuscitation might benefit the survival of out-of-hospital cardiac patients with ventricular fibrillation / ventricular tachycardia in a post-hoc analysis of a prehospital trial conducted in Europe (L.

Wik,2002).

 However, it's effectiveness in the Asian countries, where most firstly recorded rhythm in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests patients were asystole/pulseless electric activity rather than ventricular fibrillation / ventricular tachycardia, were not explored yet.

 2.

 This trial was designed to exam if pre-shock cardiopulmonary resuscitation by emergency medical technicians improves the outcome of all out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients in an Asian metropolitan city.
