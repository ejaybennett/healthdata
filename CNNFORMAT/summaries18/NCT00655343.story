(secondQuint)Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease (aGvHD) Prophylaxis With ATG-Fresenius in Matched Unrelated Donor-Stem Cell Transplantation (MUD-SCT).

 To assess the efficacy of ATG-FRESENIUS S in addition to standard therapy (cyclosporine A / methotrexate) with respect to early treatment failure defined by the occurrence of severe acute GvHD grade III-IV or early mortality within 100 days post transplantation compared to standard therapy alone.

 All patients receive myeloablative therapy.

 Recommended regimens: For patients with ALL: fractionated TBI (8-12 Gy) plus cyclophosphamide (1-2 x 60 mg/kg) [etoposide/melfalan are also allowed].

 For all other indications: either TBI (8-12 Gy) or busulfan (per os 14-16 mg/kg b.

w.

 or equivalent for IV administration) plus cyclophosphamide (1-2 x 60 mg/kg) or thiotepa 15 mg/kg or BCNU 300 mg/m2.

 Conditioning regimens may differ from centre to centre; each centre decides for constant (disease specific) regimen(s) throughout the whole study period.

 Standard GvHD prophylaxis consists of cyclosporine A (target trough level 200 ng/ml starting from day -1 until day +100) and short course methotrexate (15 mg/m2 at day +1, 10 mg/m2 at days +3, +6 and +11).

The study aim is to evaluate the influence of the anti-T-lymphocyte globulin ATG-Fresenius S given pre-transplant in addition to standard GvHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine A and a short course of methotrexate with respect to efficacy and safety.
