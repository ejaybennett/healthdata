(firstQuint)Effects of Human Leptin Replacement.

 Three separate, but complementary, specific aims, will elucidate the role of leptin in the regulation of (A) the human pituitary-adrenal axis, (B) the human pituitary-gonadal axis, and (C) the human pituitary-thyroid axis.

 These aims will be approached by a carefully designed, prospective clinical study of the rapidly-sampled dynamics of endocrine rhythms during the course of leptin-replacement treatment in the only three adult individuals identified in the world so far who are leptin-naive due to a functional leptin gene mutation.

 A study of leptin-naive subjects avoids all confounding factors and pitfalls, because the only bioactive leptin to which they will be exposed is the exogenously administered recombinant protein.

 Thus, this proposal will permit us to ascertain the endocrine effects of human leptin.

 The proposed studies will elucidate key aspects of human endocrine function and will give new insights on the role of leptin in human endocrine regulation.

 We also propose to perform structural MRI scans (on and off leptin replacement) to test the association of the changes in brain tissue composition with leptin replacement, and to test how leptin influences regional brain function during the presentation of food-related stimuli (pictures of food), which we will present to the patients along with neutral pictures (e.

g.

, landscapes).

 We will test how this possible effect on brain function will be related to food craving or hunger.

 In yet another part of the study we will assess the kinetics of human recombinant leptin.

This study will test the hypothesis that leptin contributes to the regulation of the dynamics of human endocrine function.
