(thirdQuint)A Randomized Phase III Study of Vitamins B6 and B12 to Prevent Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathy in Cancer Patients.

 Neuropathy can be a significant side effect of chemotherapy using platinum compounds, taxanes, and vinca alkaloids.

 There is clinical and preclinical data that vitamin B6 and B12 may alleviate neuropathy in experimentally induced neuropathy in animal models, or clinical neuropathy such as diabetic neuropathy.

 This is a randomized phase III study of the use of multivitamins with or without vitamin B6 and B12 to prevent or relieve neuropathic toxicity from chemotherapy in patients receiving chemotherapy.

 Patients will be stratified by type of chemotherapy agent (3 groups), presence or absence of neuropathy at baseline, and randomized to receive placebo or vitamin B6/B12 supplementation.

 A Randomized Phase III Study of Vitamins B6 and B12 to Prevent Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathy in Cancer Patients@highlight

Many types of chemotherapy may cause nerve damage as a side effect.

 This neurotoxicity can manifest as peripheral sensory neuropathy (characterized by numbness, tingling, or pain).

 The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of the combination of vitamin B6 and B12 in preventing chemotherapy induced neuropathy.
