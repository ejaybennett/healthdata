(secondQuint)COMPASSION - COngenital Multicenter Trial of Pulmonic VAlve Regurgitation Studying the SAPIEN InterventIONal THV.

 The study design is a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized study of up to 70 implanted subjects (US) with no site representing more than 30% of the implanted subjects.

 The subjects will include those subjects who have previously undergone placement of a conduit between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery and now present with a dysfunctional RVOT conduit requiring treatment for moderate or severe pulmonary regurgitation and/or RVOT conduit obstruction.

To assess the safety and effectiveness of pulmonic THV implantation in subjects with dysfunctional RVOT conduit requiring treatment for moderate or severe pulmonary regurgitation (3+ pulmonary regurgitation) and/or RVOT conduit obstruction (mean gradient of >=35mmHg) by TTE.
