(secondQuint)To Evaluate Sperm Parameters in Men With Secondary Hypogonadism Previously Treated With Topical Testosterone.

 The study was designed to determine if Androxal(R) would affect sperm parameters (count, concentration, volume) in men with secondary hypogonadism who have been previously treated with topical testosterone.

 A maximum of twelve subjects per group were randomized to daily treatments of Androxal(R) or topical testosterone (Testim(R)) for six months.

 The protocol was later amended to include a treatment group who received Androxal after a 3 month wash out period.
