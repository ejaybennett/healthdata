(secondQuint)Combined Diabetes-Renal Multifactorial Intervention In Patients With Advanced Diabetic Nephropathy (ADN).

 In this study, the overall objective is comparison of progression of renal insufficiency in subjects with Advanced Diabetic Nephropathy (CKD stages 3 and 4) randomized into multifactorial intervention in the Diabetes-Renal Clinic (study group) and into usual care (control group).

 The multifactorial intervention includes the following: 1.

 Blood pressure control to the goal of 40/50 mg/dl (males/females) [since you said that HDL is not a target because there are no meds for it I deleted HDL;] and triglycerides of less than 200 mg/dl.

 4.

 Patient enhanced self-management provided by combined diabetes-renal education curriculum (taught by certified diabetes and renal educators).

 5.

 Behavior and social intervention (motivational interviews and social assessment) provided as needed by social workers.

 6.

 Intense case management that includes close follow-up of visits, laboratory monitoring and other self-adherence behaviors.

 7.

 Weight loss with lifestyle and diet modification.

 Control Group will keep on receiving the usual treatment that they used to receive from their respective clinics and the Diabetes-Renal team would not alter their therapy or interfere in their management.
