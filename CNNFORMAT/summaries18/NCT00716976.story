(fifthQuint)Sodium Thiosulfate in Preventing Hearing Loss in Young Patients Receiving Cisplatin for Newly Diagnosed Germ Cell Tumor, Hepatoblastoma, Medulloblastoma, Neuroblastoma, Osteosarcoma, or Other Malignancy.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To compare the efficacy of sodium thiosulfate vs observation in preventing hearing loss in young patients receiving cisplatin for the treatment of newly diagnosed germ cell tumor, hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, or other malignancy.

 Secondary - To compare the mean change in hearing thresholds for key frequencies in these patients.

 - To compare the incidences of cisplatin-related grade 3 and 4 nephrotoxicity and grade 3 and 4 cytopenia in these patients.

 - To compare the event-free survival and overall survival of these patients.

 - To evaluate the association of two key gene mutations (TPMT and COMT) with the development of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to prior cranial radiation (yes vs no), age ( 5 years) and duration of cisplatin infusion ( 2 hours).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 - Arm I (sodium thiosulfate): Patients receive sodium thiosulfate IV over 15 minutes beginning 6 hours after the completion of each cisplatin infusion.

 Treatment with sodium thiosulfate continues until the completion of cisplatin therapy.

 - Arm II (observation): Patients do not receive sodium thiosulfate.

 Patients undergo audiological assessment at baseline, prior to each course of cisplatin, and then at 4 weeks and 1 year after the last course of cisplatin or other cancer treatment.

 Some patients may undergo saliva collection for DNA studies.

 After completion of study, patients are followed periodically for 10 years.

 Sodium Thiosulfate in Preventing Hearing Loss in Young Patients Receiving Cisplatin for Newly Diagnosed Germ Cell Tumor, Hepatoblastoma, Medulloblastoma, Neuroblastoma, Osteosarcoma, or Other Malignancy@highlight

RATIONALE: Sodium thiosulfate may reduce or prevent hearing loss in young patients receiving cisplatin for cancer.

 It is not yet known whether sodium thiosulfate is more effective than no additional treatment in preventing hearing loss.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying sodium thiosulfate to see how well it works in preventing hearing loss in young patients receiving cisplatin for newly diagnosed germ cell tumor, hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, or other malignancy.
