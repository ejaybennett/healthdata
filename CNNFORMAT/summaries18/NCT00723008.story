(secondQuint)Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation in Burned Patients.

 The purpose of this research study is to systematically determine if CES therapy is effective in managing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the burn patient.

 Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES) is the delivery of low-level electrical stimulation across the head, delivered with ear lobe electrode clips or self-adhesive electrode pads.

 CES in the current form has been used for the past 30 years to successfully treat anxiety, depression, insomnia and pain in a variety of patient populations.

 This FDA approved medical device is non-invasive and has no reported significant side effects.

 It will be used on patients undergoing outpatient rehabilitation in our burn center.
