(fifthQuint)Two Separate But Identical Studies Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of ALTROPANE in the Use of SPECT Imaging for Upper Extremity Tremor.

 Each study is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, out patient clinical trial which will include up to 240 subjects per study.

 Subjects will be male and female, age 40-80 years, with approximately 20 sites per study.

 Subjects will participate in 5 study visits over the course of the study period.

 The screening visit will include an assessment of eligibility.

 The second visit will be the collection of the community neurologist's diagnostic assessment.

 The third visit, during which all subjects receive a single intravenous (IV) injection of 123I-ALTROPANE(R) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, will include appropriate safety assessments before and after dosing.

 The fourth visit, to occur 24 to 72 hours after SPECT imaging, will include follow up safety assessments as well as the first Movement Disorder Specialist's (MDS) evaluation.

 The fifth visit, to occur 6 months (7 days) after SPECT imaging, will include follow-up safety assessments as well as the MDS reevaluation and truth standard diagnosis.

 The subject's participation in the study will be up to 7 months.

 Two Separate But Identical Studies Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of ALTROPANE in the Use of SPECT Imaging for Upper Extremity Tremor@highlight

This will be two separate but identical studies: ALSE-A-02a, ALSE-A02b.

 Each study is designed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and safety of a single dose of 123I-ALTROPANE(R) in subjects with upper extremity tremor for less than three years.

 Currently, no radiopharmaceutical diagnostic imaging agent has been approved by the FDA in the U.

S.

 for use in diagnosing Parkinson disease and related Parkinsonian syndromes.

 The diagnosis of Parkinsonian syndromes in the U.

S.

 is based on clinical criteria only.

 The goal is to demonstrate that 123I-ALTROPANE(R) paired with SPECT imaging permits a more accurate early diagnosis of Parkinson disease than a clinical diagnosis by a general neurologist.
