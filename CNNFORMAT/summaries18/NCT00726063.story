(firstQuint)A Prospective Study Evaluating the Performance of Nanotite Osseotite Implants When Placed by Graduate Student Programs.

 This multicenter, prospective, randomized-controlled study will compare the performance of the Nanotite vs.

 the standard Ossotite implants when placed by graduate students with little or no prior experience.

 Enrolled patients will have the study site(s) randomized to either a Nanotite (test) or an Osseotite (control) implant.

 The manner of treatment observed at the participating center will be followed for this study.

 Study Hypothesis: The performance of the Nanotite implant in this study will be no different than or superior to that of the Osseotite implant placed during the early period of graduate student training.
