(thirdQuint)Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Intervention to Treat Depression in Individuals With a Traumatic Brain Injury.

 Major depression is a significant chronic problem for people with traumatic brain injury (TBI), and its treatment is difficult.

 A promising approach to treat depression is mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), a relatively new therapeutic approach rooted in mindfulness-based stress-reduction (MBSR) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

 This multi-site, randomized, controlled trial of a MBCT intervention will examine the value of this intervention in improving quality of life and decreasing depression in people with TBI.

 MBCT may represent a time-limited, cost-effective group intervention through which clinicians would have an opportunity to address some of the most debilitating aspects of TBI.

 Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Intervention to Treat Depression in Individuals With a Traumatic Brain Injury@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is effective in reducing depression symptoms in individuals who have experienced a traumatic brain injury.

 The investigators hypothesize that participants who are given the ten-week intervention will have fewer depression symptoms than the participants in the control group, and this improvement will be maintained at the three-month follow-up assessment.
