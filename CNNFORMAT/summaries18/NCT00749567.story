(thirdQuint)Combination of Erlotinib and Bevacizumab as Second-line Treatment in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 A randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial of erlotinib versus placebo, demonstrated that therapy with this tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) prolongs survival after first or second line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.

 Moreover, the addition of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor bevacizumab (VEGF), to systemic chemotherapy, improved both the response rates and the time to tumor progression in two trials.

 Early data from phase I/II trials examining the combination of these two biological agents in pre-treated patients with non-squamous NSCLC, showed no major pharmacokinetic interactions and promising clinical activity.

 Combination of Erlotinib and Bevacizumab as Second-line Treatment in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, who progressed after first line treatment.

 Pretreatment with one of the two agents would not excluded patients from the study, in order to evaluate whether the combination of the two biologic agents could reverse tumor resistance.
