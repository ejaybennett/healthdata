(thirdQuint)Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in medically inoperable patients with centrally located stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

 (Phase I) - To estimate the local control rate of SBRT at the MTD in these patients.

 (Phase II) Secondary - To estimate the rates of adverse events (other than dose-limiting toxicity) of grade 3 that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment and that occurs within 1 year after the start of SBRT in these patients.

 - To estimate the rates of late adverse events (i.

e.

, occurs > 1 year after the start of SBRT) in these patients.

 - To estimate the local control and progression-free and overall survival rates in patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients undergo stereotactic body radiotherapy every 2 days over 1 1/2-2 weeks [total of 5 fractions (FX)] in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 2 years, then annually.

RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

 PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer.
