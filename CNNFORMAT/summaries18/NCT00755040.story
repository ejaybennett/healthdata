(thirdQuint)Cyclosporine Eye Drops in Preventing Graft-Versus-Host Disease of the Eye in Patients Who Have Undergone Donor Stem Cell Transplant for Hematologic Cancer or Bone Marrow Failure Disorder.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess the efficacy of cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion (Restasis(R)) in the prevention of ocular graft-versus-host disease in patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies or bone marrow failure disorders.

 Secondary - To correlate the Ocular Surface Disease Index with clinical ophthalmologic examination.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to age, type of transplant (related vs unrelated), and intensity of transplant (ablative vs other).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion (Restasis(R)) drops in each eye twice daily for up to 1 year after transplant.

 - Arm II: Patients receive placebo ophthalmic drops in each eye twice daily for up to 1 year after transplant.

 Patients in both arms may also receive artificial tear drops at least twice daily as clinically necessary.

RATIONALE: Cyclosporine eye drops may prevent graft-versus-host disease of the eye in patients who have undergone donor stem cell transplant for hematologic cancer or bone marrow failure disorder.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying how well cyclosporine eye drops work in preventing graft-versus-host disease of the eye in patients who have undergone donor stem cell transplant for hematologic cancer or bone marrow failure disorder.
