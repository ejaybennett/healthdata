(firstQuint)Safety and Effectiveness Study of the MEL 80 Excimer Laser Using LASIK in the Treatment of Hyperopia.

 LASIK has become one of the most common refractive eye procedures performed in the country.

 In the hyperopia procedure, a steepening occurs on the corneal surface, rather than the flattening procedure (myopic treatment).

 The surgeon will produce a standard keratomileusis flap using a microkeratome, exposing the corneal stroma.

 Recontouring under the flap is then accomplished by the removal of tissue from the stroma with the laser.

 This recontouring results in an altering of effective lens power of the central cornea, measured in diopters (D).

 The MEL 80 Excimer Laser System will be evaluated for its ability to create accurate and stable hyperopic refractive correction results.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether the MEL 80 Excimer Laser is effective in the treatment of hyperopia, when used as part of the Laser In Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) procedure.
