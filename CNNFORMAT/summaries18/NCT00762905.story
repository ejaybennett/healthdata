(thirdQuint)Clinical Trial of MedLogic LiquiBand Laparoscopic Versus Dermabond in the Closure of Surgical Incisions.

 This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-masked multi-center clinical trial.

 Patients requiring laparoscopic surgery will be enrolled and randomized to receive either LiquiBand Laparoscopic cent or DermaBond High Viscosity for incision closure.

 No other closure methods will be allowed.

 All eligible laparoscopic incisions per patient will be enrolled.

 Patients will be followed at 2 weeks and 3 months post-procedure to assess wound characteristics, wound infection, wound dehiscence and at 3 months for cosmesis.

 The study will be double-masked in that both the wound evaluator and patient will be masked to the randomized study treatment assignment.
