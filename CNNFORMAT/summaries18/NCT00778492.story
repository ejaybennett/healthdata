(firstQuint)Thrombelastogram in Patients Receiving Antiplatelet Medication Undergoing Cardiac Surgery.

 Study Design: Prospective observational study with blinded assessment of study endpoint variables.

 Collection of information concerning study endpoints will be performed by the investigator blinded to the results of preoperative testing of platelet function.

 The information will be collected from 60 patients undergoing cardiac surgery in the Department of Cardiac Surgery of Sheba Medical Center.

 Study endpoints 1.

 Primary endpoint- resternotomy for bleeding after the surgery.

 2.

 Secondary endpoints- chest tube output during first 24 hours after the surgery; consumption of blood products during first 3 postoperative days.
