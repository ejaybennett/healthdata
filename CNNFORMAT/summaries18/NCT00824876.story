(secondQuint)Orthostatic Tolerance in Mamma Cancer Patients After Anaesthesia.

 It is known, that patients undergoing major surgery have problems maintaining upright posture after major surgery.

 This can be due to fall in bloodpressure, with symptoms like dizziness, nausea/vomiting and fainting.

 With this investigation, we want to prove that anaesthesia is not the decisive factor, in patients ability to maintain upright posture after surgery.

 The investigators hypothesis is, that a standard anaesthesia does not effect the ability to maintain upright posture right after surgery.
