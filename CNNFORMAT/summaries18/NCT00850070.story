(thirdQuint)Sapropterin as a Treatment for Autistic Disorder.

 Over the past 20 years, several studies have suggested that sapropterin (tetrahydrobiopterin) might ameliorate core symptoms of autism at least in young (under age 6) subjects.

 However, those studies had somewhat questionable methodologies, a major one being that the doses of sapropterin used were roughly one tenth that thought to be needed to provide physiologically meaningful increases of sapropterin in the central nervous system (CNS).

 This study will look at the impact of a sustained exposure to this higher dose in well-diagnosed young children with autism.

 Sapropterin as a Treatment for Autistic Disorder@highlight

This study is intended to provide a definitive test of the hypothesis that elevating sapropterin (tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor for several key brain enzymes)concentrations in the CNS will result in measurable improvements in core symptoms of autism in young individuals, under age 6 years.

 The study will entail a double-blind, placebo-controlled 16-week intervention.
