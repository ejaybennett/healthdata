(firstQuint)Two Dimensional (2D) Silicon Transducer-Compression Plates for Breast Ultrasound.

 To assist in the developement of 3 dimensional breast ultrasound imaging and when possible compare the ultrasound results with 3D mammography (digital tomosynthesis mammography)or clinical mammography and ultrasound.

 Hopefully that this new, 3D ultrasound imaging can provide important information not found on mammograms or routine breast ultrasound.
