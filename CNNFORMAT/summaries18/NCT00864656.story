(thirdQuint)Eyelid Position Interdependence in Involutional Ptosis Patients Submitted to 10% Phenylephrine.

 This is a prospective observational study conducted in involutional ptosis patients, which will be submitted to instillation of a single drop of 10% phenylephrine in one eye(Group 1), 2 drops (G2) or 4 drops ( G3).

 Video camera will record the images of both eyes before and after drug application at 3, 10, 15 and 30 minutes.
