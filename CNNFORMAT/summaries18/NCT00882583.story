(fifthQuint)A Study of Dasatinib, Cetuximab and Radiation With or Without Cisplatin in HNSCC.

 Primary Objective for Phase I 1.

 To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of daily Oral dasatinib in combination with cetuximab/RT in Cohort A, in patients with AJCC stage II (T2N0) and III (T1-2N1) SCCHN of oral cavity, oropharynx, T2N0 hypopharynx, T2N0-1 supraglottic larynx.

 2.

 To determine the MTD of daily oral dasatinib in combination with cisplatin/cetuximab/RT in Cohort B, in patients with AJCC stage III (T3N0-1) and IV (T1-4N2-3M0, T4N0-1M0) squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx.

 Primary Objectives of Phase II 1.

 To estimate the objective tumor response rate and toxicity in Patients treated in expanded Cohort A and B.

 Secondary Objectives of Phase II 1.

 To estimate the 2 year disease free survival of patients treated in Cohorts A and B.

 2.

 To estimate the median overall survival in patients treated in Cohorts A and B.

 3.

 To perform an exploratory analysis of biomarker expression on serial samples of tumor and blood and to correlate biomarker expression with response and survival outcomes in patients treated in Cohorts A and B.

 4.

 To estimate the role of 18F-FDG PET as an early indicator of response in patients treated in Cohorts A and B and correlate with clinical and pathological response and survival outcomes.
