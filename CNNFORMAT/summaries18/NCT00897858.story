(thirdQuint)Studying Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins and Angiogenesis Proteins in Young Patients With Newly Diagnosed Central Nervous System Tumors.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Investigate the feasibility of centrally collecting and processing high-quality cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from pediatric patients with newly diagnosed central nervous system tumors for proteomic studies.

 - Identify protein markers that might indicate the presence of a brain tumor using CSF samples collected from these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients undergo cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection from any or all of the following 5 sites: lumbar, cervical, ommaya, intra-operative (ventricular, cisternal), and/or external ventricular drain.

 CSF is obtained within 8 weeks of diagnosis but prior to (or concurrent with) the initiation of any post-operative therapy (excluding corticosteroids).

 CSF samples are examined for proteomic biomarkers by 2D gel electrophoresis, low-mass fingerprinting, and stable isotope labeling.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 99 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of cerebrospinal fluid from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 PURPOSE: This laboratory study is studying cerebrospinal fluid proteins and angiogenesis proteins in young patients with newly diagnosed central nervous system tumors.
