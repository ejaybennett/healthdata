(firstQuint)Binge Eating and Chromium Study.

 Binge eating (i.

e.

, the consumption of unusually large amounts of food with a sense of loss of control) is a common problem with serious public health implications in large part due to its role in obesity.

 Binge eating leads to weight gain and is common in overweight individuals.

 Current treatments for binge eating disorder (BED) are inadequate, and previous randomized treatment trials have suffered from high drop out rate due to the adverse effects of pharmacological agents.

 Chromium picolinate is a dietary supplement that has been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and appetite regulation problems in patients with atypical depression; chromium picolinate also affects insulin regulation and has been shown to improve glucose levels in patients with type-2 diabetes.

 This pilot study will evaluate the effect of chromium picolinate on binge eating, mood, body weight, and glucose regulation in overweight individuals with BED.
