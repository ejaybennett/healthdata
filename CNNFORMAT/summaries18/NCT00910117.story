(secondQuint)Induction Chemotherapy With Nimotuzumab in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC).

 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with unresectable HNSCC.

 However, the role of induction chemotherapy remains uncertain for resectable disease.

 Therefore, we plan to perform a phase II study to evaluate it, focusing on radiographic and pathologic response after induction chemotherapy.

 Moreover, a new EGFR monoclonal antibody (nimotuzumab) is incorporated with PF regimen.

 The hypothesis is the addition of nimotuzumab would improve the response without remarkably increase the toxicity.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of nimotuzumab in the neo-adjuvant setting in patients with locally advanced HNSCC.

 The hypothesis is that the response would be increased with the combination of nimotuzumab and cisplatin and fluorouracil (PF) regimen.
