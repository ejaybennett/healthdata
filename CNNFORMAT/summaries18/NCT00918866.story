(firstQuint)A Study of Commercial DEFINITY to Monitor the Effects of the Heart's Pulmonary Artery Pressure.

 This Phase IV safety study will provide safety data on potential systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic effects caused by the administration of DEFINITY(R) in patients who are to undergo right heart cardiac catheterization for clinical reasons.

 Using a right heart catheter for direct measurements of pulmonary artery hemodynamics will allow accurate assessments of potential alterations of the pulmonary vasculature.

 This will be further investigated by the inclusion of two patient populations, one with a baseline pulmonary artery pressure < 35 mmHg, and one with elevated baseline pulmonary artery pressure.

 The addition of immune parameter measurements will assess a potential link between systemic and pulmonary alterations and potential immune reactions following DEFINITY(R) administration.

 The inclusion of patients in this study is not based on a required echocardiogram with DEFINITY(R) administration because patients would be exposed to an unjustifiable risk of invasive right heart catheterization and are unlikely to consent to such a procedure.

 Therefore, patients undergoing heart catheterization for clinical reasons, or patients who are undergoing pulmonary artery hemodynamic assessments will be enrolled and receive DEFINITY(R) in this study.

The purpose of this clinical research is to learn if DEFINITY(R) 416 will cause any adverse effects during Right Heart Catheterization.

 This research was requested by the FDA.
