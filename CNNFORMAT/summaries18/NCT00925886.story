(secondQuint)Use of Toric Intraocular Lens to Neutralize Keratometric Astigmatism.

 Patients with Cataract are treated with phacoemulsification of the lens with an implantation of an intraocular lens.

 Besides cataract, almost 25% of these patients have some degree of Astigmatism; when it is higher than 1 diopter, it is possible to neutralize it with an implantation of a toric intraocular lens.
