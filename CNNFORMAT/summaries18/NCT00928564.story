(fifthQuint)Addition of Pudendal Blocks to Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy for the Treatment of Pelvic Floor Tension Myalgia.

 Participants will be identified within UC Irvine urogynecology and/or pelvic floor physical therapy practice with the underlying diagnosis of pelvic floor tension myalgia.

 This diagnosis may be secondary to various underlying etiologies including interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, vulvodynia, endometriosis, adhesive disease, unknown etiology, etc.

 At the time of enrollment, participants will be randomized into one of two groups: either standard pelvic floor physical therapy with weekly saline placebo injections or standard pelvic floor physical therapy and weekly pudendal blocks for 6 weeks.

 Standard physical therapy techniques will be utilized in both groups.

 Weekly injections of a mixture of a steroid and local anesthetic or saline will be administered depending on the randomization.

 Injections will be administered by a urogynecology physician.

 The participant and the treating physical therapist will be blinded to treatment assignment.

 The participant will be evaluated with for pelvic floor muscle strength and tenderness and will have pain assessed by a visual analog scale at baseline, weekly throughout the study, and at 6 months after study enrollment.

 Vaginal electromyography will be performed and standardized questionnaires regarding pelvic floor symptoms, quality of life and sexual function will be administered at baseline, after 6 weeks of injections and at 6 months after enrollment.

 Addition of Pudendal Blocks to Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy for the Treatment of Pelvic Floor Tension Myalgia@highlight

Pelvic floor tension myalgia (PFTM) is increasingly noted in patients with chronic pelvic pain.

 Pelvic floor physical therapy is typically utilized and is at times combined with other therapies such as botox injections, trigger point injections or pudendal blocks.

 The investigators' study will randomize newly diagnosed patients with PFTM to weekly physical therapy with weekly pudendal blocks or placebo saline injection.

 Participants randomized to physical therapy with placebo injections that have a visual analog scale score of greater than 4 at 6 weeks may cross-over to the pudendal block group.

 Final patient assessment will be performed at 6 months to assess durability of response.

 Primary hypothesis: The addition of pudendal blocks to standard pelvic floor physical therapy will result in lower pain and pelvic floor muscle tension scores, lower baseline vaginal pressure and increase pelvic floor strength.

 Secondary hypothesis: The addition of pudendal blocks to standard pelvic floor physical therapy will result in a lower pain score in a shorter time frame, resulting in faster progress through physical therapy.
