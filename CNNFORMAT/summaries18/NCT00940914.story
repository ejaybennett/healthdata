(fifthQuint)Dopaminergic Loss and Pain in Parkinson's Disease.

 Parkinson's disease is a frequent neurodegenerative disease leading to motor handicap, cognitive and pain disorders.

 These pain disorders could be correlated to dopaminergic loss.

 The clinical trial will be conducted in a single center (Neurology Department, Purpan Hospital, Toulouse, France).

 The study is classified as a physiopathology one.

 Twenty patients with Parkinson's disease, presenting pain disorders or not, will be selected.

 This clinical trial will last one year.

 All the exams, including image acquisition will be done the same day.

 These will take about 6 hours for each patient.

 Expected results: Binding of 123I FP-CIT to dopamine transporters should negatively correlate with pain intensity and also with thermal pain thresholds in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease.

 Dopaminergic Loss and Pain in Parkinson's Disease@highlight

About 46% of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease present pain disorders.

 Parkinson disease is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons.

 The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between the loss of dopaminergic neurons and the existence of pain in Parkinson's disease.

 Using single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) imaging (123I FP-CIT, which binds dopamine transporter) and the determination of subjective pain threshold, the investigators will establish correlations between dopaminergic degeneration and pain perception.
