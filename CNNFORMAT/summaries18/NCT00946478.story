(thirdQuint)Effect of Pimecrolimus Cream on Cathelicidin Levels in Subjects With Eczema.

 Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) have higher rates of skin infections from viruses and bacteria.

 They also have an impaired innate immune system.

 Antimicrobial peptides are a component of the innate immune system which are decreased in atopics.

 In vitro, pimecrolimus has demonstrated its ability to increase antimicrobial peptides.

 This study will examine the ability of pimecrolimus to increase antimicrobial peptides in vivo in AD patients.

 Thus, the study will yield a better understanding of the role of pimecrolimus in regulating the immune system in atopics.

 Effect of Pimecrolimus Cream on Cathelicidin Levels in Subjects With Eczema@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of topical pimecrolimus on the immune system by assessing the levels of antimicrobial peptides in the skin of patients with eczema.

 It is hypothesized that pimecrolimus applied topically will repair the body's immune system in patients with eczema by increasing antimicrobial peptides.
