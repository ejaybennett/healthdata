(firstQuint)Evaluation of Plasma Catecholamine Concentration During Surgery.

 Hypothesis: Resection of pheochromocytomas can lead to more than normal stress in surgeons and because of abrupt hemodynamic changes in patients as well in anesthesiologists.

 Measurements of catecholamine concentrations at baseline, prior to surgery during and after surgery, are to be performed to test this hypothesis.

 Evaluation of Plasma Catecholamine Concentration During Surgery@highlight

Stress during surgery leads to significant increase in plasma catecholamine concentrations in surgeons, anesthesiologists, and patients.
