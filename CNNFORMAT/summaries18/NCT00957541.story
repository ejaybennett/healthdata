(thirdQuint)Evaluation of a Diagnostic Feature in a Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Device.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a new sensor-based diagnostic feature, which has been implemented in a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device.

 This trial will study the effectiveness of the diagnostic feature to detect heart failure events in medically stable, ICD-indicated, congestive heart failure patients.

 The ability of the diagnostic feature to 'detect' and 'predict' heart failure events will be studied.
