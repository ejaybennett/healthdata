(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of Sirolimus in Complicated Vascular Anomalies.

 Patients with vascular anomalies (VA) have a spectrum of diseases that can be broadly classified into vascular tumors and malformations.

 Complicated vascular anomalies can cause disfigurement, chronic pain, and organ dysfunction with significant morbidity and mortality.

 Despite the severity of potential complications, we lack uniform guidelines for the treatment and response to treatment of children and young adults with these diseases.

 There are pre-clinical and clinical data supporting the essential regulatory function of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in vascular growth and organization, and suggest a therapeutic target for patients with complicated vascular anomalies.

 The overall goal of this trial is to objectively determine the effectiveness and safety of the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin* in the treatment of children and young adults diagnosed with complicated vascular anomalies.

 We propose a Phase 2 trial with the diagnostic, therapeutic and response criteria experimentally determined in this study used as a framework for future Phase 3 clinical trials.
