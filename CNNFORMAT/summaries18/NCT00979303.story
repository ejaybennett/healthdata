(secondQuint)Using Non-Fluoroscopic Imaging Devices to Decrease Radiation Exposure During Ablation of Supraventricular Tachycardia.

 The standard of care for children undergoing SVT ablation is radiation (fluoroscopy) to see the heart.

 Non fluoroscopic imaging tools have been utilized for adult atrial fibrillation procedures.

 These tools utilize magnetic fields to visualize the heart without using radiation.

 The purpose of this study was to determine if these 3D mapping tools could reduce radiation exposure during SVT ablation procedures could be performed using these 3D tools.

 Using Non-Fluoroscopic Imaging Devices to Decrease Radiation Exposure During Ablation of Supraventricular Tachycardia@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether the additional use of non-fluoroscopic imaging modalities can decrease the use of radiation exposure during standard ablation procedures for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in children.
