(firstQuint)Perineural Catheter Insertion Distance for Continuous Peripheral Nerve Blocks.

 Specific Aim: Research study to determine the relationships between perineural catheter insertion distance and subsequent continuous peripheral nerve block effects.

 Hypothesis: during ultrasound-guided perineural catheter placement, inserting the catheter 0-1cm past the needle tip is associated with decreased postoperative pain compared with inserting the catheter 5-6cm past the needle tip.

 Perineural Catheter Insertion Distance for Continuous Peripheral Nerve Blocks@highlight

This is a research study to determine if the effects of continuous peripheral nerve blocks are influenced by the distance of insertion past the needle tip of the perineural catheter.
