(firstQuint)Metabolic Effects of GH and IGF-I in Growth Hormone Deficient(GHD) and Diabetes and Impaired Glucose Tolerance(IGT).

 The study was a 6 months randomised placebo controlled trial of adults with GHD and type 2 diabetes.

 All receive GH (0.

15 mg/day for 1 month, 0.

3 mg/day for 5 months) and are randomised to IGF-I or placebo (15 mu g/kg/day for 1 month and 30 mu g/kg/day for 5 months).

 Glucose metabolism is evaluated with euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and body composition by computed tomography (CT) and bio impedance;.

 Metabolic Effects of GH and IGF-I in Growth Hormone Deficient(GHD) and Diabetes and Impaired Glucose Tolerance(IGT)@highlight

The aim of this study is to measure effects of the combined treatment with GH and IGF-I on glucose sensitivity and body composition in patients with GHD and IGT or diabetes.
