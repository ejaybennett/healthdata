(secondQuint)Carfilzomib and Lenalidomide With Dexamethasone Combination in Newly Diagnosed, Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma.

 During the Phase I portion of this clinical trial, the dose of Revlimid(R) and carfilzomib will be increased until the best and safest amount (or dose) is identified in combination with standard doses of Revlimid(R) and dexamethasone.

 "Investigational" means that the drug combination is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause and how effective the Revlimid(R) and carfilzomib and dexamethasone investigational combination is for treating newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

 In this clinical trial we are looking for the highest dose of the combination that can be given safely and see how well it works as a combination in newly diagnosed patients.

 The drug, carfilzomib, has not yet been approved by the FDA (U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration).

 Revlimid(R) and Dexamethasone have been approved by the FDA.

 The drugs have not been approved in this combination for use for your type of cancer or any other type of cancer.

 Carfilzomib is being researched to treat multiple myeloma.

 Dexamethasone is commonly used, either alone, or in combination with other drugs, to treat multiple myeloma.

 Revlimid(R) is currently approved by the US FDA in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy.

 After the Phase I clinical trial defines the safest doses of Revlimid(R) and carfilzomib and dexamethasone that can be taken together, the research study will move on to its second portion, a Phase II clinical trial.

 The Phase II portion of the clinical trial will test the clinical effectiveness of the best dose combination of the three drugs.
