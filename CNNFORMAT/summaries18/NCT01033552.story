(fifthQuint)Biochemical Correction of Severe EB by Allo HSCT and "Off-the-shelf" MSCs.

 The primary objective of this study is to estimate the event-free survival rate by 1 year post-transplant with an event defined as a death or failure to have a demonstrable increase in collagen, laminin, integrin, keratin or plakin deposition by 1 year post-transplant or other biochemical, structural or physical measure of improvement.

 The secondary objectives of this study are to i) determine the incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 180 days; ii) describe the pattern of biochemical improvement as measured by an increase in protein expression (collagen, laminin, integrin, keratin or plakin) and related structural and physical changes; iii) describe health quality of life at day 365 and 730 as compared to pretreatment results; iv) describe the pattern and durability of HSC and third party MSC engraftment in the skin; v) determine the probability of survival at 1 year.

 Patients with severe epidermolysis bullosa will be screened to meet the eligibility requirements, related or unrelated donor marrow or UCB will be infused, and subjects will be followed for a minimum of 5 years after stem cell transplant.

 A target accrual of 75 subjects over 5 years will be recruited to the study.

 Biochemical Correction of Severe EB by Allo HSCT and "Off-the-shelf" MSCs@highlight

This is an open-label, single institution, phase II study in patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB).

 The underlying hypothesis is that the infusion of bone marrow or umbilical cord blood from a healthy unaffected donor will correct the collagen, laminin, integrin, or plakin deficiency and reduce the skin fragility characteristic of severe forms of EB.

 A secondary hypothesis is that mesenchymal stem cells from a healthy donor will enhance the safety and efficacy of the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant as well as serve as a source of renewable cells for the treatment of focal areas of residual blistering.
