 Comparison of coronary wedge pressure 4.

 Establishing a new scoring system to predict the ST elevation during 1min balloon occlusion.

 Comparison Between Main Branch and Side Branch Vessels@highlight

The purpose of this trial is 1.

 to compare the clinical significance of the main vessel and the side branch vessel using EKG, pain score and coronary wedge pressure 2.

 to develop a new scoring system to predict the clinical significance of a side branch
