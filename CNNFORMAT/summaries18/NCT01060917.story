(thirdQuint)Glucose Clamp Study to Prove Hypo- and Hyperglycemic Episodes Using a Non-invasive Glucose Monitoring Device.

 A completely non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring device is considered as a major target of glucose sensor development.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of a non-invasive glucose sensor (wristwatch) under controlled conditions (glucose clamp) at hyperglycemia (study day 1) and at hypoglycemia (study day 2).

 Measurements of the non-invasive glucose monitoring device are compared to those obtained from a minimally invasive glucose monitoring device (GlucoDay, microdialysis principle).

 In addition, changes in blood electrolyte concentrations as well as their impact on the measurements of the non-invasive glucose sensor are evaluated.
