(fifthQuint)Pemetrexed Disodium and Cisplatin With or Without Cediranib Maleate in Treating Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose of cediranib maleate (cediranib) in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed disodium (pemetrexed).

 (Phase I) II.

 To assess the safety and toxicity of the regimen.

 (Phase I) III.

 To assess whether cisplatin/pemetrexed plus cediranib as compared to cisplatin/pemetrexed plus placebo improves progression-free survival in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

 (Phase II) IV.

 To compare overall survival in patients treated with cisplatin/pemetrexed plus cediranib to those treated with cisplatin/pemetrexed plus placebo.

 (Phase II) V.

 To assess the safety and toxicity profile of the regimen.

 (Phase II) VI.

 To assess response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses) and disease control rate (response or stable disease) in the subset of patients with measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

 (Phase II) VII.

 To assess response rate and disease control rate using modified RECIST criteria for pleural tumors in the subset of patients with measurable disease by modified RECIST criteria for pleural tumors.

 (Phase II) VIII.

 To assess the rate of agreement between local and central pathology review of mesothelioma and its histologic subtypes.

 (Phase II) IX.

 To collect specimens for banking for use in future research studies.

 (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of cediranib maleate followed by a phase II study.

 PHASE I (CLOSED): Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and cediranib maleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients then receive cediranib maleate alone PO QD in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and cediranib maleate PO QD on days 1-21.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients then receive cediranib maleate alone PO QD in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 ARM II: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium and cisplatin as in arm I and placebo PO QD on days 1-21.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients then receive placebo alone PO QD in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and then at 3 years.

 Pemetrexed Disodium and Cisplatin With or Without Cediranib Maleate in Treating Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma@highlight

This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of cediranib maleate when given together with pemetrexed disodium and cisplatin and to see how well it works in treating patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, pemetrexed disodium and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Cediranib maleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

 Giving pemetrexed disodium and cisplatin together with cediranib maleate may kill more tumor cells.
