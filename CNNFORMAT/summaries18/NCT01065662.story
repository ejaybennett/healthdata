(fifthQuint)AZD2171 and Temsirolimus in Patients With Advanced Gynecological Malignancies.

 - We are looking for the highest dose of the study drugs that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have recurrent gynecological cancers.

 Not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug.

 - There will be samples of blood taken that measure any additional effect of the study drugs and to look for a marker for the participant's particular type of cancer.

 Blood will be taken at a certain point in the study to evaluate the interaction of the two study drugs, cediranib and temsirolimus when given together.

 These are called pharmacokinetic (PK) samples.

 About 6 teaspoons of blood will be taken with each PK sample with a total of 34 samples taken.

 - Participants will be given a study medication diary for each treatment cycle.

 Each cycle lasts four weeks (28 days).

 Temsirolimus will be given on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each cycle.

 Cediranib wil be taken orally once daily in the morning.

 - Participants will be asked to monitor their blood pressure on a daily basis at home and keep a blood pressure diary.

 - The following tests and procedures will be performed at specific time periods during the course of the study: medical history; side effect assessment; physical exam; vital signs; blood tests; CT scan; MUGA or ECHO; EKG and urine test.

 AZD2171 and Temsirolimus in Patients With Advanced Gynecological Malignancies@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of the combination of the two drugs cediranib and temsirolimus and the highest doses of these two drugs that can be given in combination to people safely.

 Cediranib is a drug that may stop blood supply to the tumor and therefore help keep cancer cells from growing.

 Temsirolimus is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing.

 These drugs have been used in other research studies in ovarian and kidney cancer and these studies suggest that these drugs may help to keep cancer from growing in this research study.
