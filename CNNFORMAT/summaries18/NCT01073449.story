(fifthQuint)Actions Elicited by In-hospital Follow-up of Cardiac Devices.

 Number of Pacemakers (PM) and Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD) is rapidly growing due to enlarged indications.

 This fact causes an exponential increase in scheduled in-hospital follow-ups.

 For this reason, all the companies that produce PM and ICD have released systems that allow remote monitoring and follow-up of cardiac devices (both PM and ICD) and U.

S.

 guidelines have already been changed, in order to suggest remote follow-up of these devices at appropriated intervals.

 Nevertheless, informations on actions taken during scheduled in-hospital follow-up are incomplete.

 ATHENS study has been designed to answer to 3 questions: 1.

 How often, during a scheduled in hospital follow-up physicians "change" something ? (device programming; drug therapy; scheduled device replacement .

.

.

) 2.

 The "rate of change" is different is the follow-up is required pby the general practitioner who normally takes care of the patients or by the patient itself? 3.

 Change are more frequent during PM or during ICD follow-up or during cardiac resynchronization therapy devices?.

 Actions Elicited by In-hospital Follow-up of Cardiac Devices@highlight

This study will enroll all patients who will attend an in-hospital follow-up of cardiac device since February 22nd 2010 to June 21st 2010.

 Primary objective of the study is to observe how many of patients seen during these period (approximately 5000) will receive a change in cardiac device programming or in drug therapy or a scheduled or urgent hospital admission.

 These data should help to clarify how useful and safe is a remote monitoring strategy for this kind of patients.
