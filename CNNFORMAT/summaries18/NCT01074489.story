(secondQuint)Challenging the Gold Standard: Pilot Study Comparing Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS), Capillary Glucose Monitors and 3 Hour Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) to Diagnose Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM).

 The rate of gestational diabetes and fetal macrosomia is increasing.

 Moreover, it appears that many macrosomic infants are born to non-diabetic mothers.

 However, this presents the question of whether our current accepted means of diagnosis is reflecting the true prevalence of GDM.

 The 3-hour GTT measures glycemic control over a limited period of time.

 A more prolonged period of monitoring makes more physiologic sense, as it would paint a picture of a patient's overall trend before a diagnosis can be confirmed or excluded.

 Given the ability of the CGMS and capillary glucose monitor to follow glycemic trends over an extended time period, these methods may prove more effective at identifying patients with abnormal glucose tolerance.

 As these modalities test the patients in their native environments, the effect of dietary changes prior to the testing period may be minimized, potentially providing an more accurate assessment of abnormal glucose utilization.

 Furthermore, both modalities should be more cost-effective than the 3- hour GTT.

The purpose of this research study is to compare 3 methods of measuring blood glucose (blood sugar) levels to see if the finger-stick method or the continuous glucose monitoring system is better than or as good as the 3 hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.
