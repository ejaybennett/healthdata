(firstQuint)Low Level Laser Therapy for Hair Preservation With Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer.

 Chemotherapy is a common treatment given to patients with breast cancer.

 Many chemotherapy drugs cause rapid hair loss.

 While hair loss is temporary, this side effect is a significant concern for patients.

 Low level laser therapy has been shown to help make hair grow.

 It is hoped that it may stop hair loss from occurring.

 Participants will be receiving 20 to 30 minute laser sessions to their scalp twice a week beginning two weeks before treatment begins until one week past the last chemotherapy session.

 Photographs will be taken during each study participant's initial visit, during treatment visits, and one month following the final chemotherapy treatment.
