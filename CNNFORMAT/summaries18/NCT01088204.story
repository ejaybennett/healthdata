(firstQuint)Feasibility Study of Laparoscopy-assisted D2 Distal Gastrectomy to Treat Advanced Gastric Cancer.

 To test oncological feasibility, compliance of nodal dissection was selected as a primary end point.

 When there are more than two missing nodal station(no lymph nodes in dissected area), it is defined as a non-compliant nodal dissection.

 Other secondary outcomes will be supplementary to evaluate feasibility of D2 dissection.
