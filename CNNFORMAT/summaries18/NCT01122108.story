(secondQuint)Comparison of Colesevelam Hydrogen Chloride (HCl) Powder For Oral Suspension Versus Generic Cholestyramine Through Use of the Bile Acid Sequestrant Acceptability (BASA) Scale.

 In 2009, colesevelam HCl was approved as a powder formulation.

 Little objective evidence exists comparing the acceptability of colesevelam HCl powder for oral suspension formulation versus other bile acid sequestrant powder formulations.

 A Bile Acid Sequestrant Acceptability (BASA) Scale was developed and validated as an instrument to compare the acceptability of different bile acid sequestrant preparations.

The objective of this study is to compare the acceptability of Colesevelam HCl powder for oral suspension versus generic cholestyramine via the BASA scale, based upon an anticipated equivalent cholesterol lowering doses of each comparator drug.
