(fifthQuint)Telephone Tinnitus Education for Patients With Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).

 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is strongly associated with tinnitus.

 Tinnitus management for Veterans and military members with TBI has become a critical concern.

 The investigators' research has focused on developing effective, evidence-based methods of tinnitus management for Veterans.

 These efforts led to the development of Progressive Tinnitus Management (PTM).

 The investigators completed a pilot study to adapt PTM to meet the unique tinnitus management needs of Veterans and military members with TBI using a novel home-based telehealth program called Tele-PTM.

 Preliminary data analyses indicated that Tele-PTM is effective.

 The present study modified the PTM program in accordance with pilot study findings and evaluated Tele-PTM using a randomized clinical trial design.

 The 4-year study was based at the VA National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR).

 Tele-PTM was implemented and evaluated in a randomized clinical trial.

 Qualified candidates were randomized to receive either Tele-PTM or Wait-List Control (WLC).

 All subjects completed questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline.

 The WLC group received Tele-PTM after completing the 6-month questionnaires.

 The primary outcome measure was the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI).

 Tele-PTM involves a series of seven telephone appointments, conducted at approximately 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks, and 3 and 6 months after enrollment is finalized.

 Telephone education was provided by the Study Psychologist at weeks 1, 3, and 5, and month 6; and by the Study Audiologist at weeks 2 and 4, and month 3.

 Tele-PTM has the potential of providing needed tinnitus services to Veterans and active military personnel across the country for a relatively small cost and with minimal impact on individual VA hospitals.

This study continues the investigators' efforts to develop tinnitus management protocols for Veterans.

 More specifically, this study developed and evaluated an adaptation of Progressive Tinnitus Management (PTM) for use as a telephone-based program for Veterans and military personnel who have experienced TBI.

 This adaptation, called Tele-PTM, is a telephone-based program and has the potential of providing needed tinnitus services to Veterans with and without TBI for a relatively small cost and with minimal impact on individual VA hospitals.
