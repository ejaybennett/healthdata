(secondQuint)Screening Brief Intervention Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) in New Mexico.

 Drug use is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.

 Efforts to develop and rigorously evaluate methods to provide Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) for drug users are needed.

 Computerized screening and brief interventions in particular have the potential to circumvent some of the potential problems of integrating SBIRT delivered by a counselor into busy primary care settings.

 These interventions may reduce drug use among individuals who are using drugs but are not yet drug dependent.
