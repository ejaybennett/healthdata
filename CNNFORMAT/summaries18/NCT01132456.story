(secondQuint)RESOLUTE Asia: Evaluation of the Endeavor Resolute Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent System in a Patient Population With Long Lesion(s) and/or Dual Vessels in Asia.

 A total of 249 to 411 patients will be enrolled from Asia at approximately 25 centers where Endeavor Resolute stent is commercially available.

 There are two study cohorts: 1.

 38 mm cohort: a minimum of 46 patients and maximum of 111 patients with at least one lesion amenable to treatment with a 38 mm length Endeavor Resolute stent.

 Patients may have one or two lesions, if the two lesions are located in separate target vessels.

 2.

 Dual vessel cohort: a minimum of 203 patients and maximum of 300 patients with dual vessel treatment where each vessel has a lesion with length 27 mm and reference vessel diameters between 2.

25 mm and 4.

0 mm.
