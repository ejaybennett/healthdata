(fifthQuint)Veliparib and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer or Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the recommended Phase II dose of ABT-888 (veliparib) given in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride) (PLD - 40 mg/m2 every 4 weeks) in patients with ovarian or breast cancer.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the toxicity profile of the ABT-888 plus PLD combination.

 II.

 To determine the effects of ABT-888 on the pharmacokinetics of PLD.

 III.

 To determine the efficacy of ABT-888 plus PLD in ovarian and breast cancer.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

 Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

 Veliparib and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer or Metastatic Breast Cancer@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of veliparib when given together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back after a period of improvement, or breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.

 Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Giving veliparib together with liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.
