(firstQuint)A Study Comparing the Safety and Tolerability of Two Doses of Fipamezole in Adult Patients With Parkinson's Disease.

 Parkinson's Disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide.

 While treatment with dopaminergic agents like levodopa, the mainstay of treatment, is effective in the early phases of the disease, their benefits decrease with disease progression, and problems such as dyskinesia and on-off phenomenon begin to manifest.

 This study investigates the safety and tolerability of fipamezole at two dose levels in patients with Parkinson's Disease.

 The sampling method used was simple random sampling.
