 Pertinent information will be collected from the medical record including gender, age in years, diagnosis, type of surgery, length of stay, medications used for pain or nausea, and first bowel movement.

 The subjects will also be asked to keep a journal of their bowel habits, signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal distress/post-operative ileus, use of medications, first bowel movement, satisfaction with bowel management and any additional comments.

 Aims of the study are to determine the effectiveness of the three arms of this trial for the resolution of POI as noted by first post-operative bowel movement; to determine if there is a difference in the length of stay based on the interventions; and to determine if there is a difference in patient satisfaction based on the intervention.
