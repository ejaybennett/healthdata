(secondQuint)The Usability and Injection Time of the Physiolis Syringe and Autoinjector in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients.

 This was a Phase 2, open-label study consisting of 2 study phases with a total of 3 study visits, each visit occurring 2 weeks apart from each other.

 Phase A (User Experience) was a randomized, 2-period, cross-over phase in which single subcutaneous (SC) dose injections were administered using either the Physiolis autoinjector and current autoinjector or the Physiolis syringe and current syringe in a 1:1 ratio.

 Phase B (Injection Time) was a randomized, single-visit, parallel-arm phase, with injection into a test tube, and one SC injection given to participants using the Physiolis autoinjector or current autoinjector administered at 2 different temperature ranges (2 to 8C [storage temperature] and 20 to 27C [room temperature]).

 If a participant only completed Visit 1 and Visit 2, then the participant was to be replaced for Visit 3.

 If the participant only completed Visit 1, the participant was to be replaced for all study visits.

This was an open-label, Phase 2 study designed to obtain user experience data (Phase A) and injection time data (Phase B) in experienced adalimumab patients injected with the Physiolis pre-filled syringe and autoinjector used to administer adalimumab.
