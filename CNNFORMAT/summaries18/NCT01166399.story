The study design will be a cohort study to determine the incidence of FI symptoms at 6, 12 and 24 weeks postpartum in primiparous women sustaining an OASI.

 At 6, 12 and 24 weeks postpartum, subjects will be contacted by telephone for evaluation of FI symptoms.

 Symptoms of FI will be defined by at least monthly symptoms of leakage of liquid, solid stool, and mucus.

 Flatal incontinence will be assessed at 24 weeks, based on the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index, and fecal urgency will be assessed at 24 weeks based on the one question from the Modified Manchester questionnaire.

 A sample size of approximately 400-450 subjects will be enrolled.
