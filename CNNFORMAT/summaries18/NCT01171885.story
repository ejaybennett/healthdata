(secondQuint)Bilateral Superficial Cervical Block for Thyroidectomy.

 In this study we will evaluate the efficacy of bilateral superficial cervical block associated with balanced general anesthesia with remifentanil as opioid of choice in preventing postoperative pain in patients who underwent total thyroidectomy with mini incision without neck dissection.

A hundred and twenty patients ASA I - II will be assessed and allocated randomly (through a table of random numbers) into three groups for analgesia for post-operative: Group 1: bilateral superficial cervical block with 20 ml of 0.

9% saline (placebo); Group 2: bilateral superficial cervical block with 20 ml ropivacaine 0.

25%; Group 3: bilateral superficial cervical block with 20 ml ropivacaine 0.

5%.

 Bilateral Superficial Cervical Block for Thyroidectomy@highlight

The objective of this study is to compare the postoperative analgesia afforded by bilateral superficial cervical block using different concentrations of local anesthetic (ropivacaine) in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for the mini-incision technique, performed by the same surgical team.
