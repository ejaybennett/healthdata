(thirdQuint)Comparison of Breathing Event Detection by a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Device to Clinical Polysomnography.

 Study Objectives: To compare a positive airway pressure (PAP) device's detection of respiratory events and airway status during device detected apneas with events scored on simultaneous polysomnography (PSG).

 Design: Prospective PSGs of patients with sleep apnea using a new-generation PAP device.

 Settings: Four clinical and academic sleep centers.

 Patients: Forty-five patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and complex sleep apnea (Comp SA) performed a PSG on PAP levels adjusted to induce respiratory events.

 Interventions: None.

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate diagnostic agreement and determine the accuracy of the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device compared to simultaneous, attended clinical polysomnography (PSG) in identifying breathing events in participants previously diagnosed with complex sleep apnea (CompSAS), complex sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR), or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
