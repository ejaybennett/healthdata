(secondQuint)Intraoperative Radiotherapy for Early Stage Breast Cancer.

 Patients will be deemed eligible for immediate IORT if the invasive cancer lesion is estimated to measure 3.

0 centimeters maximum dimension by mammogram, ultrasound, and CE-MRI and is thought to be resectable with WLE and clear surgical margins, with clinically staged N0M0 disease, minimum age of 48, and histology of invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma of the breast.

 The lesion size determined by imaging will be compared with lesion size and surgical margin status obtained from the surgical pathology specimen to evaluate the ability of mammography combined with ultrasound and CE-MRI to identify suitable candidates for immediate IORT.
