(fifthQuint)Web-based Physical Activity Program.

 Increasing physical activity (PA) is a public health priority.

 There is preliminary support for application of Motivational Interviewing (MI) for physical activity (PA), web-applications for PA promotion, web-based MI for behavior change, and finally web-based MI for PA.

 Based on collective findings in these areas of inquiry, it is necessary to investigate the efficacy of MI as a method that lends readily to practical applications for PA promotion.

 The current study seeks to investigate whether web-based MI can be applied in an adult population to enhance PA participation using a physician referral scheme.

 Additionally, mechanisms of behavior change are considered in order to inform future research and intervention.

The specific aims of the proposed study are: - 1.

 To determine if web-based Motivational Interviewing (MI) is effective, compared to an informational web-based comparison group, in enhancing physical activity (PA) participation; and - 2.

 To assess the mechanisms by which web-based MI enhances PA through changes in targeted cognitive mediators.

 The specific hypotheses of the study include that: - Hypothesis 1: Web-based MI will increase PA; - Hypothesis 2: Web-based MI will lead to stage progression in the direction of increased readiness to participate in PA; - Hypothesis 3: Web-based MI will influence theoretically identified cognitive variables; - Hypothesis 4: Cognitive variables will mediate increases in PA participation.
