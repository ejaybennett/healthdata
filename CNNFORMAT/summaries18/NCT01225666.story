(fifthQuint)MOD-4023 (Long-Lasting Human Growth Hormone (hGH)) Study in Growth Hormone Deficient Adults (GHDA).

 The study is a phase II, randomized, open-label, parallel, 4 active treatment arms study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK/PD profile of MOD-4023 in pre-treated, normalized, GHD adults.

 The study is conducted in 2 stages.

 Stage I is a 4-week treatment period with 4 different dose levels/dosing regimens.

 Stage II is a 16-week treatment-extension period in which all the patients will start with the same dose (derived from stage I) and will be dose titrated to maintain IGF-1 levels within the normal range.

 MOD-4023 (Long-Lasting Human Growth Hormone (hGH)) Study in Growth Hormone Deficient Adults (GHDA)@highlight

This study aims to assess the safety, tolerability and Pharmacokinetics/ Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) profile of three doses of MOD-4023 on a weekly regime and one dose on an every-other-week regime administered for a period of 4 weeks in Growth Hormone Deficient Adult (GHDA) patients who previously were on a stable r-hGH treatment.

 An additional extension period of 16 weeks once-weekly administration of MOD-4023 aims to confirm the dose selection for future trials.
