(secondQuint)Agreement Among Expert Radiologists in Diagnosing Primary Liver Tumors by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is currently the method of choice for non-invasive diagnosis of primary liver tumors.

 However, differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) remains challenging, particularly in non-cirrhotic patients.
