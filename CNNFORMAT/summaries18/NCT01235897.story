(secondQuint)MK-2206, Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab in Treating Patients With HER2-overexpressing Solid Tumor Malignancies.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-2206 in combination with paclitaxel and trastuzumab when given to patients with HER2-overexpressing solid tumor malignancies.

 MK-2206 is an oral drug (taken by mouth) that turns off a protein called AKT inside cancer cells.

 This could be helpful in treating treatment-resistant cancers, because AKT allows cells to survive despite active anticancer treatment.

 In the case of HER2-positive cancers, laboratory studies suggest that the drug combination of MK-2206 and paclitaxel and trastuzumab may be effective.
