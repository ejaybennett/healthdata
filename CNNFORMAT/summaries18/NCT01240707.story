(fifthQuint)Pathophysiologic Changes in the Respiratory System After Fire Smoke Inhalation.

 Fire smoke inhalation may contribute to intrabronchial inflammation, airway obstruction and impaired gas exchange.

 The scope of injury in fire smoke victims ranges from cough and minor airway irritation to severe respiratory failure and long term mechanical ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit.

 Some patients with high HbCO-levels are also treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

 In this study the investigators will examine if the scope of inhalation injury can be assessed soon after admission based on clinical markers, biochemical markers, Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), spirometry and bronchoscopy.

 The clinical effect of fiberoptic bronchoscopy after severe smoke inhalation will also be examined.

 At 6 months a lung function test and metacholine test will be performed to examine whether they have developed asthma/increased bronchial hyperreactivity or not after the initial fire smoke exposure.

 Lab staff (flowcytometer and cytokine analysis) are unaware of patient identity and whether the patient is a smoke-exposed patient or a healthy volunteer in the control group of non-exposed persons.
