(fifthQuint)A Study in Asthmatics to Determine the Efficacy and Dose Response of Repeat Doses of GW870086X on Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1).

 This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to determine the efficacy of twenty-seven day- repeat inhaled doses of GW870086X on FEV1.

 GW870086X is a novel inhaled corticosteroid with potent glucocorticoid activity currently in development by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as an inhaled treatment of persistent asthma.

 Initially, subjects will be randomised to receive placebo, 2mg or 4mg GW870086X once daily.

 An interim analysis will be performed on the primary endpoint to potentially adapt the study design after approximately 45 subjects have completed dosing.

 Based on the results of the interim analysis, the trial may continue to completion using the original doses or an adaptation to the doses could be made.

 Either the 1mg GW870086X once daily arm or 3mg GW870086X once daily arm may be added, or the trial could be terminated early.

 After screening there will be a 4 week run in period prior to start of treatment and after will be a follow up period 1-2 weeks after last dose.

 Approximately 120 subjects will complete the study.

 Key safety assessments include; clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and collection of adverse events (AE's).

 A Study in Asthmatics to Determine the Efficacy and Dose Response of Repeat Doses of GW870086X on Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)@highlight

This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to determine the efficacy of twenty-seven day- repeat inhaled daily doses of GW870086X on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1).

 Initially there will be 3 treatment arms; placebo, 2mg GW870086X and 4mg GW870086X.

 After an interim analysis the trial may; continue to completion using the original doses, be terminated early, or have a fourth arm added of either 1mg GW870086X once daily or 3mg GW870086X once daily.
