(thirdQuint)A Study to Assess the Effects of Repeat Doses of Fluticasone Furoate and GW642444M Combination in Healthy Subjects and in Subjects With Severe Impairment.

.

 This is an open-label, non-randomized study which will assess the pharmacokinetics and safety following 7 days once daily dose of inhaled FF/ GW642444M (200/25mcg) in subjects with renal impairment.

 Nine subjects with severe renal impairment (as defined by a Clcr80mL/min matched to the severe subjects based on gender, ethnicity, body mass index (15%) and age (5 years)).

 All subjects will receive fluticasone furoate 200mcg/GW642444M 25mcg once daily for 7 days.

 The results of this study will aid in deciding whether a FF/GW642444M dose adjustment is justified in subjects with severe renal impairment and in estimating any such adjustments.
