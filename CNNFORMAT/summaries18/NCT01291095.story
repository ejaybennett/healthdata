(secondQuint)Accelerated Fractionation Radiotherapy (AFRT) Versus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (Crt) In Locally Advanced Head And Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

 Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is a common and conventional method of treating locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

 In locally advanced HNSCC it has been proved to be superior to radiotherapy alone.

 On the other side accelerated fractionation radiotherapy (AFRT) is a proven practice to improve cure rate in head and neck cancers.

 Yet it has not been compared with Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced HNSCC and hence this study is aiming to compare CRT versus AFRT.

 Accelerated Fractionation Radiotherapy (AFRT) Versus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (Crt) In Locally Advanced Head And Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma@highlight

The aim of this trial is to compare the accelerated fractionation radiotherapy and concurrent chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients in terms of loco-regional control, toxicities and quality of life.
