(secondQuint)Cancer Screening Program for Women at High Risk for Developing Ovarian Cancer.

 The program will offer twice yearly CA-125 blood tests and annual transvaginal ultrasounds to monitor women at high risk for ovarian cancer.

 In addition to the main purpose of providing ovarian cancer screening, the researchers would also like to build a repository of blood specimens for use in ovarian and breast cancer research and to offer genetics counseling sessions to help educate women about risk-reducing options.
