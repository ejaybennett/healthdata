(firstQuint)Blood Pressure Telemonitoring and Goal Blood Pressure in Diabetes.

 This is a randomized control trial, two arms with block randomization.

 Primary care patients with diabetes and elevated blood pressure randomized to intervention or control.

 Intervention arm: home telemonitoring using the Ideal Life blood pressure cuff and telephone or internet transmission device to transmit blood pressure information to the Primary care manager team with otherwise normal care manager care.

 Control arm: Omron (off the shelf) home blood pressure monitor (no transmission of data) and usual care.

 We will be comparing blood pressure control between groups and provider contacts.
