(thirdQuint)A Safety Study in Healthy Volunteers of the Single-Use Autoinjector Containing Placebo of BG9418 Interferon Beta-1a With a 25-Gauge  1-Inch Needle.

 This is a single-arm, single-center study in healthy volunteers.

 The study is designed to evaluate the safe use of the single-use autoinjector with a 25G * 1" needle in subjects of varying body mass indices (BMIs).

 Because this is a safety study of the injector, the injections contain Avonex excipients only; no active IFN-1a will be administered.

 During the study, each subject will self-administer 4 IM injections using single-use autoinjectors.

 Subjects will self-administer the first 2 injections (1 in each thigh) and then repeat the process approximately 60 to 90 minutes later.

 A Trainer/Observer will prepare the autoinjector for each injection, monitor each injection, and assess the subject for AEs during the injection process and up to the time of discharge from the unit.

 The Trainer/Observer will also visually inspect the needle pre- and post-injection and record their findings.

 The Investigator or designee (physician or nurse) will assess injection sites for erythema, induration, tenderness, or warmth.

This is a single-arm, single-center study in healthy volunteers.

 This study is designed to evaluate the safety of IM injections using single-use autoinjectors with a 25G * 1" needle.

 The purpose of this study is not to evaluate study treatment; therefore, all injections will be performed with Avonex placebo only; no active IFN-1a will be administered.
