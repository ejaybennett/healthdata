(thirdQuint)Efficacy of Gamma Camera Used Intraoperatively for ID of Sentinel Lymph Nodes w/ Lymphoscintigraphy.

 Lymphoscintigraphy is an accepted and commonly-performed procedure used for staging of certain cancers, especially melanoma and breast cancer.

 It involves injecting a small amount of radioactivity under the skin in order to identify lymph nodes which should be biopsied (ie, the "sentinel lymph node, SLN") to determine if cancer has spread.

 The study objective was to evaluate the potential benefit of a new, camera-based technology (prototype device) which allows actual images to be obtained intra-operatively in the identification of sentinel nodes.

 Each device was assessed for relative node detection sensitivity (S), defined as the proportion of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) that were identified with each instrument, with the proportion determined as the number of true positives (TP) divided by the total evaluated (N).

 Efficacy of Gamma Camera Used Intraoperatively for ID of Sentinel Lymph Nodes w/ Lymphoscintigraphy@highlight

This study evaluates the ability of a prototype intraoperative handheld gamma camera (pIHGC) to image (detect) sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in melanoma and breast cancer during surgical excision, as compared to standard of care intraoperative gamma probes (GP).

 The unit of study in this trial was SNLs rather individual participants.

 Each device was assessed for relative node detection sensitivity (S) of those SLNs.
