(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Alogliptin Used in Combination With Sulfonylurea in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes in Japan.

 Both insulin hyposecretion and insulin-resistance are considered to be involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme.

 DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion.

 It is expected that inhibition of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

 The present study was planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin as an add-on to sulfonylurea in type 2 diabetic patients who had uncontrolled blood glucose despite treatment with an sulfonylurea as well as diet and exercise therapies.

The purpose of this study was evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin, once daily (QD) combined with an Sulfonylurea taken QD or twice daily (BID) in type 2 diabetic patients with uncontrolled blood glucose.
