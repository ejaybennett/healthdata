(secondQuint)MINI-AMI: Minimizing Infarct Size With Impella 2.

5 Following PCI for Acute Myocardial Infarction.

 The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether the adjunctive use of the IMPELLA(R) 2.

5 System for 24 hours following primary PCI for STEMI has the potential to limit the infarction of at-risk myocardium compared to primary PCI with routine post-PCI care (standard of care).

 This study is a feasibility study.

 Therefore, the principal objective is to identify trends in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based efficacy outcomes between the randomized treatment arms (Impella arm compared to control).
