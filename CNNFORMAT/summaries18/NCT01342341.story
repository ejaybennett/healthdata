(thirdQuint)Placebo-Controlled Cross Over Trial of Chlorzoxazone Intake.

 The investigators propose a 45-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in light to moderate and heavy alcohol users.

 The specific aims are to: 1.

 Determine if chlorzoxazone alters daily alcohol consumption by comparing the mean drinks consumed per day during chlorzoxazone administration compared with the mean drinks per day consumed during placebo administration.

 2.

 To determine if polymorphisms in genes encoding for neurotransmitters or receptors involved in alcohol reward, abuse, dependence, craving, or relapse may predict the level of response to chlorzoxazone's effects on alcohol consumption or craving.

 3.

 To investigate any change in alcohol craving during a cue induced craving task where participants view and respond to a number of images.

 Placebo-Controlled Cross Over Trial of Chlorzoxazone Intake@highlight

The overall goals of this study are to (1) expand knowledge about interactions of chlorzoxazone with alcohol by assessing the effects of chlorzoxazone compared to placebo in moderate and heavy social alcohol users and (2) to compare the effects of chlorzoxazone on visual cue induced alcohol craving to placebo in moderate to heavy social alcohol users.
