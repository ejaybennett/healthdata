(secondQuint)S0820, Adenoma and Second Primary Prevention Trial.

 The purpose of this study is to assess whether eflornithine 500 mg or sulindac 150 mg are effective in reducing the 3-year event rate of high risk adenoma or second primary colorectal cancer in Stage 0, I II and III colon cancer patients.

 The primary hypothesis will test the main effect of each agent, as well as the comparison of placebo alone to the combination of sulindac and eflornithine.
