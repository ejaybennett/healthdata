(firstQuint)Benefits of Injectable Abatacept Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Patients.

 Results in the literature suggest the structural benefits of intravenous (IV) abatacept as measured by high and low field MRI and X-ray in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have previously failed clinical treatment with TNF agents.

 This study attempts to measure the structural benefits of SC abatacept in a similar cohort of patients while at the same time comparing the structural findings with clinical outcome measurements as collected at corresponding time points with an automated patient and physician disease activity scoring system of 28 joints (DAS28).

The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of sub-cutaneous (SC) abatacept provides any structural benefit in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have failed prior use of TNF therapy.
