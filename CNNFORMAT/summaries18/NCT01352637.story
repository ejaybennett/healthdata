(thirdQuint)Enhancing Exposure Therapy for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): Virtual Reality and Imaginal Exposure With a Cognitive Enhancer.

 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop following exposure to traumatic events and includes symptoms of re-experiencing the trauma, such as through nightmares and flashbacks, avoidance and numbing, and physical hyperarousal.

 PTSD has been estimated to affect 10-20% of returning Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) veterans.

 The most effective intervention found for PTSD is exposure therapy, which can be delivered in different formats, e.

 g.

 via virtual reality (VR) and as imaginal exposure.

 The goal of this study is to test the difference between 4 study conditions: virtual reality exposure therapy (VRE) or prolonged imaginal exposure therapy (PE), both combined with an antibiotic drug, DCS (active pill vs.

 placebo).

 D-Cycloserine (DCS), a drug that has been FDA approved for over 20 years, has been hypothesized to enhance the therapeutic effects of exposure therapy.

).

 A secondary purpose of this study is to examine predictors for PTSD and response to PTSD intervention in active duty military personnel, veterans, and civilians who served in Iraq/Afghanistan.

 Psychophysiological factors (e.

g.

 heart rate, blood pressure) and/or a genetic polymorphism (BDNF Val66Met) obtained from a saliva sample will be examined.

The purpose of this study is to test the differences between four active treatment conditions for combat-related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): virtual reality exposure therapy (VRE) or prolonged imaginal exposure therapy (PE), both with DCS or placebo, as well as to examine predictors for PTSD and response to treatment in active duty military personnel, veterans, and civilians who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
