(secondQuint)Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of New Biomarkers in Patients With Heart Disease.

 Plasma samples for patients with dyspnea, edema, with or without heart failure; ambulatory or admitted for cardiac decompensation (even with cardiac shock and LVAD) ; or entering a cardiac rehabilitation program, will be prospectively collected.

 The objective of this work is to investigate and then to sequence new proteins in the plasma of these patients for diagnostic and prognostic purpose.
