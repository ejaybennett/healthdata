(secondQuint)A Self-Administered Maneuver to Relieve Symptoms Suggestive of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.

 Eligible patients were alternately assigned to either immediate instruction on the use of the Digital Repetitive Infrapubic Pressure maneuver (immediate intervention group) or to a return appointment to receive instructions in the maneuver four weeks after the initial assessment date (delayed intervention group).

 Patients were to utilize the procedure on every occasion they had difficulty initiating, maintaining, or completing urine flow between the time of their instruction and their subsequent visit.

 At the initial assessment visits and the final visit, the patients completed an International Prostate Score Sheet (IPSS).

 A telephone survey was conducted with all patients an average of nine months following their instruction in the maneuver, to determine the extent to which they were still using it.
