(secondQuint)Study of Efficacy on Cardiac Remodeling of Recombinant Human Neuregulin-1 in Stable Chronic Systolic Heart Failure Patients.

 RhNRG-1(recombinant human neuregulin-1)directly works on the cardiomyocytes and restored the normal structure and function of it.

Both the preclinical trial and phase II clinical trail have confirmed that rhNRG-1 effectively improved the heart function, and is tolerated in the effective dosage groups.

 The aim of this phase III trial is to further confirm in large population that rhRNG-1 administration can effectively improve the cardiac remodeling and is tolerated in patients with chronic heart failure.

 Study of Efficacy on Cardiac Remodeling of Recombinant Human Neuregulin-1 in Stable Chronic Systolic Heart Failure Patients@highlight

This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind , placebo parallel controlled, standard therapy based phase III clinical trial, to evaluate the efficacy of recombinant human neuregulin-1 on cardiac remodeling, as well as safety in patients with chronic heart failure.
