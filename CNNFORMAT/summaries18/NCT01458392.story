(secondQuint)Study of Dalantercept in Patients With Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck.

 For cancer cells to grow, they need to have nutrients supplied to them through blood vessels.

 The study drug, dalantercept, is designed to work by blocking the growth of those blood vessels and preventing cancer cells from growing.

 The purpose of this study is to find out if dalantercept can cause SCCHN tumors to shrink or stop growing.

 This study will also evaluate the safety of dalantercept in patients with SCCHN.

 Study of Dalantercept in Patients With Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck@highlight

Dalantercept, a soluble form of the activin receptor-like kinase-1 protein, is being studied in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).

 Dalantercept blocks the development of blood vessels that supply tumors.
