(secondQuint)Compare Technegas Ventilation-Perfusion SPECT and Xenon Ventilation-Perfusion Planar Imaging for Pulmonary Embolism.

 This is a Phase 3 within-subject trial of Technegas Ventilation SPECT and Tc-99m MAA perfusion imaging compared to xenon (Xe-133) Ventilation Planar and Tc-99m MAA perfusion imaging for the diagnosis of PE.

 Diagnosis of PE provided by review of the subjects' documented clinical information after 30 days of follow-up.

 Primary assessments of efficacy will be based on an independent blind reads of the Technegas V/Q SPECT images by three different readers and the independent blind reads of Xe 133 V/Q planar images by three different readers.
