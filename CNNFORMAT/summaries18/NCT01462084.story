(secondQuint)Effectiveness of Adaptive Servoventilation (ASV) in Patients With Central Sleep Apnea Due to Chronic Opioid Use.

 The trial seeks to determine the efficacy and patient comfort of ASV and bi-level positive airway pressure (PAP) modes for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), complicated by CSA secondary to opioid use.

 Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups, utilizing a cross-over design to evaluate the two modes with the subject as their own control.

 Subjects will be asked to undergo two PSG studies; one with ASV titration and one with bi-level treatment, using the current pressure prescription.

 The study comprises two visits.

 Subjects will be asked to complete patient satisfaction questionnaires following their PSG studies.

 It is anticipated that total subject participation will be no longer than one month.
