(firstQuint)Denosumab in Current Users of Bisphosphonates for Glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis.

 There are no data on the use of denosumab in steroid induced osteoporosis.

 Postmenopausal women with chronic use of Glucocorticoid (GCs) are at high-risk of osteoporotic fractures.

 Despite bisphosphonate treatment, a certain proportion of high-risk patients using chronic GCs either do not achieve a satisfactory gain in bone mineral density (BMD) or develop new fragility fractures.

 Thus, more potent osteoporosis treatment is necessary for this subgroup of patients.

 This prompts the current study which aims to examine the efficacy of denosumab in current users of oral bisphosphonates for Glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis (GIOP).

The purpose of this study is to study the efficacy of denosumab, a new drug, in the treatment of osteoporosis in patients using bisphosphonates.
