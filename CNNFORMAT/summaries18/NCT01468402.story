(firstQuint)Predictive Factors of Pelvic Magnetic Resonance in the Response of Arterial Embolization of Uterine Leiomyoma.

 This study followed symptomatic premenopausal women with uterine leiomyoma who underwent uterine artery embolization (UAE).

 Treatment was accompanied by magnetic resonance imaging of both the volume of the entire uterus and the leiomyomas one month before and six months after UAE.

 This patients were treated at the Uterine Leiomyoma Sector of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medicine College of the University of Sao Paulo.

 In this study, the investigators examined 179 leiomyomas in 50 patients.
