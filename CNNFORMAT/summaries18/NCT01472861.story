(firstQuint)Autologous Endometrial Coculture (AECCT).

 Young women with poor ovarian reserve are commonly given a poor prognosis for IVF success.

 Standard culture media for fertilizing oocytes (unfertilized eggs) is commonly used in IVF which closely resembles tubal fluid.

 Efforts to create optimal culture conditions for fertilization of human embryos for women with poor quality embryos and/or repeated implantation failures have been developed at our center by using AECC.

 AECC involves placing a patient's fertilized eggs on top of a layer of cells from her own uterine lining, creating a more natural environment for embryo development and maximizing the chance for IVF pregnancy.

 The investigators will prospectively randomize young patients ( age 38 years) poor ovarian reserve to AECC or no AECC with standard culture media to study pregnancy outcome.

The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of Autologous Endometrial Coculture (AECC) in young in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients with poor ovarian reserve improves pregnancy outcome.
