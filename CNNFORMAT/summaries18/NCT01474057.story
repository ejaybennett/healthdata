(fifthQuint)DElivery of Self Training and Education for Stressful Situations-Primary Care Version.

 The study is a multi-site trial evaluating the efficacy of DESTRESS-PC (DElivery of Self-TRaining and Education for Stressful Situations, primary care version), a brief, web-based self-management intervention for PTSD designed for delivery in primary care.

 Participants randomized to DESTRESS-PC log on to a secure website for self-CBT 3 times per week for 6 weeks and receive RN nurse care manager ("DESTRESS Nurse") contact every two weeks.

 DESTRESS Nurses introduce the approach, monitor, answer questions, and insure primary care provider collaboration.

 The control intervention is optimized usual primary care.

 Blinded raters assess PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, physical health status, and occupational functioning at four timepoints.

 All study participants receive RN care management and are under the care of a primary care provider trained in evidence-based PTSD treatment who receives status reports from the DESTRESS nurse to include baseline psychiatric status.

This study will compare a cognitive-behavioral online self-management intervention designed for primary care treatment of war-related PTSD to a control intervention, "optimized usual primary care PTSD treatment".

 Patients with PTSD will be trained to use the online PTSD treatment website and asked to do so three times per week for six weeks.

 They will have phone and email access to a nurse trained to assist them in their treatment program.

 Three scheduled phone check-ins during the six week treatment period will provide ongoing contact with patients during treatment.

 The investigators will assess PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety and somatic symptoms, physical health status and occupational functioning on three occasions: before the intervention, at the end of the treatment period, and six weeks after the end of treatment.
