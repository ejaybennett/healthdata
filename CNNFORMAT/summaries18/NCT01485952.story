(firstQuint)An Exploratory Clinical Trial in Early Stage Huntington's Disease Patients With SEN0014196.

 This study will establish the acute phenotypical and biological effects of repeated dose application of SEN0014196 in patients with Huntington's disease, providing biomaterials for biomarker studies (levels of circulating huntingtin, acetylation status of mutant huntingtin, innate immune markers, transcriptional profiles).

 Evaluation of phenotypic effects will include UHDRS scores, total functional capacity.

 Safety assessments will include ECG, vital signs, laboratory safety tests and physical examination.
