 After a screening period of approximately 4 weeks, participants will be treated for 12 weeks with telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV followed by 12 or 36 weeks of treatment with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV alone depending on their liver disease status, response to previous treatment and individual virologic response during treatment in this study.

 After the treatment period, there is a follow-up phase of at least 12 weeks.
