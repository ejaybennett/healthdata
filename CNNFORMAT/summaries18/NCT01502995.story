(firstQuint)Laser Light Visual Cueing for Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Disease.

 Freezing of gait is a debilitating feature of Parkinson's disease.

 This study aims to determine whether a laser light beam, attached to a rolling walker and projected onto the floor, reduces freezing episodes.

 Patients will perform two trials of 3 timed walking tasks: once with the laser beam and once without.

 For each trial, the time to complete, number of steps, and number of freezing episodes will be recorded.

 Patients will be randomized to perform the first trial either with the light or without the light, to control for fatigue.
