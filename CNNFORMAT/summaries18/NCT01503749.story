(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of Peripheral Blood Mononucleated Cells for Treatment of Liver Cirrhosis.

 G-colony stimulating factor(5ug/kg/day)will be administered twice subcutaneously for 3 days to three patients with liver cirrhosis.

 On the day 4th, plasmapheresis will be done to collect peripheral blood mononucleated cells .

 And then we are going to infuse the collected peripheral blood mononucleated cells of their own through the portal vein of each patients under ultrasonographic guidance.
