(secondQuint)BKM120 Combined With Vemurafenib (PLX4032) in BRAFV600E/K Mutant Advanced Melanoma.

 The phase 1 portion of this trial is a dose escalation study; the phase 2 portion is a single-stage, single arm prospective clinical trial.

 All patients will receive continuous doses of vemurafenib twice a day and BKM120 once a day.

 In the phase 1 portion of the study, there will be a 7 day lead-in period to allow for single dose pharmacokinetic analysis of BKM120 alone.

 Cycle 1 (28 days) is the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period.

 During phase 1, vemurafenib and BKM120 doses will be escalated using a standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme with the goal of identifying the recommended phase 2 dose.

 In the phase 2 portion of the study, patients will receive continuous doses of vemurafenib and BKM120 starting on day 1 of the first cycle.

 In the phase 2 portion of the study, patients will receive vemurafenib and BKM120 at the recommended phase 2 dose.
