(thirdQuint)Antimicrobial Efficacy of ALT005 Ophthalmic Prep Solution in Healthy Volunteers.

 A total of 45 subjects who meet the criteria for inclusion will receive either ALT005 or control solution (sterile 0.

9% saline) on one occasion to sites on the forehead and the cheeks.

 Subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 active:control.

 Subjects will be dosed in groups.

 The study will run at one study center in the US.

 Subjects will be housed in the clinical research facility from the morning of Day -4 until the evening of Day 1.

 The total duration of participation for each subject dosed is approximately 21 days (from Day -19 study orientation through the follow-up call on Day 2, excluding the initial screening period).

 In this study, the efficacy of ALT005 will be assessed in healthy volunteers who, after refraining voluntarily from using topical and oral antimicrobials for at least 2 weeks (14 days), exhibit acceptably high normal flora counts on the designated skin testing sites.

 An additional cohort was added (3 ALT005, 6 Comparator Product) to make a non-statistical comparison of efficacy.
