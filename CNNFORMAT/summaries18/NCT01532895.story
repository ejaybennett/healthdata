(firstQuint)Clinical Usefulness and Quality of Life of OROS Hydromorphone in Patients Who Have Not Been Treated With a Strong Opioid.

 This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) and observational study.

 Patients selected for the proposed study are patients complaining of cancer pain who visit or are hospitalized at the research centers during the study, who are not being treated with strong continuous opioid (narcotic medication used against the pain), and who require cancer pain control with hydromorphone, at the investigator's discretion.

 The study will evaluate the changes in pain relief, level of sleep deprivation, and the patients' quality of life before and after administration of hydromorphone.
