(thirdQuint)Comparison of a Technology-based System and an In-person Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention in the Severely Obese.

 The primary aim of this study is to compare changes in body weight between an in-person behavioral weight loss program, a technology-based system, and an enhanced version of a technology-based system during a 6 month behavioral weight loss intervention in obese adults.

 Additional aims will compare changes in body composition, physical activity, dietary intake, and the frequency of self-monitoring of weight loss behaviors between the 3 groups.

 A total of 84 sedentary, healthy obese adults (BMI: 35.

0-45.

0 kg/m2) between the ages of 21-55 will be recruited to participate.

 Assessments will be conducted at 0, 3, and 6 months and will include measurements of height, weight, body composition, blood pressure, physical activity, dietary intake, and eating behaviors.

 This is a randomized controlled trial in which participants will be randomized after the completion of assessments to one of three groups: standard behavioral weight loss (SBWL), BodyMedia(R) FIT System (FIT), and BodyMedia(R) FIT System with Bluetooth(R) enhancements (FIT-BT).

 Subjects in SBWL will participate in a behavioral weight loss intervention which includes weekly group sessions throughout the 6 month program.

 FIT and FIT-BT will not attend weekly group sessions, but will have identical intervention materials mailed each week.

 FIT will receive the BodyMedia(R) FIT System, and FIT-BT will receive the BodyMedia(R) FIT System with Bluetooth(R) enhancements to use throughout the 6 month program.

 FIT and FIT-BT will receive a telephone intervention call 1x per month.

The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of an enhanced technology-based system, that involves a wearable device to measure calories burned combined with a website, in comparison to previous versions of similar technology and a standard behavioral weight loss on body weight across 6 months in obese adults.
