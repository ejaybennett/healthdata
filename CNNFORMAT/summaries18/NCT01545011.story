(thirdQuint)Effects of Inspiratory Muscle Training on Dyspnea in Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

 Dyspnea is the main complaint of patients with COPD.

 Dyspnea is explained largely by the distension, objectified by measuring inspiratory capacity (IC), which places the diaphragm at a disadvantage to be effective, which raises the sensation of dyspnea.

 Currently, inspiratory muscles training is recommended by the French-language Society of Pneumology, in case of an objective reduction of the strength of these muscles (corresponding to maximum inspiratory pressure <60 cm H20).

 Effects of Inspiratory Muscle Training on Dyspnea in Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determinate whether inspiratory muscle training (IMT) associated with a conventional respiratory rehabilitation program is more effective than a conventional respiratory rehabilitation program alone,on Dyspnea in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects with a normal maximum inspiratory pressure (IP > 60 cmH2O).
