(secondQuint)Schistosomiasis Effect on Response to Vaccines, Anaemia and Nutritional Status of Children of Northern Senegal.

 SchistoVAN aims to study the interactions between chronic parasite infections such as schistosomiasis and the immunological and nutritional status of children.

 In this scope, the investigators conducted a case-control study where one group of children is infected with schistosoma haematobium and the other is not infected with this parasite.

 The investigators then stimulated whole blood of these children with various vaccine antigens to address their immune function and study the influence of schistosomiasis infectious state on their overall immune condition.

 Aims of the study: To evaluate the interaction between schistosomiasis and the nutritional status of children and their haemoglobinemia.

 To evaluate the influence of schistosomiasis on children's specific immune response towards EPI vaccine antigens, the inflammatory status of children and nutritional serologic markers.

 To compare schistosomiasis diagnostic tools (evaluation of circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) strip for diagnosis of urinary schistosomiasis in comparison with microscopy and urinary dipsticks) To study prevalence of intestinal parasites such as Blastocystis hominis.

SchistoVAN aims to study the role of schistosomiasis infection in the modulation of the immune response of children to childhood vaccine antigens, as well as the impact of this infection on their nutritional status and their haemoglobinaemia.
