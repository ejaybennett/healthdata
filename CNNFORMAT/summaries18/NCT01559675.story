(thirdQuint)Trial Comparing Low Dose and High Dose Steroids in Patients Undergoing Colorectal Surgery.

 Our primary aim is to study the perioperative hemodynamic profile of patients on chronic steroids undergoing colon and rectal surgery.

 We will do this by measuring heart rate, temperature and blood pressure in the operating room and during their postoperative hospitalization.

 Patients will be identified in their preoperative visit.

 They will be randomized to high dose and low dose steroid study groups.

 The standard dose steroid patients will receive hydrocortisone 100 mg IV preoperatively and 100 mg IV every 8 hrs with standard taper.

 The low dose steroid study group will receive the IV equivalent of their preoperative steroid dose in the postoperative period.

 The patients blood pressure, temperature and heart rate will be monitored in the operating room and the ward postoperatively.

 Outcomes will be compared between the two groups.

 We hypothesize that there will be no statistically significant difference in blood pressure, temperature or heart rate in the high dose and low dose groups.

 The secondary aim of this study will be monitoring of any differences in surgical outcomes, including postoperative length of stay, between the two patient groups.

 Trial Comparing Low Dose and High Dose Steroids in Patients Undergoing Colorectal Surgery@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of low dose versus high dose steroids vital signs of patients currently on steroids or recently treated with steroids undergoing major colorectal surgery.

 The investigators hypothesize that there will be no statistically significant difference in orthostatic hypotension (blood pressure measured on lying, sitting, and standing), blood pressure, temperature or heart rate in the standard and low dose groups.
