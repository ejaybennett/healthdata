(firstQuint)A Trial of Gefitinib in Combination With BKM120 in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, With Enrichment for Patients Whose Tumours Harbour Molecular Alterations of PI3K Pathway and Known to Overexpress EGFR.

 2.

1 Primary cent The safety, tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of gefitinib and BKM120 will be determined.

 2.

2 Secondary - The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of gefitinib in combination with BKM120 will be determined.

 - The preliminary anti-tumor activity of gefitinib in combination with BKM120 will be determined.

 - The pharmacodynamic target modulation effects using a hair follicle assay will be determined.

 2.

3 Exploratory - The role of circulating tumour cells as assessed by a microfluidic device will be analyzed and the genetic alterations implicated in lung cancer, including but not limited to EGFR mutations, PI3KCA mutations, PTEN loss will be characterized.

 - The feasibility of detecting somatic mutations from plasma DNA will be ascertained.
