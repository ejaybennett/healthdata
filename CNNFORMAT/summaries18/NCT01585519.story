(fifthQuint)A Study Examining Effects of Apples/ Apple Products on Heart Disease Risk.

 Many products (such as bioactive extracts) attempt to replicate health benefits of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, however, it is not known whether similar health benefits can be gained from consuming these processed products.

 A placebo-controlled intervention study will examine if health benefits are similar between products.

 Volunteers will have one risk factor for heart disease.

 Recruitment will be by advertisement from QUB and general public.

 Apples/apple products will be provided for the 4 weeks, but otherwise volunteers' normal diet and lifestyle will be followed.

 Blood and urine samples will be collected at week 0 and week 4.

 4-day food diaries will be completed at the start and end of the study.

 A number of questionnaires (physical activity, lifestyle, levels of liking, tolerability to study products, study evaluation) will be completed at the start and end of the study.

 As this is a pilot study, power calculations were not considered appropriate.

 Statistical analysis will be carried out in SPSS, each endpoint of interest from the week 0 measure will be compared between the five intervention groups by one way analysis of variance.

 A Study Examining Effects of Apples/ Apple Products on Heart Disease Risk@highlight

This study will examine if health benefits of consuming nutrient-rich apples, an apple extract and freeze dried apple product will be similar.

 50 volunteers at increased risk of heart disease will consume either a low apple diet (<1 portion/d), 2 high or low polyphenol apples/day, an apple extract, or freeze dried apple granule product for 4 weeks (ten participants per group, randomly assigned).

 Apart from the extract group, all volunteers will consume a placebo.

 All volunteers will follow a low apple diet (<1 apple per day) other than what has been provided by the research team.

 Volunteers will complete food diaries at the start and end of the study and a number of questionnaires.

 Blood and urine samples collected at 0 and 4 weeks
