(secondQuint)A Study of JNJ-40346527 in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Despite Disease-modifying Antirheumatic Drug Therapy.

 This is a randomized (treatment assigned by chance, like flipping a coin), multicenter, double-blind (neither physician nor patient will know the treatment the patient receives), parallel-group (each group of patients will be treated at the same time) study.

 JNJ-40346527 will be compared to a placebo, which is an inactive substance used to test whether a drug has a real effect.

 Patients will receive study medication for 12 weeks and will continue their permitted, stable DMARD therapy (methotrexate [MTX], sulfasalazine [SSZ], and/or hydroxychloroquine [HCQ]) through Week 12.

 A follow-up visit will occur 4 weeks after dosing is complete.

 The maximum length of patient participation will be 22 weeks, including a 6-week screening period.

 Other study visits will occur during the study, and patient safety will be monitored.
