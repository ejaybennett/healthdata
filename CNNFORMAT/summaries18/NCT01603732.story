(firstQuint)Association Between a Mother's Exposure to "Strep Throat" and Her Baby's Developing Heart Disease.

 The primary objective of this study is to: 1.

 measure maternal ss-hemolytic streptococcal carriage as defined by positive throat cultures in the absence of symptoms among Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) mothers.

 2.

 define the incidence of positive strep throat cultures among asymptomatic pregnant women, identified at -hemolytic streptococcal pharyngeal exposure, groups A, G and C ("strep throat") in pregnant women whose pregnancies have been complicated by the diagnosis of congenital heart disease.

 Our short-term goal is to identify a potential association of an antecedent maternal strep throat exposure in pregnancy to identify a subset of heart defects 4.

 To determine if co-infections play a role in congenital heart defects.

 Association Between a Mother's Exposure to "Strep Throat" and Her Baby's Developing Heart Disease@highlight

The goal of this study is to find out if there is any association between a mother's exposure to bacteria that normally causes "strep throat" and her baby's developing heart disease/heart defect.
