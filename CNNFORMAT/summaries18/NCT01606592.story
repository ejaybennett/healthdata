(thirdQuint)Psychotherapy Outcome and Self-selection Effects in Panic Disorder.

 After thorough assessment persons with a panic disorder diagnosis are randomly assigned to three arms: one randomization, one self-selection, and one a low-contact waiting list one.

 In the randomization arm (R) 95 persons are randomly assigned to Panic Control Treatment (PCT) or Panic-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (PFPP); in the self-selection arm (SS) 95 persons are offered, after adequate information, to choose which of the two they prefer.

 Twenty-six persons are initially randomized to a three-month waiting list (with sparse contact over telephone), after which they will be re-randomized, either to further randomization (to PCT or PFPP) or to self-selection.

 The four groups (R/PCT; R/PFPP; SS/PCT; SS/PFPP) will be compared on the basis of intake and repeated outcome/follow-up assessment.

 Psychotherapy Outcome and Self-selection Effects in Panic Disorder@highlight

The efficacy of two forms of psychotherapy with panic disordered patients, a cognitive-behavioral and a psychodynamic one, are compared under two different, randomized conditions: randomization or self-selection.

 The basic hypotheses are that the efficacy of both treatments is higher and that the efficacy difference is smaller under self-selection than randomized conditions.
