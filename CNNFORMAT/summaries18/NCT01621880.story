(thirdQuint)Effect of Bevacizumab on Radiation-induced Brain Necrosis in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.

 Radiation-induced brain necrosis is a severe complication of radiotherapy in patients with Nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

 Current neuroprotective therapies show limited benefit in ameliorating this complication of radiotherapy.

 This study is a randomized, single blind clinical study.

 The primary aim of this study is to determine whether bevacizumab can alleviate radiation-induced brain necrosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and to compare the treating effect between bevacizumab and steroid.

 Effect of Bevacizumab on Radiation-induced Brain Necrosis in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma@highlight

Bevacizumab may have a better effect on brain necrosis caused by radiotherapy.

This randomized trial aims to investigate whether bevacizumab may alleviate radiation-induced brain necrosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

 The effect will be compared with outcomes in patients receiving steroid therapy.
