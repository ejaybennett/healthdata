(fifthQuint)Phase 1/2 Study of X-396, an Oral ALK Inhibitor, in Patients With ALK-positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 This is the first study of X-396 (ensartinib) in humans and the investigational drug will be given as a once or twice daily oral dose in 28 day cycles until there is disease progression or unacceptable safety issues.

 X-396 will be given to small groups of patients (1 - 6) at each dose level and the patients will be observed to see if there are any adverse safety effects.

 As long as there are no unacceptable safety issues after 28 days, the dose of X-396 will be increased for the next group of patients.

 This process will continue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of X-396 is reached.

 Once the MTD is reached, up to 170 additional patients will also be given X-396 to further determine the activity of X-396 in patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer.

 These additional patients will be enrolled in the following 5 expansion cohorts: ALK TKI-naive patients, patients that progressed on crizotinib, patients that progressed on one or more 2nd generation ALK TKIs (patients may or may not have also received prior crizotinib), patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases, and patients with leptomeningeal disease.

 Phase 1/2 Study of X-396, an Oral ALK Inhibitor, in Patients With ALK-positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

This is the first human study to use X-396 (ensartinib), a drug being developed for treatment of advanced cancers.

 The initial purpose of the study is to determine the largest amount of X-396 that can be safely given to humans (the maximum tolerated dose).

 Once the recommended Phase 2 dose has been determined, an expansion phase will assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of X-396 in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer.

 The study will also provide early information on how the body handles the drug (pharmacokinetics) and on the efficacy of X-396.
