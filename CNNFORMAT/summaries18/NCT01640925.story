(thirdQuint)Trial of 2% Chlorhexidine Bathing on Nosocomial Infections in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.

 Upon study enrollment, patients will be randomized to one of two study arms.

 Patients in study arm one will receive standard bathing (soap and water or non-medicated cloth) daily.

 Patients in study arm two will receive a 2% chlorhexidine bath on study day 1 and every 48 hours and a standard bath (soap and water or non-medicated cloths) on study day 2 and every 48 hours.

 Patients will be followed until ICU day 28 or discharged from the surgical ICU.

 Hypothesis: Compared to standard daily bathing, chlorhexidine-based bathing on ICU admission and every 48 hours will decrease the incidence of nosocomial infections.

 Trial of 2% Chlorhexidine Bathing on Nosocomial Infections in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit@highlight

This prospective, randomized, controlled trial will compare the incidence of nosocomial infections (composite of primary bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and surgical site infections) that occur in intensive care unit (ICU) patients bathed with 2% chlorhexidine solution versus patients who receive standard bathing (soap and water or non-medicated cloths).
