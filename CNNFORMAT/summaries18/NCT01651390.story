(thirdQuint)Clinical Performance of the Pantera Lux Balloon Versus the Orsiro Stent in Patients With In-stent Restenosis.

.

 This clinical investigation is an international, multi-center, randomized controlled trial with angiographic follow up at 6 months.

 Clinical follow ups will take place at 6, 12 and 18 months.

 Up to 210 subjects will be block randomized 2:1 to receive the Pantera Lux balloon or the Orsiro stent and will be stratified according to diabetic status at screening.

 Clinical Performance of the Pantera Lux Balloon Versus the Orsiro Stent in Patients With In-stent Restenosis.

@highlight

To determine in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) whether percutaneous coronary intervention - in patients with in-stent restenosis in either bare metal stents or drug eluting stents - with the Pantera Lux balloon is angiographically non-inferior to percutaneous intervention with the Orsiro stent 6 months post-procedure.
