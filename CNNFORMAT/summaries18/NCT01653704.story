(thirdQuint)Learning Crisis Resource Management: Practicing Versus Observational Role in Simulation Training.

 This will be a prospective randomized controlled study.

 Participants will be randomized to one of two groups with stratification according to their level of training: the active group and the observer group.

 Each participant of the active group will be paired with one of the participants from the observer group.

 The active participant will manage individually a simulated crisis scenario (pretest) while the paired observer participant will observe the scenario from outside the simulation room using a video transmission system.

 Immediately after, both participants will be debriefed by a trained instructor focused on CRM principles.

 The same active and observer participants will then individually manage another simulated crisis scenario (post-test).

 Two independent raters, blinded to the study design and to the randomization groups, will review the videos of all scenarios in a random order and rate each participant on their CRM performance using a global rating scale (GRS).

 Learning Crisis Resource Management: Practicing Versus Observational Role in Simulation Training@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness in learning crisis resource management (CRM) principles when being an active participant in simulation-based education versus being an observer participant.

 The investigators hypothesize that active participants will improve their CRM skills more than observer participants.
