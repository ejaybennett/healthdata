(secondQuint)Stereotactic Body Radiation for Consolidation After Standard Chemoradiation for Stage 3 Lung Cancer.

 This protocol will investigate the potential role of SBRT for patients with stage 3 NSCLC.

 Eligible patients will first have received standard 50.

4 Gy chemoradiation.

 Patients entering the study will have the opportunity to receive SBRT as a noninvasive option as compared to surgical resection.

 For patients who are not surgical candidates, SBRT after 50.

4 Gy chemoradiation represents a technique of radiation consolidation that may be more effective and less toxic than standard conventional fractionated radiation.

 Stereotactic Body Radiation for Consolidation After Standard Chemoradiation for Stage 3 Lung Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) as consolidation following standard chemoradiation for patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
