(fifthQuint)Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Transrectal Prostate Biopsy.

 This study is a prospective, nonrandomized trial evaluating the efficacy of directed antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSP) compared with ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, the current standard of care.

 Northwestern University will be the lead site.

 After signing informed consent, study participants will complete a pre-biopsy questionnaire to record demographics and assess for known risk factors for infection and will have a rectal swab obtained.

 Patients whose swabs indicate colonization with ciprofloxacin-susceptible gram-negative bacteria (CS-GNB) will receive ciprofloxacin as pre-procedure prophylaxis and those whose swabs indicate colonization with ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria (CR-GNB) will receive pre-procedure antimicrobial prophylaxis based on study protocol.

 All patients will be contacted by phone twice after their biopsies, at approximately 7 and 30 days, to detail post-procedure infectious complications including fever, urinary tract infection, bacteremia and sepsis.

 Subjects who experience infections will have additional information regarding the infectious complications and cost of therapy abstracted from their medical record.

 The TRUSP results will also be recorded.

 Bacterial isolates from the rectal swabs will be archived.

 Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Transrectal Prostate Biopsy@highlight

This study is being conducted in men scheduled to undergo transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSP).

 Traditionally prior to prostate biopsy, an antibiotic, ciprofloxacin, has been given to men to prevent biopsy-related infections.

 In recent years as ciprofloxacin resistance has increased in the community, more and more men are becoming infected with ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria after prostate biopsy.

 This study is being done to determine if obtaining rectal swab cultures and choosing antibiotics based on these culture results will result in fewer infectious complications than giving all men ciprofloxacin.

 The investigators will compare 2 groups: men whose rectal swabs do not show ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria will receive ciprofloxacin prior to biopsy, and men whose swabs do show ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria will receive alternative antibiotics based on their culture results.

 Our hypothesis is that these 2 groups will have equal numbers of post-biopsy infectious complications and both groups will have fewer infectious complications than a historical group who received empiric ciprofloxacin without the benefit of rectal swab culture results.
