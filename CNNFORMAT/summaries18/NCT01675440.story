(thirdQuint)Safety & Efficacy Study of the Medtronic CoreValve System-Treatment of Symptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis With Significant Comorbidities in Extreme Risk Subjects Who Need Aortic Valve Replacement.

 The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Medtronic CoreValve(R) System (MCS) in a subset of subjects excluded from the U.

S.

 Extreme Risk Pivotal Trial population due to one or more additional co-morbidities, as measured by a composite of all-cause death or major stroke at 12 months, in the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis in subjects necessitating aortic valve replacement.

 Subjects enrolled in this study have a predicted operative mortality or serious, irreversible morbidity risk of 50% at 30 days associated with surgical aortic valve replacement.
