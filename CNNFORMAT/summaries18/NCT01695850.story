(secondQuint)A Double-blinded,Double-dummy Clinical Trial of Chinese Herbal Medicine (MaZiRenWan) for Functional Constipation.

 Functional constipation (FC) is a common clinical complaint.

 Despite the effectiveness of MaZiRenWan (MZRW) for alleviating FC symptoms has been proofed in the previous study.

Given the results of the dose determination study and placebo-controlled study of MZRW, we hypothesize that MZRW is more useful than senna (senokot), a commonly used WM drug for constipation, for FC patients in excessive TCM syndrome.

This is a prospective, double-blind, double dummy, randomized, controlled trial.

 After a 2-week run-in, eligible FC patients (Rome III) in excessive TCM syndrome will randomly be assigned to CHM arm (MZRW and WM placebo), WM arm (senna and CHM placebo) or placebo arm (CHM placebo and WM placebo).

 Patients will undergo an 8-week treatment and an 8-week follow-up.
