(fifthQuint)AMG 181 in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Crohn's Disease.

 Title: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of AMG 181 in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Crohn's Disease Study Phase: 2 Indication: Crohn's Disease (CD) Primary Endpoint: Remission at week 8, as defined by a CDAI score of 100 cent Remission at week 12, as defined by a CDAI score of cent Sustained remission, defined as achieving the criteria for remission at week 8 or 12 and week 24 cent Change from baseline in CDAI score at week 8 or week 12 Safety Endpoints: cent Adverse events cent Serious adverse events cent Significant changes in laboratory values and vital signs cent Anti-AMG 181 antibodies Sample Size: 252 Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria: Subjects must have a diagnosis of ileal, ileo-colonic, or colonic Crohn's disease for a minimum of 6 months prior to baseline, with moderate to severe disease activity at baseline defined as a CDAI score 220 and 450.

 Subjects must have demonstrated an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to immunomodulators and/or anti-TNF agents or to corticosteroids (non-US sites only).

 Subjects may continue on stable doses of protocol specified medications to treat CD.

 Subjects must have a neurological exam free of clinically significant, unexplained signs and symptoms at screening and no clinically significant change prior to randomization.

 In addition, subjects must be free of significant concurrent medical conditions at study entry.

 If applicable, female subjects must be willing to use two highly effective methods of birth control or one highly effective method and one effective method of birth control during the study.

 Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration: Investigational Product will be administered subcutaneously (SC).

 During the 24-week double-blind placebo-controlled period, subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo or a selected dose of AMG181 per protocol using repeated injections until week 24.

 During the open-label period, all subjects will receive AMG 181 per protocol using repeated injections.

 Control Group: The double-blind period (first 24 weeks) will be controlled.

 During this period, the control group will receive placebo.

 AMG 181 in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Crohn's Disease@highlight

This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multiple dose study to evaluate the efficacy of AMG 181 compared with placebo as measured by the proportion of subjects in remission (CDAI score < 150) at week 8 (primary endpoint).

 After completing all screening assessments and meeting all eligibility criteria, subjects will be randomized to receive placebo or AMG 181 at various doses per protocol.

 A maximum of approximately 80% of subjects with any prior anti-TNF agent use will be allowed in the study.

 At the end of the double blind period, subjects will enter an open-label period during which all subjects will receive open-label AMG 181 at a single dose level according to protocol.

 Subjects who fail to achieve minimal improvement, or experience disease worsening after initial response are eligible to enter the open-label period early beginning at week 12 or after.

 Subjects that complete the open-label period or early terminate from the study will enter the 2 year safety follow up period.
