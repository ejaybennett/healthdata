(secondQuint)Pilot Study to Evaluate MR-guided Laser Ablation of Focal Lesions in Patients With Medically Refractory Partial Epilepsy.

 In this study, we propose to evaluate a novel, thermal therapy and feedback system (Visualase(R) Thermal Therapy System) as an alternative to surgical resection for the treatment of focal lesional epilepsy in patients that are considered high risk surgical candidates.

 This system includes the FDA-cleared Visualase Cooled Laser Applicator System (VCLAS), which allows delivery of laser energy while the patient is being imaged by an MRI unit.

 The Visualase(R) System works via real-time MR thermal imaging (MRTI) to provide information on the thermal dose delivered to the target, resulting in a more precise and controlled delivery which has heretofore not been possible with previous non-image guided laser technology.

 We hypothesize that the Visualase system can be used in patients refractory to medication therapy in a minimally invasive procedure to destroy epileptogenic focal lesions in the brain.

To investigate whether MR-guided laser induced thermal therapy in patients diagnosed with focal lesional epilepsy using the Visualase Thermal Therapy System is both a feasible and safe minimally invasive technique for control of seizures in such patients.
