(thirdQuint)A Study to Assess the Effects of Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) on the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of an Oral Contraceptive in Healthy Volunteers.

 This study will be an open-label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the assigned treatment), single-center, fixed-sequence study (all volunteers receive the same medication on the same days), to determine how canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus) affects the pharmacokinetics (ie, how the body affects the drug) of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel.

 The study will consist of 3 phases; a screening phase, an open-label treatment phase, and an end-of-study (or follow-up) phase.

 Each volunteer will participate in the study for approximately 33 days.

 A Study to Assess the Effects of Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) on the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of an Oral Contraceptive in Healthy Volunteers@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is a drug-drug interaction between multiple doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) and single doses of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel.

 The safety and tolerability of canagliflozin will also be assessed in healthy volunteers.
