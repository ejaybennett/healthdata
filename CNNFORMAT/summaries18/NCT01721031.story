(fifthQuint)DPNB for Prevention of CRDB.

 CRBD is not uncommon in the postoperative period, especially in male patients who have had urinary catheterization after anesthetic induction under general anesthesia, and this symptom complex may cause patient agitated and exacerbated postoperative pain.

 According to the previous study, i.

v.

 tramadol 1.

5 mg/kg administered 30 min before extubation results in reduction in the incidence and severity of CRBD.

 In clinical practice, tramadol is associated with side effects including nausea, vomiting, sedation, etc.

 Clinically, dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) was applied in penile surgery, and got satisfactory pain relief effect postoperatively without side effects related to tramadol.

 Besides, we observed patients underwent urethra surgery with urinary catheter left in situ seldom complained of CRBD if DPNB and RB performed at the end of operation.

 We hypothesized that DPNB could relieve DPNB for male patient with indwelling urinary catheter insertion after induction of general anesthesia.

 In this study we compare the efficacy of dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) with 0.

33% ropivacaine and intravenous tramadol 1.

5mg/kg in prevention of CRBD, as well as the incidences of side effects postoperatively.

 DPNB for Prevention of CRDB@highlight

Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) secondary to an indwelling urinary catheter is defined as an urge to void or discomfort in the supra-pubic region.

 This symptom complex may cause patient agitated and exacerbated postoperative pain.

 In clinic, dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) was applied for penile surgery including circumcision and some anterior urethra surgery.

 The investigators hypothesize that DPNB relive CRBD for male patients with indwelling urinary catheter under general anesthesia.
