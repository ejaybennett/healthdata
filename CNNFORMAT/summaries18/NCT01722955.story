(firstQuint)Pre-warmed Intravenous Fluids and Monitored Anesthesia Care.

 Monitored anesthesia care (MAC) has been increasing in fast track anesthesia for ambulatory or outpatient surgery.

 MAC provides lower anesthetic agents than general anesthesia, however it has been shown to result high anesthetic complication rate because of negligent monitoring.

 Therefore, aim of this study is to investigate the effect of pre-warmed intravenous fluids on the core body temperature and the early outcomes.
