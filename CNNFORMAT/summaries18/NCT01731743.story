(firstQuint)Evaluation of Visual Acuity and Patient Satisfaction With AT LISA TRI 839MP Intraocular Lenses.

 After bilateral cataract surgery, monocular and binocular uncorrected (UCVA) and best distance corrected visual acuity (BCVA) will be measured at far (4m), intermediate (80 cm) and near (40 cm) distance as well as the subjective refraction.

 A patient questionnaire will be used to assess the patient satisfaction and spectacle independence.
