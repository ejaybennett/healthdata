(secondQuint)Safety and Feasibility Study of Enhanced Recovery in Pancreaticoduodenectomy.

 A specific enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol has been applied since October 2010 in consecutive patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) in a high volume Institution.

 Patient compliance for each item has been assessed.

 Each ERAS patient was matched with a patient who received standard perioperative care.

 Match criteria were age, gender, malignant / benign disease, and PD prognostic score.
