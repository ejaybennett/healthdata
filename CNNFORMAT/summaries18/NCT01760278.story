(thirdQuint)Assessment of Implantation Potential of Embryos by Time-lapse Technology.

 1.

 There will be two arms of the study.

 The Study arm in which embryos of patients will be cultured in the Embryoscope.

 The control arm in which the embryos of patients will be cultured under conventional conditions.

 2.

 Embryos to be transferred will be identified by the Embryoviewer in the Study arm and the ones in the control arm will be identified by established subjective morphological criteria.

 3.

 Embryos with definite implantation potential will be transferred in both arms.

 4.

 Embryos not transferred will be frozen and/or discarded in both arms.

 Assessment of Implantation Potential of Embryos by Time-lapse Technology@highlight

1.

 Culture conditions of developing embryos are highly controlled in the Embryoscope and are monitored by Time-lapse videography to produce 3D images at different stages.

This cannot be done under conventional culture conditions.

 2.

 The 3D images thus produced,are analysed with the help of Embryoviewer, a part of the Embryoscope,through latest software.

 3.

 Embryoviewer also identifies embryos for transfer, freezing and to be discarded.
