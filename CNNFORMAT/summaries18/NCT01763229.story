(firstQuint)The Practical Use of Transthoracic Echocardiography for Obtaining an Optimal Depth of Internal Jugular Venous Catheters in Infants.

 Patients scheduled for surgery for congenital heart disease younger than 12 months were studied.

 Following successful catheter insertion, the insertion depth was determined using transthoracic echocardiography.

 The long axis or short axis images were used.

Chest X-ray images were taken postoperatively and distances from the tip to the carina level were measured.
