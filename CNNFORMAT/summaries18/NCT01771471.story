(firstQuint)A Study Comparing the Safety and Effectiveness of Cartilage Cell Injected Into the Lumbar Disc as Compared to a Placebo.

 This is a Phase II clinical study to collect additional safety data and preliminary efficiency of juvenile chondrocytes, delivered in fibrin carrier (NuQu(R)) to the nucleus of lumbar intervertebral discs for the treatment of discogenic pain.

 This to be accomplished through a double blinded, placebo-controlled study of clinically meaningful endpoints including validated, subject reported outcomes of pain and disability, health related quality of life and subject satisfaction with treatment.
