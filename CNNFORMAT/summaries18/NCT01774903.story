(thirdQuint)An Efficacy and Safety Study of Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS)-Fentanyl in Severe Chronic Low Back Pain.

 This is an open label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single arm, prospective (study following participants forward in time) study conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of TTS-fentanyl in Thai participants with chronic low back pain.

 All participants start treatment with 12.

5 micrograms ( mu g) per hour patch.

 The patches will be replaced every 3 days.

 On Day 3, and every 3 days thereafter, the TTS-fentanyl dose increases will be considered based on rescue medication consumption and pain assessment.

 No increase in TTS-fentanyl dose will be performed within the 72-hour dosing interval.

 The duration of the treatment will be 30 days.

 Primary efficacy assessment will be pain control rated by participants.

 Assessment time points will be at Day 0 (baseline), on Day 15 and Day 30 (trial end).

 At the end of study, global preference on efficacy, side effects and overall satisfaction will also be rated by investigator and participants.

 Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
