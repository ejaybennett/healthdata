(fifthQuint)Platelet Leukocyte Aggregates in Acute Cardiac Syndrome vs Healthy Volunteers.

 The goal is to investigate whether there is a simple and inexpensive method to test the level of platelet leukocyte aggregates through the blood count test.

 The parameters which are obtained routinely for white blood cell counts include: capacity - electrical conductivity (conductivity) - dispersion (scatter), and volume.

 Though these values are not reported routinely, they can be accessed for each blood count.

 The premise is that through blood counts (no need for specialized flow cytometry) and through the parameters mentioned a conclusion can be reached about platelet leukocyte aggregates.

 This will then aid in prognosis about the risk of an acute event for every patient with ischemic heart disease who comes to the emergency room.

This project aims to refine previous studies including the investigators work recently published in August 2012 Journal Thrombosis and Thrombolysis.

 That study showed a relationship between the level of platelet leukocyte aggregates in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

 The investigators intend to compare the characteristics of platelets, monocytes and neutrophil data of volume, scatter and conductivity obtained from routine blood count level with flow cytometry results defining platelet leukocyte aggregates.

 The investigators hypothesize that there will be a direct correlation between elevated platelet-leukocyte aggregates and biophysical data from the blood count.
