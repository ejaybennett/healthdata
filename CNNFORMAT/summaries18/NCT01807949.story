(secondQuint)A Study of Lumacaftor in Combination With Ivacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis Subjects Aged 12 Years and Older Who Are Homozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation.

 This was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group multicenter study of orally administered lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in participants aged 12 years and older with CF who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation.

 The study included a Screening Period (Day -28 through Day -1), a Treatment Period (Day 1 [first dose of study drug] to Week 24 5 days), and a Safety Follow-up Visit (4 weeks 7 days after the Week 24 Visit).
