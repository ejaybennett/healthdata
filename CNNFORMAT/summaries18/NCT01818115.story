(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy Trial to Evaluate the Hydrus(TM) Implant in Subjects Undergoing Cataract Surgery.

.

 This is a post-market, prospective, single-masked, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial comparing Cataract Extraction (CE) surgery + Hydrus Implant vs CE surgery alone for the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with a positive diagnosis for open angle glaucoma (POAG) or pseudoexfoliative glaucoma.

 Eligible patients will be scheduled for cataract surgery.

 At the time of the procedure, qualified subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups: Hydrus Implant with cataract surgery or cataract surgery alone.

 Post-operative follow up will be conducted at regular intervals.
