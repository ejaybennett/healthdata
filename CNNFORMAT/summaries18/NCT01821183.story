(secondQuint)Strength and Strength-ratio of Hip Rotator Muscles at Soccer Players.

 Nontraumatic hip injuries are a problem often seen in Soccer Players.

 A biomechanical formation mechanism is probably.

 Little research has focused on the measurement of hip external and internal rotation strength at soccer players.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of soccer sports at the isometric force and force ratio of the hip rotator muscle system.

 Two samples of Athletes will be compared: Soccer Players (N15) and Non-soccer players (N15) matched in sex, age and level of physical activity to investigate hip rotator force in 3 different angles of hip flexion (0/45/90).

 The measurement will be made with a handheld dynamometer.

 Strength and Strength-ratio of Hip Rotator Muscles at Soccer Players@highlight

At this investigation we want to find out whether there is a difference in muscle strength of the internal and external rotation hip muscles between soccer players and non-soccer players caused by typical movement patterns seen in soccer sport.
