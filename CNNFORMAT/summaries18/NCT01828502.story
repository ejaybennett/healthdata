(thirdQuint)Cotinine Feedback as an Intervention to Change Parental/Caregiver Smoking Behavior Around Children With Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to determine if providing urine cotinine feedback to caregivers in conjunction with standard education will be more effective than education alone in reducing patient SHS exposure.

 The secondary objectives of this study are: To determine whether urine cotinine feedback in conjunction with education provided to the caregiver is more effective in changing parental smoking behavior compared to education alone.

 As an exploratory measure we will collect history and physical exam data to follow patient's clinical complications during the study to determine if patients with a decrease in SHS exposure also have a decrease in clinical complications.

 Cotinine Feedback as an Intervention to Change Parental/Caregiver Smoking Behavior Around Children With Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Providing parent/caregivers of children with cancer with education and evidence of secondhand smoke exposure can protect the child from future exposure to tobacco smoke.

 PURPOSE: This randomized study will compare education only to education plus cotinine feedback in decreasing secondhand smoke exposure in pediatric patients with cancer that reside with a household smoker.
