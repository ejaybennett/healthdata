 Apparent increases in suicide attempts and death by suicide among active duty Service Members have gained considerable attention from the media, members of Congress, and the DoD.

 Identifying and intervening with individuals thinking of suicide (as well as those engaging in suicidal behavior) is key to preventing suicide in Service Members.

 Intervention through caring contacts (e.

g.

, letters, phone calls) have efficacy showing they may be an important adjunct or alternative to outpatient care.

 Caring contact interventions have been shown in previous studies to decrease suicidal ideation and attempts and initial pilot data have shown positive results in military populations.

 Text messaging, a low-cost means of sending brief messages (160 characters) to any owner of a mobile phone, has been investigated as an intervention for improving attendance to medical appointments and adherence to treatment in medical populations.

 As our current military population is a young, mobile, and increasingly technologically savvy population, and with the growing support behind text messaging as a feasible and effective mode of behavioral intervention, the pairing of text messaging and caring contact interventions warrants further research.

 The investigators plan to randomize 800 participating Service Members to one of the two treatment conditions (i.

e.

, CCVT+TAU or TAU alone) to test the efficacy of this intervention.

 Measured endpoints will include suicide risk incident requiring medical evacuation or hospitalization, suicidal ideation as identified by the follow-up assessment battery, "thwarted belongingness" as identified by The Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, outpatient behavioral health care utilization, and death.

The investigators propose to utilize text messaging to create and investigate the efficacy of a Continuing Contacts via Text (CCVT) intervention that extends the continuity of care for Service Members with a recent suicide attempt and/or reported suicidal ideation by sending them non-demanding caring text messages at regular intervals over a 12-month period.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to receive Continuing Contacts via Text (CCVT) in addition to Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU alone.

 Aim 1: To determine if the addition of 12 months of CCVT to TAU (CCVT+TAU) results in lower rates of suicidal ideation and behavior relative to TAU alone.

 - Hypothesis 1a: Participants assigned to CCTV+TAU compared to TAU alone will experience reduced suicidal ideation at 12-month follow-up.

 - Hypothesis 1b: Over the 12 months following study enrollment, a smaller proportion of participants assigned to CCVT+TAU vs.

 TAU alone will have suicide risk incidents (i.

e.

, those requiring medical evacuation or hospital admission).

 - Hypothesis 1c: Over the 12 months following study enrollment, CCVT+TAU vs.

 TAU alone will have fewer total number of suicide risk incidents requiring medical evacuation or hospital admission.

 Aim 2: To test two proposed mechanisms of action of CCVT outcome: 1) reduced "thwarted belongingness" and 2) increased engagement in behavioral health services.

 - Hypothesis 2a: The effect of CCVT+TAU compared to TAU alone will be mediated by reductions in "thwarted belongingness" from pre to post-study.

 - Hypothesis 2b: The effect of CCVT+TAU compared to TAU alone will be mediated by increased use of outpatient behavioral health services in the CCVT+TAU condition.
