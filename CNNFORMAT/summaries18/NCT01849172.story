(firstQuint)Effect and Safety of Electroacupuncture for Symptoms of Menopausal Transition.

 Menopause transition is called perimenopause in the past time.

 40-80% women aged 40 to 65 have symptoms during this period.

 Hormone therapy is the recommended therapy for menopause and there is not enough evidence in favor of alternative medicine's effect.

 We are going to conduct a phase II clinical trial to further evaluate the safety and effect of electroacupuncture for menopause transition symptoms.
