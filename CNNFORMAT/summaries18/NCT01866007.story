(fifthQuint)A Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetic Comparability of Guselkumab (CNTO1959) When Delivered by 2 Different Devices and as 2 Formulations in Healthy Participants.

 This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), parallel study (each group of participants will be treated at the same time) of guselkumab in healthy participants.

 Approximately 140 participants will be randomly assigned in the ratio 2:2:2:1 in to 4 treatment groups: Group 1 (SC injection of lyophilized formulation), Group 2 (subcutaneous [SC] injection of liquid formulation with PFS-U), Group 3 (SC injection of liquid formulation with PFS-FID), and Group 4 (IV infusion of liquid formulation).

 The study consists of 3 phases: screening (up to 4 weeks), open-label treatment and inpatient follow up (1 week) and outpatient follow up (11 weeks).

 Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, electrocardiograms, injection-site reactions, and clinical laboratory tests.

 The total duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 16 weeks.

 A Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetic Comparability of Guselkumab (CNTO1959) When Delivered by 2 Different Devices and as 2 Formulations in Healthy Participants@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (what the body does to the medication) comparability of guselkumab in lyophilized and liquid formulations.

 Also to evaluate pharmacokinetic comparability of liquid formulation of guselkumab when delivered as prefilled syringe with UltraSafe Passive Delivery System [PFS-U] or with a prefilled syringe facilitated injection device [PFS FID]) following a single subcutaneous (SC) administration of 100 mg guselkumab in healthy participants.
