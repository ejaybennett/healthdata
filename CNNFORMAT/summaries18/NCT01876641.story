(firstQuint)Treatment of a Resistant Disease Using Decitabine Combined With Vemurafenib Plus Cobimetinib.

 Primary Objectives Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the proposed schedule of decitabine and Vemurafenib plus Cobimetinib in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

 Assess tumor response rates by RECIST criteria Secondary Objectives To measure the time to progression of patients treated with this combination in comparison to patients treated historically with Vemurafenib alone (the current standard of care in BRAF-mutated patients).
