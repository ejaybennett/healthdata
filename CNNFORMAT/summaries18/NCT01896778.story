(secondQuint)Body Warming in Improving Blood Flow and Oxygen Delivery to Tumors in Patients With Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the feasibility and efficacy of 2 different Body Warming to Alter (Thermo) Regulation and the Microenvironment (B-WARM) regimens on altering tumor blood flow in patients with a variety of malignancies.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine if duration and thermal dose of B-WARM changes duration and extent of tumor blood flow changes in patients with a variety of malignancies.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1of 2 arms.

 ARM I: Patients undergo B-WARM at 39 degrees Celsius (C) for 30 minutes.

 ARM II: Patients undergo B-WARM at 39 degrees C for 2 hours.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up at 30 days.

 Body Warming in Improving Blood Flow and Oxygen Delivery to Tumors in Patients With Cancer@highlight

This randomized pilot clinical trial studies body warming in improving blood flow and oxygen delivery to tumors in patients with cancer.

 Heating tumor cells to several degrees above normal body temperature may kill tumor cells.
