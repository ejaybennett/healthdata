(thirdQuint)Phase 1 Infused Donor T Regulatory Cells in Steroid Dependent/Refractory Chronic GVHD.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: Determine the safety and tolerability of donor T regulatory (Treg) cell infusions in subjects with steroid dependent/refractory chronic graft versus host disease.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: 1.

 Determine the quantitative blood Treg cell changes following the cell infusions 2.

 Determine clinical efficacy of donor Treg cells as failure-free survival (FFS) defined by the absence of a new immunosuppressive therapy added, non-relapse mortality, and recurrent malignancy at Day 180 after the first Treg infusion 3.

 In addition to FFS, the study will measure the change in: 1.

 cGVHD symptom burden measured by the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale by increase in >7 points 2.

 NIH organ-specific cGVHD scale 3.

 The reduction in daily corticosteroid requirement of prednisone to <=0.

25 mg/kg-day at Day 180 after the first Treg infusion.

 Phase 1 Infused Donor T Regulatory Cells in Steroid Dependent/Refractory Chronic GVHD@highlight

Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) is a common complication of bone marrow or hematopoietic cell transplant from another person (allogeneic transplant).

 This study will determine if subjects with steroid dependent/refractory cGVHD can tolerate infusion of donor regulatory T cells and whether their cGVHD responds to the infusion.
