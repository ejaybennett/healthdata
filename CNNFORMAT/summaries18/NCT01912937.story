(secondQuint)Pharmacokinetic Study of Drug-coated Angioplasty Balloons in the Superficial Femoral or Popliteal Arteries:.

 This study investigates the inhibition of restenosis using the CVI Paclitaxel-coated PTA Catheter in the treatment of de-novo occluded/stenotic or re-occluded/ restenotic superficial femoral or popliteal arteries.

 The proposed clinical study will be a prospective, non-randomized, single arm, multi-center, pharmacokinetic study.

 The objective of the study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in the blood delivered from the CVI Paclitaxel-coated PTA Catheter as a result of de novo occluded/restenotic or re-occluded/restenotic lesion(s).
