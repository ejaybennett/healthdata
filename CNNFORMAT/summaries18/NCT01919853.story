(thirdQuint)Treatment for Persistently Fatigued Cancer Survivors: A Randomized Controlled Trial With Biomarker Response.

 This is a randomized, attention control clinical trial to compare MBSR to support and education on biobehavioral outcomes in early-stage (0-III) post-treatment cancer survivors with clinically-significant CRF.

 The study will use quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the following: Primary Aim 1: Determine effect size estimates of MBSR compared to attention control in reducing fatigue interference and the severity of several cancer-related symptoms immediately post-intervention and at 6-month follow-up.

 Exploratory Aim 1: To identify potential moderators of intervention effects in breast cancer survivors (BCS) and colorectal cancer survivors (CRCS), such as demographic, clinical/disease characteristics, personality traits, and baseline mindfulness level.

 Exploratory Aim 2: To compare levels of a number of anti- and pro-inflammatory proteins present in blood and urine between MBSR and attention control groups immediately post-intervention and 6-month follow-up, and between fatigued and non-fatigued breast cancer survivors at baseline.

The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to an attention control psycho-educational support group in treating cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in early-stage (0-III) post-treatment cancer survivors with clinically-significant CRF.

 The study will collect, store, and later analyze blood and urine samples for several biomarkers that may be linked to persistent CRF in cancer survivors.
