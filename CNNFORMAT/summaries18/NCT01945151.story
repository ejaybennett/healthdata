(fifthQuint)Analysis of the Electrical Muscle Activity and Resistance to Movement in Spastic Hemiparetic Patients.

.

 Most hemiparetic patients can develop spasticity, characterized by neuronal hyperexcitability, increased resistance to passive stretch, Babinski sign, clonus, reflexes and involuntary spasms skin.

 As a consequence, there may be contractures and muscle shortening, generating functional limitations.

 Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation feature that can control the spasticity through reciprocal inhibition, muscle relaxation and sensory stimulation.

 The goal will be to evaluate and compare the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation when applied in the agonist and antagonist muscles of spastic hemiparetic patients.

 Analysis of the Electrical Muscle Activity and Resistance to Movement in Spastic Hemiparetic Patients.

@highlight

To evaluate and compare the effects of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation when applied in the agonist and antagonist muscles of spastic hemiparetic patients.

 The specific objectives are: - Evaluate the resistance movement, strength and muscle electrical activity before and after application of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation in spastic muscle (gastrocnemius).

 - Evaluate the resistance movement, strength and muscle electrical activity before and after application of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation in the spastic antagonist muscle (tibialis anterior).

 - Compare the risk of falls after application of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation in both muscles studied.
