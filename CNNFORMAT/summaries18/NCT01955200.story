(thirdQuint)Optimal Anti-platelet Treatment for Patients With Clopidogrel Low Response.

 Optimal anti-Platelet Treatment for patients with stent IMplantation And clopidogrel Low response: OPTIMAL study Previous studies showed that dual anti-platelet treatment (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel provided 20% risk reduction for cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke compared with aspirin alone in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS)1-4.

 However, about 5~40% patients were reported being low response to clopidogrel, which is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular events5.

 Thus, it is of great clinical value to explore an intensified anti-platelet regimen to improve the inhibition of platelet function for the clopidogrel low responders.

 Several intensified anti-platelet protocols have been evaluated in the non-selected ACS patients.

 OASIS-7 showed that 600mg loading dose and 1-week double dose clopidogrel was associated with a 42% risk reduction of the definite stent thrombosis compared with regular DAPT6; our meta-analysis has demonstrated that cilostazol based triple anti-platelet treatment (TAPT) reduces the risk of late loss of minimal lumen diameter (MLD) and binary angiographic restenosis as well as target lesion revascularization(TLR) and target vessel revascularization (TVR) compared to regular DAPT in patients undergoing coronary stent implantation; PLATO study showed that ticagrelor (TCL) based DAPT was associated with a significantly lower incidence of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death compared with clopidogrel based DAPT, and the difference mainly appeared in the first 30 days7.

 However, there is still no study to investigate which of the mentioned methods is the optimal one to improve the anti-platelet effect as well as clinical outcome for the clopidogrel low responders.

 The investigators hypotheses that for patients who received stent implantation but present clopidogrel low response, 1-month intensified anti-platelet treatment by replacing clopidogrel with ticagrelor (TCL) is superior to double dose clopidogrel or adding cilostazol regarding the inhibition of platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP).

 Inclusion criteria: 1.

 Successively recruit all patients who receive stent implantation; 2.

 Patient aged >18 years and 80 years old; 3.

 Signed inform consent.

 Exclusion criteria: 1.

 Allergy or intolerance to ASA, clopidogrel or TCL; 2.

 Subjects at a high risk of bleeding (e.

g.

 platelet count1/2M ADP is to measured 5 days after taking the loading dose clopidogrel.

 Patients are randomized into the following 4 groups receiving either regular DAPT or different intensified anti-platelet treatments for 1 month if the inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) is no more than 60%.

 All patients return to regular DAPT (ASA 100mg daily, clopidogrel 75mg daily) for 11 month after 1-month intensified treatment.

 Patients with IPA > 60% receive regular DAPT as the 5th group.

 1.

 Intensified anti-platelet treatment-1: ASA 100mg daily + Ticagrelor 90mg Bid 2.

 Intensified anti-platelet treatment-2: ASA 100mg daily + Clopidogrel 150mg daily 3.

 Intensified anti-platelet treatment-3: ASA 100mg daily + Clopidogrel 75mg daily + cilostazol 150mg Bid 4.

 Regular DAPT (IPA60%): ASA 100mg daily + Clopidogrel 75mg daily 5.

 Regular DAPT (IPA>60%): ASA 100mg daily + Clopidogrel 75mg daily Sample size calculation: The IPA of ticagrelor in response to ADP was reported to be 8815%, with a 5% 2-side alpha, 30 patients in each group would offer 80% power to demonstrate that the result of ticagrelor is superior to any of the other groups.

 According to previous study, we assume the ratio of clopidogrel low response is 10%, then 1200 patients is required to reach the statistical significance.

 To avoid some drop-out, our sample size is set as 1350 patients.

 Tests: 1.

 ADP-induced platelet aggregation: Light transmittancy aggregation (LTA) in response to 51/2M ADP.

 2.

 Arachidonic acid(AA)-induced platelet aggregation: Light transmittancy aggregation (LTA) in response to 1mM AA.

 3.

 Blood sample points: baseline (5 days after taking the loading dose clopidogrel), 1month after randomization.

 Clinical follow-up: Time points: 1month, 6month, and 1year after randomization.

 Primary endpoints: 1.

 Inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) in response to 51/2M ADP determined by light transmittancy aggregometer (LTA) 1-month after intensified anti-platelet treatment.

 Secondary endpoints: 1.

 Clinical efficacy: death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, revascularization, and stent thrombosis (ARC definition); 2.

 Safety: minor, moderate, and major bleeding.

 Optimal Anti-platelet Treatment for Patients With Clopidogrel Low Response@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine that for patients who received stent implantation but present low response to regular anti-platelet treatment, whether 1-month intensified anti-platelet treatment by replacing clopidogrel with ticagrelor (TCL) is superior to double dose clopidogrel or adding cilostazol.
