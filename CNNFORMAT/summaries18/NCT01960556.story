(fifthQuint)Simulation-Based Central Venous Line Maintenance Bundle Education.

 The 2006 NACHRI Quality Transformation Effort demonstrated that additional reduction in pediatric catheter associated blood stream infection (CA-BSI) rates could be achieved through improving compliance with maintenance bundle care for central lines.

 The investigators objective was to improve maintenance bundle compliance rates and nursing competency surrounding central venous line (CVL) care in their pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).

 A multidisciplinary team developed a bedside simulation-based training program to improve compliance with standard PICU CVL maintenance bundle.

 The investigators then performed a randomized comparison study comparing a standard CVL bundle education process for bedside PICU nurses in a control group (CG) to an intervention group (IG) receiving bedside training to simulate a CVL dressing change and maintenance bundle followed by intermittent educational refresh.

 Groups were assessed for compliance with prescribed components of the CVL bundle maintenance (CVL score).

 CVL scores will be compared between groups.

Catheter associated blood stream infections (CA-BSI) remain a source of significant morbidity and mortality in adult and pediatric critical care units.

 While it has been established that CVL maintenance bundles are pivotal to achieving and maintaining low CA-BSI rates, training and retention of proper bundle compliance remains a challenge.

 The investigators prospectively compared this simulation-based program to a standard educational approach.

 The investigators hypothesized that implementation of bedside simulation-based training of CVL dressing changes by registered nurses would improve CVL maintenance bundle compliance.
