(secondQuint)Phase 1 Single and Multiple Dose Study of FPA008 in Healthy Volunteers and Rheumatoid Arthritis Subjects.

 Approximately 56 healthy volunteers will be enrolled at 1 study center in the Netherlands for Parts 1 and 2, and approximately 39 subjects will be enrolled at up to 6 sites in Central and Eastern Europe for Part 3.

 Dose escalations in Parts 1 and 2 will be driven by an assessment of the safety profile.

 Review of safety and PK parameters may inform decisions to add cohorts with intermediate dose levels in order to reach an optimal target exposure.
