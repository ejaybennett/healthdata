(fifthQuint)A Golimumab Phase 3b, Multicenter, Assessment of Intravenous Efficacy in Rheumatoid Arthritis Subjects Who Have Diminished Disease Control Despite Treatment With Infliximab (REMICADE).

 The study employs an open-label "active switch" design that moves subjects from infliximab to golimumab 2 mg/kg IV.

 In general, subjects eligible for the study include men or women who are currently receiving infliximab in actual clinical practice who are at least 18 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis, and have previously demonstrated initial and/or temporary improvement in disease signs and symptoms, but now exhibit a diminished response and inadequate disease control despite continued treatment.

 Subjects must have received infliximab in combination with methotrexate for a minimum of 9 months prior to the first screening visit.

 The screening visit will occur sometime between Week -12 and Week -10.

 Consenting subjects who meet screening criteria will receive their final dose of infliximab at Week -8 as part of actual clinical practice.

 Golimumab IV treatment, which will be supplied by the sponsor, will be received at Weeks 0, 4, 12, 20, and 28.

 The primary endpoint is at Week 24, the final efficacy assessment is at Week 32, and a follow-up safety assessment by telephone is at Week 44.

 There will be a maximum of 36 weeks between the last infliximab infusion at Week -8 and the last infusion of golimumab at Week 28.

 The duration of study participation is expected to be a maximum of 56 weeks (including the Screening Period, 32 weeks of golimumab treatment and assessment, and a 12-week safety follow-up).

 A Golimumab Phase 3b, Multicenter, Assessment of Intravenous Efficacy in Rheumatoid Arthritis Subjects Who Have Diminished Disease Control Despite Treatment With Infliximab (REMICADE)@highlight

This is a Phase 3b, multicenter study of the efficacy of golimumab 2 mg/kg IV in subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis who are receiving methotrexate and have inadequate disease control (defined as an erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]-based Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28] 3.

2 and 4 swollen and 4 tender joints) despite current anti-TNF therapy with infliximab 2 - 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks, 2 - 5 mg/kg every 5 weeks, 3 - 6 mg/kg every 6 weeks, 3 - 7mg/kg every 7 weeks, or 4 - 8 mg/kg every 8 weeks.

 To be eligible for participation, subjects must have previously demonstrated initial and/or temporary improvement in disease signs and symptoms, who have since exhibited a diminished response despite continued treatment.

 It is estimated that 200 subjects will be enrolled in the study at approximately 85 global sites.
