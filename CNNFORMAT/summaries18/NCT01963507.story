(secondQuint)Effects of a Resistance Training Period on Blood Pressure of Hypertensive Elderlies: Influence of the Polymorphism of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme.

 To investigate the chronic effects of resistance training on blood pressure and biochemical exams in elderly, 135 hypertensive elderlies were divided into 2 groups: trained and control.

 The trained group was submitted to a resistance training period.

 Before the 16 weeks ACE gene was genotyped (PCR).

 Before and after 16 weeks, blood pressure (ambulatory), HDL-cholesterol, Total cholesterol, Glycemia, Triacylglycerol (colorimetric assay) and plasminogen activator inhibition (PAI-1), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), Adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), C Reactive Protein, Angiotensin II, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, Angiotensin 1-7, (ELISA assay) were measured.

The study aimed to evaluate the chronic effects of resistance training on blood pressure and biochemical exams in hypertensive elderlies and the influence of the polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme in these response.
