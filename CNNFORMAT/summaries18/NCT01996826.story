(fifthQuint)A Multi-Center Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Bevacizumab in High-Risk Corneal Transplant Survival.

 The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a drug, bevacizumab (Avastin), in preventing blood vessels that often occur after a corneal transplantation which are considered at "high-risk" for rejection.

 In many cases these blood vessels lead to the graft rejection and eventual failure of the corneal transplant.

 It is hoped that this treatment will increase the chances of corneal graft survival.

 The medication used in this study is called bevacizumab or Avastin (Genentech, Inc).

 It works by inhibiting the action of a molecule called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

 VEGF is a substance molecule that binds to certain cells to stimulate new blood vessel formation.

 When VEGF is bound to the drug, it cannot stimulate the formation and growth of new blood vessels.

 Growth of blood vessels into the cornea is a complication which can worsen the prognosis of your corneal transplant and put the transplant at a higher risk for rejection.

The goal of this study is to investigate whether using bevacizumab (Avastin(R)) is both safe and effective at decreasing the likelihood of a high-risk corneal graft rejection.

 Patients who are "high-risk" for rejection have blood vessels growing from the white of the eye into the cornea (clear, front region of the eye).

 The medication is used at the time of surgery and in the weeks following surgery.

 Participants have a 50/50 chance at receiving the active study medication or a placebo medication.
