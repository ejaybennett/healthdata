(firstQuint)Efficacy Study of Vitamin D and Statins to Treat Hypercholesterolemia.

 Vitamin D is primarily generated in the skin, in response to direct absorption of ultraviolet B radiation.

 Vitamin D can also be obtained through fortified foods and oral supplements.

 Lipid abnormalities are common in the general population, and are regarded as a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

 Recently low vitamin D status has been shown to be associated with increased risk of developing hyperlipidemia.

 Statins are normally the first-line therapy for hypercholesterolemia.

 It is also reported that vitamin D can improve serum lipid levels.

 However, its effects on hypercholesterolemia patients remain unclear.

 The investigators planned to determine the efficacy of combination therapy with statins and vitamin D in a cohort of hypercholesterolemia patients.

 This study may shed light as to whether oral vitamin D supplementation can be an adjunct therapy in hypercholesterolemia patients.
