(thirdQuint)Optimization of Synvisc-One for Knee OA.

 This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind (subject and physical therapist), sham needle injection controlled, single center, multi-site study.

 Subjects with primary osteoarthritis knee pain will be randomly assigned to a 6 ml intra-articular injection of Synvisc-One or sham needle injection.

 The post-treatment course of physical therapy will begin between Day 3 and Day 14 and will last up to 12 weeks in duration (PT ends at study Week 12).

 Subjects are encouraged to complete between 6 and 16 physical therapy visits within 10-12 weeks of physical therapy treatment as determined by the treating Physical Therapist.

 Optimization of Synvisc-One for Knee OA@highlight

The study hypothesis is that the use of Synvisc-One will improve physical therapy compliance and performance, resulting in improved knee function and pain when compared to a group that receives a sham injection (an injection that does not have medicine) only before a standardized physical therapy regimen over 10 weeks.
