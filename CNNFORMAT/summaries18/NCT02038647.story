(thirdQuint)Phase 2 Study of Alisertib (MLN8237) in Combination With Paclitaxel Versus Placebo in Combination With Paclitaxel as Second Line Therapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC).

 The drug tested in this study is called alisertib.

 Alisertib is being tested to treat people who have Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC).

 This study determined the safety and efficacy for alisertib when given twice a day along with paclitaxel.

 This open label study enrolled 178 patients.

 Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Alisertib 40 mg - Paclitaxel 60 mg/m^2 - Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 - Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient All participants received treatment until their disease progressed or they experienced unacceptable alisertib-related toxicity.

 This multi-center trial was conducted world-wide.

 The overall time to participate in this study is approximately up to 22 months.

 Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone every month for 6 months after the end of treatment (EOT) for follow-up assessment of progression free survival and for overall survival every 2 months until death, study closure, or 14 months after randomization of the last participant.

This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 2 study designed to is to determine if the combination treatment can improve progression free survival (defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first) when compared with placebo + paclitaxel.
