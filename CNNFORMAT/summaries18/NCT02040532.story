(fifthQuint)Gabapentin for Insomnia Symptoms and Nighttime Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) in Peri- and Postmenopausal Women.

 Thirty-two peri- and postmenopausal women at the Boston sites (MGH and BWH) were enrolled into this open-label pilot study.

 The study was a 7-week intervention study using open-label gabapentin at bedtime with a scheduled dose titration from 100-mg for one week, followed by 300-mg for 3 weeks, and then 600-mg for 3 weeks.

 The intervention study followed a 3-week screening period to establish a stable baseline for insomnia symptoms and VMS and to determine the safety of administering gabapentin in study participants.

 Tolerability and treatment response (insomnia symptoms, nighttime VMS) were assessed systematically at each study visit.

 The dose titration schedule was followed in all participants unless there are dose-limiting toxicities.

 Gabapentin for Insomnia Symptoms and Nighttime Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) in Peri- and Postmenopausal Women@highlight

The broad goal of this study is to obtain pilot data to determine the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the non-hormonal agent gabapentin for insomnia symptoms and nighttime vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) when open-label gabapentin is administered at low dose and only at night in peri- and postmenopausal women.

 We hypothesize that the majority of participants will be able to increase and tolerate treatment, and insomnia symptoms and the frequency of nighttime VMS will improve on low-dose gabapentin dosed at bedtime.
