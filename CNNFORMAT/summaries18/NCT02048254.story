(secondQuint)Study of I-125 Brachytherapy Versus Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy to Treat Inoperable Salivary Gland Cancer.

 The target population are those patients with inoperable salivary gland derived primary or recurrent cancer, including local advanced primary salivary gland cancer which could not be resected completely; recurrent salivary gland cancer which could not be resected completely; T3/T4 tumor which could not tolerate surgery due to severe combined disease.

 The subjects would be divided into Iodine-125 radioactive seeds permanent interstitial implantation brachytherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy randomly.

 During the follow-up period, the efficacy and the safety index would be monitored.
