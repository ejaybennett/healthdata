(secondQuint)Calcinosis in a Single-Center Scleroderma Population.

 This is a prospective study of scleroderma- spectrum patients focused on soft tissue calcinosis in order 1) to better understand the risk factors (including clinical/laboratory characteristics, and serology) of calcinosis in the scleroderma-spectrum disorders (limited or diffuse systemic sclerosis with or without overlap of inflammatory arthritis and/or myositis).

 2) view common complications associated with calcinosis.

 Better understanding of scleroderma calcinosis would lead to other studies that eventually will define better treatment options for this incurable and often disabling complication.
