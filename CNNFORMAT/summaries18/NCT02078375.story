(firstQuint)The PRESS RA: Protein and Resistance Exercise Supplementation Study for Rheumatoid Arthritis.

 This study proposes a randomized trial to evaluate a tailored 16-week resistance exercise program, in combination with protein supplementation, for older individuals with RA.

 The exercise protocol in this study is distinctive because it combines dynamic and isometric (static) resistance exercise performed on specialized equipment that can accommodate the range of motion limitations frequently encountered in the older RA population.

 This study will also begin to evaluate if additional benefit can be achieved with daily protein supplementation.
