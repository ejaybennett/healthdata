(secondQuint)Comparison of Two Ventilation Modes With Laryngeal Mask Airway Guardian.

 The Guardian Laryngeal Mask (Ultimate Medical Pty Ltd, Richmond, Vic, Australia) is a new silicone-based single-use extraglottic airway device that forms a seal with the glottis for ventilation and with the hypopharynx for airway protection, and provides a gastric drainage port.

 The aim of the following perspective, randomized, blind trial study id to compare how the volume-controlled ventilation and pressure-controlled ventilation modes using the Laryngeal Mask Guardian affect the pulmonary mechanics, the gas exchange and the cardiovascular responses particularly in obese patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopy.

 Comparison of Two Ventilation Modes With Laryngeal Mask Airway Guardian@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare volume- and pressure- controlled ventilation with laryngeal mask airway Guardian in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery in terms of ventilatory efficacy, airway leak pressure (airway protection), ease-of-use and complications.
