(fifthQuint)Stem Cell Therapy to Improve Burn Wound Healing.

 The study will include a Phase 1 trial.

 A tissue repository will be collected.

 The recipients in the Phases 1 of the study will be inpatients at Jackson.

 Their enrollment will continue into the outpatient setting.

 The donors will be recruited through the University of Miami (UM).

 The donors will present for 2 clinic visits, and after the bone marrow aspiration, the study team will contact the donor by phone 2 times (Initial call 24-48 hrs.

 and then 30-60 days after Donation).

 RECIPIENTS Recipients will be screened upon presentation to the hospital.

 To establish enrollment, the wound will be examined and measured.

 A complete medical history and physical exam will be performed.

 Blood will be collected to test for blood bourne pathogens, including hepatitis and HIV.

 A pregnancy test will be done for females.

 Once the patient is enrolled, MSC's will be applied according to the dose and frequency determined by the Phase 1 trial.

 At various intervals, skin biopsies, wound measurements, questionnaires and possibly bone marrow aspirate may be performed (see below).

 Study Design for Specific Phase 1: This will represent the Phase 1 portion of the study.

 It will asses the safety of delivering MSC's to burn wounds.

 A total of 20 patients will be recruited and divided into 4 groups.

 These groups will be taken through a dose escalation method, i.

e.

 the first group will be started on the lowest dose.

 If there are no adverse reactions, the second group will receive a higher dose.

 This will be repeated for the third and fourth groups with each receiving a higher dose.

 If necessary, a second dose of MSC's will be given.

 Each administration will be given no less than 10 days apart but no more than 6 weeks apart.

 Second doses will not be given until it is evident that no significant adverse events occured from the first administration.

 There will be a maximum of 2 administrations of MSC's.

 At the end of each dose level, safety data will be presented to the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB).

 If there were no significant adverse events or concerns from either party, the protocol will continue to the next dose level.

 Rejection will be monitored with blood tests before, between and after receiving MSC's, as well as clinical evaluation.

 Upon discharge from the hospital, patients will be asked to come to clinic at 1- 4 week intervals depending on the course of the individual patient.

 Home nursing care may be arranged if necessary for dressing changes.

 During clinic visits, the wounds will be assessed and questionnaires done.

 During this time, the patients will also have necessary evaluations and sessions with physical and occupational therapy.

 Once the wound is considered healed, patients may be asked to return to clinic monthly to ensure that the wound remains healed.

 At the completion of the Phase 1 trial, all safety data will be sent to the DSMB, monitor, IRB and FDA.

 If no significant safety issues arise, the study is anticipated to progress to Phase 2 .

 Blood sample and tissue repository: During the course of the study, many samples will be taken.

 These include serum, blood cells, tissue and skin cells.

 These samples may be taken from donors and recipients.

 These samples may be able to provide insight into biomarkers which may be used to predict healing and scarring.

 As such, they may be stored for further, non-clinical research in the tissue repository.

 Patients would have signed away their rights to these samples.

 SCHEDULE FOR RECIPIENTS (all Phase 1 patients).

 Week 1: Health and medications will be recorded.

 Samples of blood will be drawn for safety and research purposes.

 A skin biopsy from the wound may be performed and the wound will be evaluated/measured.

 Prior to treatment, 2nd degree burn subjects will be reassessed to determine if wound healing is likely within the next week.

 If > 30% of the wound is closed and significant evidence of healing is present, this subject will be excluded from further participation in the study.

 MSC's will be applied to the wound.

 A film dressing to hold the cells in place may be applied.

 This dressing would be removed 12-48 hours post-operatively.

 The wound will be dressed with the appropriate dressing for the specific type of wound.

 Wounds will also be photographed.

 Week 3 to 26: Patients will return to clinic.

 Additional samples of blood may be obtained for research purposes.

 Questionnaires will be completed with inquiries into changes in health and medications.

 Wounds will be evaluated and measured, as well as photographed.

 Dead tissue will be cleaned if necessary.

 Appropriate dressing changes will be done.

 If needed, MSC's will be applied to wounds for the second time.

 The application will be no less than 10 days apart but no more than 6 weeks apart.

 Again if cells are applied, a film dressing to hold the cells in may be applied.

 This dressing can be removed in 12-48 hours.

 Signs of rejection will be monitored.

 Blood tests will be done per investigators discretion.

 Skin biopsies may also be performed.

 If rejection or reaction is suspected, patients will no longer be eligible to receive any more donor cells.

 After Week 26 or End of Treatment Visit: If the wound is healed, a biopsy of the wound may be done.

 Samples of blood may be drawn for research purposes.

 These patients will return to clinic monthly to ensure that the wound stays closed.

 If the wound remains unhealed, it will be measured and photographed.

 Note that patients with healed wounds may refuse biopsy.

 Appropriate dressing changes will be done.

 Questions about health and medications will be asked.

 DONORS Approximately 10 donor will be used to harvest MSC's.

 Initially, potential donors will present for a screening visit.

 Here, a physical exam will be done, in addition to a screening questionnaire.

 Medical history will be collected.

 Blood samples will also be taken to be tested for blood bourne pathogens, including hepatitis and HIV.

 A urine sample will be collected as well.

 If a potential donor meets the screening criteria, they will return for a second, 'donation' visit.

 At this visit, vital signs will be recorded and a bone marrow aspirate will be done.

 The bone marrow aspirates will be done by Dr.

 John Byrnes, a hematologist/oncologist who routinely performs these aspirates for the stem cell trials here at UM.

 This second visit will take place within 1 week of the initial visit.

 A biomarker test may be involved.

 The evaluation of specific biomarkers may help to determine the effect of stem cell delivery to burn wounds.

 In order to provide this type of examination, removal and analysis of nucleic acids derived from donor materials may be needed.

 A separate genetic research consent will be provided to the donor.

 GENETIC TESTING The biomarker/genetic tests may be performed on materials obtained from both donors and recipients.

 The samples could include bone marrow aspirate, blood and tissue.

 The tests will be performed primarily to detect the expressions of levels of genes important for healing, tissue repair and inflammation.

 Stem Cell Therapy to Improve Burn Wound Healing@highlight

This study will determine the safety of allogeneic stem cell therapy from healthy donors, for 2nd degree burn wounds of less than 20% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA), at four different dose levels.

 Clinical evaluation will take place every 1 to 4 weeks intervals until wound closure, and then monthly for 6 months following the last administration of MSCs.

 Once the safety and dose-response analysis in Phase 1 is completed, an expanded trial will be initiated to better examine the efficacy of MSC therapy in 2nd degree burn wounds.

 Phase 1 will establish the maximum safe dose that will be used in the Phase II trial.
