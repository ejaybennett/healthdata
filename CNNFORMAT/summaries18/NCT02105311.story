(secondQuint)Effect of Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty Versus Travoprost on Circardian Intraocular Pressure.

 Selective laser trabeculoplasty is an effective treatment for lowering intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma.

 Clinical evaluations of its effectiveness in individual patients usually are derived from baseline and post-laser measurements of intraocular pressure during office hours in the sitting position.

 Only a few studies have examined the efficacy of laser trabeculoplasty beyond office hours.

 Although the 24-hour effect of laser trabeculoplasty has been studied ,the study was conducted before the use of these new and more potent intraocular pressure lowering drugs.

 So it doesn't have any study to determine the effect of selective laser trabeculoplasty and travoprost to reduce the diurnal and nocturnal variation of Iintraocular pressure.

The investigators conduct this study to access the effect of selective laser trabeculoplasty on 24-hour circadian tension curves of patients with open-angle glaucoma, normal tension glaucoma and ocular hypertension.

 This treatment effect is compared with that of the prostaglandin analogue, travoprost.
