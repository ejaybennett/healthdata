(thirdQuint)Dose-escalating, Safety, Tolerability and PK Study of TAS-119 in Combination With Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 Background and rationale for study: In nonclinical pharmacology studies TAS-119 significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel and TAS-119 is being developed for use in combination with paclitaxel.

 TAS-119 selectively inhibits the kinase inhibitor Aurora A.

 AurA regulates cell division by controlling the transition from G2 to M phase.

 Overexpression of AurA is associated with resistance to taxanes.

 The study will be conducted in two sequential phases: Dose Escalation Phase with the purpose to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose of TAS-119 given in combination with paclitaxel An Expansion Phase in which additional patients will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of the recommended Phase 2 dose of TAS-119 in combination with paclitaxel, during which a subgroup of patients will be evaluated for DDI between paclitaxel and TAS-119 via PK assessment.

The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of TAS-119 and determine the most appropriate dose in combination with Paclitaxel for subsequent studies in patients with advanced solid tumors.

 TAS-119 is a novel, selective Aurora A kinase inhibitor, which has previously been demonstrated to enhance the activity of paclitaxel in preclinical studies
