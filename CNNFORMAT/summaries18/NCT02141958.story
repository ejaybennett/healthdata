(thirdQuint)Safety Study of Fenretinide in Adult Patients With Cystic Fibrosis.

 Patients with cystic fibrosis have an innate imbalance of essential fatty acids, with increased arachidonic acid (AA) levels, decreased docosahexanoic acid (DHA) levels, and elevated AA/DHA ratio.

 An increasing amount of evidence suggests that this lipid imbalance is a primary effect in CF, playing a major role in the infection-inflammation vicious cycle that leads to respiratory failure.

 Fenretinide, a derivative of vitamin A, was shown to correct the AA/DHA imbalance in lungs and blood plasma in specific animal model of CF, resulting in reduced lung inflammation and decrease in the severity of pulmonary infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

 This is a single center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 3 increasing oral doses of Fenretinide compared to placebo, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Fenretinide in adult CF patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

 A single cohort of 16 clinically stable adult patients will be randomized to either Fenretinide or placebo, in a 3:1 randomization scheme (12 active, 4 placebo).

 Safety Study of Fenretinide in Adult Patients With Cystic Fibrosis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of a novel oral formulation of Fenretinide to adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, once-daily for 21 days (treatment cycle).

 This study will include up to three (3) dose levels with minimum 7 day breaks in between treatment cycles.

 For each dose level, blood samples will be collected for exploratory pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluation.
