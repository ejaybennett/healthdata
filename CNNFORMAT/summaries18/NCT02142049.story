(secondQuint)Ibrutinib and Lenalidomide With Dose Adjusted EPOCH-R in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma.

 This is a Phase 1b, open-label, non-randomized multicenter study conducted in 2 parts.

 Part 1, will determine the MTD of the combination of ibrutinib, lenalidomide and DA-EPOCH-R in subjects with DLBCL.

 Ibrutinib will be administered at a fixed dose of 560 mg and lenalidomide will be dose-escalated.

 DA-EPOCH-R will be given at standard doses.

 For Part 2, the MTD determined in Part 1 will be the dose used for all subjects.

 The primary objective for Part 2 is to determine the ORR of ibrutinib and lenalidomide in combination with DA-EPOCH-R in subjects with ABC DLBCL (a subset of non-GCB DLBCL) as analyzed by gene expression profiling.

This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, non-randomized multicenter study to assess the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib and lenalidomide in combination with DA-EPOCH-R in subjects with relapsed/refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).
