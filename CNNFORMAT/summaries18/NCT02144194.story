(thirdQuint)Maintenance Oral Vinorelbine or Observation After Vinorelbine-Docetaxel First Line Chemotherapy in Advanced Breast Ca.

 To our knowledge, this is the first trial evaluating the role of oral Vinorelbine as a maintenance therapy versus observation following a first line treatment with iv/oral Vinorelbine+Docetaxel.

 Eligible patients will be enrolled in the trial to receive 6 cycles of iv(D1)/oral(D8) Vinorelbine + Docetaxel.

 For responding and SD patients, after the 6 cycles, they will be randomized either in observation arm or to receive a maintenance chemotherapy with oral Vinorelbine.

 The oral form of the drug was found to be most appropriate for a long term treatment allowing to preserve QoL of the patients.

 Oral Vinorelbine will be administered on D1, D8 every 3 weeks during maintenance treatment, until PD, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal to continue.

 The trial will assess efficacy/safety of initial Vinorelbine-Docetaxel combination as well as the benefits of maintenance chemotherapy with oral Vinorelbine.

 Maintenance Oral Vinorelbine or Observation After Vinorelbine-Docetaxel First Line Chemotherapy in Advanced Breast Ca@highlight

This 2 arms study will assess the efficacy and safety of the Vinorelbine-Docetaxel combination given as an initial upfront treatment (first line) to all metastatic breast cancer patients enrolled.

 Patients having a disease control following initial treatment, will be randomized to either oral Vinorelbine maintenance arm or Observation arm.

 The trial will also compare the efficacy and safety of maintenance oral Vinorelbine versus Observation.
