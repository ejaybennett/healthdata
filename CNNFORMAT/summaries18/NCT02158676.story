(fifthQuint)Effect of Prebiotic and Synbiotic Supplementation in Individuals Undergoing Roux-en-y Gastric Bypass.

.

 The study will recruit patients submitted to roux-en-y gastric bypass.

 Individuals that meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized by means of a computer program on three study groups: 1) Prebiotic group: Oral supplementation with 6g/day of prebiotic for 15 days.

 2) Synbiotic group: Oral supplementation with 6g/day of synbiotic for 15 days.

 3) Placebo group (control): Oral supplementation with 6g/day of placebo (maltodextrin) for 15 days.

 Will be assessed the effects of supplementation on the plasma cytokines, plasma lipopolysaccharide (bacterial endotoxin), plasma cellular fatty acid profile, metabolic parameters (lipid profile, glycemic status and insulin resistance) and nutritional status.

 Blood samples will be collected before the surgery and the supplementation will begin 30 days after surgery.

 Effect of Prebiotic and Synbiotic Supplementation in Individuals Undergoing Roux-en-y Gastric Bypass.

@highlight

The study will recruit patients submitted to bariatric surgery.

 Individuals will be supplemented with 6g/day of prebiotic or synbiotic or placebo (maltodextrin) for 15 days.

 Immunological, metabolic and anthropometric parameters will be assessed before and after the supplementation.

 Our hypothesis is that prebiotic or synbiotic supplementation modulate plasma concentrations of immunological and metabolic parameters and anthropometric measures of subjects undergoing gastric bypass Roux-Y.
