(thirdQuint)Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of an Investigational, Injectable HIV Medicine (GSK1265744) in HIV-Uninfected Adults.

 This study will evaluate GSK1265744, which is an investigational, injectable HIV medicine.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GSK1265744 in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

 Study researchers will evaluate the use of GSK1265744 for both the prevention of HIV infection (known as pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) and for the treatment for HIV infection.

 This study will enroll two cohorts of participants (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2).

 Within each cohort, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 will receive GSK1265744 tablets (also called oral 744) and injections (also called GSK1265744 long acting or 744LA), and Group 2 will receive placebo tablets and injections.

 Participants in Cohort 1 will attend several study visits through Week 81 or Week 105.

 Participants in Cohort 2 will attend several study visits through Week 85 or Week 109.

 From study entry through Week 4, participants in both cohorts will take a GSK1265744 tablet (Group 1) or a placebo tablet (Group 2) once a day.

 For 1 week after participants stop taking their assigned tablets, study researchers will assess safety and tolerability.

 If no safety or tolerability concerns are identified, participants will enter the injection phase of the study.

 Participants in Cohort 1 will receive two injections of GSK1265744 (Group 1) or placebo (Group 2) at Weeks 5, 17, and 29.

 Participants in Cohort 2 will receive one injection of GSK1265744 (Group 1) or placebo (Group 2) at Weeks 5, 9, 17, 25, and 33.

 All study visits will include HIV counseling, a physical examination, a medical history review, and a blood collection.

 Select study visits will include adherence counseling, central nervous system (CNS) symptom assessment, behavioral and acceptability assessments, a urine collection, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and rectal and/or vaginal swabs.

This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (which is how the body interacts with drugs) of an investigational, injectable HIV medicine (GSK1265744) in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

 Researchers will evaluate the use of this medicine for both the prevention and treatment of HIV infection.
