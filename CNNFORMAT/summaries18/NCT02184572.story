(secondQuint)Safety and Immunogenicity Study of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine (209762) Compared to Merck & Co.

, Inc.

's MMR Vaccine in Healthy Children 12 to 15 Months of Age.

 This study will evaluate the safety of GSK's trivalent MMR vaccine (referred to as INV_MMR vaccine) at a potency that will be used to define maximum release limits for the INV_MMR in comparison to the US standard of care (M-M-R II/ M-M-R VaxPro vaccine referred to as COM_MMR vaccine).

 In order to obtain more representative data on the comparator vaccine, the COM_MMR used in this study will consist of two lots designated COM_MMR_L1 and COM_MMR_L2.

 Throughout the study COM_MMR_L1 and COM_MMR_L2 will be analyzed as pooled lots.

 This study is intended to support licensure of GSK's MMR vaccine in the US.

 All children will receive Varivax and Havrix vaccines, concomitantly with MMR containing vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age.

 Prevnar 13 will be administered only to US children.

 At the end of the study, GSK will provide a second dose of Havrix and/or varicella vaccine to participants enrolled in selected non-US countries if local health departments do not routinely provide hepatitis A and varicella vaccination.

 The second dose of Havrix and varicella vaccine is not part of the study procedures.
