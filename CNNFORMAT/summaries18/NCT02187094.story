(thirdQuint)Study Evaluating the Effect of TC-6499 on Gastric Emptying Time in Diabetic Subjects With Gastroparesis.

 This is a 4-way crossover study to assess the effect of TC-6499 on gastric emptying time in diabetic subjects with gastroparesis.

 The length of study participation for a subject is up to 50 days.

 During screening, eligible subjects will complete an oral 13-C-spirulina breath test also known as the Gastric Emptying Breath Test (GEBT).

 During the treatment period, subjects will complete 4 overnight drug assessment visits (treatment arms) where they will receive a randomized single dose of study drug and the GEBT.

 Each overnight visit will be separated by approximately 7 days.

 At least 18 subjects will be randomized and complete all 4 dosing arms (actual = 23 randomized subjects and 21 completing all 4 arms of the crossover).

 Study Evaluating the Effect of TC-6499 on Gastric Emptying Time in Diabetic Subjects With Gastroparesis@highlight

Gastroparesis, also referred to as delayed gastric emptying, is a debilitating, chronic disorder that slows or stops the passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine.

 The purpose of this study is to test whether TC-6499 is safe and effective at reducing gastric emptying time in diabetic subjects with gastroparesis.
