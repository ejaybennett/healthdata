(fifthQuint)To Determine the Effect of Honey Enema in the Treatment of Patients With Acute Pouchitis.

 Pouchitis is the most common long-term complication of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) in ulcerative colitis (UC).

 Pouchitis is defined as a clinical syndrome of watery, frequent, at times bloody stool accompanied by urgency, incontinence, abdominal cramps, malaise, and fever.

 The PDAI (Pouchitis Disease Activity Index) provides a standardized definition of pouchitis based on clinical, endoscopic, and histological markers.

 Pouchitis is defined as a score 7 and remission as a score 7 will receive honey enemas twice a day for one month.

 We chose a twice daily enema regimen, because patients with inflammatory bowel disease usually receive their enemas twice a day.

 We expect one month to be enough time, because the duration of antibiotic therapy for patients with acute pouchitis is about one month.

 Then, the PDAI score of these patients, before and after honey enema will be compared.

 To Determine the Effect of Honey Enema in the Treatment of Patients With Acute Pouchitis@highlight

Patients with a bowel condition called ulcerative colitis have bowel surgery in which a portion of their bowel is removed and the reconnected at the small bowel to the anus.

 Sometimes, after the surgery, this connection part, the pouch, would be inflamed in a condition called Acute Pouchitis.

 Physicians usually treat them by prescribing antibiotics; however, some patients do not respond and need additional surgery.

 In this study, we will test an alternative treatment for this complication by performing manuka honey enemas twice a day for 30 days.

 This is a pilot study and ten patients will undergo enema treatment.
