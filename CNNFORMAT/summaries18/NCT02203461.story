(secondQuint)Changes in Insulin Resistance in Healthy Volunteers on STRIBILD Medication.

 The measurement of insulin resistance will be performed in 30 HIV-negative healthy non-obese (BMI 18-25) male volunteers before and after 14 days (+/- 2 days) of treatment with STRIBILD(R) (treatment 1, n=10), as compared to TVD, LPV/r (treatment 2, n=10) and TVD, DRV/r (treatment 3, n=10).

 The volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of three groups.

 The measurement of insulin resistance, lipid and glucose metabolism will be performed; before and immediately after the treatment.

 Furthermore, the therapy compliance will be verified using the method of drug counting and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).
