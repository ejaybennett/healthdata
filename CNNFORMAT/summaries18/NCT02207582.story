(firstQuint)Prefrontal Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation in Patients With Depression.

 Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is a non-invasive electric stimulation technique of the brain which was shown to be superior effective in contrast to other electric stimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).

 These studies investigated mainly healthy controls and specific tasks.

 Only one case report is available for depression.

 Here we stimulate patients with depression with tRNS in a placebo-controlled two-arm design.

 Stimulation will be done as add-on to standard therapy.

 Electrodes will be applied over both dorsolateral prefrontal cortices which are standard target points of tDCS and also transcranial magnetic stimulation in depression.

 Prefrontal Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation in Patients With Depression@highlight

Transcranial random noise stimulation is used to stimulate the prefrontal cortices in patients with depression.

 It's a placebo-controlled two-arm study.
