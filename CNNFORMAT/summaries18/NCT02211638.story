(secondQuint)Candesartan Cilexetil Special Drug Use Surveillance Challenge - Quality Control.

 This special drug use surveillance was planned to gain an understanding of the actual use of candesartan cilexetil in the new anti-hypertensive treatment environment where angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination drugs have become commercially available.

 The surveillance will also investigate the background factors of patients continuing treatment with candesartan cilexetil and patients who switched from candesartan cilexetil to ARB combination drugs, as well as changes in parameters such as blood pressure.

 The usual adult dosage of Candesartan cilexetil is 4 to 8 mg, administered orally, once daily.

The dose may be increased up to 12 mg as necessary.

 However, treatment should be started at 2 mg once daily in patients with renal impairment and the dose may be increased up to 8 mg as necessary.
