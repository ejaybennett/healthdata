 Intervention to Bridge the Evidence-based Gap in Stroke Care Quality@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a multifaceted quality improvement intervention can improve the adherent rate of individual and composite of evidence-based performance measures for patients with acute ischemic stroke within the first 7 days of symptom onset and reduce the incidence of a new clinical vascular event, disability, and all-cause mortality at discharge and long term clinical outcome.
