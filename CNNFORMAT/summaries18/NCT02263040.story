(firstQuint)A Pilot Study to Assess the Immunogenicity and Reactogenicity of High Versus Standard Dose TIV.

 This is a prospective, randomized controlled, observer blind trial of HDTIV (Fluzone High Dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine) versus SDTIV (Fluzone, standard dose TIV) in 100 healthcare workers 18-64 years of age.

 Participants will receive, in a 1:1 ratio, one dose of either SDTIV or HDTIV containing the strains of influenza virus as recommended by the World Health Organization for the season of recruitment.

 All adverse events will be collected for 7 days following the injection, serious adverse events will be collected through day 21, and serum for antibody testing will be obtained on day 0 and day 21.

 The primary outcome will be seroconversion to each strain of vaccine included in the vaccine, as measured by change in HAI titer between day 0 to day 21.
