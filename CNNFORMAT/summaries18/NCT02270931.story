 The study objectives are described below: 1.

 Obtain serum and plasma specimens longitudinally collected from a minimum of 130 subjects diagnosed with breast cancer and are about to or are currently undergoing treatment and follow-up.

 Specimens will be used to evaluate CA 15-3 assays, currently under development, as an aid for monitoring recurrence or progressive disease.

 2.

 To store any remaining specimens for use in future cancer research and to evaluate as yet undetermined biomarkers for the development of IVDs, including additional CA 15-3 assays, for monitoring the course of disease and therapy in subjects diagnosed with breast cancer.
