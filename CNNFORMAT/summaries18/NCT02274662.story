(fifthQuint)Expanded Access Protocol Thymus Transplantation.

 The patients enrolled have a high likelihood of death if they do not receive a thymus transplant because of lack of thymus function.

 As there are many types of patients who may be enrolled, study results will not have statistical significance.

 The study objective is to make thymus transplantation available on an expanded access basis.

 Data will be collected on survival, naive T cell development, T cell chimerism, and transplant related toxicities, as well as any unexpected study related serious adverse events.

 Patients undergo thymus transplantation and may undergo allograft biopsy.

 Immune suppression may be given depending on the immune status and clinical condition.

 Protocol specified studies continue until approximately one year post-transplantation.

 Study participation lasts two years.

 Expanded Access Protocol Thymus Transplantation@highlight

The primary purpose is to provide access of thymus tissue transplantation to patients who have immunodeficiency, hematologic malignancies, or severe autoimmune disease related to poor thymic function.

 With no thymus function, bone marrow stem cells do not develop into T cells, which fight infection.

 Eligible participants undergo thymus transplantation and biopsy.

 Immune suppression may be given depending on the immune status and clinical condition of the participant.

 Immune function testing is continued for one year post-transplantation.
