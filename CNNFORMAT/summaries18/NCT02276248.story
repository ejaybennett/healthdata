(secondQuint)Radiotherapy Combined With GDP Chemotherapy in Stage I/II Extranodal Natural Killer/T-cell Lymphoma.

 Radiotherapy has been recognized as the definitive treatment of choice for stages I and II extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.

 The progression-free survival rate and overall survival rate of radiotherapy plus anthracycline-containing chemotherapy were comparable to that of radiotherapy alone.

 Our previous studies demonstrated the high responsiveness and safety of GDP (gemcitabine, cisplatin, dexamethasone) regimen in patients with extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.

 Therefore, we design this study to evaluate the safety and benefit of radiotherapy plus GDP regimen in extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.

This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy combined with GDP (gemcitabine, cisplatin, dexamethasone) chemotherapy in stage I/II extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma patients with unfavorable prognostic factors.
