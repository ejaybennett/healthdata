 Triple Combination Therapy of Choroidal Neovascularization in AMD, a Cost Effect and Efficient Therapeutic Treatment@highlight

We propose to undertake a retrospective review of approximately 200 patients with a diagnosis of exudative macular degeneration treated with triple combination therapy (Bevacizumab, Dexamethasone and Photo-dynamic therapy) during the years of 2006 to 2010 at The Retina Center and compare those results with an additional group of approximately 200 patients also treated with triple combination therapy and 20 mg of daily oral zeaxanthin.
