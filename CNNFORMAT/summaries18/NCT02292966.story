(fifthQuint)Impact of HCV Treatment on Neurocognitive Functions and Brain Metabolism.

 This study will evaluate the effect of DCV/ASV/BCV on neurocognitive functioning and brain metabolite concentrations in the frontal white matter and the basal ganglia in people with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection, through a comparison of baseline and post-treatment parameters.

 This is an open label single arm multi-centre study.

 All participants will each receive daclatasvir (30mg), asunaprevir (200mg) and beclabuvir (75mg) in a fixed-dose combination oral tablet for twice daily administration with food.

 Duration of treatment will be 12 weeks for all subjects followed by 24 weeks of observational follow-up.

 Impact of HCV Treatment on Neurocognitive Functions and Brain Metabolism@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine whether neurocognitive impairments experienced by patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be reversed by treating HCV, with a new combination of direct acting antiviral drugs (daclatasvir (DCV), asunaprevir (ASV) and beclabuvir (BCV)).

 The study will assess the effect of HCV on the central nervous system (CNS) by assessing neurocognitive function and brain injury prior to treatment, and comparing it to the end of treatment, and 4, 12 and 24 weeks after treatment.
