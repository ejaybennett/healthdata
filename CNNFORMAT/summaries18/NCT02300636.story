(fifthQuint)Resistive Co-contraction Training After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.

 Co-contraction trainings can enhance joint stability via improving proprioceptive ability and stimulates muscle activity after injury and/or surgery.

 The participants will be assigned to the different groups one month after surgery.

 They will receive 8-week-treatment.

 Isometric strength of quadriceps and hamstring muscles will be measured at first,third and sixth months after surgery.

 Concentric and eccentric strength of quadriceps and hamstring muscles will be measured only at sixth months after surgery.

 Resistive Co-contraction Training After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction@highlight

This study investigates different resistive co-contraction trainings effect on knee strength recovery after ACL reconstruction.

 Participants will be divided into three groups.

 Group 1 will receive standard ACL rehabilitation with 8 week co-contraction training in open kinetic chain position, Group 2 will receive standard ACL rehabilitation with 8 week co-contraction training in open kinetic chain position and Group 3 (control group) will only receive standard ACL rehabilitation.
