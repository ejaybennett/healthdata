(fifthQuint)D2C7 for Adult Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma.

 This is a Phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of D2C7-IT, when delivered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) following confirmatory diagnostic biopsy in recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade III and IV malignant glioma patients, and to determine what dose will be considered in a phase II trial.

 A two-stage continual reassessment method (CRM) design will be used to determine the MTD of D2C7-IT where the first stage involves dose escalation in successive patients until an initial DLT is observed.

 Cohorts of 2 patients will be accrued to this study within both stages of the trial.

 The first patient of each cohort will be observed through the completion of the D2C7-IT infusion, before additional patients in that cohort are treated.

 Once the optimal dose level of D2C7-IT is determined (dose escalation completed), a total of 27 recurrent patients with WHO grade IV malignant glioma patients will be treated at that dose level as a dose expansion cohort.

 Patients diagnosed with recurrent malignant glioma based on radiographic evidence may be enrolled onto the study prior to biopsy.

 Up to four intratumoral catheters will be placed in areas at greatest risk for infiltrating disease and in any solid-contrast-enhancing disease.

 Catheter placement will be based on the BrainLab software.

 If frozen section of the biopsy indicates a proven diagnosis of recurrent WHO Grade III or IV malignant glioma (diagnosis results are typically received within 24-48 hours following biopsy), the investigators will proceed with D2C7-IT infusion.

 If not, the catheters will be removed.

 Molecular genetic tests, such as, but not limited to, DNA sequencing, gene amplification, and gene expression, will be performed on the tissue obtained at biopsy.

 The goal of these molecular genetic tests is to identify genetic predictors of response or failure of response to treatment with D2C7-IT.

 A continuous intratumoral infusion of D2C7-IT will be administered in the Neurosciences Step down unit at Duke for 72 hours.

 Patients who are taking (and are stable on) less than or equal to 4 mg per day of dexamethasone (i.

e.

 low-dose corticosteroid) within the 2 weeks prior to admission for D2C7-IT infusion (i.

e.

 patients who meet the relevant eligibility criterion) may continue on this dose.

 Patients taking corticosteroids for other medical indications (e.

g.

, asthma or skin condition) will be advised to continue use of these medications.

 The patient will remain in the hospital during the entire infusion.

 At the completion of the infusion, the catheters will be removed within 6 hours and a CT scan will be obtained after the catheters are pulled.

 The patient will be observed in hospital for a minimum of another 6 hours.

 Following D2C7-IT infusion, subjects will be evaluated in clinic at 2 weeks for adverse events and followed at 4 and 8 weeks and every 8 weeks thereafter until 48 weeks.

 D2C7 for Adult Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma@highlight

This is a Phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of D2C7-IT (D2C7 Immunotoxin) when delivered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade III (dose escalation only) and IV (dose escalation and dose expansion) malignant glioma patients, and to determine what dose will be considered in a single-arm Phase II trial.

 Patients with recurrent WHO grade III (dose escalation only) and IV (dose escalation and dose expansion) malignant glioma who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study.

 Immediately following stereotactically-guided tumor biopsy, subjects will have catheters inserted.

 If the frozen section of the biopsy indicates a proven diagnosis of recurrent malignant glioma (diagnosis results are typically received within 24-48 hours following biopsy), the investigators will proceed with the D2C7-IT infusion.

 If not, the catheters will be removed.

 A continuous intratumoral infusion of D2C7-IT will be administered and the same total flow rate for all catheters will be set at 0.

5 ml/hour per catheter for 72 hours.
