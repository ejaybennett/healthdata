(firstQuint)Gabapentin for Headache in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.

 We plan to use gabapentin (GBP), an FDA approved non-narcotic pain medication for neuropathic pain, which is also an alpha-2-delta (A2DR) receptor analogue to reduce the pain and decrease the need for narcotics in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).

 GBP has been shown to decrease neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain in a variety of perioperative and postoperative conditions.

 A2DR affinity also has some neuroprotective effect in animal data.

 We plan to conduct a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial to further assess GBP-associated reductions in narcotic use and pain scores compared to the non-GBP (placebo) arm.

 To accomplish this aim, we plan to randomize 20 aSAH patients with headache to either GBP and standard of care pain treatment versus placebo and standard of care treatment.

The purpose of this study is to see how much gabapentin will reduce headaches associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and to reduce the amount of narcotic pain medication prescribed.
