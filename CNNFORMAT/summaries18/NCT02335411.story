(fifthQuint)A Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Participants With Recurrent or Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma (MK-3475-059/KEYNOTE-059).

 This study will have 3 cohorts.

 Cohorts 1 and 2 will run simultaneously; Cohort 3 will start when biomarker assay validation is complete.

 In Cohort 1, participants who have received at least two prior therapies for their advanced disease will receive monotherapy with pembrolizumab.

 In Cohort 2, participants who have not received any previous therapy for their disease will receive pembrolizumab in combination with cisplatin and 5-FU or (Japan only) capecitabine.

 In Cohort 3, participants who have not received any previous therapy and who have programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive tumors will receive pembrolizumab monotherapy.

 A Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Participants With Recurrent or Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma (MK-3475-059/KEYNOTE-059)@highlight

This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) for advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma; pembrolizumab will be given as monotherapy to participants who have had previous treatment or who are treatment-naive; pembrolizumab will also be evaluated as combination therapy with cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) or (Japan only) capecitabine in treatment-naive participants.

 The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab will provide a clinically meaningful Overall Response Rate (ORR).
