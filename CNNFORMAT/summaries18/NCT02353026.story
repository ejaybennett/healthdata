(fifthQuint)Phase I Study of Intravenous Artesunate for Solid Tumors.

 A rapid dose escalation design will be used, in which single patients will be enrolled to each dose level until a grade >/= 2 treatment-related toxicity occurs during cycle 1; enrollment then will proceed using a classic 3+ 3 dose escalation design.

 If the toxicity was grade 2, then enrollment will continue on that dose level.

 If the toxicity was grade 3 or 4, then enrollment will continue on one dose level below that dose.

 Dose escalation with the 3+3 design will continue until >/= 2 patients out of 6 experience a treatment-related dose-limiting toxicity.

 Then, the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose of intravenous artesunate will be one dose level below the level at which the toxicities occurred.

 Phase I Study of Intravenous Artesunate for Solid Tumors@highlight

This is a Phase One study to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of intravenous artesunate in patients with solid tumors.

 A rapid dose escalation design will be used, in which single patients will be enrolled to escalating dose levels until a grade 2 or higher toxicity occurs during cycle 1.

 Enrollment will then continue using 3 to 6 patients at each dose level until a dose is reached at which 2 or more patients out of 6 experience a treatment-related toxicity.
