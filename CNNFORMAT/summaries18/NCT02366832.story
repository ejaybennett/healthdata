(firstQuint)Cryoablation for Phantom Limb Pain.

 This study aims to treat Phantom Limb Syndrome (PLS) with cryoablation of the remaining nerve stumps.

 The rationale is that because the pain in PLS follows the known distribution of nerves, and because the amputated nerves are known to undergo changes after the surgery that may lead to excessive "firing," that interruption of the nerve impulses will reduce patient pain.
