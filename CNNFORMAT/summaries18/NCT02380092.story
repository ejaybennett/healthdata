(fifthQuint)Post Market Clinical Follow Up of LEGION Primary TKS With VERILAST.

 The LEGION cent Primary Total Knee System (TKS) is a comprehensive, state-of-the-art system that empowers surgeons to address diverse surgical challenges and provide personalized joint care.

 The LEGION cent Primary TKS implant designs were built on the legacy of the GENESIS cent II TKS.

 For more than 15 years and in more than 30 countries, the GENESIS cent II TKS has achieved outstanding clinical outcomes.

 As CE-mark and 510k approval for the LEGION cent Primary TKS has been obtained, it is being used in clinical practice in several countries including Europe and the US but clinical studies need to be carried out in order to confirm its safety and efficacy and in order to conform to the medical device directives (MEDDEV.

 This study is therefore a post-market study to evaluate the short-, mid- and long-term safety and effectiveness of the LEGION cent Primary TKS with VERILAST cent bearing surface (the combination of an OXINIUM cent femoral component with highly cross-linked polyethylene tibial base plate inserts).

 The clinical outcome from a large cohort of subjects who are treated with the LEGION cent Primary TKS as part of their standard of care will be documented.

 The study is designed to reflect standard clinical practice as closely as possible because it allows the results of such a study to represent the true clinical outcome that would be achieved in clinical practice, up to a maximum.

 Only subjects who will be treated with the LEGION cent Primary TKS as part of their normally planned care will screened for participation in this study.
