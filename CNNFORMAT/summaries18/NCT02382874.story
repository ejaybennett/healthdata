(fifthQuint)Allogenic AD-MSC Transplantation in Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis).

 Primary FSGS thought to be a part of the immune-mediated disease.

 Main challenge is to decrease protein excretion in urine.

 Only 30% of children with FSGS achieve complete remission with steroids and other 30-40% patients experience remission (partial and complete) with cytotoxic immunosuppressant drugs.

 Even with these treatments, many patients eventually still require dialysis.

 Other treatment strategy doesn't exceed beyond symptomatic treatment and delaying the progression.

 Also risk of recurrence after kidney transplantation is 20-50%.

 Cell therapy is one of the treatment strategies and mesenchymal stromal/stem cell is one modality that notice in glomerulus disease.

 We will evaluate safety and efficacy of intravenous injection of allogeneic AD-MSC (adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cell) in 5 refractory INS patients.

They will be followed 1, 2, 4 weeks and then monthly until a year following injection day.

 Allogenic AD-MSC Transplantation in Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis)@highlight

Idiopathic Focal Segmental Glumero Sclerosis (FSGS) is not very common but important manifestation of kidney disease.

 FSGS has poor prognosis among the patterns of Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome (INS).

 Even with treatment (Steroid therapy and cytotoxic immunosuppressant therapy), many patients eventually still require dialysis.

 Cell therapy is useful in treatment of INS and mesenchymal stromal/stem cell is one of the cells that useful in the treatment of glomerulus disease.

 Intravenous injection of allogeneic adipose derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cell will be done in 5 patients with refractory INS(FSGS).

 They will be followed 1, 2, 4 weeks and then monthly until a year following injection day.
