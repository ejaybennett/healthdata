(thirdQuint)Post-Market Study to Assess Outcomes of Patients Treated With AFX System Compared to Other EVAR Devices.

 This study is a prospective, randomized, multi-center study, intended to evaluate the outcomes of contemporary EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair) in a real world population.

 The study is designed to compare the anatomically stabilized AFX Endograft System to a reference group of proximally fixated EVAR devices.

 Patients will be randomized between the two groups.

 Randomization will be 1:1.

 Each investigator will select one comparator device of their choice before enrolling the first patient.

 The study will sequentially evaluate non-inferiority and superiority hypotheses.

 Up to 80 sites with experience in EVAR and up to 800 subjects will participate in this study.

 Post-Market Study to Assess Outcomes of Patients Treated With AFX System Compared to Other EVAR Devices@highlight

The objective of this post-market study is to evaluate Endologix AFX endovascular AAA system with anatomical fixation against other approved Endovascular systems with proximal fixation.

 Multiple U.

S clinical centers will be involved in the study to include a broad range of experience.

 Imaging data will be evaluated by an independent core lab.
