(thirdQuint)A Trial Assessing Peri-procedure Chemoprophylaxis During Transrectal Prostate Needle Biopsy.

 Introduction Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy is the standard procedure for the histological diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer that consequently help in providing the appropriate line of treatment.

 Risks of infectious complications post TRUS-guided biopsy have increased in the last years.

 In their study, a total of 5798 TRUS-guided biopsies performed between 2002 and 2011.

 Increased incidence of infectious complications is noted from 0.

52 infections per 100 biopsies between 2002 and 2009 to 2.

15 infections per 100 biopsies between 2010 and 2011 (PC or more, heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of more than 20 per minute or arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) less than 32mm Hg and abnormal white blood cell count (>12,000/ mu L or mu L) Aim of the work; The aim of the study is to evaluate whether changing antibiotic prophylaxis from fluoroquinolones alone to fluoroquinolones plus gentamicin 160mg single IM dose or targeted antibiotic prophylaxis according to rectal swab culture would influence infectious complication rates in those men undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.
