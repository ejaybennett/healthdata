(fifthQuint)Bereaved Parent Study.

 Participants who consent will engage with the principal investigator in a one-time voice-recorded interview consisting of demographic and open-ended questions.

 Participants can choose to conduct the interview face-to-face or over-the-phone.

 Completion of the interview is expected to take between 60-90 minutes.

 Validation focus groups are expected to take between 60-90 minutes, as well.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: - To conduct qualitative interviews in order to understand what helps and what hinders bereavement processes among St.

 Jude parents, with particular attention to how relationships with St.

 Jude professional care staff affect parental bereavement processes.

 Focus groups will provide additional groups of bereaved parents with an opportunity to validate initial findings and/or suggest additional avenues of inquiry to expand our understanding of the grief/bereavement experience, and gain provider insight into how these findings should be used to improve the training of hematology/oncology Fellows.

 Bereaved Parent Study@highlight

Recent focus groups at St.

 Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) revealed several limitations in our understanding of how parents' relationships with care staff help and hinder their grief experience.

 Additionally, there is a gap in the bereavement literature regarding the psychological effects professional caregiver relationships have on parents whose children died of cancer.

 To bolster our knowledge base and benefit Bereavement Care Services at SJCRH, as well as benefit other professionals by filling the gap in the literature, we have designed a qualitative study that will conduct individual interviews with bereaved parents whose children died at SJCRH.

 Validation of the preliminary analyses of the initial 30 interviews will occur through new focus groups involving two separate sets of bereaved parents who will validate the findings and/or suggest additional avenues of inquiry needed to gain a more complete understanding of parental grief/bereavement experience.

 Additionally, focus groups with hematology/oncology fellows will obtain provider feedback on the value of these findings in their training and future role as physicians.
