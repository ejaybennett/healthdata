(thirdQuint)Nifedipine or Nifedipine Plus Indomethacin for Treatment of Acute Preterm Labor.

 The investigators current treatment for preterm labor has not been shown to be effective in prolonging pregnancy sufficiently to improve neonatal outcomes and other treatment strategies are needed.

 Multiple examples demonstrate that multi-agent treatments are routine clinical practice in other fields of medicine including chemotherapeutics for cancer, multi-therapeutics for myocardial infarction and broad spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia.

 At this time, it is unclear if a combination of tocolytic medications for preterm labor is more advantageous for women.

 If pregnancy is prolonged with combined tocolytic therapy, this could directly influence the treatment of preterm labor and potentially improve neonatal outcomes.

 There currently are no trials of combination regimens using widely used tocolytic agents, such as nifedipine and indomethacin.

 Thus, we propose a comparative effective trial of nifedipine plus indomethacin vs.

 nifedipine alone for the treatment of preterm labor.

Tocolytic agents are used for the treatment of preterm labor.

 It is unclear whether combination treatments of two tocolytic agents are more effective in stopping preterm labor compared to one.

 Therefore, the investigators propose a comparative effective trial of nifedipine plus indomethacin vs.

 nifedipine alone for the treatment of preterm labor
