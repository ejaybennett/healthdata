(thirdQuint)Retinoic Acid Homeostasis in Neuropsychiatric Diseases.

 Retinoids comprise of a group of small-molecule derivatives of Vitamin A with retinoic acid (RA) representing the biologically most active endogenous form.

 RA has multiple functions central nervous system (CNS).

 It is hypothesized, that local RA homeostasis is functionally involved in the pathophysiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases.

 In a cross-sectional (and partly longitudinal) analysis, serum RA status will be assessed in healthy controls and subjects with Major Depression, Alzheimer's disease, alcoholism and in subjects with schizophrenia.
