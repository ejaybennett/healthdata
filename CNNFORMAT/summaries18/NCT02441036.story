(secondQuint)Gene Expression Following Ultherapy Treatment.

 This is a prospective, multi-center, pilot clinical trial to evaluate the molecular changes following an Ultherapy(R) treatment.

 Subjects will be randomized to one of five treatment groups and, based on study group assignment, will receive one single-side Ultherapy(R) treatment at varying timepoints prior to an already planned facelift procedure.

 Treatment will be delivered to the pre-auricular region on one side of the face; the contralateral side will serve as control.

 During an already planned facelift procedure, treated and non-treated resected tissue will be obtained for analysis.
