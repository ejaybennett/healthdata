(firstQuint)The SNORES Randomized Clinical Trial.

 The investigators' goal is to perform a randomized clinical trial among women with PCOS who present for infertility treatment.

 Our primary outcome is to determine if screening women with PCOS, and treating those with confirmed sleep apnea, will lead to more ovulatory cycles.

 Our sub-aims are to describe the rate of OSA and sleep symptoms in patients with PCOS, to see if current sleep questionnaires correlate to a diagnostic sleep study, to describe the correlation between OSA and biomarkers of glucose homeostasis in women with PCOS, to investigate health related quality of life between the groups, to compare perinatal outcomes between the groups, and to evaluate the composition of breastmilk among women who choose to breastfeed.
