(fifthQuint)MK-3475 and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you join this study.

 Up to 24 participants will be enrolled in Phase 1 of the study, and up to 80 participants will be enrolled in Phase 2.

 Phase 1: If you are enrolled in Phase 1, the dose of pembrolizumab you receive will depend on when you join this study.

 The first set of participants will receive the lowest dose level of pembrolizumab.

 Each new set will receive a higher dose of pembrolizumab than the set before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.

 This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of pembrolizumab is found.

 In addition to pembrolizumab, you will receive either SBRT or conventional radiation therapy, depending on what type of radiation therapy the doctor thinks will be better for you.

 Phase 2: If you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will receive pembrolizumab at the highest dose that was tolerated in Phase 1.

 Your radiation therapy assignment will be decided based on what treatment your doctor thinks would be better for you: If the doctor thinks SBRT would be better for you, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to either Group 1 or Group 2: - If you are in Group 1, you will receive SBRT and pembrolizumab.

 - If you are in Group 2, you will receive pembrolizumab alone.

 However, if the disease has gotten worse after 5 weeks or possibly later, you may be able to also start receiving SBRT.

 If your doctor thinks it would be safer, you may cross over to Group 4 (described below) and receive conventional radiation therapy instead of SBRT.

 If the doctor thinks conventional radiation therapy would be better for you, you will be randomly assigned to either Group 3 or Group 4: - If you are in Group 3, you will receive conventional radiation therapy and pembrolizumab.

 - If you are in Group 4, you will receive pembrolizumab alone.

 However, if the disease has gotten worse after 5 weeks or possibly later, you may be able to continue receiving pembrolizumab and start receiving conventional radiation therapy.

 These treatments are randomly assigned because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

 You will have an equal chance of being in either group.

 Some participants will also be assigned to Group 5 and will have their radiation treatment details decided by the treating doctor.

 If you are in Group 5, you will receive pembrolizumab along with SBRT or conventional radiation therapy to one or more tumors and low dose radiation to others.

 Study Therapy Administration: You will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle.

 Radiation will consist of either 4 or 15 daily treatments lasting about 30-45 minutes each day while you stay in the same position.

 Depending on what group you are in and the status of the disease, you will either start radiation on the same day as your first pembrolizumab dose, or if the disease has gotten worse.

 The doctor will discuss the radiation therapy schedule with you.

 Study Visits: On Day 1 of each cycle: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

 One (1) day before the start of Cycles 3, 5, 8, 11, and 14, you will have a CT, PET, MRI, x-ray, and/or ultrasound scan.

 Leftover tumor tissue from an earlier procedure will be used for biomarker testing.

 Biomarkers are found in the blood and tissue and may be related to your reaction to the study treatment.

 Length of Study: You may receive up to 16 cycles of pembrolizumab.

 You will receive up to 15 radiation treatments, depending on what group you are in.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drug if intolerable side effects occur or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 If the disease has gotten worse, you may be able to continue study therapy, as described above.

 Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

 Follow-Up Visits: About 30 days after your last dose of pembrolizumab: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 1/2 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - You will have a CT, PET, MRI, x-ray, and/or ultrasound scan.

 - You may have lung function tests performed.

 About every 12 weeks for 2 years after you finish your last pembrolizumab cycle, the following tests and procedures may be performed.

 Instead of any of these follow-up visits, it is possible the study staff may call you instead and ask how you are doing.

 - You may have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) may be collected for routine tests.

 - You may have a CT, PET, MRI, x-ray and/or ultrasound scan.

 Starting 2 years after you finish your last pembrolizumab cycle, you will have a physical exam and/or a CT, PET, MRI, x-ray, and/or ultrasound scan every 12 weeks if your doctor thinks it is needed.

 If you have these procedures performed at another hospital, information about your medical history, physical exam, lung function, and scans will be sent to MD Anderson for review.

 MK-3475 and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)@highlight

The goal of Phase 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the combination of Keytruda (pembrolizumab, also called MK-3475) and radiation therapy (either conventional or stereotactic body radiation therapy [SBRT]).

 The safety of this combination will also be studied.

 The goal of Phase 2 of this study is to learn if this combination therapy can help to control metastatic NSCLC.

 This is an investigational study.

 Radiation therapy (both conventional and SBRT) is FDA approved for the local control of metastatic and primary tumors.

 Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of melanoma that is metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery.

 Its use in patients with metastatic NSCLC is investigational.

 Up to 104 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
