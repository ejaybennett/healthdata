(secondQuint)Comparison of Exenatide vs.

 Biphasic Insulin Aspart 30 on Glucose Variability in Type 2 Diabetes.

 Studies have showed that fluctuations of glucose seem to have more deleterious effects than sustained hyperglycaemia in the development of diabetic complications.

 The present randomized controlled trial was designed with primary aim to evaluate glycaemic fluctuation in the comparison between twice-daily Exenatide and other treatment paradigm (e.

g.

 insulin Aspart 30).

 Comparison of Exenatide vs.

 Biphasic Insulin Aspart 30 on Glucose Variability in Type 2 Diabetes@highlight

This is a multi-centre, open-label, randomized, parallel trial to compare the effect of Exenatide versus Biphasic insulin Aspart 30 on glucose variability and inflammatory markers in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.
