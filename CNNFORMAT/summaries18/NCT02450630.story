(fifthQuint)Assessing the Effect of Strengthening Referral of Sick Children From the Private Health Sector and Its Impact on Referral Uptake in Uganda.

.

 Research Questions/Goals and Specific Objectives: Research question: The study aims to answer the question whether integrated intervention of VHT registration of children (registration of children will enable follow up by VHTs), community sensitization and regular meetings between the public and private providers on referral of sick children targeting women and men is cost-effective and can improve uptake of referral advice.

 Goal: The goal of the study is to assess the effect of a strengthened referral system from the private sector on uptake of referral advice and its cost-effectiveness.

 The project addresses poor referral of children as one of the challenges in the reduction of under-five mortality in Uganda.

 Primary objective: 1.

 To asses the effect of strengthening the referral system on uptake of referral of sick children who seek care in the private sector.

 Secondary objectives 1.

 To explore factors which influence the referral or non-referral of sick children from the private sector.

 2.

 To assess the cost effectiveness of uptake of referral of sick children who seek care in the private sector.

 Uganda's under-five mortality is high, currently estimated at 90/1000 live births (UDHS, 2011) Poor referral of sick children that seek care from the private sector is one of the contributory factors.

 Previous studies in Uganda and elsewhere have found out that referral of sick children to higher levels of care is poor (Oryema, 2009, Achan et al 2011; Font et al 2002, Kallander et al 2006 ), In Uganda several studies have estimated referral of children to be as low as 8% (Kallander et al 2006) to 28% (Peterson et al 2004).

 Several factors have been attributed to the poor referral like long distances to health facilities, high costs involved in referral, poor attitudes of health workers, lack of drugs at health facilities and lack of involvement of fathers in the referral process (Mbonye 2003, Font et al 2002).

 A study in Uganda found that of the 70% of patients who sought treatment at private clinics within 1 week of onset of symptoms only 7% were properly managed (treated according to National Guidelines).

 The study concluded that at private facilities possible strategies include training and social marketing of prepackaged treatment for STDs (Jacobs et al 2004).

 In Tanzania, it has been found that in urban private-sector clinics, flexible clinics hours, prompt services, and efforts to improve respect, privacy and confidentiality may prove more helpful in increasing visit adherence (Miller et al 2014).

 The proposed intervention aims to improve referral and uptake of referral advice of children that seek care from private facilities by addressing constraints to the referral of children.

 The private sector providers participating in this project will include private clinics and registered drug shops.

 A recently concluded trial has shown that staff in drug shops were mainly female, of whom over 50% were qualified health workers (state enrolled nurse or above).

 The majority of drug shop vendors had received no prior training on malaria case management, and had little knowledge at baseline of ACT as the first-line anti-malarial drug, or what an mRDT was used for (Mbonye et al.

 submitted, 2014).

 The project will be implemented in Mukono District, Central Uganda.

 There is a high prevalence of diarrhea (22.

3%), acute respiratory tract infection (12%) and fever (42%) among children aged cent The proportion of sick children referred from the private sector that completes the referral process (seen at higher health facilities).

 Co-primary outcomes: - Appropriate case management for malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea among children in the private sector.

 - The cost-effectiveness of timely and uptake of referral of sick children.

 Secondary outcomes: - The proportion of sick children seeking care at private outlets within 24 hours of onset of symptoms - The time between consultations at private outlets and uptake of referral at health facilities (referral facilities) - The proportion of sick children receiving prompt appropriate treatment from a private sector outlet.

 - Factors which influence the referral or non-referral of sick children from the private sector.

 All private outlets in both arms will be trained to record data on sick children aged less than 5years who seek care at private outlets: 1.

 Demographic (age, sex, relationship to caretaker, marital status of caretaker, education levels, rural/urban residence) 2.

 Social-economic data (household income, ownership of household items that determine expenditure and consumption levels, address and telephone contacts of caretakers)); 3.

 Type of illnesses, treatment given, prescription of drugs, referral advice, children referred and where referred.

 These data will be captured in patient registers and treatment forms distributed in the intervention and control clusters.

 Assessing the Effect of Strengthening Referral of Sick Children From the Private Health Sector and Its Impact on Referral Uptake in Uganda.

@highlight

Uganda's under-five mortality is high, currently estimated at 90/1000 live births (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2011).

 Poor referral of sick children that seek care from the private sector is one of the contributory factors.

 The proposed intervention aims to improve uptake of referral advice for children that seek care from private facilities (registered drug shops/private clinics).

 The project will be implemented in Mukono district, central Uganda selected because a recent concluded trial in the district showed that drug shop vendors (DSVs) adhere to diagnostic test results, treat appropriately and refer sick children; although uptake of referral is poor.

 The main reasons attributed to the observed poor referral were negative attitude towards referral forms from drugs shops by the health workers at referral facilities,perceptions of poor quality of care at referral facilities and costs involved (Hutchinson.

 2012; Hutchinson et al.

 2013 in press).

.

 Thus the proposed project is a follow up to address these factors with the aim to improve uptake of referral.

 This project is in line with the Uganda's Health sector and USAID Mission's health priorities of strengthening the health system.

 Critical barriers in the implementation of child survival interventions are poor quality of care in the private sector and timely referral and uptake of referral advice at community level.

 These barriers may be attributed to inadequate training of providers in the private sector (in diagnosis and management of childhood illnesses); inadequate supervision and regulation; poor linkages and collaboration between the public and private sectors; and non-existent linkages between community structures and the private sector.

 The barriers will be addressed through an intervention with three components; i) VHTs will be trained to do community sensitization and initiate community discussions aimed at identifying community support mechanisms for financial hardship (to be community led and managed) - e.

g.

 communities to be encouraged to establish community credit/insurance schemes for referral VHTs will register children and facilitate follow up of sick children ii) supervision of providers in the private sector to diagnose, treat and refer sick children, iii) regular meetings between the public and private providers (convened by the district health team) to discuss the referral system.
