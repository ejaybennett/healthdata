 This study will investigate whether adding an electronic adherence monitor to inhaled steroids, and feeding this information back to patients and families can improve adherence and outcomes in childhood asthma.

 The devices will also sound twice daily reminder alarms to act as direct medication prompts.

 This intervention will be compared to a control group in which adherence is monitored, but with no feedback or alarms.
