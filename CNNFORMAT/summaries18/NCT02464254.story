(secondQuint)Intervention to Support Participation in Regular Exercise in the Elderly (INSPIRE).

 Older adults with multiple chronic diseases are at high risk for both disability and adverse clinical events, outcomes that can be improved with physical activity, but there have been no trials to establish physical activity recommendations or clinical guidelines for this vulnerable population.

 A recent randomized controlled trial conducted by Dr.

 Peterson established the efficacy of inducing positive affect-a feeling of happiness and well-being-in motivating physical activity in older adults with cardiovascular disease.

 This new randomized controlled trial will pilot test the a new PAIRE (Positive Affect Induction for Regular Exercise) intervention that is specific to older adults with multiple high-risk chronic illnesses versus an educational control group.

 This work is innovative because it will translate the benefits of a proven intervention focused on positive affect to increase physical activity in older adults with multiple high-risk chronic illnesses, one that is tailored to the clinical and psychosocial challenges of this particularly vulnerable population.

 This work is significant because an effective intervention promoting physical activity will improve outcomes for older adults with multiple high-risk chronic diseases, and currently one does not exist.

The investigators will conduct a 1-year prospective and randomized study to evaluate the initial efficacy of positive affect vs.

 an educational control to motivate physical activity in older adults with high burdens of chronic disease.
