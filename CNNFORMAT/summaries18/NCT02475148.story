(fifthQuint)A Study to Investigate Safety and Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Food Effect of JNJ-54175446 in Healthy Participants.

 This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, single ascending dose study in healthy participants for JNJ-54175446.

 The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase (between 21 and 2 days prior to dose administration), a double-blind treatment phase (8 days; Part 1 and Part 3) or an open-label treatment phase (8 days; Part 2), and a follow-up examination (within 14 to 21 days after dose administration).

 The maximal study duration for a participant will not exceed 6 weeks.

 In each cohort of Part 1 (6 cohorts) and Part 3 (1 cohort), participants will be randomly assigned to receive JNJ-54175446 or matching placebo and in cohort of part 2, all participants will be assigned to JNJ-54175446 treatment.

 In part 1, primarily maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be assessed, along with safety and tolerability of JNJ-54175446.

 In part 2, pharmacokinetics (PK) of JNJ-54175446 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be assessed.

 In part 3, the effect of food on the plasma PK of JNJ-54175446 in young healthy male participants will be assessed.

 Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

 A Study to Investigate Safety and Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Food Effect of JNJ-54175446 in Healthy Participants@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of JNJ-54175446 versus placebo after single oral dose administration (ascending dose levels), to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) or the safety and tolerability at exposures resulting in full target engagement for at least 24 hours in all participants (whichever comes first), to characterize the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-54175446 in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine and to investigate the effect of food (high fat/high calorie) on the pharmacokinetics of JNJ 54175446 after single oral dose administration.
