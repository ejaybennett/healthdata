(secondQuint)Strategies to Reduce Injuries and Develop Confidence in Elders.

 Objective: To determine the effectiveness of an evidence-based, patient-centered multifactorial fall injury prevention strategy implemented within primary care practices using usual health care resources Design: This study is a cluster randomized, parallel group superiority trial with practices stratified by healthcare system and patients nested within practices.

 The unit of randomization is the practice.

 Study Duration: The total study duration is 4 years.

 Recruitment will take place over 20 months, with follow-up taking place for 20 months - 40 months depending on date of enrollment.

 Trial Sites : 86 primary care practices that are part of 10 trial sites located around the U.

S.

: The Partners' Health Care System; Essentia; Hopkins Health Care System; HealthCare Partners; Reliant Health Care System; Mount Sinai Health Care System; University of Pittsburgh Health Care System; University of Texas Medical Branch Health Care System; University of Iowa Health Care System; University of Michigan Health Care System.

 Number of Subjects: The original target sample size was 6,000 participants enrolled in 86 practices to provide 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the rate of the primary outcome with intervention relative to control.

 The study was originally designed for a study duration of 36 months with 18 months of recruitment and a minimum of 18 months of follow-up.

 The study was extended to a 40 month study (20 months of recruitment and a minimum 20 month of follow-up).

 For a 40 month trial, it was estimated that a sample size of ~5400 subjects would provide 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the rate of the primary outcome with the intervention relative to control.

 Main Inclusion Criteria Community-living persons, 70 years or older, who are at increased risk for serious fall injuries.

 Intervention: An evidence-based patient-centered intervention that will combine elements of a multifactorial, risk factor-based, standardly-tailored fall prevention strategy developed at Yale, practice guidelines offered by the Center for Disease Control's (CDC's) "STEADI" toolbox (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Disability and Injury) and the joint American Geriatrics Society/British Geriatrics Society guidelines, and Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders (ACOVE) practice change approach.

 The fall prevention strategies will be systematically implemented into clinical practice using: delivery system design to improve quality (Co-management); decision support (algorithms); information systems (software); self-management support (patient/caregiver engagement and activation); and linkage to community-based resources.

 Primary Outcome: The primary outcome is serious fall-related injuries, operationalized as those leading to medical attention, including non-vertebral fractures, joint dislocation, head injury, lacerations, and other major sequelae (e.

g.

 rhabdomyolysis, internal injuries).

 Primary Analysis: The risk of any serious fall injury (i.

e.

, time to first event) will be analyzed using a survival model that incorporates competing risks (due to death) and clustering.

 In this analysis, participants who are lost to follow-up without a prior serious fall-related injury will be censored at their date last seen.

 In a secondary analysis, the investigators will adjust for the pre-specified set of baseline covariates to examine their influence on the intervention effect.

 Secondary Outcomes: Number of falls, number of all fall-related injuries, and measures of well-being.

 Strategies to Reduce Injuries and Develop Confidence in Elders@highlight

The aim of this pragmatic cluster-randomized trial is to determine the effectiveness of an evidence-based, patient-centered multifactorial fall injury prevention strategy in community dwelling older adults at risk of falls recruited from 86 primary care practices around the U.
