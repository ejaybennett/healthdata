(secondQuint)Safety, Tolerance, PK, and Anti-tumour Activity of AZD1775 Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours.

 This study is being conducted in two parts, designated Parts A and B.

 Part A is a safety lead-in consisting of a cohort of approximately 12 patients with advanced solid tumours.

 Part B expansion cohorts will investigate AZD1775 monotherapy in advanced tumour types with molecular biomarkers of interest.

 The tumour types to be evaluated are: 1) ovarian cancer (BRCA1/2 mutation [PARP-failures]), 2) ovarian cancer (BRCA wild-type) with more than three prior lines of treatment, 3) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and 4) small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).
