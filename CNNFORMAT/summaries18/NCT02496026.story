(secondQuint)Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Robotic Therapy in Upper Limb Motor Recovery After Stroke.

 As for transcranial direct current stimulation a HDC kit (ATES/EB NEURO, Firenze, Italy) will be used as device.

 It is a new device generation of stimulator able to provide an effective stimulation pattern.

 As robotic device the InMotion wrist robot (Interactive Motion Technologies Inc.

, Watertown, MA, USA) will be used.

 It is an end-effector robotic device able to assist as needed the wrist movements.

The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) integrated with wrist robot-assisted treatment.

 In detail, the anodal stimulation on the impaired hemisphere will be used associated with a robotic treatment.
