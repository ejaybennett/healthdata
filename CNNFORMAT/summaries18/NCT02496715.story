(thirdQuint)Randomized, Placebo-controlled Study Comparing Efficacy of Fluticasone/Salmeterol Combination to Advair in Asthmatics.

 This pivotal trial will examine therapeutic equivalence of a new generic fixed-dose combination product containing fluticasone propionate 100 mcg / salmeterol 50 mcg (as xinafoate salt) and reference listed drug (RLD) Advair(R) Diskus 100/50 in adult patients with chronic but stable asthma as defined in National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 (NAEPP 3) guidelines [2].

 To ensure adequate study sensitivity the test and reference products should both be statistically superior to placebo (p<0.

05) with regard to the BE study primary endpoints.

 A secondary study objective is the safety and tolerability of the test compound.
