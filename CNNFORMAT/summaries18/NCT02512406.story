(fifthQuint)Sensory Processing in Tourette Syndrome.

 While it is widely recognized that patients with tic and Tourette Syndrome (TS) experience heightened sensitivity to or abnormal processing of internal sensations, it has also been suggested that patients with tic and TS experience abnormal processing of external sensations/stimuli.

 While this sensitivity to external stimuli does not appear to trigger motor or vocal tics, it can significantly affect quality of life.

 These sensitivities can be a source of irritation, discomfort, and distraction that can be equally or more disruptive than vocal or motor tics.

 Heightened sensitivity to external stimuli or other abnormalities of external sensory processing have been identified in other neuropsychological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, ADHD, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) .

 TS often presents with co-morbid diagnoses including attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) but it is not currently known whether sensitivity to external stimuli is due to a central processing abnormality common to these disorders.

 This study's objective is to use a variety of questionnaires to determine how external stimuli along with the presence of other disorders effect sensory processing.

 Sensory Processing in Tourette Syndrome@highlight

The purpose of this study is to learn more about how patients with Tourette Syndrome deal with sensory stimuli in their environment such as bright lights, loud noises, physical sensations such as shirt tags, etcetera.

 We will compare responses of patients with Tourette Syndrome to those without Tourette Syndrome.

 The study aims to better characterize sensory processing abnormalities by sensory modality: The investigators will use a measuring tool based on Dunn's 1997 model of sensory processing, the Sensory Profile, which will allow the investigator to characterize both registration and response to external stimuli, as well as to delineate which sensory modalities are affected.

 Identifying which sensory modalities are most affected may guide future research into the pathophysiology of sensory processing abnormalities in TS.

 The investigators also aim to correlate sensory processing abnormalities with the presence of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) , and autism spectrum disorders.
