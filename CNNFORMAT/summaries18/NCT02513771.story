(fifthQuint)Sitagliptin for Reducing Inflammation and Immune Activation.

 ACTG A5346 is a phase II, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, trial of sitagliptin 100 mg vs.

 placebo for 16 weeks followed by a 4-week post-intervention follow-up.

 A5346 studied whether sitagliptin reduced plasma concentrations of sCD14 in HIV-infected men and women 18 years of age who were on suppressive ART with HIV-1 RNA below the limit of quantification at screening and for at least the prior 48 weeks.

 Participants were randomized 1:1 to Sitagliptin arm vs.

 Placebo arm, and were stratified by screening CD4 count (100-350 vs.

 >350 cells/mm^3) and statin use (on statins vs.

 not on statins).

 Sitagliptin for Reducing Inflammation and Immune Activation@highlight

The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether sitagliptin (Januvia is the brand name for sitagliptin) reduces inflammation and immune activation markers in HIV-infected men and women when compared to a placebo (inactive medication like a dummy pill).

 The study evaluated whether taking 100 mg of sitagliptin by mouth daily for 16 weeks is safe and effective for HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral therapy (ART) who do not have diabetes.

 Sitagliptin is a medication that is used to treat people with diabetes (high blood sugar) but also may reduce inflammation in the body.
