(fifthQuint)Permissive Hypercapnia During One Lung Ventilation: Impact on Right Ventricular Systolic and Diastolic Functions During Lung Resection.

 Investigators studied 15 patients scheduled for elective pulmonary resection through thoracotomy.

 Patients had a standardized management for thoracotomies.

 Initial VT 10ml/ kg was reduced to 8ml/kg after OLV and the rate adjusted to maintain PaCO2 30-35 mm Hg.

 Haemodynamic, respiratory variables and echocardiographic data (Tei index and TAPSE) were obtained at: T1, 15 min post establishing OLV with normocapnia, T2, 15 min post establishing OLV with hypercapnia (PaCO2 7.

98kPa (60mmHg) and 9.

31kPa (70mmHg) and pH >7.

1), and T3, 15 min after resuming OLV with normocapnia.

 One-way repeated measures ANOVA, with post hoc Dunnet1/4s test were used for analysis.

 A P value < 0.

05 is considered statistically significant.

 Permissive Hypercapnia During One Lung Ventilation: Impact on Right Ventricular Systolic and Diastolic Functions During Lung Resection@highlight

Investigators studied 15 patients scheduled for pulmonary resection through thoracotomy.

 Initial tidal volume (VT) 10ml kg-1 was reduced to 8ml kg-1 after one lung ventilation (OLV) and the rate adjusted to maintain partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 30-35 mm Hg.

 Data were obtained at: T1, 15 min post establishing OLV with normocapnia, T2, 15 min post establishing OLV with hypercapnia (PaCO2 7.
