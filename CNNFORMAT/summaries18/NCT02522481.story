(secondQuint)Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of Lumason/SonoVue in Subjects Undergoing Pharmacologic Stress BR1-141.

 The study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Lumason at improving the visualization of the LV EBD during pharmacologic stress echocardiography examinations and for detection of exclusion of the CAD.

 The study population consists of adult subjects referred for pharmacological stress echocardiography and with suboptimal image quality during unenhanced ultrasound imaging at rest who have known or suspected CAD.

 Subjects to be enrolled in the study are representative of subjects who could benefit most from CEUS stress echocardiography.

 Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of Lumason/SonoVue in Subjects Undergoing Pharmacologic Stress BR1-141@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of Lumason-enhanced dobutamine stress echo (DSE) in subjects having a suboptimal left ventricular endocardial border delineation (LV EBD) at rest and who are scheduled for coronary angiography.
