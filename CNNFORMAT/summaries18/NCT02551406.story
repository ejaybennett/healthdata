(secondQuint)Prognostic Value of Residual Hypoventilation in Mechanically Ventilated Neuromuscular Patients.

 Home mechanical ventilation (HMV) is used to treat hypoventilation, and its efficacy is mostly assessed by daytime blood gases and nocturnal oxymetry (SpO2).

 Transcutaneous CO2 measure (TcCO2) has shown higher sensitivity than SpO2 to detect hypoventilation in neuromuscular diseases (NMD) patients.

 No data exist on the prognostic value of these techniques to monitor mechanical ventilated NMD patients.

 Basing on retrospective data review, investigators aimed to compare the prognostic value of the data obtained using different tools to assess residual hypoventilation in the cohort of ventilated NMD patients followed at our reference center.

Different tools may be used to monitor the efficacy of home mechanical ventilation.

 Investigators aimed to compare the prognostic value of the different data obtained by capno-oxymetry in a mechanical ventilated neuromuscular disease's population.
