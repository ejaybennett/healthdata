(firstQuint)Effect of Dexmedetomidine Combined With Sufentanil for Postoperative Intravenous Analgesia in Neurosurgery.

 Sufentanil is a classical drug for postoperative analgesia.

 Dexmedetomidine is a commonly used 2-adrenergic receptor, and it helps provide sedation, analgesia and inhibition of sympathetic activation.

 The investigators propose to recruit 120 patients who is undergoing the arteriovenous malformation embolism operation in department of Neurosurgery.

 Patients will be randomly divided into 4 groups(control group, sufentanil and low dexmedetomidine dose group, sufentanil and middle dexmedetomidine dose group, sufentanil and high dexmedetomidine dose group), then the investigators select post-operative records to determine whether dexmedetomidine can take a positive role in neurosurgical analgesia.
