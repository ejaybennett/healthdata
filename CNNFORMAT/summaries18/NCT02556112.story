(fifthQuint)Effectiveness of a Group Lifestyle Balance Class in a Military Population.

 Many active duty personnel struggle with weight gain and becoming overweight during the course of their active duty service.

 This can lead to difficulty in maintaining fitness standards and limit their ability to fully function in performing their mission.

 In addition, this may lead to increased risk for chronic disease development.

 Few published studies exist that evaluate interventions aimed at weight loss and chronic disease prevention in the active duty population.

 The Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program has been shown to be effective in facilitating weight loss and reducing chronic disease risk in civilian populations.

 However, the effectiveness of this class in preventing chronic illnesses, facilitating weight loss, increasing physical activity and promoting perceptions of improved functioning and well-being has not been studied in active duty populations.

 The purpose of this study will be to examine the effectiveness of the GLB program compared with the currently available Fitness Improvement Program (FIP) and Better Body Better Life (BBBL) on the following health indicators: individual physical fitness as measured by change in weight, abdominal circumference and minutes engaged in physical activity; changes in risk associated with chronic disease as measured by changes in lipid and HbA1c levels; and changes in self-perception of function and well-being as measured by the RAND SF-36 questionnaire.

 This will be a quantitative randomized control intervention study to determine the effects of a GLB class on physical indicators of fitness, disease risk and overall perception of functional health and well-being in an active duty population, and to compare outcomes with the FIP intervention (care as usual) and newly implemented BBBL intervention currently offered to Airmen.

 This study will be conducted at David Grant Medical Center (DGMC), Travis AFB, California.

 Effectiveness of a Group Lifestyle Balance Class in a Military Population@highlight

With this study researchers will evaluate the effects of the GLB intervention on weight loss, chronic disease indicators and self-perceived function and well-being in an active duty population.

 The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the GLB program [compared with two currently available programs, the Fitness Improvement Program (FIP) and the Better Body Better Life (BBBL) program], on the following health indicators: improvement of individual physical fitness as measured by change in abdominal circumference, weight and physical activity; decrease in risk associated with chronic disease as measured by changes in lipid and HbA1c levels; and improvement in self-perceived function and well-being as measured by the RAND 36 Item Short Form Health Survey (RAND SF- 36).

 In addition, the researchers seek to obtain feedback about the programs from the participants.
