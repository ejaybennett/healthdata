(fifthQuint)20 Years Results by HBP and DBP in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus After Following-up.

 Microalbuminuria and clinical albuminuria were defined as urinary albumin excretion rate 30 mg/g creatinine and 300 mg/g creatinine, respectively (6).

 CBP was measured once in each clinic visit.

 HBP was measured every day in the morning within 10 minutes after awakening in the sitting position, but HBP value assessed for this study used the value measured once in the same morning at each clinic visit.

 Clinic hypertension (CH) and morning hypertension (MH) were defined as systolic BP (SBP) 130 mmHg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) 85 mmHg; clinic normotension (CN) and morning normotension (MN) were defined as SBP SD.

 Mean values were compared using the paired or unpaired student t test.

 To compare the prevalence of micro- and macrovascular complications or medical treatment in patients with and without HT on basis of HBP or CBP (3), Fisher's exact test with two-tailed P values was used, and then hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals were calculatein.

 End-points and outcome measures.

 Differences in outcomes for each end-point of death, and micro- and macrovascular complications between patients with HT and NT on basis of HBP or CBP at base- and end-points in the home or in the clinic, respectively, were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and then compared by hazard rate using the log-rank test.

 Risk factor assessment for outcomes.

 Risk factors determined to be statistically related to outcomes were assessed by Cox proportional hazard analysis.

 Analysis was performed using the Prism version software (GraphPad Software, CA, USA) and the Statistical Package for the Bioscience (ComWorks Co,Tokyo,Japan).

 Two-tailed values of P<0.

05 were considered statistically significant.

Participants were examined using the methods reported previous.

 All chemical laboratory data were obtained at each clinic visit in the morning in a non-fasting state.

 A single specimen at each visit was used to assess urinary albumin levels based on the 2009 guidelines of the ADA.

 CBP was measured once in each clinic visit.

 HBP was measured every day in the morning within 10 minutes after awakening in the sitting position, but HBP value assessed for this study used the value measured once in the same morning at each clinic visit.

 Clinic hypertension (CH) and morning hypertension (MH) were defined as systolic BP (SBP) 130 mmHg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) 85 mmHg; clinic normotension (CN) and morning normotension (MN) were defined as SBP SD.

 Mean values were compared using the paired or unpaired student t test.

 To compare the prevalence of events or medical treatment in patients with and without HT on basis of HBP or CBP, Fisher's exact test with two-tailed P values was used, and then hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.

 Differences in outcomes between patients with HT and NT on basis of HBP or CBP at base- and end-points in the home or in the clinic, respectively, were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and then compared by hazard rate using the log-rank test.

 Risk factors determined to be statistically related to outcomes were assessed by Cox proportional hazard analysis.
