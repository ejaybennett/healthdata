(fifthQuint)A Dose Escalation Study Of PF-06801591 In Melanoma, Head And Neck Cancer (SCCHN), Ovarian, Sarcoma, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Urothelial Carcinoma or Other Solid Tumors.

 Protocol B8011001 is a Phase 1, two part, open-label, multi center, multiple-dose, safety, efficacy, PK, and PD study of PF-06801591 administered intravenously (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) in previously treated adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma head and neck (SCCHN), ovarian carcinoma, sarcoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), urothelial carcinoma or other solid tumors.

 The first part of the study, Part 1 dose escalation, was designed to assess the safety and tolerability of increasing dose levels of IV or SC administered PF-06801591 to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI) design.

 Part 2 expansion is designed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of 300 mg of PF-06801591 administered SC once every 4 weeks in patients with NSCLC or urothelial carcinoma as well as confirm the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

 Part 1 enrollment has completed, enrollment will only be allowed for Part 2.

Protocol B8011001 is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, multiple-dose, dose escalation and expansion, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) study of PF-06801591 in previously treated adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, SCCHN, ovarian carcinoma, sarcoma, NSCLC, urothelial carcinoma or other solid tumors.

 This is a 2 Part study whereby the safety and tolerability of increasing dose levels of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) PF-06801591 was assessed in Part 1.

 Part 2 expansion is designed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of SC PF-06801591 in patients with NSCLC or urothelial carcinoma as well as confirm the recommended Phase 2 dose.
