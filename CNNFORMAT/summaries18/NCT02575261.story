(firstQuint)CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy for EphA2 Positive Malignant Glioma Patients.

 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is a recombinant receptor with both antigen-binding and T cell activating functions.

 Chimeric antigen receptor T cell Immunotherapy has more advantages compared with conventional immunotherapy, especially in dealing with patients of hematologic malignancies and solid malignant tumors.

This study design a novel specific Chimeric antigen receptor aiming at EphA2 antigen.

After CAR-T cell infusion,At periodic intervals, the investigators will evaluate clinical symptoms Improved conditions of this disease.

Through this study,the investigators will evaluate the safty and effectiveness of CAR-T cell immunotherapy in treating with EphA2 positive malignant glioma patients.
