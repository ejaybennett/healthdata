(fifthQuint)A Study of Fibrin Sealant Plus Silver Microparticles to Prevent Incisional Hernias Following Abdominal Surgery.

 Hernias are areas of weakness in the muscle of the abdomen and commonly develop after people have had abdominal surgery.

 This area of weakness often turns into a bulge or protrusion that can increase in size over time, interfere with the intestines and make it difficult for people to work or exercise.

 Many people undergo surgery to fix their hernia.

 Unfortunately, the operations to repair the hernia frequently fail and the hernia returns.

 The investigators are developing a material to help the body heal after abdominal surgery and thereby prevent incisional hernias for forming in the first place.

 This study is the first step in testing this new material in patients and whether it is safe to use.

 This study will include patients having all types of abdominal surgeries.

 The test material is called MYOSEAL; a combination of a tissue sealant called TISSEEL(R) (Baxter Biosurgery, Deerfield, IL) plus small particles of metallic silver ( mu , American Elements, Los Angeles, CA).

 TISSEEL is made from naturally occurring blood proteins and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in surgery since 1998.

 But, TISSEEL has not been approved to prevent incisional hernias after abdominal surgery.

 The silver particles are not approved by FDA, but are thought to be generally safe in the way they will be used.

 This study hopes to learn how to help the body better heal after abdominal surgery.

 At the conclusion of a laparotomy, 4-6 pairs of stainless steel clips (large Horizon(R) titanium clips, Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle Park, NC) will be attached opposite each other and equally spaced to the edges of the sutured myofascial incision, followed by the application of MYOSEAL to the sutured myofascial incision before closure of the skin.

 Study participants will be examined at 1 day, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery.

 The primary endpoints include wound occurrences, including wound infections, seromas, and hematomas and postoperative complications through 6 months following surgery.

 The secondary endpoint is the incisional hernia rate at 1 month as determined by the distance between the metal clips marking the myofascial edges using calipers and a plain abdominal radiograph.

 A Study of Fibrin Sealant Plus Silver Microparticles to Prevent Incisional Hernias Following Abdominal Surgery@highlight

Incisional hernias are a frequent consequence of abdominal surgery.

 Current clinical efforts are primarily focused on improving repair materials and surgical techniques to correct these hernias instead of the optimal solution: prevention.

 A product called MYOSEAL is currently being developed to prevent hernia formation after abdominal surgery by using fibrin tissue sealant and silver particles to prophylactically enhance the early wound healing of myofascial incisions.

 The purpose of this phase 1 study is to examine the safety of applying MYOSEAL immediately after abdominal wall suture closure in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

 The investigators expect that applying this product to sutured myofascial incisions will increase collagen formation in the wound and thus prevent the formation of incisional hernias.
