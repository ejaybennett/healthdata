(thirdQuint)VX-970 and Irinotecan Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of VX-970 in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride (irinotecan) in patients with advanced solid tumors.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To estimate the safety and tolerability of VX-970 in combination with irinotecan.

 II.

 To document anti-tumor activity.

 III.

 To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of VX-970 and irinotecan.

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To identify molecular subpopulations of patients with increased sensitivity to the irinotecan and VX-970 combination.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes and ATR kinase inhibitor M6620 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, then at 3 and 6 months.

 VX-970 and Irinotecan Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ATR kinase inhibitor M6620 (VX-970) and irinotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced) or cannot be removed by surgery.

 VX-970 and irinotecan hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
