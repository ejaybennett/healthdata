(fifthQuint)Peptide Vaccine in Advanced Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma or Colorectal Adenocarcinoma.

 Tissue Collection: Within 4 weeks after signing this informed consent document, as part of the screening tests: You will have leftover frozen tissue collected to create your vaccine, if available.

 If there is not enough frozen tissue available, then leftover tissue from a recent procedure performed as part of your standard of care will be collected.

 The study staff may ask you to take part in another MD Anderson clinical research study (PA15-0176) for collection of leftover tissue.

 The study doctor will discuss this with you and, if you decide to take part, you will sign a separate informed consent document.

 After the tissue cells have been collected, your vaccine will be made.

 The vaccine can also be made from blood cells.

 If you agree, you will be consented and enrolled under a separate protocol, PA14-0138, to have the leukapheresis procedure performed.

 Leukapheresis is a special type of blood draw procedure that separates the red blood cells, white blood cells, and other parts of your blood from each other.

 The consent form for this protocol will explain how the leukapheresis procedure is performed and its risks.

 The white blood cells collected from leukapheresis will be used in this study.

 Baseline Tests: You must receive at least 1 type of chemotherapy after you are enrolled in this study but before your first dose of vaccine.

 There is no limit to the number of types of chemotherapy you may receive.

 Your study doctor will decide when you will enter the treatment part of this study.

 Within 28 days after your last dose of chemotherapy: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 The routine blood draw will include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.

 Within 14 days before your first dose of vaccine, you will have an MRI or CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

 Study Vaccine and Study Drug Administration: About 28 days after your last dose of chemotherapy, you will receive the vaccine as an injection under the skin on Day 1 of Weeks 0, 1, 3, 4, 6 and then every 3 weeks until Week 30, then at Weeks 39 and 51.

 Imiquimod cream will be applied over the injection site about 30 minutes after you receive the vaccine.

 This will be done each time you receive the vaccine.

 You will also receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes every 3 weeks until Week 51.

 Study Visits: On Day 1 of Weeks 0, 1, and 3: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and research tests for immune testing to test for genetic mutations.

 On Day 1 of Week 4, blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for immune system testing and routine tests.

 On Day 1 of Weeks 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for immune system testing and routine tests.

 - You will have an MRI or CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

 You will not have these scans at Weeks 9 and 15.

 On Day 1 of Weeks 16, 21, 24, 27, 33, 36, 42, 45, and 48: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 On Day 1 of Weeks 30, 39, and 51: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for immune system testing, tumor marker testing, and routine tests.

 - You will have an MRI or CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

 Length of Study: You may receive the vaccine and pembrolizumab for up to 1 year.

 You will no longer be able to receive the study vaccine if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Your participation on the study will be over after follow-up.

 End-of-Study Visit: About 8 weeks after your last study visit: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 Follow-Up: You will be called 2 times by the study staff in the 6 months after your last dose of vaccine and asked about any side effects you may have experienced since the end-of-study visit.

 Each call should last about 10 minutes.

 If you left the study because you had side effects, you will be called by the study staff until that side effect has gone away or has become stable.

 Peptide Vaccine in Advanced Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma or Colorectal Adenocarcinoma@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if it is possible to make a vaccine for advanced pancreatic or colorectal cancer.

 In this study, you will receive the vaccine in combination with pembrolizumab.

 The safety of this vaccine in combination with pembrolizumab will also be studied.

 This study will use your tumor cells (either from a fresh biopsy or from leftover tissue samples) and blood to help create a vaccine designed specifically for you based on what the study doctor and research staff can learn about the type of mutated proteins (a type of genetic change) in the tumor.

 This is an investigational study.

 The study vaccine is not FDA approved or commercially available.

 It is currently being used for research purposes only.

 Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and squamous cell head and neck cancer.

 It is considered investigational to use pembrolizumab to treat pancreatic or colorectal cancer.

 The study doctor can explain how the vaccine is designed to work.

 Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
