(thirdQuint)Tedizolid Tissue Penetration in Diabetic Patients With Wound Infections and Healthy Volunteers Via In Vivo Microdialysis.

 This study will enroll 10 patients with diabetes who are admitted with a lower limb wound infection and 6 healthy volunteer control participants.

 The study will take place in an inpatient unit at Hartford Hospital for all patients and in the Clinical Research Center at Hartford Hospital for all healthy volunteers.

 All participants will receive 3 to 6 doses of oral tedizolid 200mg once daily.

 A microdialysis probe (Mdialysis Inc.

, N.

 Chelmsford, MA) will be inserted into the subcutaneous soft tissue near the margin of the wound (patients) or in the thigh (healthy volunteers).

 The microdialysis probe is perfused with lactated Ringer's solution and samples are collected for the 24 hours following the final dose.

 A peripheral intravenous catheter will be inserted into an arm vein to collect blood samples simultaneously with microdialysis samples.

 Concentrations in tissue are compared with blood to determine percent penetration.

 Tedizolid Tissue Penetration in Diabetic Patients With Wound Infections and Healthy Volunteers Via In Vivo Microdialysis@highlight

This study will determine the tissue penetration of tedizolid (Sivextro, Merck & Co.

), a novel oxazolidinone antibiotic, into the extracellular, interstitial fluid of soft tissue in diabetic patients with lower limb wound infections.

 Penetration will be compared with a group of healthy volunteer control participants.
