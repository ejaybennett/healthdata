(firstQuint)Impact of Resveratrol on Brain Function and Structure.

 Cell and animal studies postulated various beneficial effects of resveratrol, ranging from a reduction of inflammatory processes and the treatment of cancer to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and stroke.

 With regard to cognitive decline, rodent models for Alzheimer's disease (AD) showed improved learning and decelerated hippocampal neurodegeneration after intake of resveratrol.

 Animal and first human studies provided evidence that resveratrol might serve as an easy, cost-effective option to develop novel prevention and treatment strategies against age-associated cognitive decline.

 To test this hypothesis, the researchers study general brain structure and function on healthy older individuals (> 60years old).

The study will investigate whether resveratrol could provide positive effects on memory and brain structures and functions in healthy elderly participants.
