(fifthQuint)Major Cardiovascular and Other Patient-important Outcomes With Personalized dialYsate TEMPerature.

 1.

 Statement of the health problem or issue Dialysis is a life-saving treatment for patients with kidney failure.

 However, over 20% of patients die within one year of starting dialysis from heart disease or stroke.

 One reason that so many dialysis patients die from heart disease and stroke may be related to the dialysis treatment itself.

 During dialysis, blood pressure often drops, and the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart and brain is reduced.

 Over time, this can cause significant damage and result in heart attacks, strokes, and even death.

 Our team was the first to show that the heart and brain become starved of blood and oxygen during dialysis.

 We and others have shown that lowering the temperature of dialysis (to just below the patient's own body temperature) improves blood flow and protects the heart and brain during dialysis.

 We will now determine if this method can prevent heart attacks and strokes in a large population of dialysis patients.

 2.

 Objective of your project Our study will now determine whether a cooler, personalized dialysis temperature prevents heart attacks, strokes, and death.

 3.

 How will you undertake your work? We will conduct a randomized controlled trial.

 Our study will include 7500 dialysis patients in 82 dialysis centres across Ontario.

 The name of this study is MY TEMP.

 Patients in the treatment group will receive cooler dialysis (0.

5C below their measured body temperature).

 Patients in the control group will receive standard dialysis at a fixed temperature of 36.

5C.

 This study will last for two years.

 At the end of two years, we will compare the number heart attacks, strokes and deaths in the treatment and control groups.

 4.

 What is unique/innovative about your project? We usually need to study a large number of patients in a clinical trial to reliably understand the effects of a treatment.

 Normally, a study with 7500 patients would cost more than $15 million dollars to conduct; however, our study will provide a reliable answer to the question being asked and cost less than $2 million.

 This is because we will use data that is already being collected by our healthcare system.

 For example, when a patient is hospitalized for a heart attack or stroke, this information is recorded in a secure healthcare database.

 We will be able to analyze this healthcare data at the end of the study (and link patient outcomes to the type of dialysis treatment received (i.

e.

 treatment or control)).

 This innovative study design means that our study will be much larger (but cost less) than a traditional clinical trial.

 In addition, MY TEMP is a simple and safe intervention that can be provided on any dialysis machine at no added cost.

 If proven effective, this simple, low-cost intervention could be easily adopted across Canada (and worldwide), and save our healthcare system millions of dollars by reducing the number hospitalizations for heart attacks and strokes.

 5.

 What is the impact of the proposed research? Each year in Ontario, more than 2,000 hemodialysis patients die or are hospitalized for a major cardiovascular event.

 Heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death in dialysis patients.

 Unfortunately, medications that prevent heart disease and stroke in other patients do not work as well in dialysis patients.

 If our intervention is successful, we think it will prevent at least 200 deaths and cardiovascular events each year (in Ontario alone).

 Major Cardiovascular and Other Patient-important Outcomes With Personalized dialYsate TEMPerature@highlight

People with failed kidneys need an artificial kidney machine (called dialysis) to remove toxins and extra fluid from the body.

 Most patients receive dialysis treatments at a hospital three times a week.

 During treatment, a patient's blood pressure may drop, causing dizziness and muscle cramping.

 Repeated drops in blood pressure can also injure the heart and brain.

 Over time, this can lead to heart attacks, strokes, and sometimes death.

 New research shows that cooling the temperature of the dialysis fluid (called dialysate) can reduce heart and brain injury.

 In most hospitals, all patients' dialysate temperature is set at 36.

5 C (to match body temperature).

 In our study of 73 patients, we showed that reducing the dialysate temperature to 0.

5 C below body temperature protected the heart and brain from injury [1,2].

 We now want to test this simple, safe, low-cost intervention in a large study with more than 7000 dialysis patients in Ontario.

 We can lower the dialysate temperature on dialysis machines in Ontario at no added cost.

 This intervention has the potential to reduce many hospitalizations and deaths in Ontario, and relieve suffering in patients with kidney failure.
