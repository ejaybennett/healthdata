(fifthQuint)A Study of Metronomic CP and JX-594 in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer and Advanced Soft-tissue Sarcoma (METROmaJX).

 For the phase I study, this is a prospective open-label phase I trial based on a dose escalating study design assessing two dose level of JX-594 when associated to metronomic cyclophosphamide.

 For the phase II study, stratum soft-tissue sarcoma, this is a monocenter, randomized non comparative phase II clinical trial.

 This phase II trial was based on an optimal 2-stage Simon's design.

 Randomization 2:1 with 2 patients randomized in experimental arm n1 (association of metronomic cyclophosphamide and JX-594) and 1 patient randomized in control arm n2 (treatment by metronomic cyclophosphamide alone).

 For the phase II study, stratum breast cancer, this is a monocenter, one-arm phase II clinical trial, based on two-stage optimal Simon's design (association of metronomic cyclophosphamide and JX-594).

 A Study of Metronomic CP and JX-594 in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer and Advanced Soft-tissue Sarcoma (METROmaJX)@highlight

Assessment of the efficacy and safety of JX-594 and metronomic cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma and advanced breast cancer, once the Maximum Tolerated Dose have been determined (phase I trial).

 Phase I study: this is a prospective open-labeled phase I trial based on a dose escalating study design assessing two dose levels of JX594 when prescribed in combination with metronomic cyclophosphamide.

 Phase II study sarcoma: this is a monocentric, randomized two-arm non comparative phase 2 study assessing efficacy and safety of JX-594 in association with metronomic cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.

 Phase II study breast cancer: this is a monocentric, single-arm phase II study, assessing efficacy and safety of JX-594 in association with metronomic cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced breast cancer.
