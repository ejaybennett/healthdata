(fifthQuint)A Safety and Effectiveness Study of Pre-operative Artesunate in Stage II/III Colorectal Cancer.

 Artesunate is an established antimalarial drug belonging to the artemisinin class of drugs, has an excellent safety profile, is well tolerated and affordable.

 In last two decades, artemisinins have shown potent and broad anticancer properties in a range of cell lines and animal models, supporting the hypothesis that artemisinins have the potential to be an effective anti-cancer therapy.

 Multiple potential mechanisms of action include anti-proliferative effects through cell-cycle disruption, reactive oxygen species (ROS) -induced DNA damage, induction of apoptosis, anti-angiogenesis, immunomodulation and induced radiosensitivity.

 Despite a multi-modality treatment approach to colorectal cancer, 5 year overall survival does not currently exceed 60%.

 Neoadjuvant pre-operative therapy may be more effective at eradicating micrometastases compared to adjuvant therapy delivered following the delay and immunological stress of surgery.

 However current neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens are often associated with significant side effects and may result in a delay in surgery whilst patients recover.

 A well tolerated, affordable, novel anticancer agent that could be given to patients whilst they wait for surgery, without causing a surgical delay due to treatment related toxicity, would have a significant clinical impact on patient care.

 The NeoART trial is a phase II multicentre randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial (RCT) for patients undergoing primary surgery for Stage II/III colorectal cancers.

 Patients are randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive either a two week course of neoadjuvant artesunate 200mg once daily or matching placebo.

 Both patients and health care professionals are blinded to treatment allocation arm to minimise outcome-reporting bias.

 The primary endpoint of the trial is recurrence free survival two years after surgery.

 Secondary endpoints include 2 and 5 year overall survival, treatment related toxicity, tolerability and patient quality of life.

 A translational sub-study looking at predictive and prognostic biomarkers is also planned.

 A Safety and Effectiveness Study of Pre-operative Artesunate in Stage II/III Colorectal Cancer@highlight

This study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of pre-operative artesunate given orally once a day for 14 days prior to surgery in patients with Stage II/III colorectal cancer.

 Artesunate is an established antimalarial drug with an excellent safety profile, is well tolerated and affordable.

 A number of laboratory studies and one small pilot clinical study in patients with colorectal cancer have shown that artesunate can reduce the proliferation and growth of cancer cells.

 Two hundred patients diagnosed with Stage II/III operable colorectal cancer will be randomly allocated to receive oral artesunate 200mg daily or a matching placebo for 14 days prior to surgery.

 Patients will be followed up closely for 5 years to see if giving artesunate preoperatively reduces the risk of cancer recurring after surgery.
