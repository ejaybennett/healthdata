(fifthQuint)Music Therapy Improves the Mood of Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation.

 METHODOLOGY Study Design.

 It is a randomized controlled experimental study Place: Clinical Hospital Complex of the Federal University of Parana, Bone Marrow Transplant Service.

 The research was developed in the period Jan/2014 to November/2015.

 Population: Adult patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) Allogeneic.

 Approved by the Ethics Committee in Research of the University Federal of Parana Clinical Hospital Complex, Presentation certificate for consideration Ethics: 26404414.

0096 Sample Calculation: The calculation of sample size was based on a previous pilot study for which was identified an average of 5.

4 for the score of humor with standard deviation of 1.

 It was felt that this group corresponds to the control group of the new study and a minimal difference in the score of humor 1 point higher in the experimental group would be clinically relevant.

 For a significance level of 5% and a 80% test power, would take at least 45 cases in each group (Control and Experimental).

 Depending on the evaluation of mood score is given by an ordinal scale, it is suggested a 10% increase in the sample size in each group.

 Thus, 50 patients were needed in each group.

 the calculation of the sample was done by statistical.

 Randomization: It was made random and concealed allocation of participants in the groups as follows: A Contributor not involved with the research played a given and communicated the number randomly selected to the researcher, the number was pair, and would compose the experimental group of music therapy.

 If it was odd participant would make up the control group.

 The evaluation was done by an external student of psychology.

 For musical intervention was not possible to apply the principle of double blind but, the evaluator did not know what kind of intervention was applied.

 The interventions were applied twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm.

 in the morning and the assessment on the same day but the afternoon.

 METHOD Apply live music through the music therapy techniques such as re-creation, improvisation and rhythmic production, the experimental group of music therapy (EGM).

 Implement and measure through the visual analog scale (VAS) and numeric the level of mood, anxiety and pain in the experimental group music therapy (EGM).

 Apply the visual analog scale (VAS) and numeric to measure the levels of Mood, Anxiety and Pain Control Group (GC) that received only the standard treatment.

 Music Therapy Improves the Mood of Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation@highlight

ABSTRACT The transplant allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT Alo) is a therapeutic medical treatment carried out in combat various neoplastic hematologic disorders, congenital, genetic or acquired.

 In this procedure, which combines high-dose chemotherapy and or radiation and has a degree of high cytotoxicity, the patient goes for a social solitary confinement, which causes psychological distress, pain, anxiety, mood disorders and can lead to depression.

 The music therapy was applied and the purpose of decreasing the insulation.

 This is a randomized controlled study.

 Method: Apply the intervention of live music sessions through the techniques of music therapy; assess and quantify through the visual analog scale (VAS) and numeric.

 The dependent variables, pain, anxiety and mood of the participants selected randomly for the experimental group music therapy (EGM) n=50, and compare with the control group (CG) n=50, which received only the standard treatment.
