(secondQuint)Intravitreal Aflibercept or Ranibizumab for Rubeosis Iridis.

 Aflibercept (Eylea(R)) and ranibizumab (Lucentis(R)) are an anti-VEGF, but there are differences between the two drugs.

 Lucentis is administered in the form of smaller molecules, which is thought to give Lucentis an advantage over Eylea in its ability to penetrate the eye's retina and halt abnormal blood vessel growth contributing to advanced macular degeneration and scarring that causes blindness.

 They may have a role in treating ocular disorders involving fibrovascular proliferation.

 To determine and compare whether intraocular aflibercept and ranibizumab decreases rubeosis iridis (RI) in patients with neovascular glaucoma (NVG).
