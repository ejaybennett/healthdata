(thirdQuint)The Study to Investigate the Contribution of Fasting and Post-prandial Blood Glucose to Overall Glycaemia in T2DM.

 Background The current evidence shows that hyperglycemia is one of the important cause of atherosclerosis.

In the DCCT study[1], comparing with the conventional therapy group (HbA1c7%, the relative contribution of PPG was around 69.

7%, but this proportion decreased gradually accompany with the increasing HbA1c.

 When HbA1c10.

2%, the contribution of PPG was only 30.

5%; Kikuchi et al[17] concluded the similar result with Monnier in the T2DM patients of Japan.

 Riddle et al[18] found that when HbA1c8%, PPG contributes more to HbA1c, with the deterioration of blood glucose, the relative contribution of FPG increased to 70%.

 However, blood glucose fluctuation is affected by many factors such as disease duration, sex, diet, food cooking methods and race[19].

 Our previous study found compared with NGT, the intra-day blood glucose fluctuation was similar in IGR patients, but it had already occurred.

 In the newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients, the inter-day and intra-day blood glucose fluctuation was significantly increased, besides, the effect of different ratio of carbohydrate in the diet was different[20-24] For Asian yellow, there are less research and the conclusions are not consistent.

 Japanese scholars Kikuchi [17]obtained the similar conclusion with Monnier, but the study done by Taiwanese researchers [25] show that in the good blood glucose control patients, the relative contribution of PPG was up to 70% , but with the blood glucose control deterioration, FPG and PPG to its effect is similar, about 50% each.

 Until now, the research on the contribution of the BBG and PPG to HbA1c is less, and the results are different, May be different from the research methods and the study population.

 At present, all the research use 6.

1mmol/L (WHO criteria)or 5.

6mmol/L(ADA criteria) as normal FBG level (WHO criteria) to calculate the fasting or postprandial hyperglycemia, not according to the blood glucose fluctuation curve of NGT population, so that the BBG and PPG contribution of HbA1c might be underestimated or overestimated.

 In addition, Peter and Monnier used MTT method which would cause difference result from the T2DM patients in the real world .

Peter, Monnier, Riddle and Kikuchi monitored the blood glucose by collecting pre or postprandial blood sample frequently or SMBG.

 The contribution of the postprandial glucose to HbA1c is underestimated.

 As the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) is becoming more and more widely used, it is considered as a better method to evaluate the contribution of BBG and PPG to HbA1c because of the minimizing bias which is resulted of research methodology[25].

 There was no any China mainland data showing the contribution of BBG and PBG to HbA1c in T2DM patients treated with OADs using the CGM method.

 Therefore this study is aimed to investigate the contribution of BBG and PBG to HbA1c in Chinese T2DM patients treated with OADs using CGMS.

 It's expected to generate evidence to support the concept of individualized therapy when patients are uncontrolled by OADs.

 Objectives Primary objective is to investigate the relative contribution of BBG and PBG to overall glycaemia in T2DM with OAD.

 The secondary is to investigate the absolute contribution of BBG and PBG to overall glycaemia in T2DM with OAD treatment, investigate the correlation between overall glycaemia exposure and HbA1c and regression equation of HbA1c to BBG and PBG.

 Sample size According to MONNIER' research, the contribution of PBG to whole day hyperglycemia use 6.

After enter the SAS 8.

 So more than 132 cases will be enrolled ( rate of dropout and withdraw is 20%, the cases will need 110+110*0.

01 software) Because this is exploratory research, so we justified the sample: T2DM subjects: the primary endpoint is the relative contribution of FBG.

 The contribution will be calculated by individual subject.

 A sample size of 60 for each group produces a two-sided 95% confidence interval for relative contribution of FBG with a precision of approximately 6.

5% when the estimated standard deviation is 25% (refer to previous study), so the total subjects of five group is 300.

 Number of subjects per treatment arm: N (normal glycaemic group)=100; N (T2DM with OADs)=300 Cases with one of the following reasons should be removed - Misdiagnos - No medication or no regular medication - Irregular diet - No test recording - Using any drug which might interfere the glucose metabolism and mislead the result.

 Study design This is a single center, two groups, cross sectional study.

 - One group consists of normal glycaemic subjects, N=100.

 - One group consists of T2DM subjects treated with OADs, N= 300, which will be divided into 5 sub-groups by HbA1c level and each sub-group will include 60 subjects (HbA1c=9.

0%) CGMS will be used to collect blood glucose data.

 The normal glycaemic subjects will not receive any treatment during this study.

 The T2DM subjects will maintain their previous OADs treatment and no other new treatment will be added during this study.

 Relative and absolute contribution will be calculated by two ways: - Refer the methods of Monnier and Riddle to calculate the contribution with WHO normal FBG cut point of 6.

1 mmol/L - AUC 24h total high glycaemia=the area above the curve of FBG 6.

1 mmol/L - AUCPPG=(the area above pre-prandial glucose in a 4-h period after each meal)X3 meals - AUC BBG= AUC 24h total high glycaemia - AUCPPG - Using the data of the group with normal glycaemic subjects as the basis to calculate the contribution (no need to select a normal FBG cut-off point, therefore avoid the overestimated or underestimated contribution of FBG due to the conflict of different FBG cut-off point in western guideline and China guideline with 5.
