(fifthQuint)AirSealInsufflation Trocar/CO2 Absorption Study.

 Three main factors affect patients' cardiopulmonary status during gynecologic laparoscopy: 1) degree of Trendelenburg tilt (25 - 30), 2) carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption and 3) increased intra-abdominal pressure (10 -20 mmHg).

 Slight modifications to any or all of these three factors can lead to a significant decrease in morbidity.

 The AirSeal(R) valveless trocar system reduces CO2 absorption when compared to standard trocars during renal laparoscopy.

 Also, use of this trocar system provides a more stable intra-abdominal pressure when compared to standard trocars, a feature that could possibly allow for laparoscopic surgery to be performed at lower intra-abdominal pressures.

The purpose of this study is to compare CO2 absorption during gynecologic laparoscopy using the AirSeal(R) valveless trocar system versus standard insufflation trocars at intra-abdominal pressures of 10 and 15 mmHg.

 The investigators hypothesize that with the AirSeal(R) valveless trocar system, gynecologic laparoscopy can be performed at a lower intra-abdominal pressure with a possible resultant decrease in CO2 absorption, while maintaining adequate visualization of the operative field for safe completion of surgery.
