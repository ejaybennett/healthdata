(secondQuint)Assessing a Endoscopic Mucosal Resection Site Using Different Endoscopic Imaging Methods.

 Residual neoplasia after EMR is a common.

 Optimal surveillance protocols are not clearly defined.

 There is a need for better imaging modalities to evaluate for residual disease.

 Suspected residual tissue can be confirmed with repeat colonoscopy or can be empirically treated.

 However, this can lead to either frequent colonoscopy or overtreatment.

 This presents more cost and financial burden to the patient.

 With the introduction of newer colonscopes that have near focus/zoom capability, it is important to assess whether the near focus technology offers better accuracy for detection of residual neoplastic tissue.

 With better accuracy to confidently rule out residual neoplasia using newer imaging modality, additional treatment or biopsy at the previous EMR may be avoided.

 Furthermore, the interval for surveillance colonscopy can be lengthened.

 Hypothesis of the study: Using standard white light with and without near focus does not provide better sensitivity and negative predictive value compare to narrow band imaging with and without near focus when assessing previous endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) site for residual neoplasia.

The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of using different endoscopic imaging technique (white light, white light with near focus, narrow band imaging (NBI), NBI with near focus) for detection of residual neoplastic tissue at site of prior EMR
