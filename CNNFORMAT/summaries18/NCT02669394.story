(thirdQuint)Reshaping the Path of Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI).

 A total of 88 adults diagnosed with vascular cognitive impairment will be randomized to either a 12-month twice-weekly resistance training program or stretch and relaxation program.

 There will be three measurement sessions: baseline, 6 months (midpoint of intervention period), and 12 months (end of intervention period).

The investigators will conduct a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial study to provide preliminary evidence of efficacy of a resistance exercise training program for maintaining white matter integrity and improving cognitive function in older adults with vascular cognitive impairment, compared with a stretch and relaxation program.
