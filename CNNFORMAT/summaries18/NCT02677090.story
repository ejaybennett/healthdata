(firstQuint)Fiber Tolerability in Children Aged 3-7 Year.

 The aim of the trial is to determine, using a dose escalation design, the digestive tolerability of the PROMITOR(R)given at the doses of 6, then 9 and finally 12 g (corresponding to 4, 6, and 8 g of fibers respectively) twice a day with the meals of the morning and of the evening versus control (maltodextrin, no fiber) over one week of intake in children from 3 to 7 years old.

 As it is an exploratory study there is no categorization between primary and secondary objectives.
