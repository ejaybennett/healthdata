(fifthQuint)Sirolimus Associated With Tacrolimus at Low Doses in Elderly Kidney Transplant Patients.

 Study Design This will be a single-center, prospective, 12-month randomized controlled trial aiming to compare sirolimus associated with tacrolimus in elderly renal transplant patients as to safety and incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.

 Treatments In the control group (Tacrolimus + Mycophenolate) the investigators will use tacrolimus (starting with 0.

1 mg/kg twice daily adjusted to target serum levels by 4-8ng/ml at the third month and then 3-7ng/ml from the third month to the 12th month) and mycophenolate sodium 720 mg twice daily.

 A dose reduction of mycophenolate sodium to 720 mg/day will be accepted due to possible side effects of the drug.

 In the treatment group (Tacrolimus + sirolimus) the investigators will use tacrolimus (starting with 0.

1 mg/kg twice daily adjusted to target serum levels by 4-8 ng/ml at the third month and then 3-7 ng/ml from the third month to the 12th month) and sirolimus 2 mg/day (adjusted serum levels at 4-8 ng/ml throughout the study period).

 In all groups, patients will receive prednisone 30 mg/day (in the first month with weekly reductions up to 5 mg/day at the end of the second month).

 Induction therapy consisted of basiliximab or antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin, Genzyme(R)).

 Thymoglobulin will be used in patients with panel reactivity class I greater than 50 % (at a dose of 1mg/kg for 5 days).

 Sirolimus Associated With Tacrolimus at Low Doses in Elderly Kidney Transplant Patients@highlight

There is no consensus on the best immunosuppressive regimen in elderly people.

 The aim of this study will be to evaluate the efficacy of sirolimus associated with tacrolimus in elderly kidney transplant recipients.

 The investigators will conduct a single-center prospective randomized study comparing the combination of tacrolimus with sirolimus at reduced dose rate (tacrolimus + sirolimus group) against tacrolimus with mycophenolate (tacrolimus + mycophenolate group).

 The investigators will include all kidney transplant patients over 60 years of age.

 The investigators will evaluate estimated glomerular filtration rate and incidence of cytomegalovirus in 12 month follow-up.
