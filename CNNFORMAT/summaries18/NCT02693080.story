(fifthQuint)CT Perfusion Imaging in Predicting Treatment Response in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer or Lung Metastases Treated With Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the feasibility of performing perfusion CT imaging (CT perfusion imaging) at baseline, within 48 hours post-stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR), and at 2-4 months SABR in patients undergoing SABR for treatment of a lung tumor per standard of care.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the range (variability) of perfusion parameters, including blood flow, blood volume, transit time, and permeability at each time point.

 II.

 To assess the change in perfusion parameters between these time points.

 III.

 To correlate any change in perfusion parameters with circulating-tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels at these time points.

 IV.

 To correlate perfusion parameters with tumor response 1 year post-SABR.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo CT perfusion imaging of the lungs at baseline, within 48 hours of first SABR, and at 2-4 months after completion of SABR.

 After completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 2-4 months and then at 1 year.

 CT Perfusion Imaging in Predicting Treatment Response in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer or Lung Metastases Treated With Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies computed tomography (CT) perfusion imaging in predicting treatment response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer or tumors that have spread from the primary site (place where it started) to the lungs (metastases) treated with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy.

 CT perfusion imaging is a special type of CT that uses an injected dye in order to see how blood flow through tissues, including lung tissue.

 CT perfusion imaging of the lungs may help doctors learn whether perfusion characteristics of lung tumors may be predictive of response to treatment and whether lung perfusion characteristics can be used to follow response to treatment.
