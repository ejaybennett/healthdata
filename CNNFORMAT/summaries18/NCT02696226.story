(thirdQuint)Frequency of Reduced Leaflet Motion After Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

.

 This will be a pilot prospective randomized controlled trial.

The study will enroll 50 adult patients scheduled to undergo SAVR and 50 adult patients scheduled to undergo TAVR.

 Subjects who satisfy Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria will be approached for informed consent.

 Those who give informed consent will be enrolled.

 After induction of anesthesia, a computer program will be used to randomize patients to one of the 2 treatment groups.

 1.

 SAVR patients will get either Warfarin or aspirin 2.

 TAVR patients will get either Warfarin or aspirin.

 Patients will be seen at 4-6 weeks postoperatively for Transthoracic ECHO (TTE), 4 dimensional (4D), Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scan and review of medical history.

 Phone follow up at 6,9 and 12 months post-operatively.

 Data from this pilot study will enable us to determine the feasibility of a larger randomized controlled clinical trial to investigate the phenomenon of reduced leaflet motion/subclinical valve thrombosis and, possibly, its clinical importance.

 Frequency of Reduced Leaflet Motion After Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

@highlight

This is a prospective, randomized pilot study in patients undergoing Sugical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR) and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) to estimate the incidence of reduced leaflet motion and assess the impact of perioperative anticoagulation on the incidence of reduced leaflet motion.
