(thirdQuint)Letrozole Plus Ribociclib or Placebo as Neo-adjuvant Therapy in ER-positive, HER2-negative Early Breast Cancer.

 Subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to either letrozole plus placebo vs.

 letrozole plus continuous dosing of ribociclib vs.

 letrozole plus intermittent dosing (3-weeks-on/1-week-off) of ribociclib.

 The difference in clinical, pathologic and radiologic response as well as Pre-operative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI) scores across the three treatments arms will be examined.

 Subjects will also be followed for 5 years post-treatment to determine if ribociclib in combination with letrozole for 24 weeks results in improved 5 year Relapse Free Survival (RFS) compared to letrozole alone.
