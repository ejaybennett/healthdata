 SR-BI and Antiviral Treatment Response in HCV@highlight

The scavenger receptor type B class I (SR-BI) is a receptor for high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and one of entry factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV).

 The investigators aimed to examine the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the SCARB1 gene, which encodes SR-BI, with virologic responses to pegylated interferon-based treatment in Asian chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients.
