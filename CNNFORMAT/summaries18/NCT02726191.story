(secondQuint)Computerized Cognitive Training in Epilepsy.

 The proposed investigation will be the first to pit two software packages against each other to evaluate the relative efficacy and feasibility of their use among patients with epilepsy.

 Pharmacotherapy fails to control seizures in approximately 30% of patients.

 Use of non-pharmacologic interventions, such as cognitive rehabilitation, has shown some benefit for improving cognitive functions and reducing mood symptoms.

 Each of the computer exercises employ a set of stimuli that are generalizable and mimic real-world experiences.
