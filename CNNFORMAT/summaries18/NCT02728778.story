(secondQuint)Botulinum Toxin A for Emotional Stabilization in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).

 Afferent feedback from facial muscles is believed to enhance emotional states (facial feedback theory).

 The facial expression of negative emotions involves facial muscles of the glabellar region.

 It has been shown that paralysis of facial muscles in the forehead using botulinum toxin A leads to the improvement of depressive symptoms.

 It is believed that the limited ability to express these emotions alleviates depressive symptoms.

 As Borderline personality disorder is characterized by negative emotions expressed via facial muscles in the forehead, it is hypothesized that BPD patients could profit from botulinum toxin treatment.
