(thirdQuint)Radiation-Free Heart Catheterization Using MRI.

 Participants undergo general anesthesia, and vascular access is obtained in the x-ray catheterization lab.

 Next the participant is transferred into the MRI scanner where a focused MRI examination is performed.

 Catheters are then guided into the heart chambers using real-time MRI guidance to perform conventional cardiac catheterization steps.

 If time allows, additional research MRI is performed before the participant is returned to the x-ray catheterization lab.

 If any MRI guided catheterization steps are unsuccessful, the clinically indicated step is performed after the participant returns to the x-ray catheterization lab using conventional x-ray guided pictures.

 Radiation-Free Heart Catheterization Using MRI@highlight

Currently catheters used in heart catheterization procedures are guided throughout the heart chambers and blood vessels by pictures taken by x-rays.

 This technology exposes patients to radiation.

 With this study protocol the investigators will use MRI technology to take real-time pictures to navigate catheters throughout heart chambers.

 MRI uses electromagnetic energy; therefore, it does not expose participants to radiation energy.
