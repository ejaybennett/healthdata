(fifthQuint)Measuring hCG Levels in Pregnant Women.

 Women presenting at the study site for a prenatal visit, and who are 70 days' gestation, will be offered participation in the study.

 Efforts will also be made to recruit patients through physician or treating health care professional referral and advertisements.

 One hundred and fifty consenting women will be enrolled.

 Up to three additional study visits will be scheduled: At the enrollment, if an ultrasound-confirmed gestational age is not available in the woman's medical record, a transvaginal ultrasound will be performed.

 If the woman is 56-63 days gestation on the day of enrollment, she will be asked to return weekly until she reaches 71-77 days.

 If the woman is 64-70 days gestation, she will be asked to return weekly until she reaches 78-84 days.

 If the woman is less than 56 days gestation, she will be asked to return for the three research visits at the appropriate time to provide the urine samples and blood draws.

 Women will have one visit during each of their three assigned gestational age weeks.

 At each visit, women will provide a urine sample for an MLPT and have a blood draw to measure serum hCG.
