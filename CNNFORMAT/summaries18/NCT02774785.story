(fifthQuint)Does Intra-operative MarginProbe Use Reduce Re-excision Rates?.

 Almost 60% of all patients diagnosed with breast cancer (48000 annually in the UK) undergo breast conserving surgery (BCS.

 Surgical removal of the cancer aims to reduce the risk of local recurrence and patient mortality.

 In order to minimise the amount of tissue removed, excision up to the cancer-free area (margins) is undertaken.

 Further surgery, following initial breast cancer surgery, is required in 25% - 30% of patients because of disease found at the edges of the tissue removed.

 Reducing the need for further operations benefits patients (by reducing the number of operations required, improving cosmetic outcome and minimising anxiety) and the NHS (by realising economic benefits).

 MarginProbe, a disposable probe which measures the margins of tissue removed during breast cancer surgery, allows the surgeon to remove further tissue during the same surgical procedure to clear any involved margins, minimising subsequent re-operations.

 Four hundred and sixty patients in 6 specialist Breast Units will be randomly allocated after BCS (and specimen radiology), by telephone randomisation, to either: - MarginProbe assessment of the surgical specimen with re-excision of margins if required; - Standard BCS (clinical and radiological clear margins) whereby the wound will be closed and the surgery completed (standard UK practice).

 Does Intra-operative MarginProbe Use Reduce Re-excision Rates?@highlight

The new device we are looking at is called the MarginProbe.

 It is a disposable probe which measures the margins of tissue removed to check they are clear of cancer cells, during breast conservation surgery.

 After specimen radiology, allows the Surgeon to remove further tissue if necessary, during the same operation if any involved margins are identified.

 This minimises the need for further repeat operations.

 Previous studies carried out elsewhere in the world (USA and Israel) have identified that the probe reduces re-excision rate but there has never been a study in the UK.

 The trial involves randomly allocating patients once they are in theatre, to either the MarginProbe procedure after breast conserving surgery and radiology has been completed, or not.
