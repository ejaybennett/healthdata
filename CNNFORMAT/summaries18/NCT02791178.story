(firstQuint)Optical Coherence Tomography in STEMI.

 The specific research objectives include: 1.

 To use OCT to determine the type of plaque (plaque rupture, plaque erosion or calcified nodule) most associated with the presence and severity of MVO (as measured by IMR and cardiac MRI).

 2.

 To use OCT to investigate the relationship between the extent of tissue protrusion and the amount of residual stent thrombus with the presence and severity of MVO (as measured by IMR and cardiac MRI).

The overall objective of this research proposal is to use OCT to investigate those morphological culprit plaque characteristics associated with the risk of developing MVO in reperfused STEMI patients.
