 Cohort of Prosthetic Joint Infections@highlight

Management of prosthetic joint infections (PJI) is a challenging task.

 These infections include different clinical and microbiological settings calling upon various treatment strategies according to infection type (acute or chronic), bone quality, the involved micro-organism and the patient's general condition and willing.

 Treatment of PJI combines surgery and prolonged antibiotic therapy.

 In some patients with a high operative risk prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy can be used.

 Lack of large prospective studies motivated the conception of this cohort with a long term follow up, regardless to PJI management procedures.
