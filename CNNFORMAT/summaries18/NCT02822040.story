(firstQuint)An Evaluation of Root Length Measurements Using Intraoral Scan and Panoramic Radiographs.

 Intraoral digital scans will be taken on patients who have completed orthodontic treatment, and measurements will be made on the crown dimensions.

 These dimensions will then be applied onto the same teeth as seen on panoramic radiographs and a mathematical relationship will be determined for root length.

 Changes in root length will be measured from initial records to treatment complete panoramic radiographs and these estimates will be compared to actual root length changes as measured in CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) records.

This study will attempt to validate a method of estimating root length on panoramic radiograph by crown measurement on intraoral digital scans.
