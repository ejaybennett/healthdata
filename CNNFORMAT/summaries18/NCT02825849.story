(thirdQuint)Platelet-rich Plasma (PRP) for Endometrial Regeneration and Repair.

 BACKGROUND: There is a need for new and more effective therapies for patients with intrauterine adhesions (Asherman's Syndrome) and persistent thin endometrial lining in in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment programs, particularly for patients resistant to standard therapies HYPOTHESIS: Platelet rich plasma stimulates cellular processes involved in endometrial regeneration relevant to management of a thin lining or intrauterine scarring.

 PRIMARY AIMS: - To measure the change in endometrial lining thickness SECONDARY AIMS: - To determine if fertility is improved in patients receiving platelet rich plasma (PRP): 1.

 In patients with thin lining undergoing frozen embryo transfer (FET), to determine: - the chance of having embryo transfer, - implantation rate - clinical pregnancy rate 2.

 In patients with Asherman's Syndrome, to determine: - the rate of return/normalization of menses - the chance of spontaneous pregnancy - the chance of embryo transfer Any adverse effects of study arm will be monitored and reported as appropriate.

 Platelet-rich Plasma (PRP) for Endometrial Regeneration and Repair@highlight

Patients with intrauterine adhesions (Asherman's Syndrome) and persistent thin endometrial lining in in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment programs, particularly those resistant to standard therapies, present a significant clinical challenge.

 The aim of this trial is to assess if intrauterine administration of platelet rich plasma (PRP) improves endometrial lining thickness in patients with thin lining or Asherman's Syndrome.
