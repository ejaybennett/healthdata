(thirdQuint)An International Survey on Aminoglycoside Practices in Critically Ill Patients: AMINO III Survey.

 Aminoglycosides are commonly used antibiotics for difficult to treat infections.

 However, aminoglycoside administration varies widely among countries.

 The aim of this multicenter observational study is to provide up-to-date and comprehensive descriptive data on current aminoglycoside (tobramycin, amikacin or gentamicin) use in a large cohort of critically ill patients in different countries.

 The benefits expected from this study are a better understanding of worldwide aminoglycoside prescription variability in critically ill patients and to determine the risk factors of inadequate aminoglycoside dosing regimens.
