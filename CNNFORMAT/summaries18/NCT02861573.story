(fifthQuint)Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Combination Therapies in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (MK-3475-365/KEYNOTE-365).

 Assignment of patients to a cohort will be based on prior treatment.

 Participants assigned to Cohort A must have previously received docetaxel for mCRPC.

 Participants assigned to Cohort B must have previously received either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide (but not both) in the pre-chemotherapy mCRPC state.

 Participants assigned to Cohort C must have previously received abiraterone acetate in the pre-chemotherapy mCRPC state (prior docetaxel for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is allowed if 4 weeks have elapsed from the last dose of docetaxel).

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) combination therapy in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

 There will be three cohorts in this study with 70 participants enrolled in each cohort: Cohort A will receive pembrolizumab + olaparib, Cohort B will receive pembrolizumab + docetaxel + prednisone, and Cohort C will receive pembrolizumab + enzalutamide.

 Outcome measures will be assessed individually for each cohort.
