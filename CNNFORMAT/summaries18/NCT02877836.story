(fifthQuint)Functional MRI and DTI in the Preoperative Assessment of Dystonia.

 Advances in the field of functional neurosurgery, neuroradiology and virus neuronal tracing studies have expanded our knowledge of the circuits underlying the clinical expression of several neurologic syndromes.

 Globus pallidus internus (GPi) Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a validated technique for the treatment of 'isolated dystonia'.

 The efficiency of this therapy in 'complex dystonia', commonly associated with focal brain lesions, is limited and heterogeneous.

 Broadening indications for DBS therapy to complex DDS disorders require further improvement of preoperative assessment of motor circuit functional reorganization and white matter integrity.

 The efficacy of neuromodulation in these clinical syndromes is determined by the severity of pyramidal involvement, the interactions between cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic and cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits and motor network reorganization at the cortical level.

 The aim of the study is to identify movement-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation patterns in a group of dystonic patients in comparison to healthy controls (HC).

 Further analysis will assess the recruitment pattern in different patient subgroups defined according to clinical and radiological criteria relevant to GPi DBS eligibility (hyperkinetic/ hypokinetic and prepallidal/ postpallidal).

 Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will be applied to the assessment of the topographic distribution and severity of white matter lesions in the group of dystonic patients in comparison with HC.

 Further knowledge concerning motor network organization and white matter integrity after focal brain lesions might contribute to the understanding of this mitigated response to DBS and to the refinement of DBS indications and techniques in secondary dystonia.

 Functional MRI and DTI in the Preoperative Assessment of Dystonia@highlight

The aim of this study is to evaluate the organization of the motor circuit in a group of patients suffering from dystonia compared with a group of healthy controls.

 Deep Brain stimulation is a functional neurosurgery technique consisting in neuromodulation of the motor circuit that has been applied to dystonia.

 The efficiency of this technique depends on the relative preservation of the function and the structure of the motor network .

 The assessment of neuronal circuit by advanced techniques of functional neuroimaging in this study might contribute to expand our understanding of the abnormalities in motor circuit activation and the integrity of CNS structure underlying dystonia.

 This study might contribute therefore to the refinement of Deep brain stimulation indications and techniques in complex dystonia syndromes
