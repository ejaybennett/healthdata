(fifthQuint)Effects of LopiGLIK on Cardiovascular Risk.

 The experimental design involves the construction of a multi-center, controlled, randomized, single-blind, versus Armolipid Plus(R).

 Patients with mild hypercholesterolemia, of both sexes and aged between 18 and 75 years, will be recruited, from the beginning of the study and for the next 2 weeks, from 30 Cv specialists and/or GPs (25 patients each).

 The subjects will be enrolled in the 50/50% male/female ratio 10% comparable for age, in order to obtain a proper comparison between groups with similar demographic characteristics or not statistically different.

 The subjects, selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be divided into two groups, subjected to centralized randomization at the "Diagnosis and Treatment of hypertension Center" to receive one of two different treatments, a tablet/day of the new nutraceutical LopiGLIK(R) (Akademy Pharma) containing Morus Alba, immediately after a meal, vs.

 a tablet/day of Armolipid Plus, always immediately after the meal.

 During the first two weeks both groups will follow the prescribed diet and assume the placebo.

 At the end, blood tests (traditional metabolic parameters, blood glucose, HbA1C, fasting insulin, transaminase levels, CPK) and the endothelial function will be assesed.

 During the next 16 weeks a group will assume LopiGLIK(R) (Akademy Pharma) containing Morus Alba, the other will assume Armolipid Plus and everyone will continue to follow the prescribed diet.

 At the end of this period blood tests will be repeated.

 Tablets of Armolipid Plus, LopiGLIK(R) and placebo will be provided by Akademy Pharma free of charge.

 Effects of LopiGLIK on Cardiovascular Risk@highlight

The study is designed to compare the effects of two combination of nutraceuticals: Armolipid Plus(R) and LopiGLIK(R) (Akademy Pharma), a new supplement that, in addition to Berberine and Red Rice, contains Morus Alba's extract.

 The study will analyze the impact of 16 week treatment with one of the combinations, according to a randomized scheme, on metabolic parameters in dyslipidemic subjects that do not require or not tolerate a statin therapy.

 In particular, it will assess the ability of the two combinations to reduce the levels of total and LDL cholesterol, HbA1C, glicaemia and insulin and increase those of HDL cholesterol.
