(thirdQuint)Messages and Plans to Increase Gym Utilization.

 Our study uses a survey methodology.

 Within the survey, participants are randomly assigned to experimental conditions.

 After completion of the survey, participants' real-world behavior is assessed via gym card swipe data.

 Within the survey, an experimental quantitative three group design will be used to answer our research question.

 Thus, our independent variable has three levels: the control message, the nudge message, and the boost message.

 Our dependent variable will be collected gym card swipes over the semester.

 The three experimental message conditions will be delivered within the questionnaire that participants complete.

 The control group will read only summary information about the David Pottruck Health and Fitness Center.

 Participants in the nudge condition will read a similar summary but will also be given a prompt to form an implementation intention.

 Those in the Boost condition will also have summary information about the Pottruck gym but will also be given information about why an implantation intention is an effective way to attain long term goals.

 They will also be given a prompt to form an implementation intention.

 Messages and Plans to Increase Gym Utilization@highlight

This primary object of this study is to test to the hypothesis that the both the nudge and boost messages will increase short term gym utilization relative to the control condition but that only the boost message will increase long-term gym utilization.

 Non-technical summary: College students will receive one of three messages about exercise.

 Their card swipe data as a measure of gym utilization will be tracked as an assessment of the effect of those messages.
