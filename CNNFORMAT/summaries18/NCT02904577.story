(firstQuint)Indolent Non Follicular Lymphomas Prognostic Project.

 The present study is designed as a prospective collection of information potentially useful to predict the prognosis of newly diagnosed patients with non-follicular low grade B-cell lymphoma.

 The study is aimed to verify whether a prognostic collection of data would allow the development of a more accurate prognostic assessment for non-follicular low grade B-cell lymphomas.
