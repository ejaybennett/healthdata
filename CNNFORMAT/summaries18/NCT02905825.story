 The BreathID(R) Hp system continuously measures breath via a nasal cannula and the BreathID(R) Hp Lab System measures breath collection bags before and after ingestion of a solution with enriched carbon 13 urea and citric acid.

 The stool sample will be provided within a week of the breath tests and will be analyzed by a central laboratory.
