(fifthQuint)CyberCycling to Reduce Therapeutic Side Effects and Improve Quality of Life in AYA Cancers.

 Objectives Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility (adherence; user acceptance: exercise tolerance, enjoyment and motivation) of performing an adaptive, moderate intensity, aerobic exercise program on a 'cybercycle' compared to control (stretching/resistance bands) in adolescent and young adults (AYA) with cancer.

 (Exploratory) Aim 2: To explore the effects of an adaptive, moderate intensity aerobic exercise program using a 'cybercycle' compared to control (stretching/resistance bands) on changes in fitness, body composition, quality of life (QoL), fatigue, sleep and cognition.

 Study Design/Overview: This study is a randomized trial in 20 adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors (15-30 years old) which will comparing two intervention arms: 1) aerobic exercise on a 'cybercycle' (stationary cycling with exergaming/videogaming); and, 2) a stretching/resistance band 'control' condition.

 CyberCycling to Reduce Therapeutic Side Effects and Improve Quality of Life in AYA Cancers@highlight

Only a few clinical trials evaluating the potential benefits of exercise have been conducted in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cancer and, no prior studies have evaluated the potential effects of 'cybercycling' (exergaming on a stationary bike) in AYA cancer survivors.

 Therefore, the study aims to conduct a pilot trial to determine feasibility (adherence, user acceptance) and to explore potential effects of a 'cybercycling' exercise program on fitness, body composition, quality of life, sleep and cognition.
