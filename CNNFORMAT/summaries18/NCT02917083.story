(fifthQuint)CD30 CAR T Cells, Relapsed CD30 Expressing Lymphoma (RELY-30).

 To prepare the CD30.

CAR T cells, research staff will take some blood from the subject.

 This would be drawn as 2 (two) separate blood collections.

 Alternatively, if the subject's blood counts are low, staff may collect the cells needed to prepare T cells by a pheresis procedure.

 This procedure will involve placing a needle in both arms, collecting the cells over 3 to 6 hours during which the subject will be required to lie relatively still.

 After the T cells have been collected, some of them will be activated stimulating them with antibodies and will then be infected with a retroviral vector (a special virus that can carries a new gene into cells) containing a new gene called anti-CD30 that will make an antibody to lymphoma cells.

 The trained cells are called CD30.

CAR T cells.

 Then, the cells will be tested to make sure that they kill lymphoma cells that express the CD30 antigen and not normal cells.

 The cells generated will be frozen and stored to give back to the subject.

 This is a dose escalation study.

 This means that at the beginning, patients will be started on the lowest doses (1 of 3 different levels) of CD30.

CAR T Cells.

 Once that dose schedule proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose.

 This process will continue until all 3 dose levels are studied.

 If the side effects are too severe, the dose will be lowered or the T cell infusions will be stopped.

 The risks of harm and discomfort from the study treatment may bear some relationship to the dose level.

 The potential for direct benefit, if any, may also vary with the dose level.

 Subjects will be given one injection of CD30.

CAR T cells.

 The injection will be on Day 0.

 The subject may be given a dose of Benadryl and Tylenol before the injection of T cells to minimize any possible allergic reaction.

 The injection will take 1-10 minutes.

 The subject will be monitored in the clinic after each injection for up to 3 hours.

 If the subject is not post autologous transplant they will receive treatment with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (chemotherapy drugs) before the CD30.

CAR T cells.

 These drugs will decrease the numbers of the patient's T cells before the CD30.

CAR T cells are infused.

 Although the investigators do not expect any effect on the tumor with the dose that the patient will receive, these drugs are part of many regimens that are used to treat lymphoma or leukemia.

 To learn more about the way the CD30.

CAR T cells are working and how long they last in the body, extra blood will be drawn.

 On the day that the subject receives the cells, blood will be taken before the cells are given and several hours afterwards.

 Other blood will be drawn at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks (optional), 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years.

 CD30 CAR T Cells, Relapsed CD30 Expressing Lymphoma (RELY-30)@highlight

The subject has a type of lymph gland cancer called Lymphoma.

 The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease.

 No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer.

 This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells.

 T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected with germs.

 Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they both have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

 Investigators hope that both will work better together.

 Investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them.

 They now want to test whether these genetically modified T cells given after chemotherapy will be more effective at killing cancer cells.

 The gene that will be put into the T cells makes an antibody called anti-CD30.

 This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30.

 Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

 For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells.

 When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor.

 These CD30 chimeric receptor-activated T cells (CD30.

CAR T cells) seem to kill some of the tumor, but they don't last very long and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.

 Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to multiply and grow to accomplish their functions, and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in circulation.

 Because of that, doctors may use chemotherapy drugs to decrease the level of circulating T cells prior to the CD30.

CAR T cells infusion.

 This is called "lymphodepletion".

 CD30.

CAR T cells have previously been studied in lymphoma patients.

 What is new for this study is that lymphodepletion chemotherapy will be administered in patients who are not post autologous transplant in the hope that it will result in more durable anti-tumor effects.
