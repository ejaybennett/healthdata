(fifthQuint)H7N9 Vaccination With and Without AS03 and Unadjuvanted H3N2v Vaccination: Standard and Systems Biology Analyses.

 This is a single center, randomized, partially-blinded, Phase II, small, targeted, prospective study in approximately 30 healthy male and non-pregnant female subjects aged 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, designed to evaluate and compare the immunogenicity between an intramuscular monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur given with and without AS03 adjuvant manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, and an intramuscular unadjuvanted monovalent inactivated influenza A/H3N2v virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur.

 The primary objectives include assessing the serum anti-HA hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) response to influenza A/H7N9 antigen (with and without adjuvant) at Day 57 (approximately one month after the second study vaccination with A/H7N9 vaccine AS03) and influenza A/H3N2v antigen at Day 29, identifying differentially expressed genes in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 29, and identifying differentially abundant cellular proteins in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 29.

 The secondary objectives are to compare plasma cytokine and chemokine profiles at specific time points and between treatment arms at post vaccination points, assess the neutralizing antibody responses to influenza A/H7N9 antigen, identify differentially expressed genes in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 8 following one intramuscular dose of influenza A/H3N2v , and identifying differentially abundant cellular proteins in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 8 following one intramuscular dose of influenza A/H3N2v vaccine compared to baseline assessments performed prior to study vaccination.
