(thirdQuint)Expanded Access of Omegaven IV Fat Emulsion to Infants and Children With PNALD.

 The etiology of parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) is currently considered multifactorial.

 Available treatment options for this disease process are limited and have achieved moderate success at best.

 Unlike conventional intravenous fat emulsions, Omegaven cent is comprised solely of fish oils containing primarily omega-3 fatty acids.

 The investigators hypothesize that administering Omegaven cent to patients with PNALD in place of conventional fat emulsion may reverse cholestasis allowing patients to be maintained on adequate PN until they are able to ingest adequate nutrition enterally.

 Expanded Access of Omegaven IV Fat Emulsion to Infants and Children With PNALD@highlight

This is an expanded access protocol for use of intravenous fish oil infusion, Omegaven, in infants and children with parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) to decrease elevated liver enzymes and direct bilirubin.

 This study aims to describe the response of PNALD after use of Omegaven by normalization of serum levels of liver enzymes and bilirubin.
