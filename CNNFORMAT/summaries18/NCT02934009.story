(secondQuint)Dermal Profile Analysis Using the NMR-MOUSE.

 Excretion of urine is impaired in terminal chronic kidney disease patients often requiring dialysis.

 Fluid management of dialysis patients is solely based on body weight differences before and after dialysis.

 Patients can suffer from either hypotension if too much fluid is eliminated by dialysis or from fluid-overload symptom (e.

g.

 shortness of breath, edema) if not enough fluid is eliminated.

 In this study a mobile non-invasive NMR-MOUSE setup (a nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurement) is used to measure the hydration status of the skin.

 Dermal Profile Analysis Using the NMR-MOUSE@highlight

The determination of fluid status in dialysis patients is a major clinical problem.

 In this study the NMR-MOUSE is used to determine if it can be used to non-invasively determine hydration status of the skin.

 This evaluation will be performed in dialysis patients and healthy volunteers.
