(thirdQuint)VASCADE ANTEGRADE-PVD Post-Market Registry.

 Due to the growing adoption of antegrade femoral access and the use of VCDs to close these arteriotomies, it is important to collect performance and complication outcomes data related to this procedural variable.

 The aim of this registry is to consistently collect prospective data on procedural outcomes on antegrade access cases closed with the VASCADE VCS in a way that is consistent with the RESPECT Study design and the FDA-approved Instructions for Use (IFU).

The objective of the registry is to collect procedural outcomes data when the Cardiva VASCADE Vascular Closure System (VCS) is used to seal femoral arterial access sites at the completion of ipsilateral peripheral interventional procedures performed through 5-7F introducer sheaths via an antegrade approach.
