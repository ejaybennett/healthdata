(fifthQuint)Avelumab (antiPDL1) and Azacytidine in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study part and dose level of avelumab based on when you join this study.

 If you are in Part A (Phase 1B), you will be assigned a dose level of avelumab.

 Up to 4 dose levels of avelumab will be tested.

 Up to 18 participants will be enrolled at each dose level.

 If intolerable side effects are seen in the participants who received the highest dose level, the next group of participants will receive a lower dose than the group before it.

 This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of avelumab is found.

 If you are in Part B (Phase 2), you will receive the highest tolerable dose of avelumab that was found in Part A.

 Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in Part B.

 If you are a Phase 1B participant and are receiving a lower dose of avelumab when the Phase 2 dose is found, your dose may be increased to the Phase 2 dose (but not higher).

 All participants will receive the same dose level of 5-azacytidine.

 Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 28 days.

 You will receive 5-azacytidine either by vein over about 10-40 minutes or as an injection under the skin on Days 1-7 or Days 1-5 and 8-9 of each cycle.

 You will receive avelumab by vein over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 14 of each cycle during Cycles 1-4, or until the disease is in complete remission (has completely disappeared), whichever comes first.

 When the disease is in complete remission, you will receive avelumab by vein only on Day 1 of each cycle.

 Your health will be checked for up to 2 hours after the infusion.

 You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects.

 You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

 Length of Study: You may receive the study drugs for up to 24 cycles, or for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

 Study Visits: On Day 1 of each cycle, you will have a physical exam, EKG, and blood/urine will be collected for routine tests.

 Twice weekly for Cycles 1-3, and then every 2-4 weeks after that, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 On Day 28 of Cycle 1 and then every 1-4 cycles after that, you will have a bone marrow aspirate for cytogenetic testing and to check the status of the disease.

 Your doctor will tell you when you will have this procedure.

 After the first cycle of treatment, you may be able to receive the 5-azacytidine injections or infusions at an outside clinic close to home.

 End-of-Study Visit: About 30 days after your last dose of study drugs: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate for cytogenetic testing and to check the status of the disease.

 Follow-Up: Every 3-6 months for up to 5 years after the last dose of study drugs: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 If the doctor thinks it is needed and the disease has not gotten worse, you may have a bone marrow aspirate every 6-12 months for 5 years after your last dose of the study drug.

 If you cannot come to the clinic for these follow-up visits, you may be called by a member of the study staff to ask how you are doing.

 These calls should last about 10 minutes each time.

 Avelumab (antiPDL1) and Azacytidine in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)@highlight

This clinical research study has 2 parts: Part A and Part B.

 The goal of Part A is to find the highest tolerable dose of avelumab that can be given in combination with 5-azacytidine to patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

 The goal of Part B is to learn if the highest tolerable dose of this drug combination found in Part A can help to control the disease.

 The safety of this drug combination will also be studied in both parts of the study.

 This is an investigational study.

 Avelumab is not FDA approved or commercially available.

 It is currently being used for research purposes only.

 5-azacytidine is FDA approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

 Its use in combination with avelumab is investigational.

 The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

 Up to 58 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
