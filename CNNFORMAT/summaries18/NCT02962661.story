(fifthQuint)Trial With Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) vs Standard of Care in Cardiomyopathy.

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 3 study groups.

 This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

 - If you are in Group 1, you will receive MSCs by vein and standard of care drugs for heart failure at MD Anderson.

 - If you are in Group 2, you will receive MSCs injected into your heart at Baylor St.

 Luke's Medical Center (BSLMC) and standard of care drugs for heart failure at MD Anderson.

 You will have an additional screening visit 1 week before your procedure.

 At this visit you will sign an additional consent form for the screening and procedure visits at BSLMC.

 - If you are in Group 3, you will only receive standard of care drugs for heart failure.

 You will have an equal chance of being assigned to each group.

 Study Drug Administration: If you are in Group 1, you will receive MSCs by vein over about 10-20 minutes 1 time each week for 4 weeks in the outpatient clinic at MD Anderson.

 You will remain in the clinic for up to 6 hours after each MSC infusion so the study staff may check you for any side effects.

 You will also receive standard of care drugs for heart failure.

 The study doctor will tell you which drugs you are taking, their risks, and when you should take them.

 If you are in Group 2, you will sign separate consent forms at BSLMC.

 You may have to have additional screening tests and/or screening tests repeated.

 This will be explained to you.

 You will have a procedure where the doctor will insert a long, narrow tube, called a catheter, into a blood vessel, usually in your leg, and then guide the catheter to your heart with the help of a special x-ray machine.

 X-ray dye is then injected through the catheter so that the x-ray machine can take pictures/video of your heart.

 This procedure is called a cardiac catheterization/left heart ventricular angiography.

 The doctor then uses a special device, called NOGA, which monitors your heart function.

 This procedure, referred to as NOGA mapping, will help your doctor find out which part of your heart muscle is still healthy but is not receiving enough blood and oxygen because this is the part that is most likely to respond to the MSC injections.

 This helps the doctor decide where to inject the MSCs.

 Your doctor will use a special catheter with a retractable needle to inject the study product into the damaged area of your heart muscle.

 This catheter is investigational and not approved by the FDA.

 There will be about 15 injections of a very small amount (a drop) of fluid containing millions of cells into your heart muscle.

 Following the procedure, you will be watched overnight.

 If you are in Group 3, you will receive standard of care drugs for heart failure.

 The study doctor will tell you which drugs you are taking, their risks, and when you should take them.

 Study Visits: On Days 1, 14, 21, and 28 (+/- 5 days), if you are in Group 1 or 3: - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your heart and liver function.

 - On Day 28 only, you will have an ECHO.

 If you are in Group 2, on the day of the procedure: - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your heart and liver function.

 - You will have 3 EKGs in a row and an ECHO.

 One (1) time each month during Months 1-6, all participants: - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your heart and liver function.

 At Months 3 and 6, this blood will also be used for biomarker testing.

 At Month 6, this blood will be used for antibody testing.

 - You will have a follow-up visit with your cardiologist.

 If you are in Group 3, you will have a follow-up visit with your cardiologist one (1) time each month during Months 2-6.

 - You will have a follow-up visit with your transplant doctor.

 If you are in Group 3, you will have a follow-up visit with your transplant doctor one (1) time each month during Months 2-6.

 - At Months 3 and 6 only, you will have an EKG.

 - At Months 2 and 6 only, you will have an ECHO.

 At Month 12: - You will have a follow-up visit with your transplant doctor.

 - You will have a follow-up visit with your cardiologist.

 - You will have an EKG and ECHO.

 Length of Study: If you are in Group 1, you will be able to receive up to 4 infusions of MSCs.

 If you are in Group 2, you will be receive about 15 injections of MSCs during the procedure.

You will no longer be able to receive the MSCs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 If you are in Group 3, your length of treatment will depend on the standard of care therapy chosen.

 Your participation in this study will be over after Month 12.

 Trial With Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) vs Standard of Care in Cardiomyopathy@highlight

Any time the words "you," "your," "I," or "me" appear, it is meant to apply to the potential participant.

 The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to standard of care drugs can help control heart failure that may have been caused by anthracyclines.

 The safety of the MSCs will also be studied.

 MSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases, such as heart failure.

 The MSCs used in this study were collected from healthy donors and are stored and grown in a lab at MD Anderson.

 This is an investigational study.

 MSCs are not FDA-approved or commercially available.

 They are being used for research purposes only.

 The study doctor can explain how they are designed to work.

 Up to 72 participants will be take part in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
