(thirdQuint)Fibrinolysis Compared to Thoracoscopy for Pleural Infection.

 Background: Pleural infection (empyema or complex parapneumonic effusion (CPPE)) represents one of the most common clinical diagnoses encountered in clinical practice in the United States (US) It is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality despite advances in medical diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

 Objective: Compare two standard of care treatments: TPA/DNase vs early medical Thoracoscopy Methods: We will conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial.

 We plan to enroll a total of 80 patients and randomize them to either Medical Thoracoscopy group or Fibrinolytic Therapy group.

 Follow-up will be daily until hospital discharge and at 6 and 12 weeks in the outpatient setting Primary Outcome: Duration of hospital stay after intervention Secondary Outcome: Failure rate of assigned treatment and adverse events Potential Outcome and Benefit: Determine best strategy for treating patients with pleural infection.

The purpose of this prospective randomized clinical trial is to compare two currently accepted standard-of-care treatment strategies: Medical thoracoscopy as compared to instillation of intrapleural tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA) and human recombinant Deoxyribonuclease (DNase) for the management of empyema or complex parapneumonic effusion (CPPE) in adults.
