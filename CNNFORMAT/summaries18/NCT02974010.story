(fifthQuint)Sequential Therapy for the Treatment of Severe Bipolar Depression.

.

 NeuroRx is developing NRX-101, a fixed-dose combination oral capsule composed of d-cycloserine (DCS) and lurasidone for the maintenance of remission from Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) in adults with Bipolar Depression following initial stabilization.

 The proposed oral combination product is intended to be administered as part of a sequential therapy consisting of the following 2 components: 1.

 an initial, one-time intravenous (iv) infusion of ketamine (0.

5 mg/kg administered over 40 min), followed one day later by 2.

 twice daily oral capsules of NRX 101 (DCS + lurasidone), dosing of which is initiated 1 day after ketamine administration, titrated over 5 days to a maintenance dose and continued for up to 6 weeks.

 Each NRX-101 oral capsule contains DCS (237.

5 or 175.

0 mg) and lurasidone (8.

25, 16.

5, or 33.

0 mg).

 It is anticipated that subjects entering the study will be receiving concurrent disorder-directed treatment with various predefined combinations of medications.

 This treatment regime will be maintained upon entry into the study.

 However, any use of lurasidone, quetiapine, or olanzapine will be stopped at study entry, so as to avoid either duplication with study drug (groups 1 and 2) or undermining of the control group.

 The clinical efficacy goal is to provide extended relief from symptoms associated with ASIB in adults with Bipolar Disorder, and allow effective treatment with NRX-101 dosing initiated one day (24 hours) after initial stabilization with iv ketamine in a clinic, emergency department, or inpatient setting.

 NRX-101 contains the same active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oral products Seromycin (Cycloserine Capsules, USP; ANDA 060593; Purdue GMP) and Latuda (lurasidone HCL) tablets for oral administration (NDA 200603; Sunovion Pharma, Inc.

).

 The proposed NRX-101 product takes advantage of a unique synergistic confluence of 2 approved medications with long histories of safety following the administration of a single dose of ketamine.

 All components of this treatment are currently FDA-approved for use in conditions other than ASIB.

 The goals of combining these drugs into a single course of treatment is to maximize the beneficial effects of the specific subcomponents while overcoming potential treatment-limiting side effects associated with those subcomponents.

 Beneficial effects of the proposed dosage regimen include 1) well-documented pharmacodynamic effects of ketamine in treating both persistent depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in bipolar disorder (McCloud, 2015; Naughton, 2014; Newport, 2015; Price, 2014), 2) well-documented pharmacodynamic effects of oral DCS against persistent symptoms of depression (Heresco-Levy, 2013) and 3) the FDA-approved efficacy of lurasidone in treatment-resistant depression (Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, 2013).

 Due to the synergistic effects, the proposed NRX-101 combination capsule is also expected to avoid or minimize the significant undesired adverse effects associated with the usage of these drugs as single agents (eg, negative consequences of repeated use of ketamine (JHP Pharmaceuticals, 2012), potential psychotomimetic effects of long-term treatment with DCS alone (Kantrowitz, 2010) and potential akathisia and susceptibility for increased suicidality associated with lurasidone alone (Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, 2013).

 The risk of ASIB is higher in bipolar depression than other psychiatric disorder and the majority of currently available antidepressants are contraindicated for patients with bipolar depression.

 NeuroRx believes that the proposed NRX-101 treatment regimen (ketamine administration followed by NRX-101) will demonstrate superiority over ketamine followed by lurasidone and over ketamine alone in delaying the time to documented relapse from depression in bipolar disorder, providing a new treatment option for ASIB patients.

 There is currently no FDA-approved product for the treatment of ASIB.

 NeuroRx proposes that NRX-101 will fulfill an urgent medical need for safe and effective treatment for ASIB.

 Patients with Bipolar Depression and ASIB will be recruited in both inpatient and outpatient settings and, following informed consent, will be given an intravenous infusion of ketamine 0.

5mg/kg over 40 minutes.

 Those who exhibit a satisfactory clinical response to ketamine will be randomly allocated to NRX-101 or to a comparator group.

 The primary outcome variable is time to relapse as defined by a return to baseline in either depression or suicidality as determined by the treating physician or the need to institute a new treatment plan.
