(secondQuint)Study to Assess the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Single Dose of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Meningococcal MenACWY-CRM Vaccine (Menveo), Administered to Subjects 15 Through 55 Years of Age, Approximately 4-6 Years After Primary ACWY Vaccination.

 This is a phase 3b, controlled, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of Menveo after a single vaccination in healthy individuals who were vaccinated with Menveo or Menactra 4 to 6 years before and in vaccine-naive individuals.

 Vaccine-naive subjects: subjects who have not received any meningococcal vaccine prior to participation to this clinical trial.

 Subjects will be randomised into one of the two different blood draw schedules according to a 1:1 ratio.

 - Blood draws at Day 1, Day 4 and Day 29 - Blood draws at Day 1, Day 6 and Day 29.
