(thirdQuint)The Use of Resting State, fMRI and DTI in the Identification of Chronic Pain Conditions.

 Resting state fMRI scans of chronic pain sufferers may be sufficiently different from scans of normal subjects to allow a high level of classification accuracy of whether subjects have chronic pain.

 In addition, investigators will utilize DTI and a brief activation state using pain rumination to assess whether investigators can reliably find differences between chronic pain sufferers and healthy normals.

 The analysis will use pattern recognition methods in a leave N out cross validation design.

 The success of the classifications will be the mean of all the validation runs.
