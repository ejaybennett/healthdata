(fifthQuint)Investigating Psychosocial Intervention Treatment Response in Justice-Involved Youth With Conduct Disorder.

 CD is a youth-limited neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impulsivity and dysfunctional social behavior.

 CD is associated with increased risks of mortality, lower educational and occupational achievement, criminal behavior and other psychosocial difficulties, and hence presents a significant burden to society.

 Impulsivity is a prominent predictor of violence in CD.

 Treatment programs targeting impulsivity in CD have been shown to be effective at increasing pro-social functioning in CD, but the biological mechanisms that underpin these therapeutic gains are not well understood.

 Past research suggests cortisol and the ACC play a role in CD and impulsivity.

 This study explores biological and behavioral changes in response to Stop, Now and Plan Youth Justice Model (SNAP YJ), a validated 13-week psychosocial intervention addressing impulsivity and self-control in youth offenders The main hypotheses are: 1.

 CD youth who respond to SNAP YJ treatment will exhibit greater post-treatment ACC activation during an fMRI imaging task compared with their baseline, pre-treatment ACC activation.

 2.

 CD youth who respond to SNAP YJ treatment will exhibit a higher post-treatment cortisol awakening response (CAR) compared with their baseline, pre-treatment CAR.

 The secondary hypotheses are: 1.

 CD youth will exhibit lower ACC activation at baseline during an fMRI imaging task compared with the baseline ACC activation exhibited by typically developing youth.

 2.

 CD youth will manifest a lower baseline CAR compared with the baseline CAR of typically developing youth.

 Investigating Psychosocial Intervention Treatment Response in Justice-Involved Youth With Conduct Disorder@highlight

This research focuses on justice-involved youth with conduct disorder (CD) and a history of violence.

 CD is a youth-limited neurodevelopmental disorder that is commonly associated with criminality.

 Although psychosocial interventions that address impulsivity and self-control have been shown to be effective at helping promote prosocial behavior in patients with CD, the biological changes that occur as a result of treatment are not well understood.

 This study will explore changes in cortisol (a stress hormone) and the brain function of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in response to a common psychosocial intervention (Stop, Now and Plan Youth Justice Model).

 This study will contribute to our understanding of biological mechanisms involved in therapeutic gains among youth offenders and thereby inform further development of treatment programs for justice-involved youth.
