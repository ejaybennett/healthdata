(thirdQuint)Prison Connect-STI/HIV Prevention Intervention for Couples Affected by Incarceration.

 This pilot study will recruit male inmates in the Connecticut Department of Correction and their community-dwelling female partner.

 Using an adapted version of an efficacious couples-level HIV prevention intervention for community populations (CONNECT; PI: El-Bassel), this study will pilot test a single in-prison intervention session using face-to-face or teleconferencing modalities and a brief community follow-up session.

 Feasibility and acceptability among the inmates and their partners will be assessed.
