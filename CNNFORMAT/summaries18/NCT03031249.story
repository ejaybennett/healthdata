(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Safety of ATO Plus ATRA in Nucleophosmin-1 Mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 In this open-label, randomized, prospective clinical trial, NPM1- mutated AML patients who have reached CR are randomized into two groups.

 In experimental group, patients receive cytarabine at a dose of 3g//d on the first, third and fifth day, ATRA at a dose of 30mg//d on day 1-14 and ATO at a dose of 0.

15mg/kg/d (maximum, 10mg/d) on day 1-14.

 Patients in control group only receive high dose of cytarabine.

 The safety and efficacy of ATRA plus ATO regimen is evaluated.

The primary outcome is relapse-free survival rate after treatment.
