(thirdQuint)Protonics Knee Brace Versus Hamstring Resisted Exercise (HRE) on Individuals With Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome.

 The purpose of this graduate student research study is to compare the effect of Protonics knee brace and Hamstring Resisted Exercise (HRE) on anterior pelvic tilt, hip internal rotation and adduction, and knee pain in subjects with Patellofemoral pain symptoms (PFPS) and examine the reliability and validity of self-report patellofemoral disability index (PDI) as a measure of functional performance in subjects with PFPS.

 There will be three visits over 4 weeks for 1 hour per visit, but the first visit will take about 2 hours.

 In visit one, participants will be asked to sign an informed consent, complete five questionnaires.

 Then, your hip range of motion (ROM), pelvic tilt angle, and lateral step-up test will be measured.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: group one receiving the Protonics knee brace exercise, and a home program or group two getting the hamstring-resisted exercise using sport cord and home program.

 Participant in both groups will walk a specific distance in each phase.

 Phase I (walk 5 min in straight surface), Phase II (walk 8 min in inclined surface), and Phase III (walk 10 min in different direction).
