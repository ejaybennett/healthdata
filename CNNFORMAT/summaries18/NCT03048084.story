(thirdQuint)Seizure Treatment in Glioma.

 Currently, treatment of glioma patients with a specific anti-epileptic drug (AED) mainly depends on the physicians' preference, as there is no robust evidence from randomized controlled trials supporting the use of one specific anticonvulsant above the other in glioma patients.

 Levetiracetam and valproic acid are the most commonly used AEDs in glioma patients.

 Both drugs are used for the treatment of seizures, have similar toxicity profiles and are non-enzyme inducing AEDs, therefore not interfering with chemotherapeutic drugs.

 However, it is not known whether one drug is more effective than the other in reducing seizures.

 Seizure Treatment in Glioma@highlight

Currently, treatment with a specific anti-epileptic drug mainly depends on the physicians' preference, as there are no studies supporting the use of one specific anticonvulsant in glioma patients.

 The overall aim of this randomized controlled trial is to directly compare the effectiveness of treatment with levetiracetam or valproic acid in glioma patients with a first seizure.
