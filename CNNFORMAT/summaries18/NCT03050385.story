(secondQuint)Cognitive Rehabilitation During Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation.

 This study explores the additive effect of transcranial direct stimulation compared to sham stimulation during cognitive rehabilitation tasks in mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia patients.

 Potential participants are recruited by physicians' referral or self-entry.

 Informed consent by a clinical research coordinator and research physician is performed followed by screening.

 Participants who passed screening go through 10 sessions of active or sham transcranial direct current stimulation and are evaluated their cognitive function at screening, at the end, and two weeks after the intervention.

 For quality assurance, independent researcher regularly monitor and audit as participants are enrolled in the trial.
