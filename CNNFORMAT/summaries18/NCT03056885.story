(secondQuint)Inflammatory Local Response During OLV: Protective vs Conventional Ventilation Strategy.

 One-lung ventilation (OLV) is a ventilation procedure used for pulmonary resection often causing lung injury.

 International guidelines have recommended for years the use of conventional ventilation (CV) with high tidal volume (VT) (8-10 ml\kg).

A body of recent evidences have shown that conventional ventilation can reduce systemic oxygenation, increase inflammatory products and cause lung tissue damage.

 In this study we compare the conventional strategy , consisted of Vt 10 mL/kg, with the protective strategy, consisted of Vt 5 mL/kg.

 Both Vt were based on predicted body weight (PBW).

 Broncho-alveolar lavages (BAL) are selectively performed in the dependent (ventilated) lung before and at the end of the OLV.

 The levels of pro-inflammatory (IL-1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF) and anti-inflammatory (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, INF) cytokines are evaluated.

 We also evaluate patients clinical outcomes in terms of incidence of postoperative respiratory complications and length of stay.

 Inflammatory Local Response During OLV: Protective vs Conventional Ventilation Strategy@highlight

This study evaluates the local cytokine inflammatory response during one lung ventilation in patients undergoing pulmonary lobectomy or wedge resection.

 We compare two different ventilation strategies: a conventional strategy with a protective strategy.
