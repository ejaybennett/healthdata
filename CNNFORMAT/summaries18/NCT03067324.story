(secondQuint)Quality Control of Pancreatic Islet Intended to Islet Graft Cells Intended to Stabilot Islet Graft Protocol.

 Islet quality control after pancreatic islets isolation process is insufficient.

 The Islet Chip study proposes to develop a bio-sensor that will allow a multi-parametric analysis of islet graft based on measurement of islet membrane electric potential.

 The project aims to : - develop the bio-sensor necessary to measure islet membrane electric potential - develop interface between bio-sensor and user - correlate analysis data collected by bio-sensor with metabolic results of islet graft.
