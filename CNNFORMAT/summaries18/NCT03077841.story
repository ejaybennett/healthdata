 Optimizing Preventative Adjuvant Linac-Based Radiation: the OPAL Trial - Study of Hypofractionated Partial Breast Irradiation in Women With Early Stage Breast Cancer@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the side effects that may occur after radiation is given to breast cancer patients for 2 to 2 1/2 weeks at the part of the breast where the disease first started.

 Researchers also want to learn if this treatment can help to control the disease and prevent the cancer from coming back in the breast.

 This is an investigational study.

 Radiation therapy will be delivered using FDA approved and commercially available methods.

 The shorter radiation treatment period is considered investigational.

 The study doctor can explain how radiation is designed to work.

 Up to 150 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study.
