(fifthQuint)Ceritinib + Trametinib in Patients With Advanced ALK-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

 This is a phase I/II study of ceritinib and trametinib in Stage IIIB or IV ALK rearranged NSCLC.

 The phase I portion is a standard 3+3 dose escalation study starting at dose level 1 and will be open to any patient with ALK-rearranged, or ROS-1 rearranged NSCLC.

 The phase II portion will consist of 3 single arm cohorts in ALK-rearranged NSCLC: - Cohort A (ALKi Naive): 20 evaluable patients - Cohort B (Post-crizotinib PD): 21 evaluable patients - Cohort C (PD second line ALK TKI (e.

g.

, alectinib, ceritinib, PF-06463922 or - AP21163): 10 evaluable patients.

 The aim will be to enroll up to 69 patients.

 Patients may continue treatment for up to 24 months from the time of study entry, and will receive 12 months of follow-up following completion of the drugs.

 Ceritinib + Trametinib in Patients With Advanced ALK-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)@highlight

This is a phase I/II study of ceritinib and trametinib in Stage IIIB or IV anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 The Phase I portion will investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination of ceritinib and trametinib in ALK or ROS-1 rearranged NSCLC.

 The Phase II portion will investigate the clinical efficiency of the combination of ceritinib and trametinib in 3 single arm cohorts: ALKi (ALK inhibitor) naive patients; post-crizotinib progressed disease (PD) patients; and PD second line ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) patients.
