(fifthQuint)Nutritional Rehabilitation in Senegalese HIV-infected Children and Adolescents.

 Background: Severe (SAM, BMI-z BMI-z 7 years and health workers).

 Methods: This is an open cohort study (intervention/evaluation) conducted over 2 years.

 Children with SAM will be enrolled in a rehabilitation protocol, using Plumpy Nut (200kcal/kg/d) until the target weight is reached, BMI-z > -1.

5.

 Children with MAM will be enrolled in a rehabilitation protocol, using Plumpy Sup (75kcal/kg/d).

 At enrollment and at discharge from the rehabilitation protocols, a blood sample will be collected for an immunovirological, biological and selected proteins and micronutrients assessment.

 At each visit, a clinical examination and anthropometric measurements will be performed.

 At enrollment and after discharge, focus groups will be conducted with children > 7 years about their understanding and perception of the study protocol and of the nutritional care.

 Before enrollments start and at the end of the study, interviews will be conducted with the health workers involved in the study to explore their understanding of the study and their perceptions about the acceptability, effectiveness and feasibility of the nutritional rehabilitation of HIV children.

 Overall acceptability of RUF will be assessed in children by questionnaires at 3 time points during the study follow-up.

 Expected outcomes: Implementation of the recent recommendations on early ART initiation in children should allow the integration of targeted and appropriate nutritional interventions.

 The SNAC's Study will disseminate the first scientific data on modalities, acceptability and efficacy of nutritional rehabilitation in HIV-infected older children and adolescents in Africa.

 As it complies with international and national recommendations, it will also provide programmatic data, with regards to feasibility of outpatient nutritional rehabilitation using RUTF in HIV-infected adolescents, to national stakeholders and decision makers.

 It is ultimately expected to facilitate effective integration of these vulnerable patients both in nutritional care guidelines and follow-up health structures.

 Nutritional Rehabilitation in Senegalese HIV-infected Children and Adolescents@highlight

Severe (SAM, Body Mass Index-z BMI-z < -2) acute malnutrition, highly prevalent in HIV-infected children and adolescents, is an independent risk factor of death, even when antiretroviral treatment (ART) is initiated.

 The objectives of the SNAC'S study are to assess acceptability and effectiveness of outpatient nutritional rehabilitation, using ready-to-use food (RUF), elaborated in compliance with national and international recommendations and implemented in HIV-infected children and adolescents, under active follow-up in the 12 main pediatric HIV care sites in Senegal and presenting with SAM or MAM.
