(secondQuint)Measuring Cell Free DNA During the Course of Treatment for Esophageal Cancer as a Marker of Response and Recurrence.

 Esophageal carcinoma is an aggressive malignancy and about a third of patients present with distant metastatic disease.

 While survival is slowly improving with better diagnostic tools and therapy, the overall 5-year survival remains low at 18%.

 Unlike other malignancies, such as colon cancer and prostate cancer, there is no peripheral blood marker of response or recurrence during treatment in esophageal cancer.

 However, quantifying cfDNA is a unique and tumor specific avenue that may allow real time response to treatment in esophageal cancer.

 To identify esophageal cancer specific mutations, tumor samples will undergo whole exome sequencing.

 From this data, the investigators will select 10-15 genes to focus their efforts.

 PCR primers will be designed to detect these tumor specific mutations in the cell-free component of peripheral blood samples over the course of treatment for esophageal cancer.

 The investigators will obtain baseline blood (before treatment) and then collect blood after neoadjuvant treatment, after surgery, and then at subsequent visits from the participants.
