(fifthQuint)Vascular Changes in Pre-Eclamptic Patients and Its Impact on Pregnancy Outcome.

.

 Pre-eclampsia affects 2-8% of all pregnancies, although treatment is generally effective.

 However, 10-15% of direct maternal deaths are associated with Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia(WHO, 2011).

 There is a considerable evidence that generalized endothelial dysfunction underlies the clinical manifestations of the disease (Oladipupo et al.

, 2014).

 It has been demonstrated that peripheral nutritive blood flow is impaired in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and precedes onset of the disorder (Kenny et al.

, 2014).

 The pathophysiological mechanism is characterized by a failure of the trophoblastic invasion of the spiral arteries which may be associated with an increased vascular resistance of the uterine artery and a decreased perfusion of placenta.

 (Al-Jameil et al ; 2014 ) Ultrasound of the brachial artery, and Doppler ultrasound of the carotid artery and uterine artery are propaedeutic , non-invasive methods that contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiology of PE and Eclampsia (Takata et al.

, 2002 ).

 Doppler assessment of the placental circulation plays an important role in screening for impaired placentation and its complications of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and perinatal death.

 Assessment of the fetal circulation is essential in the better understanding of the pathophysiology of a wide range of pathological pregnancies and their clinical management(Ghidini & Vergani, 2012).

 Vascular Changes in Pre-Eclamptic Patients and Its Impact on Pregnancy Outcome.

@highlight

Normal pregnancy is associated with vasodilation and decreased peripheral resistance, which is detected as early as 5 weeks' gestation .

 Pre-eclampsia is a multi-system disorder of the second half of pregnancy , which is characterized by increased vascular reactivity and peripheral resistance with pathological changes that are consistent with impaired blood flow to the affected vascular beds.

 Investigators will evaluate fetal and maternal vascular changes in normotensive and pre-eclamptic patients by Ultrasound and Doppler and their impact on prediction of pregnancy outcome.
