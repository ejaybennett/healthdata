(firstQuint)Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy for the Patients With Pancreatic Cancer.

 The trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of dendritic cell Immunotherapy for the patients with pancreatic cancer.

 Dendritic cells are obtained from blood monocytes using standard protocol.

 Two options for dendritic cell priming are used: MUC-1/WT-1 peptides for the patients with unresectable tumor and/or tumor lysates for the patients undergoing tumor resection.

 The dendritic cells are them matured and injected subcutaneous (all patients) and intratumorally (when possible).
