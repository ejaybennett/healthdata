(thirdQuint)Lay Health Worker Outreach in Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening in Asian Americans.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the efficacy of lay health worker (LHW) outreach on colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among 3 Asian American groups (Filipinos, Hmong, and Koreans) in a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing CRC education delivered by LHWs (intervention) to a CRC brochure and nutrition education (control).

 II.

 Examine the processes through which LHWs communicate with, connect to, and convince community members from 3 Asian American cultures of the importance of CRC screening using mixed methods.

 OUTLINE: Lay health workers (LHWs) are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

 GROUP I (CRC EDUCATION): LHWs undergo training over 3 days and recruit 15 participants from their social network.

 Participants attend a CRC educational session conducted by an LWH over 90 minutes at month 1 and 3.

 Participants receive phone calls from the LWH at months 2 and 4 reminding them about CRC screening.

 GROUP II (CRC BROCHURE): LHWs undergo training over 3 days and recruit 15 participants from their social network.

 Participants attend a lecture on healthy nutrition for cardiovascular health presented by a professional health educator at months 1 and 3.

 After the first meeting, participants receive a brochure on CRC screening.

 Participants receive phone calls from the LWH at months 2 and 4 regarding changes in their nutritional behavior.

 Participants may attend an optional post-intervention LHW outreach session on CRC screening.

 After completion of the study, patients are followed up at 2 months.
