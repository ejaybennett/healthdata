(fifthQuint)Improve Access to Cervical Cancer Screening.

 Every woman aged from 25 to 65 years met in a the Doctors of the World's programs will attend to a prevention consultation about sexual and reproductive health and cervical cancer screening.

 8 programs are included at this study: medical centers and mobile programs, in five french cities.

 Those programs intends to facilitate access to care for people who does not have access for different reasons :no health insurance, living far from health services, doesn't know prevention or health system in France.

 After the dedicated consultation, one intervention will be proposed : - Either an orientation to health centers partners for a pap smear test (arm "Pap test") - Or a vaginal HPV self-sampling on site, and after results an orientation to health centers partners for a pap smear test (arm"HPV self sampling + Pap test") The inclusion of women in one or the other arm will be done through randomization: 7 periods of one month with a proposition of vaginal HPV self-sampling and 7 periods of one month without vaginal HPV self-sampling.

 Each period with a proposition of HPV self-sampling will be followed by a period without HPV self-sampling, to prevent the seasonality impact.

 The first period have been randomized for each program.

 To lead this consultation, prevention team members have been trained on how to lead the consultation and specifically how to deal with sexual and reproductive health, cervical cancer screening topics and counseling.

 Illustrated tools have been specially developed for this purpose.

 Professional translators will be involved in consultation when needed.

 Improve Access to Cervical Cancer Screening@highlight

Every year, in France, 3 000 women are diagnosed for cervical cancer, and 1 000 die each year.

 The incidence of this cancer is very inequal: recent studies found regional, social and economical inequalities.

 Currently, in France, the pap-smear test is the reference in prevention for cervical neoplasia (CIN) and cancer screening.

 Screening and treatment allowed to reduce the incidence and the mortality by cervical cancer by half, since the two last decades.

 But many women are still not reached by prevention programs, especially precarious women.

 In 2013, Doctors of the World France evaluated that almost 70% of women aged from 25 to 65 years coming in its medical center had never benefit of a pap-smear test.

 The objective of this study is to compare the rate of participation in the pap-smear screening with the proposition of a prevention consultation about sexual and reproductive health associated or not with the proposition of a vaginal Human Papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling.
