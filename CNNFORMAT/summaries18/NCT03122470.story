(thirdQuint)Correlation of Imaging Findings With Clinical Findings and Patient Outcomes in Prostate Cancer.

 The study team hypothesizes that strategic use of advanced MRI methods will provide a more accurate and less invasive approach for diagnosis and management of prostate cancer.

 The primary objectives are: 1.

 To develop advanced MRI methods and optimal MRI protocols for detection, staging, and follow-up of prostate cancer.

 2.

 To evaluate the diagnostic performance of MRI-guided biopsy methods and correlate MRI findings with the pathological grade of cancer.

 3.

 To correlate prostate MRI findings and biopsy results with patient progress and outcomes.

 4.

 To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in disease re-classification in patients on active surveillance.

 Secondary Objectives: 1.

 To apply computer-aided advanced image analytic techniques (Computer-assisted diagnostics- CAD) to extract MRI features of patient clinical scans that correlate with diagnosis and grade of prostate cancer.

 2.

 To study MRI features of lesions that mimic prostate cancer on imaging eg - chronic prostatitis, post treatment changes.

 3.

 To evaluate the impact of MRI in decision making and choice of treatment by physicians and patients.

 Correlation of Imaging Findings With Clinical Findings and Patient Outcomes in Prostate Cancer@highlight

MRI is being increasingly relied upon for detection, staging and management of prostate cancer.

 In this study patients with risk of prostate cancer will be recommended to have a pelvic MRI prior to the standard biopsy of the prostate and standard treatment of any detected prostate cancer.

 The results of the MRI will be compared to standard diagnosis techniques to see if cancer can be more accurately detected.
