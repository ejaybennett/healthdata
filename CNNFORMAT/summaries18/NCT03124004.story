(thirdQuint)Evaluation of the Intra- and Post- Operative Bleeding After Periodontal Debridement in Direct Anticoagulant Patients.

 Many protocols of drug suspension for surgical procedure has been designed, since the introduction of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications.

 Nowadays it is not certain if suspension could give more costs than benefits for the clinical procedure itself.

 With the recent development of the Direct Oral Anticoagulant it is still unclear whether these medications might bring more bleeding events in the intra-operative and post-operative phase after periodontal causal therapy, equal to, or more than Oral Anticoagulant Therapy.

 The purpose of this study is to assess the degree of intra- and post-operative bleeding complication between direct oral anticoagulant therapy patients and Oral Anticoagulant Therapy patients for periodontal debridement.

 Evaluation of the Intra- and Post- Operative Bleeding After Periodontal Debridement in Direct Anticoagulant Patients@highlight

Direct Oral Anticoagulants were recently approved for medical treatment of several condition such as, non valvular atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis, and others, substituting sometimes the conventional oral anticoagulants.

 The aim of the present study is to observe the possible difference in intra-operative and post-operative bleeding events for periodontal debridement.
