(thirdQuint)Study of Pembrolizumab and Cabozantinib in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.

 Primary Objectives - To determine the efficacy based on objective response rate [ORR = complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib when administered in combination in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

 Secondary Objectives - To characterize dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination.

 - To assess other measures of anti-tumor activity of the combination of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma that has progressed after treatment with at least one prior VEGF-targeted therapy, or for whom VEGF-targeted therapy has proven to be intolerable, or is considered inappropriate.

This study is designed to evaluate the combination of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib in subjects with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic renal cell carcinoma that has progressed after treatment with at least one prior VEGF-targeted therapy, or for whom VEGF-targeted therapy has proven to be intolerable, or is considered inappropriate.
