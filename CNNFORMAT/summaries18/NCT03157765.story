(secondQuint)Trial of Endometrial Scratch Prior to Frozen Embryo Transfer in Patients With Recurrent Implantation Failure.

 Patients who failed to achieve a clinical pregnancy after embryo transfer of at least three high quality embryos in at least two IVF or FET cycles and for whom their last failed cycle was a frozen embryo transfer are offered the opportunity to enroll in this study.

 All patients will follow our routine FET protocol.

 On a randomized basis, selected patients will undergo an endometrial biopsy using a Pipelle disposable device in the week prior to starting estrogen to prepare her endometrium.
