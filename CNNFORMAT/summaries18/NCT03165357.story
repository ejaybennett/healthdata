(thirdQuint)Sodium Bicarbonate Supplementation in Athletes.

 Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) was proposed as an ergogenic agent, because it improves high-intensity and resistance exercise performance.

 Until now the major limitation to NaHCO3 supplementation has been the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects.

 Therefore, this study aims to examine the effect of chronic, progressive- dose NaHCO3 ingestion on physical capacity, body composition and concentrations of the selected biochemical blood markers in trained athletes, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.

The purpose of this study was to verify the effect of 10-day sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and placebo (PLA) supplementation on body composition, physical capacity, as well as concentrations of the selected biochemical blood markers in trained athletes, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.
