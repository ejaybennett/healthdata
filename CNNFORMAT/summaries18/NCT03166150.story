(secondQuint)Muscle and Functional Assessment in Leakage Study.

 This study will provide data on benefits of combination of multimodal strengthening and aerobic conditioning rehabilitation program with PFMT and will help to characterize changes pelvic floor and lower extremity muscles in older women with UI after multimodal strengthening and aerobic conditioning rehabilitation program with PFMT.

 The proposed study will shift the paradigm in the evaluation and treatment of older women with UI and mobility limitations.

 Unlike current PFMT, an innovative multimodal strengthening and aerobic conditioning rehabilitation program combined with PFMT will focus on overall physical function using a patient-centered individual approach, evaluate and treat both UI and mobility limitations.

 The study will evaluate the incremental benefit of endurance and lower extremity muscle strengthening in addition to benefits from PFMT.

 We anticipate that this approach will enhance the benefits of PFMT because the proposed intervention will focus on prevention of functional decline through endurance, strength, and balance training among older women with UI.

 Thus, not only it will improve UI symptoms, but also decrease mobility limitations.

 Objective evaluation of mobility and MRI muscle fat infiltration and atrophy in older women with UI will give us better understanding in pathophysiology of UI and mobility limitations in older women.

 Muscle fat infiltration and atrophy assessment of the pelvic floor and gluteal muscles in older women is novel and may represent a biomarker which serves as a predictor of treatment success in the evaluation and management of UI and mobility in older women.

 Muscle and Functional Assessment in Leakage Study@highlight

The purpose of this study is to improve urinary incontinence in older women by building strength in the pelvic and lower body muscle through exercise and rehabilitation.

 The study will also look at quality of pelvic floor and lower extremities muscles using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).
