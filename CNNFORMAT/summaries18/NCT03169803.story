(firstQuint)Cardiac Output Autonomic Stimulation Therapy for Acute Heart Failure (COAST-AHF).

 A single-arm, safety study intended to assess safety and system performance, and the feasibility to improve hemodynamics in patients with acute heart failure syndrome using transvenous, cardiac autonomic nerve stimulation (CANS) therapy.

 In addition, the effects of NeuroTronik CANS Therapy cent on the congestion of patients will be studied.

 The study proposes that the NeuroTronik CANS Therapy cent System be deployed during the acute heart failure syndrome hospital admission, along with existing standard treatment.
