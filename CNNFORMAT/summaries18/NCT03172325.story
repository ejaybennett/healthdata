(fifthQuint)Study to Demonstrate Non-Inferiority Efficacy and Safety of CinnoRA Produced by CinnaGen Company Versus Humira for Treatment of Active Rheumatoid Arthritis.

 The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of adalimumab produced by CinnaGen company and AbbVie adalimumab in subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis.

 Patients with diagnosis of active rheumatoid arthritis according to EULAR criteria (European League Against Rheumatism) aged between 18 to 75 years are included.

 This is a Phase III, randomized, two arms, double blind (patient and assessor blinded), parallel active non inferiority controlled clinical trial.

 The eligible patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive CinnoRA(R) or Humira(R).

 Every 2 weeks, 40 mg of either of the drugs is administered to each patient subcutaneously along with methotrexate (15 mg/week), folic acid (1 mg/day), and prednisolone (7.

5 mg/day) over a six-month period.

 Physical examinations, vital signs, disease activity and laboratory parameters are evaluated for patients at baseline and at 3 and 6-month visits.

 The incidence of adverse events at each visit was recorded based on patients' reports, vital signs, physical examinations, and laboratory tests.

 Before initiation, the trial is reviewed by food and drug administration of Iran.

 The protocol, case report form (CRF), information for patients and informed consent form are submitted to the ethics committees responsible for review and approval purposes, according to national regulatory guidelines.

 In this study, no patient is recruited without an informed consent.

 All the informed consent forms which are signed by the patients have two copies so that patients could receive a copy of it.

 Determination of sample size: The outcome is changes in composite scores defined by the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology criterions [16].

 EULAR response was seen at least once during the 4 week period after drug injection in 89% in the Humira group.

 The CinnoRATM group proportion is assumed to be 0.

7100 under the null hypothesis of inferiority[16].

 If the CinnoRATM response rate is not 18% ( = -0.

18; non-inferiority margin) worse than Humira treatment, it will be implied to be non-inferior.

 Sample size 64 in both Humira and CinnoRATM groups yields 90% power to detect non-inferiority margin.

 The significance level of the test was targeted at 0.

0250.

 The significance level actually achieved by this design is 0.

0284.

 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE: CinnaGen Company conducts clinical trials according to procedures that incorporate the ethical principles of GCP.

 Accurate and reliable data collection is assured by verification and cross-check of the CRFs against the patient's records by clinical monitors, and the maintenance of a drug-dispensing log by the center.

 Principle and coordinating investigators, CRO (contract research organization) coordinators and sponsor personnel attend the investigator meetings and at the end they receive a GCP certificate.

 CRO coordinators and one sponsor attend the SIV (Site Initiation Visit) meetings.

 Protocol and GCP principles are reviewed by coordinating investigator of each site and also, the needed information for completing CRF and Trial Master File (TMF) forms are explained.

 Monitoring by CRO is performed in 30% and 70% of study progress and at the end of the study.

 In the monitoring sessions some sponsor personnel audit the process.

 During monitoring process, CRO coordinator checks all CRFs and confirms them to the source documents and for required cases the query form was filled out.

 The temperature of the refrigerator which containing the medicines is checked and recorded by data logger which is checked repeatedly by auditor.

 TMF is checked by CRO coordinator and it is rechecked by auditor.

 Drug accountability data and information about the proper time for patients' injections are checked by CRO coordinator and rechecked by sponsor personnel.

 After monitoring, problems are reported by monitor and auditor to the trial centers.

 Blinding: The study is double blind.

 The Subjects and those who conduct the study are unaware of the state of the patient with regard to receiving CinnoRA(R) or Humira(R).

 For this to happen, Subjects are blinded by using a masked prefilled syringe content biologically inert substance drug, Adalimumab (CinnoRA(R) or Humira(R)).

 The injection method, injection syringes and cartridges are totally the same in both groups.

 During the study, patients are completely unaware of the types of medications and groups of therapy.

 To blind those who conduct the study, the person who delivers or checks the study drug is different from those who examine the patients and all drugs packages are identified by unique numbers (manufacture code).

 It should be noted that CRO personnel who enter data into CRF and database and also the sponsor personnel who monitor data entry are blinded.

 The study is double blind and situations that might warrant breaking the code are defined in the protocol and include serious adverse events.

 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data: Since the number of patients who participated in this clinical trial is limited and small, the investigator can't perform missing imputation analysis and do statistical analysis on those patients who are completed the entire study.

 However, analyses on the adverse events are performed on patients who entered the study.

 In this study, patients with at least one adverse event are included in the report.

 For each adverse event, data is summarized using frequencies and percentages and then classifies according to body system.

 They are reported in the form of incidence rate.

 In other words, patients with any number of Adverse Events are counted only once in this calculation.

5 mg/day) over a six-month period.

 The primary objective of this study is to assess equivalence of test- adalimumab (CinnoRA(R)) to the reference adalimumab (Humira(R)) in terms of efficacy in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis.

 The secondary objectives of this study are: - To further compare efficacy of test- adalimumab to reference adalimumab - To assess safety of test- adalimumab compared to reference adalimumab
