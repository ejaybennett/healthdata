(fifthQuint)A Randomized Phase IV Control Trial of Single High Dose Oral Vitamin D3 in Pediatric Patients Undergoing HSCT.

 Comorbidities and complications including infection, organ system toxicity, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and disease recurrence are some of the biggest contributors to quality of life and mortality in children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

 Research has suggested that patients with sufficient vitamin D levels during transplant have improved outcomes, including lower incidences of infection and acute GVHD, as well as overall improved survival.

 Prior research has shown that chronically ill children are at risk for vitamin D deficiency, including those undergoing HSCT.

 Data has shown populations with as many as 70% of HSCT patients have insufficient levels of vitamin D at time of transplant.

 While several studies have attempted methods of vitamin D supplementation in this subset of patients, there has not been success with either standard or aggressive supplementation strategies.

 Single high-dose oral vitamin D therapy, known as stoss therapy, has been used in other chronically ill children where adequate levels of vitamin D are difficult to attain.

 Stoss therapy suggests a single high-dose followed by maintenance dosing would be adequate to replete and maintain vitamin D levels in chronically ill children.

 While it has been shown to be effective with no evidence of toxicity in patients with rickets and cystic fibrosis, its safety and efficacy has not been studied in the transplant setting.

 However, there is an urgent need to identify a modifiable factor may reduce the occurrence and/or severity of HSCT associated complications.

 Our overall objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a single, high dose oral vitamin D followed by maintenance supplementation in children undergoing HSCT.

 This change will result in a new and innovative approach to maintaining adequate vitamin D levels during pediatric HSCT, with the long term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality.

 Our primary hypotheses are based on previous data referred to above.

 Our primary hypothesis is that a single, high dose of vitamin D followed by maintenance supplementation in children undergoing HSCT is a safe and efficacious way to replete vitamin D stores during HSCT through Day +100 of transplant.

 Our secondary hypothesis is that adequate vitamin D levels in patients undergoing HSCT have positive effect on the overall outcomes, including graft versus host disease, immune recovery, rejection, relapse, and infection rates.

Research has suggested that children with sufficient vitamin D levels undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) have improved outcomes, including lower incidences of infection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as well as overall improved survival.

 However, supplementation in children undergoing HSCT has shown to be a challenge using standard or aggressive supplementation strategies.

 The overall objective of our study is to determine the effectiveness of a single, high dose oral vitamin D at the start of transplant followed by maintenance supplementation in children undergoing HSCT.
