(secondQuint)An Algorithm to Decide on Antibiotic Prescription in Lower Respiratory Tract Infection in Primary Care.

 The study will have two distinct phases: The first phase will test the feasibility of the intervention (UltraPro) along a pilot study.

 Following the setup of a lung ultrasound training curriculum for general practitioners, the practicality of the whole UltraPro algorithm will be evaluated at primary care level.

 The second phase will be a pragmatic randomized three-arm intervention study using an algorithm based on the results of procalcitonin and lung ultrasound to manage patients with lower respiratory tract infections at primary care level.

 The procalcitonin-ultrasound algorithm will be compared to procalcitonin-guided management alone and usual care.
