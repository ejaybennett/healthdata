(secondQuint)Linking Epidermal Barrier Function With Anti-Oxidant Defense Mechanisms in Atopic Dermatitis.

 Up to 40 healthy and 40 atopic dermatitis subjects meeting the inclusion criteria will be enrolled.

 Medical records will be reviewed pertaining to the subject's diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and specific therapeutic interventions.

 For atopic dermatitis subjects, AD severity will be assessed using Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI).

 Study sites will be chosen by the investigator.

 One lesional and one nonlesional site on the trunk, upper, or lower extremities will be selected.

 Digital photos of the study skin site(s) will be taken.

 Skin barrier function indices (transepidermal water loss, pH, sebum and hydration levels) of an active lesion and adjacent nonlesional skin will be measured using noninvasive skin barrier measurement devices.

 Two 3mm punch biopsies will be performed over the same skin sites that skin barrier measurements were performed.

 One biopsy will be performed over an active AD lesion and another on adjacent nonlesional skin.

 Tissue will be sent out for immunohistochemical staining to study the expression anti-oxidant biomarkers.

 Five mL of peripheral venous blood will be collected for immunoassay to measure the level inflammatory cytokines.

 For healthy subjects, digital photo of the study skin site(s) over either the trunk, upper, or lower extremities will be taken.

 Skin barrier function indices (transepidermal water loss, pH, sebum and hydration levels) of skin be measured using noninvasive skin barrier measurement devices.

Investigators will measure skin barrier function using noninvasive devices and sample their skin and blood to study the expression anti-oxidative enzymes, skin barrier proteins and inflammatory molecules.

 These results will be correlated with the disease severity in atopic dermatitis patients.
