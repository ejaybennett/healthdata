(thirdQuint)Er,Cr:YSGG Laser For Recipient Bed Bio-modification And Connective Tissue Harvesting in Treatment of Gingival Recession.

 Twenty four patients suffering from isolated Class I and II Miller gingival recession defects in anterior esthetic region were enrolled in this study.

 They were randomly assigned into three groups; de-epithelialized connective tissue graft harvesting technique or; conditioning the exposed root surfaces with Er,Cr:YSGG laser before connective tissue coverage using scalpel blade harvested de-epithelialized connective tissue graft harvesting technique, or; conditioning the exposed root surfaces with the Er,Cr:YSGG laser before Er,Cr:YSGG laser harvested connective tissue using de-epithelialized technique.

 Clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline and at 3, 6 and 9 months postoperatively.
