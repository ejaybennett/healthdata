(secondQuint)ULnar Nerve ECHographic Observation (ULNECHO).

 100 elbows from 50 patients will be included, from a population of asymptomatic subjects, in order to measure the frequency of ulnar nerve which surface is >8,3 mm.

 The measures will be realized centered on the epicondyle : 2 cm higher, and 2 cm lower with 2 echographs (ESAOTE) and 2 observers.

 An inter and intra observer study will also be realized to determine the reproducibility and reliability of the measurements.

 ULnar Nerve ECHographic Observation (ULNECHO)@highlight

There is currently no consensus on the normal ultrasound surface of the ulnar nerve at the elbow.

 The goal of this study is to study the ulnar nerve surface at the elbow in a population of asymptomatic subjects
