(fifthQuint)Neuroplasticity in Parkinsons Disease After Training.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting many physiological systems essential for balance control.

 New findings suggest that intensive, challenging and cognitively demanding exercises could induce neuroplasticity in PD.

 A new balance training (the HiBalance program) have therefore been developed; emphasizing critical aspects of balance control through highly challenging and progressive exercises incorporating dual/multi-tasking (Conradsson et al, 2012).

 In an RCT, the HiBalance-program was shown to improve balance, gait and physical activity level in favor for the training group (Conradsson et al, 2015).

 In this proposal the investigators will combine physiotherapy, neurology and neuroimaging to characterise and determine the effects on physical and cognitive symptoms as well as structural and functional changes and wet biomarkers in the brain after the training.

 Participants will be recruited through Karolinska University Hospital and via announcements in relevant forums like for instance the Swedish Parkinson Association.

 According to earlier power calculations for detecting effects in balance and gait measures after this particular intervention, the investigators anticipate 40 to 50 participants in each group to detect significant changes.

 The investigators will perform both per protocol analysis and intention to treat analysis using mixed model or repeated measurement ANOVAs if the data is normally distributed.

 Neuroplasticity in Parkinsons Disease After Training@highlight

This project aims to determine the effects of the HiBalance program on neuroplastic changes in people with mild to moderate Parkinsons disease.

 The main hypothesis is that highly challenging exercise will lead to greater gait and balance ability, increased levels of physical activity and an improved health related quality of life.

 The investigators further hypothesize that neuroplasticity changes will be seen in corresponding areas of the brain, neuropsychological changes on cognitive test measures, and that exercise will inhibit the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the brain through the mediation of neurotrophic factors.
