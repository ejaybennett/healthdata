(fifthQuint)Beta-Lactam InfusioN Group Study.

 Aim To conduct a multicentre randomised, controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether continuous infusion of a beta-lactam antibiotic (piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem) results in decreased all cause Day 90 mortality compared with intermittent beta-lactam antibiotic infusion in critically ill patients with sepsis.

 Hypothesis The BLING III Study will test the hypothesis that patients managed in the ICU with sepsis, the administration of beta-lactam antibiotics via continuous infusion decreases Day 90 mortality compared with intermittent infusion Design This BLING III study is a prospective, multicentre, open, phase III, RCT.

 Participants commenced on one of two beta-lactam antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem) will be randomised to receive the beta-lactam antibiotic via either continuous infusion or intermittent infusion over 30 minutes for the treatment course while in the ICU for up to 90 days after randomisation.

 For participants where the beta-lactam antibiotic is subsequently changed from piperacillin-tazobactam to meropenem or vice versa for ongoing treatment of the infectious episode, the new prescription will continue to be administered in the allocated method (continuous infusion or intermittent infusion over 30 minutes).

 Permuted block randomisation with variable block sizes and stratified by site will be conducted via a password-protected, secure web-based interface.

 The primary endpoint for this trial will be death from all causes at 90 days.

 7,000 patients will be enrolled into this study from approximately 70 ICUs worldwide, with approximately 35 ICUs in Australian and New Zealand hospitals.

 For eligible patients, the administration method of beta-lactam antibiotic, either piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem, will be randomised to either continuous infusion or intermittent infusion over 30 minutes.

 The choice of beta-lactam antibiotic and the dose and dosing interval (i.

e.

 the dose the patient will receive in 24 hours) will be determined by the treating physician prior to randomisation.

 For all patients, data will be collected at baseline and daily whilst in the ICU.

 Patients will be followed up to day 14, regardless of location in the hospital, to determine test of cure and to identify new acquisition, colonisation or infection with an multi-resistant organism.

 Additional follow up will occur at 90 days post randomisation.

 Beta-Lactam InfusioN Group Study@highlight

The purpose of this study is to find out whether continuous infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics or intermittent infusion or beta-lactam antibiotics, offers more health advantages to patients or if there is no difference.

 The investigators will be looking to see whether patients receiving beta-lactams via one administration method or the other have a better chance of recovering from their illness.

 They will also be looking at long term outcomes such as quality-of-life and healthcare resource use.

 Sepsis is caused by toxic substances (toxins) from bacteria and other organism entering the bloodstream from a site of infection.

 In some people, the infection can progress to sepsis and septic shock where the functions of organs in the body are affected.

 Patients suffering from sepsis and septic shock are commonly managed in the intensive care unit (ICU) where they are prescribed antibiotics as standard therapy, as well as other therapies to support the functions of the body.

 Beta-lactam antibiotics are a group of antibiotics commonly used to treat infection in patients with sepsis and septic shock.

 Currently, beta-lactam antibiotics are most commonly given to patients be intermittent infusions, that is, given at regular intervals throughout 24 hours.

 New research suggests that giving beta-lactam antibiotics as a continuous infusion may mean that antibiotic concentrations in the blood remain more consistent and may be more effective at killing bacteria.

 However, the benefit to the patient by giving beta-lactams via continuous infusion has not been tested in a high-quality, large clinical trial.
