(thirdQuint)Self-Criticism Pilot Study.

 The intervention is based upon recent unpublished doctoral research that developed this novel treatment within students with high levels of self-criticism.

 This pilot study aims to adapt the intervention for an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service, a primary mental-health service in the UK.

 Self-criticism is a transdiagnostic process across common mental-health disorders and is therefore, a potential target for psychological intervention.

 Clients at IAPT are likely to present with high levels of self-criticism.

 This pilot study may help develop an alternative evidence-based intervention that can be routinely offered within IAPT services.

 The researchers aim to recruit 20 clients registered at Talking Therapies Southwark, experiencing a significant impact of self-criticism on their daily life, and requesting help for self-criticism.

 Clients that provide consent to participate in this study would receive 6 sessions of this intervention and a 2-month follow-up telephone session.

 Self-Criticism Pilot Study@highlight

This uncontrolled pilot seeks to develop a novel intervention based on Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT), that reduces self-criticism and improves psychological wellbeing.

 The researchers aim to assess the the acceptability and feasibility of providing such an intervention within a primary mental health care service; and a preliminary indication of the the effectiveness of this intervention?
