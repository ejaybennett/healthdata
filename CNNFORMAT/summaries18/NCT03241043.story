(firstQuint)Study to Evaluate Pharmacokinetic and Bioavailability of Envarsus vs.

 Advagraf in Liver Transplant Recipients.

 Using an open-label, randomized, controlled, 2-period cross-over design, two treatments (Envarsus(R) and Advagraf(R)) will be compared (with regard to PK profile and bioavailability) after administration of IMP to 20 de novo transplanted recipients.

 The patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatments as treatment period 1 and afterwards switched to treatment period 2 (Group 1: Envarsus(R) - Advagraf(R); Group 2: Advagraf(R) - Envarsus(R)).
