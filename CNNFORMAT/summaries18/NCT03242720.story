(fifthQuint)Effects of PAP on Afib Recurrence Risk After Catheter Ablation in OSA Patients.

 Obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep-related breathing disorder in which breathing stops for short periods during sleep, is a common condition in patients with atrial fibrillation.

 Studies have shown that up to 75% of atrial fibrillation patients undergoing catheter ablation procedure have obstructive sleep apnea.

 Obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence after successful catheter ablation by 40%.

 However, whether treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure (PAP, the current most effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea that uses a machine to help breathe more easily) reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence is not fully understood.

 The purpose of this study, therefore, is to examine whether positive airway pressure therapy reduces atrial fibrillation recurrence after catheter ablation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation.

With this pilot study, we are hoping to test the feasibility of a larger study in the future and to learn whether positive airway pressure therapy reduces the recurrence risk of atrial fibrillation after successful catheter ablation procedure among patients with atrial fibrillation and obstructive sleep apnea.

 The results from this study will help us refine the design for a future larger study, and will ultimately improve care of patients with obstructive sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation.
