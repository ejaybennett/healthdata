(fifthQuint)App Reminder on ASA Adherence.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of using a smartphone application (app) reminder on medication adherence twice daily in 200 adults prescribed 81 milligrams of aspirin (ASA) for 35 days as anti-thrombotic therapy after knee or hip arthroplasty.

 The aim is to determine if an app downloaded on a smartphone that reminds patients twice a day to take their ASA as prescribed will improve ASA adherence and clinical outcomes for patients after total knee and total hip joint arthroplasty compared to those in the usual care.

 This is a two group, randomized control study with random assignment into the control group for usual care or the intervention group to receive a medication reminder app for their smart phone (daily for 35 days) plus usual care.

 Participants will receive a baseline interview for demographic and other data and 36 day follow-up assessment, both conducted in person.

The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of using a smartphone app reminder on medication adherence twice daily in adults prescribed 81 milligrams of aspirin for 35 days as anti-thrombotic therapy after knee or hip arthroplasty.

 This study will randomly assign participants to get usual postoperative care which is teaching with verbal instructions and printed information about taking the aspirin at the time of discharge, or to have an app on your smartphone with preset reminders in addition to usual postoperative discharge teaching after surgery.
