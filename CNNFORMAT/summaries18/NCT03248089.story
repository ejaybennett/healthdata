(thirdQuint)Spanish Lung Liquid vs.

 Invasive Biopsy Program (SLLIP).

 Primary objective: To demonstrate the non-inferiority of cfDNA-based versus tumor tissue-based genotyping as it pertains to the detection of clinically-actionable biomarkers in first line, treatment naive, metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.

 The following secondary objectives will be studied: - Turn around Time (TAT) of cfDNA vs.

 tissue results.

 - Time to treatment (TtT) initiation.

 - Quantity not sufficient rate (QNS) of tissue for clinically-actionable biomarker testing.

 - Tumor Not Detected (TND) rate of cfDNA in blood.

 - Rescue rate of QNS samples using cfDNA-derived genotyping.

 - Rate response for patients that are actionable biomarker positive (either in cDNA or tissue) treated with target-drugs according investigator criteria.

 Up to three RECIST assessments per patient will be retrospectively done by external personnel (no investigational team).

 - Rate of discovery of genomically mediated, acquired resistance to targeted therapies in the biomarker-positive subsets.

 Spanish Lung Liquid vs.

 Invasive Biopsy Program (SLLIP)@highlight

Tumor Derived cell free DNA (cfDNA) is increasingly used in the clinic to obtain genotype information about lung cancer, but its concordance with concurrent tumor-derived sequenced data is not known.

 The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of cfDNA-based versus tumor tissue-based genotyping.
