(thirdQuint)Efficacy of the MovinCog Intervention in Children.

 Specifically, the investigators will compare both components together (exercise and cognitive training) against either one of the components (exercise alone, or cognitive training alone) and against an active control group.

 The study will include measures of scholastic aptitude, as well as of working memory and cognitive control (primary outcome measures), two cognitive abilities that are critical to daily life activities, and that respond well to training.

 In addition, the investigators will measure physiological responses to training, to monitor changes associated with exercise (secondary outcome measures).

 Finally, the investigators will relate training-specific improvements with transfer gains, to better model the interaction between training and transfer.

 This will provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics associated with the intervention.

 Efficacy of the MovinCog Intervention in Children@highlight

This study aims to test the efficacy of the MovinCog Intervention to enhance cognitive abilities in children 7-15 yrs.

 The intervention consists of two parts: a physical exercise regimen, based on high-intensity training, and a cognitive training component.

 The design will contrast the intervention with an active control group, matched for expectancy effects.
