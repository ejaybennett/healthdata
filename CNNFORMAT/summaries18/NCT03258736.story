(fifthQuint)Caudal Block Versus Ultrasound Guided Ilioinguinal/Iliohypogastric Block in Pediatric Patient.

 In this prospective randomized study, pediatric patients between 1- 10 years old who were scheduled to bilateral inguinal hernia surgery wil be enrolled the study.

 The patients wil randomly assign to receive an ultrasound-guided Ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric block group or caudal block group Ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric block was performed with 2 mg/kg bupivacaine as 0.

25 % and total volum wil be divided equally for each side, Caudal block wil performe with bupivacaine 2 mg/kg as 0.

2%.

 Supplemental analgesia will consist of as requred intraoperative remifentanyl, for recovery unit rescue tramadol, as requred at home ibuprofen.

 Patients wil be evaluated in the recovery unit for analgesia with FLACC pain scale, analgesic requirement, complications and parental satisfaction.

 Parents will be also called for analgesia and satisfaction after discharge of the patients in first 24 hours.

 The evaluation will be performed by a researcher whom does not know which participants belong to the caudal or ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block group.

 Caudal Block Versus Ultrasound Guided Ilioinguinal/Iliohypogastric Block in Pediatric Patient@highlight

The caudal block is the most common technique for inguinal surgery.

 Increased use of ultrasound in regional analgesia techniques has been improved the practise of the peripheral nerve blocks.

 Ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve blocks are possible to alternative methods to the central blocks.

 The aim of this study is to compare analgesic efficiency of caudal block and ultrasound guided Ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve blocks for bilateral inguinal hernia in pediatric patients
