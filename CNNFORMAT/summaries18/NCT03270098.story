(thirdQuint)Improving Cognition Via Exercise in Schizophrenia.

 The goal of the proposed study is to examine the impact of exercise training on cognitive functioning in people with schizophrenia.

 People with schizophrenia display a broad range of cognitive impairments that have been identified as major determinants of poor functional outcome and disability, thus representing an important public health concern and a target for interventions.

 At present, available treatments offer only minimal to limited benefits to ameliorate these deficits.

 Extensive animal and human research literatures converge in supporting the positive influence of aerobic exercise training on cognitive functioning.

 Preliminary data indicate that aerobic exercise training is effective in improving cognitive functioning in people with schizophrenia.

 However, previous studies employed small samples, focused on a single or limited range of cognitive domains, and/or collected insufficient information on daily functioning or putative biomarkers underlying cognitive change.
