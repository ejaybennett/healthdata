 Method: This experimental study will make use of a randomized controlled design (RCT), consisting of one hundred and sixty eight stroke survivors recruited from different health care facilities within the Cape Metropolitan area.

 The study participants will be divided randomly into two groups, with one receiving the intervention - the experimental group - and the other receiving an educational booklet - the control group.

 Participants will be assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention (six weeks), three and sixth-month post intervention, using standardized outcome measures (both subjective outcome measures and objective clinical tools).

 Ethical clearance and permission to conduct the study will be obtained and patient information will be kept confidential.

 Analyses will be conducted using descriptive statistics of frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation for continuous variables.

 Given the assumptions of equal variance, a two-way full factorial ANOVA will be computed in order to assess interaction between groups and intervention type.
