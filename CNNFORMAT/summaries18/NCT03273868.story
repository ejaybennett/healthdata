(thirdQuint)The Effect of Thoracic Spinal Manipulation on Autonomic Nervous System.

 Several studies have shown that spinal manipulative therapies had an immediate effect on autonomic nervous system activity (sympathoexcitatory effect) and on pressure pain sensitivity (hypoalgesic effect).

 Only one study assessed and found a correlation between these effects.

 Despite this interest, no one has assessed i) if these effects last over time and ii) if the relationship between them is reliable.

 The primary aim of the study is to assess every single effect over one hour after the intervention.

 The secondary aim is to assess the relationship between autonomic modulation and pain modulation (if any).

 Autonomic nervous system activity is assessed by measuring heart rate variability and the baroreflex sensitivity Pain sensitivity is assessed by measuring pressure pain threshold.

 The Effect of Thoracic Spinal Manipulation on Autonomic Nervous System@highlight

This study evaluates the effect of a single high-velocity low amplitude thoracic manipulation on both autonomic nervous system activity and pressure pain threshold.

 It is a crossover study, thus, each participant will undergo both interventions (thoracic spinal manipulation or a sham manipulation).

 The two interventions will be separated by a 48 h washout period.
