(fifthQuint)Gamified WellWe-intervention to Promote the Health and Wellbeing of Families With Small Children.

 Families with pre-school aged children attend to regular health visits in Child health clinics on a yearly basis.

 During the health visits PHNs assess and promote the health and wellbeing of the whole family through health discussions.

 In this study we aim to evaluate whether the addition of gamified method into the health discussion promotes healthy behaviors and mindfulness of the families and increases the family-centered approach of health visit compared to the traditional method.

 WellWe-intervention includes the use of gamified WellWe app at home and during the health discussion in the Child health clinic.

 Usual care includes paper-based questionnaires filled by the parents and health discussion using these questionnaires in the Child health clinic.
