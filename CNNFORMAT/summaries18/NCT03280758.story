(fifthQuint)Muscle Strength Training for Older Adults With Type II Diabetes.

 This study aims to investigate a resistance training program for improving glycemic control, muscle mass, strength and functional performance in older patients with Type II Diabetes (T2 DM).

 This is a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial.

 60 subjects will be randomly allocated to either a muscle strengthening group or a no exercise control group.

 Information on demographic characteristics, body composition, muscle strength, functional capacity and glycemic control will be collected at baseline (pre-test) and after a 4-month intervention (post-test).

 Muscle strengthening group will receive resistance training 3 times per week (1 hour/session).

 The control group will not receive any training but can continue usual medical care and daily activities.

 60 subjects will be randomly allocated to either a muscle strengthening group or a no exercise control group.

 Muscle strengthening group will receive resistance training 3 times per week (1 hour/session).

 The control group will not receive any training but can continue usual medical care and daily activities.

 Primary outcomes: glycemic control and lipid profile Secondary outcomes: muscle mass and strength, and functional capacity Data will be collected at baseline (pre-test) and after a 4-month intervention (post-test).
