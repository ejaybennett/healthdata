(firstQuint)CAR-T Cells Combined With Peptide Specific Dendritic Cell in Relapsed/Refractory Leukemia/MDS.

 A prospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Chimeric antigen receptor T cells combined with Eps8 peptide specific dendritic cell for patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia.

 There are options for CAR-targets: CD19, CD20, CD22 and CD10 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia; CD33, CD38 CD56, CD117, CD123, CD34 and Muc1 for acute myeloid leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome.

 Progression free survival, overall Survival, overall response rate, and duration of response were monitored.
