(fifthQuint)Virtual Psychiatric Care for Perinatal Depression.

 This is a two-site pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the feasibility of a Virtual Psychiatric Care for Perinatal Depression (Virtual-PND) intervention protocol, comparing virtual care to in-person care only.

 Participants will be pregnant or postpartum women with a major depressive disorder who are referred for care at one of the participating study sites.

 Each study site is a specialist reproductive psychiatric program where women from the greater Toronto area are referred, and generally treated with in-person care.

 Those randomized to the virtual care group will be able to receive psychiatric visits with video-based visits.

 Those randomized to the in-person care group will receive in-person care only, as per usual clinical practice at the study sites.

 The length of the active treatment phase will be 12 weeks from enrolment.

 The secondary end-point will be 1 year postpartum, as participants are followed clinically to 1-year postpartum at both study sites.

 The overall objective of this pilot RCT is to determine the feasibility of conducting a larger RCT to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment model, comparing outcomes among those with and without access to virtual care, and cost-effectiveness.

 Virtual Psychiatric Care for Perinatal Depression@highlight

Perinatal depression occurs in 15% of pregnant women and new mothers, yet as few as 1 in 5 receive adequate treatment.

 It has a negative impact on the woman herself, as well as a potential for serious consequences for her child.

 Virtual psychiatric care is a potential model that may provide accessible mental health care during this time, as barriers to in-person care often include unpredictable infant schedules, competing childcare demands, or travel/cost challenges.

 The Virtual-PND intervention consists of 12-weeks of the option of supplementing in-person psychiatric care with secure, in-home real-time video-visits through the Ontario Telemedicine Network.

 This pilot RCT will demonstrate the feasibility of proceeding to a future large-scale RCT evaluation of virtual psychiatric care for this population.
