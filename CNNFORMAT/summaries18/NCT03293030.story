(firstQuint)Immunogenetic Profiling of Dupilumab for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis.

 This is a single center, open-label study, which will examine the effect of dupilumab on the immunologic and genetic environment within atopic dermatitis (AD) lesions.

 Fifteen subjects with moderate to severe AD will receive dupilumab for a treatment period of 52 weeks (i.

e.

 last injection on week 48).

 Surgical discard specimens will also be collected from fifteen healthy subjects.

 Biopsy samples from AD subjects and surgical discard samples will undergo molecular profiling.

 Skin swabs and stool samples will be collected and banked for future analysis.

 The reason to treat patients for 52 weeks is to have the ability to correlate early molecular events with clinical outcomes (EASI, IGA, itch score) at week 52.

 In addition, collection of microbiome samples will be performed at week 52.
