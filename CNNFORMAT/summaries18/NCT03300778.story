(secondQuint)A Study of Aerobic Exercise for Adolescents With Subthreshold Mood Syndromes.

 Subthreshold depressive and hypomanic symptoms are common in adolescents, increasing the risk of developping into depression or bipolar disorder.

 Preliminary evidence shows that aerobic exercise might have positive effects in enhancing cognition and improving clinical symptoms in non-clinical and preclinical population and patients with mood disorders.

 This randomized controlled trial will investigate short-term (3 months) effects of aerobic exercise on cognition and clinical symptoms as well as the long-term (18 months) effects on the clinical outcomes of high-risk states.
