(fifthQuint)Torsion of the Tibial Tuberosity, a New Factor for Patellar Instability?.

 Patellar instability (recurrent patellar dislocation) can occur at any age.

 It is most often seen in young subjects, especially among adolescents.

 It is commonly accompanied by anatomical factors known to be driving: Dysplasia of the trochlea, patella alta, lateralisation of the tibial tuberosity, patellar torsion and misalignment, tearing of the medial femoro-patellar ligament.

.

 The assessment of these factors is essential to evaluate the instability and guide the procedures of the surgical treatment.

 MRIs have become an important test for the analysis and measurement of these factors.

 A new factor not described in bibliographic sources and characterized by an external toggle of the tibial tuberosity is frequently found in patients with patellar instability thanks to MRIs.

 This does not seem to be the case when there is no patellar pathology.

 A statistical study is needed to assess this rotary anomaly.

 It will be necessary to take it into account in the future regarding indications and techniques for tibial tuberosity osteotomies, often used to correct patellar instability.
