(thirdQuint)The Effect of Contralateral Limb Training on Functional Outcomes in Patients With ACL Reconstruction.

 Returning to sport after ACL reconstruction is not at desired level among athletes.

 Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strenghts have important role in returning to sport after ACL reconstruction.

 Cross-over training is recomended during rehabilitation after ACL reconstrucion.

 Yet duration of the training, frequancy and type of exercise interention are not clear for the cross-over training.

 Ain of the study is to investigate the effects of cross-over training on muscle strenght.

 The Effect of Contralateral Limb Training on Functional Outcomes in Patients With ACL Reconstruction@highlight

Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strenghts have important role in returning to sport after ACL reconstruction and one of the main focus of rehabilitation is to improve strenght of these muscles.

 With the strenghtening of the contralateral limb (cross-over training) we aimed to improve the strenght of the quadriceps
