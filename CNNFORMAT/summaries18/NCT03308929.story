(thirdQuint)Prospective G7 Dual Mobility Total Hip PMCF.

 This multi-center prospective follow-up study will evaluate clinical outcomes, functional outcomes, radiological outcomes and further characterize the safety profile of the G7 Dual Mobility Hip Arthroplasty System.

 This will be accomplished by assessing these domains using the Harris Hip Score, UCLA Activity Score, and EQ-5D-3L, obtaining and assessing radiographs and the tracking of device or procedure related adverse events.

 Subjects will undergo unilateral primary or revision total hip arthroplasty and will then be followed for 10 years with intervals at 6 weeks, 1-, 2-, 3- 5- and 10 years.

 For the 10 year visit, subjects will not be required to present in their doctor's office, but will fill out a survey.

 Subsequent to 10 year data collection, the subject's participation in the study will be compete.
