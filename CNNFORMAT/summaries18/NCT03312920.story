(secondQuint)Investigating Memory Retrieval Improvement in Healthy Subjects.

 Associative memory refers to remembering the association between two items, such as a face and a name or a word in English and the same word in another language.

 It is not only important for learning, but it is also one of the first aspects of memory performance that is impacted by aging and by Alzheimers disease.

 For decades, neuroscientists have investigated associative learning and memory and ways to accelerate and enhance associative learning and memory.

 Transcranial Direct Current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and painless electrical stimulation technique that has demonstrated to accelerate learning and improve memory in some studies.

 To investigate whether learning can be accelerated and associative memory improved by using tDCS, this study will compare the performance in a Face Name Associate memory task from 3 groups.

 The first group will get active aodal tDCS during the study phase of the Face Name Memory task, whereas the second group will get sham tDCS during the study phase of the task and the third group will get active cathodal tDCS.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether learning can be accelerated and associative memory performance improved in healthy subjects by applying transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) during a Face Name memory task.
