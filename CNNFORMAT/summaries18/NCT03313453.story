(fifthQuint)Effect of Air Cleaner on the Indoor Allergen Sensitized Allergic Rhinitis Patients.

 The most important principle in the treatment of allergic diseases is to avoid or reduce exposure to the causative antigen.

 Causative agents that induce allergic diseases or exacerbate symptoms are classified into indoor and outdoor allergens.

 House dust mites and pet's hair are typical indoor antigens.

 Air pollution as well as allergens are important deterioration factors, and environmental management is essential for alleviating symptoms of allergic diseases.

 Therefore, we are about to evaluate the impact of the air cleaner to the allergic rhinitis patients.

 A total of 45 patients will be enrolled in the study and a real air cleaner and a mock-up air cleaner will be randomly installed at ratio of 1: 1 to measure rhinitis symptoms and the changes in indoor air quality after 6 weeks of operation.

 Effect of Air Cleaner on the Indoor Allergen Sensitized Allergic Rhinitis Patients@highlight

This study aimed to assess the impact of air cleanser on allergic rhinitis patients and indoor air quality.

 Air cleaners will be installed in the bedrooms and living rooms of the mite allergic rhinitis patients who aged 18-60 years.

 Main parameters: - Symptom medication score of allergic rhinitis Supportive parameters: - Visual analog scale of allergic rhinitis - Quality of life score of allergic rhinitis - Indoor air quality measurement - Indoor allergen level measurement
