(secondQuint)Esthetic and Radiographic Outcomes Following Immediate Implant Placement With or Without Labial Plate Defects.

 The objective of this prospective controlled clinical trial is to compare the esthetic and radiographic outcomes following immediate implant placement with or without labial plate dehiscence defects using bone augmentation in combination with an absorbable collagen membrane.

 Subjects in need of one implant replacing tooth to be removed in the maxilla within region 13-23 are included.

 Thirty patients are recruited.

 They are divided into two groups: intact labial plate and compromised labial plate.

 No implant-supported temporary restorations are used during the first 4 months.

 After a screw-retained provisional phase of 2 months, a final impression is taken at implant level and take-in definitive crown.

 Patients are recalled for oral hygiene maintenance and prosthetic controls every 6 months for the entire duration of the study.
