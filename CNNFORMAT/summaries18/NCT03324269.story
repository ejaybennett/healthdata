(fifthQuint)Evaluating the Predictive Value of the Nociception Level Index NOL.

 The evaluation of pain, a conscious response, in the anesthetized patient remains one of the main challenges in anaesthesia.

 Opioids remain the cornerstone for perioperative analgesia, albeit frequently associated with side effects.

 Most of these side-effects are dose-dependent.

 The misadministration of opioids contributes to side-effects such as: post-operative nausea and vomiting, respiratory depression and opioid-induced hyperalgesia.

 Thus intra-operative monitors are necessary to measure the balance between Nociception and Anti-Nociception (NAN balance) by an adequate opioid administration.

 In the past few years, different monitors have been developed such as the Analgesia Nociception index (ANI) based on the heart rate variability and the Surgical Plethysmographic index (SPI) based on the amplitude of the Plethysmogram and the heart rate variation.

 Pupil dilation has also been proposed (Algiscan, Idmed company, Marseille, France).

 Each one of these monitors is measuring only one parameter.

 Recently the NOL monitor was released.

The NoL index ranges from 0 to 100 and is based on a nonlinear combination of nociception-related physiologic variables, specifically heart rate (HR), heart rate variability at the 0.

15- to 0.

4-Hz band power, photoplethysmograph wave amplitude (PPGA), skin conductance level, number of skin conductance fluctuations, and their time derivatives.

The NoL index estimates the nociceptive/antinociceptive state from these component measures using random forest regression.

 NOL index has been studied in many types of surgery apart from cardiac surgery.

 Cardiac surgery has one of the frailest patient populations, in whom hemodynamic stability is of utter importance.

 In our institution, a combination of TCI propofol (Schnider model) and remifentanil (Minto model) is used to for most of the anaesthetic procedures, including cardiac anaesthesia.

 Remifentanil is titrated to prevent an increase in blood pressure and hearth rhythm at noxious stimuli, such as surgical incision, sternotomy and adapted following hemodynamic trend during surgery.

 The hypothesis of this study is to develop a calibration test using the NOL index variation to define the individual most appropriate NAN balance using remifentanil TCI before the start of surgery and before a very strong noxious surgical stimulus such as surgical incision in thyroid surgery and sternotomy during cardiac surgery.

 Before the start of surgery, the investigators want to titrate in each patient the remifentanil Ce required to abolish the NOL index response to a calibrated noxious tetanic stimulus (Tetanus 60 mamp, 100 Hz, 30 seconds).

 Thus this individual remifentanil Ce will be the remifentanil level programmed before surgical incision and sternotomy.

 NOL and hemodynamic responses will be recorded during the entire duration of thyroid surgery and until the cardiopulmonary bypass during cardiac surgery.

 The individual relation between the remifentanil calibration level and the patient's response will be studied.
