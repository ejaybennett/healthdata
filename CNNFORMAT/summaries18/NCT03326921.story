(fifthQuint)HA-1 T TCR T Cell Immunotherapy for the Treating of Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia After Donor Stem Cell Transplant.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the feasibility and safety of HA-1 T TCR T cell immunotherapy in approximately 12 children and adolescents and 12 adults with recurrent acute leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the in vivo persistence of transferred HA-1 TCR T cells in peripheral blood.

 II.

 To determine the ability of HA-1 TCR T cells to migrate to bone marrow.

 III.

 To evaluate the function of HA-1 TCR T cells before and, if possible, after adoptive T cell transfer.

 IV.

 To observe whether infusion of HA-1 TCR T cells is followed by a reduction of leukemia burden.

 V.

 To observe whether infusion of HA-1 TCR T cells is followed by a reduction of recipient hematopoietic chimerism.

 VI.

 To observe whether infusion of HA-1 TCR T cells is followed by the appearance or recurrence of signs or symptoms of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CD4+ and CD8+ HA-1 TCR T cell.

 Patients receive fludarabine phosphate for 1-3 doses 7-14 days prior to HA-1 TCR T cell administration.

 Patients then receive CD4+ and CD8+ HA-1 TCR T cells intravenously (IV) over 1 hour.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up closely for 12 weeks and then every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually for up to 10 years.

 HA-1 T TCR T Cell Immunotherapy for the Treating of Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia After Donor Stem Cell Transplant@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CD4+ and CD8+ HA-1 T cell receptor (TCR) T cells in treating patients with acute leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment following donor stem cell transplant.

 T cell receptor is a special protein on T cells that helps them recognize proteins on other cells including leukemia.

 HA-1 is a protein that is present on the surface of some peoples' blood cells, including leukemia.

 HA-1 T cell immunotherapy enables genes to be added to the donor cells to make them recognize HA-1 markers on leukemia cells.
