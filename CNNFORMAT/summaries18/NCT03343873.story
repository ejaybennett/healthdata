(secondQuint)The Effects of Different Anesthetics on Functional Connectivity and (EEG).

 This research will include 150 healthy volunteers and 150 brain tumor patients; the participants will be randomly divided into midazolam, dexmedetomidine, propofol, ketamine and saline (control) group.

 Resting and task fMRI will be performed with 32-leads EEG simultaneously at awake, sedation and recovery states.

 The primary outcome of our study is the effect of mild sedation for visual and auditory brain network connection.

 The secondary outcomes are the effect of mild sedation for default, executive control, sensory and motor networks and their subnetwork connectivity; the effect of mild sedation for simultaneous EEG; the sedation state, circulatory and respiratory parameters of the participants, and the adverse events.

 The Effects of Different Anesthetics on Functional Connectivity and (EEG)@highlight

This research is a prospective double-blinded randomized controlled study.

 It will mainly discuss the mild sedative mechanism and the effect on brain functional connectivity and simultaneous EEG of midazolam, dexmedetomidine, propofol and ketamine.
