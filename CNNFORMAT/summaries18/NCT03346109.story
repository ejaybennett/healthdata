(secondQuint)To Study the Feasibility and Quality of Life of Medial Group Retropharyngeal Node Sparing in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.

 In this study, patients with non-keratinizing stage T1-4 N0-3 M0 NPC(UICC/AJCC 8th edition), except for patients with MRLN metastasis, are randomly assigned to receive MRLN sparing or prophylactic irradiation .

 Patients in MRLN sparing group will not routinely receive MRLN irradiation to 56Gy/33Fr; while patients in MRLN prophylactic irradiation group will always receive MRLN irradiation to 56Gy/33Fr.

 Our primary endpoint is local relapse-free survival (LRFS).

 Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), incidence of out-field recurrence rate, toxic effects, and quality of life (QOL).

All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to treat population, and the safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.

 To Study the Feasibility and Quality of Life of Medial Group Retropharyngeal Node Sparing in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma@highlight

This is an randomized, controlled, phase 3 clinical trial.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether medial group retropharyngeal node (MRLN) sparing could reduce the incidence of radiation-caused dysphagia and improve patients' quality of life without compromising survival rate.
