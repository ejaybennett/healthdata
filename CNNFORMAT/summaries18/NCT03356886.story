(thirdQuint)Additional Effect of Pain Neuroscience Education on Pain And Disability in Chronic Low Back Pain.

 Design: This study will be a blinded randomized controlled clinical trial.

 Participants: One hundred and four participants with CLBP (18 and 55 years) both genders.

 Interventions: Individuals included will be randomized into two possible treatment arms: PNE+SMT or SMT alone.

 Each treatment will last for 8 sessions.

 The group submitted to PNE+SMT will received in the first two initial sessions an individual face-to-face PNE program of 40 minutes.

Main outcome measures: Pain intensity and low back pain-related disability will be adopted as primary outcomes and as secondary outcomes we will assess fear-avoidance, pain self-efficacy and global perceived effect of improvement.

 The outcomes will be assessed on three occasions: pre-intervention, immediately after 8 sessions of intervention and after one-month follow-up period.

 All statistical analysis will be conducted following the principles of intention to treat, and the effects of treatment will be calculated using linear mixed models.

 Discussion: This study will help to better understand if PNE -a psychosocial cognitive intervention- will add significant effect (immediate and at follow-up) to a movement therapy protocol based on manual therapy.

 Additional Effect of Pain Neuroscience Education on Pain And Disability in Chronic Low Back Pain@highlight

Objectives: The primary objective will be to investigate the additional effect (immediate and after one-month follow up) of pain neuroscience education (PNE) to Spinal Manipulative Therapy (SMT) on primary outcomes of pain intensity and disability in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain (CLBP).
