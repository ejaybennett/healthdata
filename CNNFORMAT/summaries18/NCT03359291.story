(firstQuint)Clinical Study to Investigate the Effect of Macitentan on the Concentrations of Rosuvastatin in the Blood of Healthy Male Subjects.

 Rosuvastatin is a substrate of various transporter proteins including breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP).

 It is unknown to which extent macitentan has an effect, if any, on BCRP transporters, especially intestinal BCRP.

 The primary purpose of this Phase 1 study is to investigate the effect of macitentan on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin, a model BCRP substrate.

The aim of this Phase 1 trial is to study a potential drug-drug interaction between macitentan and rosuvastatin, a model substrate of various transporter proteins (e.

g.

 in the gut).
