(firstQuint)BRIDGE: Proactive Psychiatry Consultation and Case Management for Patients With Cancer.

 It is challenging to cope with cancer.

 The investigators want to understand if it is helpful for patients with serious mental illness (SMI) to be connected to a psychiatrist and case manager when cancer is diagnosed.

 Many people with illnesses like major depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder face barriers to receiving high quality cancer care.

 It can be difficult to get to appointments, have many different doctors, and experience depression or worry.

 Better communication between the patient, the oncology team, and mental health providers may improve care.

 As for all patients, it is important for people with mental illness to have access to high quality cancer treatment that is patient-centered and coordinated.

 Having a case manager and psychiatrist at the cancer center who collaborates with the oncology team starting at cancer diagnosis may help patients to receive the cancer care that they need.

 This single-arm open pilot study will enable the study team to pilot patient measures (engagement and satisfaction in care, psychiatric and cancer-related symptoms) and caregiver measures (engagement and satisfaction in care, caregiver burden, and mastery) and refine the intervention manual before conducting a randomized controlled trial (17-396-RCT).
