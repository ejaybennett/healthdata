(secondQuint)A Post Marketing Surveillance Study.

 This study is planned to collect information on use of the Barricaid ACD with an anchor width of 6mm.

 Other iterations of the device are made with an 8mm wide anchor.

 The narrower anchor was designed to optimize surgeon visualization during implantation, is CE-marked, and has undergone all appropriate rigorous testing prior to release.

 Safety will be evaluated to demonstrate acceptable levels of device-related and procedure-related complications.

 This limited market release will allow its performance to be evaluated by examining the effects on reoperation, device deficiencies, patient pain scores and disability after discectomy with ACD.
