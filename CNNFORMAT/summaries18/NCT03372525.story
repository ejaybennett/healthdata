(secondQuint)Invasive Ventilation Strategies for Neonates With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Syndrome (ARDS).

 Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the serious complications in critically ill neonates.

 It can result in severe hypoxemia refractory to mechanical ventilation.

 Usually, invasive ventilation with low parameters is enough for neonates with mild and moderate ARDS.

 And extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is used to neonates with severe ARDS.

 However, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can also lead to high death rate and need more technique and conditions.

 Mechanical ventilation with higher parameters was a substitute for such situations, but the death rate, complications and injuries of higher parameters is unknown.

 The purpose of the present study was to compare HFOV with CMV as invasive respiratory support strategies on decrease the mortality and morbidities in neonate with ARDS.

 Invasive Ventilation Strategies for Neonates With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Syndrome (ARDS)@highlight

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in neonates has been defined in 2017.

The death rate is over 50%.

 HFOV and CMV are two main invasive ventilation strategies.

 However, which one is better needing to be further elucidated.
