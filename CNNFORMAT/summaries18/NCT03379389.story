(fifthQuint)Clinical Assessment of Urinary Antiseptics Methenamine and Methylthioninium in Recurrent Cystitis.

 This is a double-blind, randomized, double-dummy, comparative study in parallel groups of subjects presenting with recurrent cystitis (2 episodes within the past 6 months).

 After initial evaluations including urine culture and antibiogram, a total of 284 subjects will be randomized and treated with one of two presentations of urinary antiseptics containing methenamine and methylthioninium for six days.

 After three days of treatment, subjects will return to the study center and antibiotic therapy based on the results of the urine culture and antibiogram will be initiated for each subject, to be continued for the remaining three days of the treatment period.

 Efficacy assessments will include the UTISA (Urinary Tract Infection Symptoms Assessment Questionnaire) together with a global assessment by the investigator.

 Safety assessments will include monitoring of adverse events and laboratory tests carried out at each of the three study visits.
