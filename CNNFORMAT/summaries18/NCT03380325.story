(firstQuint)The Effect of Iloprost on Capillary Recruitment and Insulin Sensitivity in Type 2 Diabetes.

 In type 2 diabetes impaired insulin-mediated muscle perfusion is thought to contribute to reduced whole-body glucose uptake.

 This study aims to identify iloprost - a stable prostacyclin analogue - as a possible therapeutic option to increase whole-body glucose uptake via enhancement of muscle perfusion.

 All participants will be subjected to two hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps; one with and one without simultaneous iloprost infusion in a randomized cross-over design.

 Microvascular blood volume will be measured by means of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography.
