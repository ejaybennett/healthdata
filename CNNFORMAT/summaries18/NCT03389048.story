(firstQuint)Performance Assessment Of The PMD-200 In Subjects With Degenerative Lumbar Spine Disease Who Requires Surgical Procedure.

 The proposed study is design to further demonstrates the capability of the Nociception Level, (NoL) Index in identify and discriminate between painful event and non-painful period following pain stimulus of Straight Leg Raising (SLR) test in patients with degenerative lumbar spine disease.

 This feasibility study may provide first indication for a validation method that will be able to evaluate the outcome of a surgical procedure within the degenerative lumbar spine patient.

 Currently, there is lack of understanding of long-term outcomes after such surgeries.

 In this study, the investigators plan to demonstrate that the NoL Index may serve as an indicator to the surgical procedure outcome.

 It will compare the objective measurement of the NoL to the patient Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and disability questionnaire that will characterize the subject pain perception prior and following the surgical procedure.
