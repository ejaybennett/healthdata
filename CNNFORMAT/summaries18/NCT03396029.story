(firstQuint)Tailored Written Lifestyle Feedback in Colorectal Cancer Screening.

 Cancer screening may be used as a teachable moment for healthy lifestyle behaviours.

 This study aims to investigate the effect of minimal, but individually tailored lifestyle advice and a standard leaflet on healthy lifestyle given at a colorectal cancer screening context on one-year changes in these behaviours in a population-based sample of men and women.

 Individuals invited to sigmoidoscopy screening in the piloting of Norwegian Bowel Cancer Screening are additionally invited to this lifestyle intervention study.

 Changes in lifestyle are measured by a brief lifestyle questionnaire administered at prescreening and after one year.

 The intervention to the intervention arms is given after completion of the prescreening lifestyle questionnaire.
