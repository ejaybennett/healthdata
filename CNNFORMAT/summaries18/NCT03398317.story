(secondQuint)Sperm Selection by Either PICSI or MACS in Cases With Abnormal Sperm DNA Fragmentation Index for ICSI.

 Sperm DNA fragmentation has shown a negative correlation with fertilization rate, embryo quality, and implantation rate.

 And a positive correlation with miscarriage rate in the 1st trimester.

 Sperm selection methods like PICSI and MACS have been developed for selecting a healthy mature non apoptotic sperm with healthy membrane for Oocyte injection so as to obtain best embryo quality and achieve higher ongoing pregnancy rates.

 A sperm selection technique based on sperm membrane binding to hyaluronic acid (PICSI Dish), the main substrate of the oocyte zonapellucida, could improve the likelihood of obtaining better sperm for ICSI with non fragmented DNA.

 Another sperm selection technique based on Magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) that depends on the binding of protein Annexin V to phosphatidylserine which is a marker for apoptosis, giving a resulting (eluted) spermatozoa without DNA fragmentation.

 In order to determine which sperm selection technique is better for dealing with DNA fragmentation patients we need to study both techniques on two different groups of patients.

 Sperm Selection by Either PICSI or MACS in Cases With Abnormal Sperm DNA Fragmentation Index for ICSI@highlight

On the day of ICSI, choosing the best sperm by either PICSI or magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) in cases with abnormal DNA is not fully investigated.

 This study helps in solving this problem by using two known techniques to achieve that purpose.
