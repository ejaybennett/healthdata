(fifthQuint)Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis With Methotrexate: Predictors of Response.

 The purpose of the study is to gather, in a prospective manner, information on patients with early rheumatoid arthritis and their response to methotrexate therapy.

 Specific aims of this study are: - To evaluate the efficacy of methotrexate monotherapy as defined by attaining ACR 50 response after 16 weeks of therapy.

 - To identify predictors of methotrexate response in patients with RA.

 - Does presence of the shared epitope predict methotrexate response - Does evidence of periodontal disease predict methotrexate response A maximum of 120 RA patients will be consented for this protocol.

 This subject accrual will include UNMC and the RAIN (Rheumatoid Arthritis Investigational Network).

 Investigators have examined the discriminatory characteristics of several clinical and biologic parameters in predicting treatment response (at least 50% improvement based on ACR criteria) in initial analyses involving 54 participants with early RA treated with methotrexate monotherapy in past RAIN clinical trials.

 In the initial analyses, factors showing discriminatory characteristics have included rheumatoid factor (RF) isotypes (particularly IgA and IgM), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE)-containing alleles, C-reactive protein, and interleukin (IL)-1.

 For instance, we have found that subjects with low serum concentrations of RF-IgM ( 27 IU/ml) serum concentrations (79% vs.

 43%).

 Males and females will participate in this protocol.

 As RA is approximately three times more common in females, it is anticipated that a higher percentage of the study subjects will be female.

 Subjects will be > 19 years of age.

 This age range was chosen because the age of majority in Nebraska is 19.

 RA diagnosed before the age of 19 may not have the same disease characteristics as defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criterion for RA.

 Pediatric subjects will not be enrolled in this study.

 Rheumatoid arthritis occurs in all races.

 No enrollment restrictions have been based on race or ethnic origin.

 Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis With Methotrexate: Predictors of Response@highlight

This is an open-label, prospective study of methotrexate in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) designed to characterize the subset of RA patients that respond best to methotrexate monotherapy.

 Eligible patients will be adults with RA who are naive to prior methotrexate or combination disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy.

 Patients will be started on methotrexate at 15 mg once weekly, with the dose escalated to 20 mg once weekly at 8 weeks for patients not in remission.

 Patients will be assessed with joint counts and laboratory monitoring at study entry, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks.

 Primary endpoint will be achievement of ACR 50 (American College of Rheumatology 50) criteria.

 Investigators will collect serum for rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibody isotyping and, in patients who sign a separate consent, DNA for genotype analysis.

 This should allow Investigators not only to evaluate the efficacy of methotrexate monotherapy but also to identify predictors of a good therapeutic response and evaluate the tolerability of a more aggressive dosing regimen.
