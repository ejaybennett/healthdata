 Physical inactivity is a significant risk for various cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, diabetes, and stroke.

 To address the sitting disease Sackner Wellness Products has patented 2 non-invasive methods for inducing passive movement while in seated or supine posture the Gentle Jogger(R) and Gentle Jumper(R), each simulating the activities of jogging and jumping respectively.

 Passive simulation of jogging and jumping introduces pulses into the circulation as the feet strike a semi-rigid surface within the chassis of the device.

 These pulsations stimulate release of beneficial mediators which are important to cardiovascular health.

 The study will recruit healthy subjects in a younger age group (25-59 yrs ) and older age group (> 60 yrs) in order to measure changes in blood pressure, cardiovascular indices of vasodilation, heart rate variability, and other non-invasively acquired biometric information in different postures [(1) supine, 2) semi-recumbent, 3) sitting, 4) Trendelenburg and 5) reverse Trendelenburg )], while at rest and during and after use of the GJogger and GJumper.

 Additionally, a subgroup of subjects will be asked to perform texting of a specified script in order to determine whether or not GJogger is a distraction during text messaging.

 Volunteers will be paid for their participation in the study The Gentle Jogger and Gentle Jumper are non-FDA regulated wellness devices (2016) in which, 1) GJogger and GJumper as part of a healthy lifestyle may help to prevent certain chronic diseases or conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes and, 2) may help living well with certain chronic diseases or conditions such as s heart disease, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes.

Movement is important for overall health.

 Lack of movement has been shown to be associated with numerous diseases.

 This study will assess the validity and usefulness of two innovative low risk, non-invasive wellness devices, the Gentle Jogger(R) and the Gentle Jumper that passively simulate the physical activities of jogging and jumping, respectively.

 The study will evaluate whether or not each of the devices in different body postures (seated, lying down, slight recumbent and slight head down) produces changes in blood pressure, and indices of dilatation of blood vessels, in a younger (25-59yr) and older (> 60 yrs.

) subject population.

 Volunteers will be paid for their participation in the study.
