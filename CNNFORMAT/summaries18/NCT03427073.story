(fifthQuint)Dose-escalation Study of ALM201 in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer and Other Solid Tumours.

 ALM201 is a peptide with anti-angiogenic activity in a range of in-vitro and ex-vivo models.

 ALM201/0001 is a Phase 1, multicentre, open-label, dose escalation study of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ALM201.

 The study is divided into two parts.

 Part 1 will enrol patients with advanced solid tumours.

 Patients will receive subcutaneous injection of ALM201 on Days 1-5, 8-12 and 15-19 in 21 day cycles.

 Patients can receive up to 8 cycles of treatment, although compassionate use will be allowed based on availability of ALM201.

 Enrolment will follow an accelerated dose escalation schedule until grade 2 drug-related adverse events are observed, at this point the 3+3 enrolment design will be used.

 There will be at least 1 week stagger between the first and subsequent patients in a new cohort dose.

 Dose increments will not exceed 100% escalation and will be guided by data generated from previous cycles.

 The dose and possibly the schedule will be adjusted to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).

 Part 2 will enrol patients with advanced ovarian cancer whose tumour has a proangiogenic profile as assessed by the angiogenesis gene signature biomarker.

 Patients will receive ALM201 at a dose and schedule established in Part 1.

 Patients will undergo safety and tumour assessments as well as blood draws for PK profiling.

 The safety assessments will involve physical examination, vital signs, biochemistry and haematology laboratory screens as well as immunogenicity testing.

 Tumour assessments will involve computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at screening and after every 2 cycles during cycles 1 -8.

 Patients will be asked to provide consent for access to archived tumour tissue and for fresh biopsies to be taken at pre-dose, tumour response and/or point of disease progression for potential biomarker and pharmacodynamics assessments.

 Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling will be carried out in Cycles 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8.

 Dose-escalation Study of ALM201 in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer and Other Solid Tumours@highlight

ALM201 is a peptide with anti-angiogenic activity in a range of in-vitro and ex-vivo models.

 ALM201/0001 is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ALM201.

 The study is divided into two parts.

 In Part 1, patients with advanced solid tumours will receive daily doses of ALM201 on Days 1-5, 8-12 and 15-19 in 21 day cycles to assess the safety profile of ALM201.

 Part 2 will be a dose expansion of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) determined in Part 1.

 Patients with advanced ovarian cancer will be enrolled with the main objective to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose.
