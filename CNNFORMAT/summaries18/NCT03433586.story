(fifthQuint)COMT on Aspirin Platelets Effects (CAPE).

 This is a randomized, crossover, double-blinded, placebo and no-treatment controlled study.

 This study is designed to detect the variation in platelet function based on COMT variation and how these platelets respond to cancerous cells.

 We expect to enroll 200 healthy participants with the intention of studying 90 participants to complete the protocol.

 Individuals aged 18 to 40 years will be eligible to participate in this study if they do not have history of fainting/problems related to blood draws, major chronic medical illnesses, regular or current treatment of Aspirin cent .

 Examine the role of genetic variation in in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) on platelet function in a randomized, crossover, double-blinded, placebo and no-treatment controlled clinical trial of daily Aspirin cent (81 mg), placebo, and no treatment for 10 3 days.

 Platelet function will be assessed with a platelet aggregometry and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting assessment of platelet adhesion molecule GPIIIb/IIIa and p-selectin.

 COMT on Aspirin Platelets Effects (CAPE)@highlight

The PAVE study is a parallel trial of the effects of genetic variation in COMT in the presence or absence of Aspirin cent (81mg), placebo, and no treatment on platelet function.

 Healthy normal participants (N=90) between the ages of 18 and 40 years will be randomized to take daily placebo Aspirin cent (81mg), placebo, and no treatment for 10+/- 3 days.

 Following each treatment, participants will have a 2-week washout period before taking the other treatments for an additional 10+/- 3 days.

 Blood samples will be taken at baseline and after each treatment for evaluation of platelet adhesion molecule expression and aggregation.

 Samples will also be evaluated for differential gene expression and metabolomic profiles.
