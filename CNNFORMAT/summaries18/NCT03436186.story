(thirdQuint)Swallowing and Voice Outcomes After Thyroidectomy.

 A total of 43 consenting patients who underwent thyroidectomy were prospectively recruited.

 Subjective evaluation of swallowing was assessed with 'Swallowing Impairment Score' and 'MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory'.

 Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) was applied for objective evaluation.

 Also, functional oral intake scale (FOIS) and functional outcome swallowing scale (FOSS) were used for swallowing assessment.

 Voice evaluation was assessed with videostrobolaryngoscopy (VSL) and 'The Multi-Dimensional Voice Program (MDVP)' was used for capturing and analyzing the voice samples.

 All evaluations were performed preoperatively and on 1st day, 2nd week and 6th months postoperatively.

 Swallowing and Voice Outcomes After Thyroidectomy@highlight

Impairment in voice and swallowing functions are common after thyroidectomy.

 The investigators aimed to evaluate the objective functional voice and swallowing outcomes in a series of patients undergoing thyroidectomy.

 according to the study, even in the absence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, subjective and objective swallowing and voice alterations do occur after thyroidectomy.
