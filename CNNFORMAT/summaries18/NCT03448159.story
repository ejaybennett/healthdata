(firstQuint)Fluoxetine Opens Window to Improve Motor Recovery After Stroke.

 FLOW Trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded phase II trial evaluating the efficacy of coupling antidepressant therapy (e.

g.

, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor - fluoxetine) with exercise rehabilitation across multiple Canadian sites in 176 stroke patients.

 88 patients will be enrolled in each arm of the study.

 Both groups will receive an exercise program in addition to standard of care rehabilitation, but only one group (the intervention group) will receive the active drug fluoxetine.

 Study participants will be evaluated at baseline, post-exercise program and 6-months post-exercise program.

 While enrolled in the study, participants will be required to take part in a 12 week, 3 times per week exercise program.

 Evaluators and patients will be blind to the treatment administered.

 The trial is constructed with randomization to remove selection and allocation biases and to ensure greater validity in observed differences in the outcome measures.

 The Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC) in Toronto will act as the coordinating and analysis center.
