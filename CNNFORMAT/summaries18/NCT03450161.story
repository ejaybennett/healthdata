(fifthQuint)Hyperalgesia, Persistent Pain, and Fentanyl Dosing in On-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.

 A prospective, randomized, double-blinded (patient, anesthesiologist, assessor) clinical study.

 This study will examine three different clinically used application schemes of fentanyl, an opioid used as the standard of care in routine practice.

 Patients will be randomized to receive one of the following three treatment arms for anesthesia maintenance (pre-sternotomy): 1.

 High-dose fentanyl bolus (20 mu g/kg of body weight [BW]; e.

g.

 70kg 1400 mu g or 1.

4mg) 2.

 Low-dose fentanyl bolus (3 mu g/kg BW; e.

g.

 70kg 210 mu g or 0.

2mg) 3.

 Continuous fentanyl application by Shibutani scheme This study will include data from 69 adult patients (23 per arm) undergoing first time, elective, on-pump CABG surgery with median sternotomy and central cannulation.

 Following randomization by the sealed envelope technique, fentanyl kits will be drawn up by an anesthesiologist not involved in patient care or outcome assessment.

 Patients with preexisting chronic pain, opioids in the last 30 days, a BMI>36kg/m2, sleep apnoea, renal failure (clearance mu g/kg bolus of fentanyl (not study medication, but rather standard of care).

 5 minutes prior to sternotomy, the patient will receive analgesia maintenance (one of the three fentanyl study arms).

 Clinicians will at all times be able to administer a bolus of fentanyl on a perceived "as needed" basis (not study medication, but rather standard of care).

 The primary objective of this trial is to assess whether or not different intraoperative dosing schemes of fentanyl during on-pump CABG surgery influence the area of hyperalgesia as measured by sternal pin-prick testing on the first postoperative day.

 As the mechanisms causing opioid-induced analgesia are poorly understood but appear to be dosis-related, the investigators will examine 3 clinically used fentanyl application schemes in cardiac surgery: 1) a high-dose bolus group, 2) a low-dose bolus group, and 3) a low-dose continuous infusion group.

 Hyperalgesia, Persistent Pain, and Fentanyl Dosing in On-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting@highlight

Randomized, double-blinded, three arm study in adult patients undergoing first time coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery with median sternotomy.

 The investigators will examine the effects of three fentanyl dosing schemes (high-dose bolus, low-dose bolus, continuous dose) on the area of hyperalgesia and allodynia at 24 and 48h as well as on persisting pain at 3, 6, and 12 months.

 Additionally, the investigators will measure fentanyl concentrations throughout anesthesia.
