(thirdQuint)Relationship Between Knee Varus and Patellofemoral Pain.

 The hip-knee-ankle angle of 180 1 from standing whole-lower-extremity radiograph was taken as neutral axis.

 Angles of less than 179 were labelled knee valgus, and angles greater than 181 were labelled knee varus.

 The proportion of knee valgus is very low in the general population.

 Maybe the number of participants with knee valgus in this study will be very small.

 Therefore, the study will mainly assess the hip-knee-ankle angle of the participants with knee varus in the two groups.

 It is hypothesized that knee varus is a risk factor for patellofemoral pain.

 Relationship Between Knee Varus and Patellofemoral Pain@highlight

This study aims to research on the relationship between knee varus and patellofemoral pain.

 The standardized standing whole-lower-extremity radiographs of the participants will be taken.

 The hip-knee-ankle angle will be obtained from the radiographs.

 The hip-knee-ankle angle of the participants with knee varus in the study group and the hip-knee-ankle angle of the participants with knee varus in the control group will be compared.
