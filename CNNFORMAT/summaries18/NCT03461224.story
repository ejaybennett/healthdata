(secondQuint)Modulated Accelerated RAdiotherapy in Early Breast Cancer.

 The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical results in terms of late skin and subcutaneous toxicity of accelerated hypofractionated forward-planned IMRT in patients with early stage BC.

 Results were compared with a historical control group (CG) of patients treated with 3D-conformal postoperative RT delivered with conventional fractionation.
