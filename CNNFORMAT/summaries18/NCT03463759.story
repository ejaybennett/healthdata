(secondQuint)Pain Inhibition and Facilitation in Recurrent Low Back Pain.

 Pain inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms have been suggested to play a role in the development of persistent low back pain; however, there is still debate on when changes in these mechanisms occur.

 Similarly, evoked cortical responses can reflect neuroplastic changes in pain processing regions, which are also thought to play a role in the transition to persistent pain, but there is also debate on when these neuroplastic changes develop relative to low back pain.

 Therefore, this study will use patients with an intermediary clinical pain state, recurrent low back pain, and matched healthy control participants, to investigate within and between subject differences in pain inhibitory, facilitatory and neuroplastic mechanisms.

 Pain Inhibition and Facilitation in Recurrent Low Back Pain@highlight

This study evaluates psychophysical measures of pain inhibition and facilitation, along with cortical responses to different sensory stimuli, in patients with recurrent low back pain and matched healthy individuals.
