(fifthQuint)Cortical Superficial Siderosis and Risk of Recurrent Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy.

.

 Patients with acute lobar ICH fulfilling the Boston criteria for probable or possible CAA will be enrolled within 30 days after ICH onset.

 Brain MRI performed at baseline will be analyzed blinded to clinical data.

 Patients with presence of cSS will be compared with those without cSS.

 During a systematic follow-up of 24 months, patients will undergo neurological, neuropsychological and MRI evaluation.

 We will compare the rate of recurrent symptomatic ICH at 24 months in patients with vs.

 without cSS.

 Cortical Superficial Siderosis and Risk of Recurrent Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy.

@highlight

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a major cause of lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the elderly with high risk of recurrence.

 The investigators aim to determine the relationship between cortical superficial siderosis (cSS), a MRI hemorrhagic marker of CAA and the risk of symptomatic ICH recurrence in a multicentric prospective cohort of patients with acute lobar ICH related to CAA.

 The investigators hypothesize that patients with cSS have an increased risk of recurrent symptomatic ICH relative to those without cSS.
