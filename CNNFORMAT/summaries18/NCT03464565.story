(secondQuint)COMPLETE: International Acute Ischemic Stroke Registry With the Penumbra System Aspiration Including the 3D Revascularization Device.

 Registry Objective: The primary objective of this registry is to collect data on Penumbra System including the 3D Revascularization Device in a patient population with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) secondary to intracranial large vessel occlusion (LVO).

 Registry Design: This will be a prospective, single-arm, multi-center observational registry and will include patients that present with either anterior or posterior LVO who are eligible for mechanical thrombectomy using the Penumbra System.

 Registry Duration: Subjects will be in the registry for approximately 90 days from enrollment to last follow-up.

 Data Management: Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) will be used at all investigational sites.

 All registry data will be entered into commercially available web-based electronic data capture system (EDC).

 Data entry will be performed by the study site personnel.

 Automated data quality checks will display warnings for invalid data.

 Additionally, manual review of data listings may be used to identify data discrepancies or inconsistencies.
