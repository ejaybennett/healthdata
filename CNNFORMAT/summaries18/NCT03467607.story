(firstQuint)A Feasibility Study of a Low Tidal Volume Ventilation Strategy in One Lung Ventilation.

 This study investigated the feasibility of low tidal volume ventilation for one lung ventilation.

 45 patients were recruited - 15 patients in each of three groups, 3ml/kg, 4ml/kg or usual care.

 Outcomes studied were length of stay, 30 day mortality, unplanned ICU admission, evidence of respiratory failure or requirement for non-invasive ventilation, chest x-ray infiltrates and requirement for antibiotics.

 A Feasibility Study of a Low Tidal Volume Ventilation Strategy in One Lung Ventilation@highlight

A study of two ventilatory strategies for low tidal volume ventilation compared to a control group to elucidate if low tidal volumes of 3ml/kg or 4ml/kg were feasible for one lung ventilation.
