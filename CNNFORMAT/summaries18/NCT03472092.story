(secondQuint)Distinct Mechanisms of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Effects in Youth With Migraine.

 Pediatric migraine is a prevalent disorder that results in significant pain and disability for children and adolescents.

 Little is known about the distinct brain changes that occur in youth with migraine when they receive cognitive behavioral therapy, which is known to decrease headache days for these patients.

 Pediatric medical and behavioral clinicians can use mechanistic insights from this study to provide patients and families with a stronger rationale for treatment, thereby decreasing stigma and increasing confidence in and commitment to the care plan.

 This project will study migraine, which affects > 6 million youth in the U.

S.

 Cochrane reviews show that psychological therapies for pediatric headache result in better outcomes than control conditions (56% improved vs.

 22% in 714 participants), and our CBT+Amitriptyline Study found that 66% of youth with chronic migraine had a 50% reduction in headache days compared to 36% in an education control+Amitriptyline (AMI) group.

 Despite this evidence base, the neural mechanisms supporting the efficacy of CBT for pain remain poorly understood.

 The lack of mechanistic understanding is a barrier to treatment utilization, particularly given the time, effort, and expense for pediatric migraine patients to receive CBT vs.

 conventional pharmacological therapy (which in a national trial reduced headache days similar to placebo pill: AMI 52% of participants improved; Placebo 61%).

 Pilot data from the investigators demonstrate that: CBT induces changes in brain connectivity/activation, and QST at baseline predicts reduced migraines at 8 weeks.

This study evaluates whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is more effective in engaging and changing brain mechanisms associated with predicting a reduction in headaches than pill based therapies (placebo or amitriptyline).
