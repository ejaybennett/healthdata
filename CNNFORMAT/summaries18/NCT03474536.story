(fifthQuint)Quantitative Parameters of HLA-DQ Antibodies in Lung Transplantation.

 After lung transplantation the production of de novo DSA directed against HLA-DQ molecules is associated with CLAD and graft loss.

 The most used assay for serum DSA detection is the Single Antigen Luminex(R) (SAG), which provides a semi-quantitative fluorescence value, the MFI, used as a surrogate of DSA "strength".

 But MFI is not perfectly associated with CLAD development.

 We developed a method using SPR allowing the concentration, kinetics (ka, kd) and affinity parameters (KD) of anti-DQ DSA to be determined.

 These quantitative parameters could represent biomarkers finely associated with CLAD.

 The way this parameters evolve (stability, increase or decrease) with time could also impact on DSA pathogenicity.

 We will compare the quantitative parameters of de novo anti-HLA DQ DSA, determined at the time of their discovery, between recipients that developed a CLAD for the 2 years following DSA apparition, and those who did not.

 The association between quantitative parameters of DSA and graft loss, their evolution and its association with CLAD and graft loss, and their correlation with SAG MFI will be also evaluated.

 Quantitative Parameters of HLA-DQ Antibodies in Lung Transplantation@highlight

The aim is to compare the quantitative parameters of de novo anti-HLA DQ Donor Specific Antibodies (DSA), determined at the time of their discovery by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), between recipients that developed a Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction (CLAD) for the 2 years following DSA apparition and those who did not.

 If concentration, kinetics and/or affinity parameters of anti-DQ DSA are associated with CLAD development, new, non-invasive prognostic biomarkers of humoral rejection in lung transplantation will be discovered .
