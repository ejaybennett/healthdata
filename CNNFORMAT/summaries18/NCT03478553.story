(firstQuint)Genetics of IPF - Screening Study for Family Members.

 The purpose of this study is to explore genetic factors associated with the development of pulmonary fibrosis.

 The investigators aim is to identify and explore genetic loci that affect development of pulmonary fibrosis and also explore related environmental exposures.

 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is one of the interstitial lung diseases under the broader umbrella of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP).

 The investigators hypothesize that inherited genetic factors are associated with pulmonary fibrosis.

 To investigate the genetics of pulmonary fibrosis, the investigators plan to enroll individuals with pulmonary fibrosis and their family members.
