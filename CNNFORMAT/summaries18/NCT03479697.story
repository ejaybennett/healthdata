(secondQuint)HIRREM for Stage 1 Primary Hypertension.

 The purpose of this research study is to determine the effects of a technique called High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM(R)), for hypertension.

 HIRREM uses scalp sensors to monitor brain electrical activity, and computer software algorithms translate selected brain frequencies into audible tones in real time.

 Those tones are reflected back to participants via ear buds in as little as four to eight milliseconds, providing the brain an opportunity for self-adjustment of its electrical pattern.

 This study will compare acoustic stimulation linked to brainwave activity (HIRREM, along with continued current care, HCC), with continued current clinical care alone (CCC).

 Both groups will continue their other current care throughout, including non-pharmacological, and lifestyle modification therapies.
