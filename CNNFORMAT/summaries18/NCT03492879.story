(fifthQuint)Non Invasive Electrical Impedance Technology (EIT) for Diagnosing Liver Diseases Severity.

 The study will include 210 patients with chronic liver diseases.

 Relevant clinical data such as sex, age, weight, height, alcohol intake, medical history and routine lab results will be collected.

 The study will include three groups: 1.

 Patients with indication for liver biopsy will undergo a routine liver biopsy and also routine liver Ultrasonography, Shear wave elastography and Electrical Impedance Technology (EIT) (70 patients).

 2.

 Patients with chronic liver diseases will undergo routine liver Ultrasonography, Shear wave elastography and Electrical Impedance Technology (EIT) (70 patients).

 3.

 Patients with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease will undergo routine liver Ultrasonography, Shear wave elastography and quantification of liver steatosis using the Electrical Impedance Technology (EIT) (70 patients).

 Non Invasive Electrical Impedance Technology (EIT) for Diagnosing Liver Diseases Severity@highlight

The aims of this study are to assess the performance of the non-invasive Electrical Impedance Technology (EIT) in evaluating the liver fibrosis stage in patients with chronic liver diseases, in comparisons with a liver biopsy and/or Shear wave elastography and Liver Ultrasonography.

 The second aim is comparing between Liver Ultrasonography and Electrical Impedance Technology (EIT) to quantify the hepatic steatosis grade in patients with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) .
