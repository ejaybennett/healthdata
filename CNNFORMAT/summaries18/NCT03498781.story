(firstQuint)Good Intentions Study.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate attendance, exercise, and screen time habits in fitness center members.

 Because they are the population under investigation, recruitment will take place via the fitness center facilities.

 This population is under investigation because much of this population is sedentary and does not exercise at recommended levels, despite access to physical fitness facilities.

 This research will investigate methods to encourage physical activity in this population.
