(fifthQuint)Structured Discharge and Follow-up Protocol for COPD Patients Receiving LTOT and NIV.

 The study is planned with Turkish Thoracic Society and Global Alliance Against Respiratory Disease-Turkey partnership and being carried out 10 centers throughout Turkey.

 COPD patients who are prescribed long-term oxygen therapy for hypoxemic respiratory failure and/or noninvasive ventilation for hypercapnic respiratory failure will be included in the study and will be randomized to either intervention or control arm.

 The intervention mainly consists of not only education about the disease and medications but also the education of the equipment and how to use it to have the best benefit.

 Control arm patients will receive usual care, which consists of basic education of the patient about the therapies.

 The primary outcome of the study is readmission in 90 days.

 Structured Discharge and Follow-up Protocol for COPD Patients Receiving LTOT and NIV@highlight

Readmission to hospital is one of the most important problems in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients who developed chronic respiratory failure.

 Patients receiving long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) constitute the most vulnerable group because of the need for comprehensive care.

 However, because of lack of health care support systems in Turkey, many advanced COPD patients are hospitalized due to preventable problems such as insufficient knowledge about the therapies, nonadherence to therapy and technical issues related to LTOT/NIV equipment.

 The aim of this multicenter randomized trial is to find out whether a structured discharge and follow-up protocol reduce the rate of unplanned, COPD-related hospital readmissions over 90 days in patients receiving LTOT or NIV.
