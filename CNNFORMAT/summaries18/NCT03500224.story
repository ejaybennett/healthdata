(thirdQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Mass Balance, Pharmacokinetics (PK), Metabolism and Excretion of TAK-954 Containing Microtracer ([14C]-TAK-954) in Healthy Male Participants.

 The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-954.

 This study will assess the mass balance, metabolic profiles and routes of elimination of single intravenous dose of [14C]-TAK-954, and will determine the major circulating and excreted metabolites and single-dose PK of total radioactivity, TAK-954, THRX513466, and THRX 913682 in healthy male participants.

 The study will enroll approximately 6 participants.

 All participants will receive a single dose of [14C]-TAK-954 0.

5 mg on Day 1.

 This single-center trial will be conducted in Netherlands.

 The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 6 to 7 weeks.

 Participants will make a final visit to the clinic 15 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

The purpose of this study is to determine the mass balance, routes of elimination and characterize the metabolic profiles of a single intravenous dose of [14C]-TAK-954, identify major circulating and excreted metabolites.

 This study will also determine the single-dose PK of total radioactivity, TAK-954 and its metabolites where possible.
