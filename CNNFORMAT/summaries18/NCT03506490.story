(secondQuint)Acute Effects of Aerobic Exercise on Motor Memory Consolidation in Older People.

 The participants of this study were 33 subjects of both genders (M = 68 years old; SD = 4.

2 years old) and were divided in two groups: a control group (N = 15; M = 67, 6 years old; SD = 4.

1 years old) and an experimental group (N = 18; M = 67, 4 years old; SD = 4.

4 years old).

 The participants performed a Soda Pop test before the aerobic training session (Baseline).

 The training session lasted 45 minutes and was composed of running exercises.

 After the training session, the motor memory consolidation was held in three different stages: Training; 1 hour after training; 24 hours after training.

Scientific evidence suggests that an aerobic exercise session promotes improvements in the consolidation of motor memory in adults.

 In this sense, the main purpose of this study was to investigate if an aerobic training session could improve motor memory consolidation in older people.
