(secondQuint)Ketogenic Diet to Improve Neuro-recovery.

 There is a growing need for innovative therapies for improving neuro-recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI).

 Despite extensive research, clinical advancements, and improved rehabilitation strategies, SCI continues to be a significant cause of disability and mortality.

 Recent evidence shows that the diet-based therapies, such as ketogenic diet (KD) offer effective neuro-protection against secondary injury cascades in a rat model of SCI.

 The KD is a high-fat, low carbohydrate diet designed to mimic the metabolic and biochemical changes seen during calorie restriction, specifically, ketosis.

In this study our goal is to determine if 8 weeks of KD vs.

 SD significantly improves motor and sensory function, functional independence and gut microbiome composition in patients with complete SCI.

 56 individuals with SCI (C5-T12/ American Spinal Injury Impairment Scale (AIS)21, 22 who are starting enteral feeding will be randomly assigned to 8 weeks of KD or SD.

 Individuals' caloric targets will be set by measuring resting energy expenditure via indirect calorimetry prior to interventions.

 Patients will start solid KD or SD when they are able to swallow.

 Blood ketones, motor and sensory recovery (via American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [REF]), and functional independence (via Spinal Cord Independence Measure) scores will be measured before, after 4 and 8 weeks of KD vs.

 SD.

The purpose of this project is to determine if 8 weeks of ketogenic (KD, high-fat) diet vs.

 standard diet (SD) significantly improves motor and sensory function, gut function, and functional independence in patients with complete SCI.
