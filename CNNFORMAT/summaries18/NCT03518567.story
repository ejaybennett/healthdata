(thirdQuint)Behavioral Economic Analysis of Demand for Marijuana.

 This laboratory study will employ a multi-session experimental design to examine cue-induced craving for marijuana, the effect of marijuana administration (High THC) on behavioral economic demand for marijuana, and marijuana smoking topography.

 The study will recruit 100 non-treatment seeking marijuana users who smoke marijuana at least once weekly.

 The relationship between hypothetical and actual demand for marijuana will be examined.

 We will also investigate the impact of marijuana cue exposure on demand for marijuana, and will examine the relationship between demand for marijuana and indices of marijuana smoking topography.

 The study will recruit 100 non-treatment seeking marijuana users who smoke marijuana at least once weekly to obtain a final sample of 85 with complete data (15% of attrition).

 Participants will be tested at a baseline session and during two experimental sessions (a marijuana cue-reactivity paradigm paired with ad libitum marijuana smoking session and a marijuana smoking topography session).

 This study will confirm the utility of the hypothetical marijuana purchase task as a reliable and valid tool for assessing behavioral economic marijuana demand.
