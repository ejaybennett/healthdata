(thirdQuint)Characterization of Diabetes Mellitus in Fibrous Dysplasia/McCune-Albright Syndrome.

 Specific project aims include: Aim 1: Determine insulin secretion and sensitivity in subjects with MAS-associated diabetes.

 Aim 2: Measure gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in MAS-associated diabetes to investigate a potential role for excess glucagon signaling.

 Aim 3: Determine if IPMN development is associated with impairment of insulin secretion prior to development of overt diabetes.

 The authors expect that this study will: 1.

 Establish the etiology of diabetes in FD/MAS 2.

 Increase understanding of the role of IPMNs in pathogenesis of diabetes 3.

 Provide critical insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes in FD/MAS.

 Characterization of Diabetes Mellitus in Fibrous Dysplasia/McCune-Albright Syndrome@highlight

The investigators' objective is to understand the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus in Fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright syndrome (FD/MAS) by: 1) establishing the contributions of insulin resistance versus impaired insulin secretion, 2) investigating presence of excess glucagon signaling by measuring gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, and 3) investigating a potential interaction between diabetes and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs).
