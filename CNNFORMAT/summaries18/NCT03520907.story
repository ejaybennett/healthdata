(secondQuint)The Comparison of the Transversalis Fascia Plane Block With Ilioinguinal/Iliohypogastric Nerve Block.

 The ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block (II/IH B)is a widely used regional anesthesia technique in inguinal hernia repair surgery.

 However, this block provides limited analgesia during and after surgery, and the patients feel pain when walking.

 The transversalis fascia plane block (TFPB) is a recently developed technique and several case reports presented its efficacy for inguinal repair surgery in adult patients.

 It may block not only ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves but also splanchnic nerves, which is conveyed via the thoracolumbar fascia.

 Therefore, we compare the effect of the TFPB and II/IH B on postoperative pain and walking form.

 The Comparison of the Transversalis Fascia Plane Block With Ilioinguinal/Iliohypogastric Nerve Block@highlight

This study compares the transversalis fascia plane block with the ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block in children undergoing hernia repair surgery.

 Half of participants will receive the transversalis fascia plane block, while the other will receive the ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block.
