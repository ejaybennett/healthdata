(fifthQuint)Rivaroxaban as Thrombosis Prophylaxis in Bariatric Surgery.

 The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

 Rivaroxaban as an oral anticoagulant could be an attractive option for thromboprophylaxis compared to subcutaneous standard treatment after bariatric surgery.

 Especially in high-risk patients where an extended duration of thromboprophylaxis after hospital discharge is recommended, an oral therapy would be desirable.

 The objectives are to assess the safety and feasibility of VTE prophylaxis and lung embolism with Rivaroxaban 10mg as an oral anticoagulant.

 Especially in high-risk patients where an extended duration of thromboprophylaxis after hospital discharge is recommended, an oral therapy would be desirable.

 After bariatric surgery patients receive the study medication Xarelto 10mg QD for 7, resp.

 28 days.

 In a subgroup of study patients (patients from the University Hospital Inselspital, Bern) PK/PD parameters are assessed following the last intake of rivaroxaban at day 28.

 Rivaroxaban as Thrombosis Prophylaxis in Bariatric Surgery@highlight

The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

 The objectives are to assess the safety and feasibility of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis and lung embolism with Rivaroxaban 10mg as an oral anticoagulant.

 After bariatric surgery patients receive the study medication Xarelto 10mg QD for 7, resp.

 28 days.

 All clinically thromboembolic events will be assessed by ultrasound or CT, respectively, as soon as apparent.

 In addition, patients are screened for VTE at day 28 by ultrasound to detect clinically inapparent thromboses.

 In a subgroup of study patients (patients from the University Hospital Inselspital, Bern) PK/PD parameters are assessed following the last intake of rivaroxaban at day 28.
