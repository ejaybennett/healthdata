(fifthQuint)Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of GDC-0084 in Newly-diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme.

 Phase 2a study - Stage 1 Dose-Escalation and Maximum Tolerated Dose The dose-escalation portion of the study (Stage 1) will use a standard "3 + 3" design to determine the MTDs for QD and intermittent dosing schedules.

 The MTDs for QD and intermittent dosing of GDC-0084 will be determined in 3 steps: QD (Step 1), QOD (Step 2) and daily dosing for 3 consecutive days of the week (3 days on/4 days off) (Step 3).

 All 3 steps will follow the same dose-escalation rules as described below.

 Each step and each dose cohort within each step will consist of newly recruited patients with all patients receiving the dose to which they are originally assigned.

 Approximately 6 - 12 patients with newly diagnosed GBM will be enrolled in Step 1; the number of patients recruited to assess the intermittent dosing MTDs in each of Step 2 and Step 3 is assumed to be approximately the same (6 - 12 patients).

 However, numbers may vary for all 3 steps, depending on the outcome of the dose-escalation of each step.

 Step 1 The MTD for QD dosing will be determined.

 The initial dose level for QD dosing will be 60 mg (Dose Level 0).

 This dose is based on the phase 1 findings outlined in the rationale in the protocol, adding 1 dose level to test for a potential MTD increase.

 When the MTD for QD dosing has been determined, Step 2 and 3 will be initiated in parallel.

 Step 2/3 Once the MTD for QD has been determined, the QD MTD will be used as the initial dose level for the assessment of the QOD MTD in Step 2 and as the initial dose level for the assessment of the intermittent 3 days on/4 days off MTD in Step 3.

 Dose-escalation will occur in Stage 1: - The initial dose (Dose Level 0) for QD MTD determination in Step 1 will be 60 mg.

 Dose levels will increase in 15 mg steps; - The dose-escalation portion of the study (Stage 1) will use a standard "3 + 3" design to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of GDC-0084 administered orally in 28-day cycles; Decisions regarding dose-escalation and selection will be made by a Cohort Review Committee (CRC).

 All AEs, including DLTs, will be reported, with severity assessed according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.

03.

 After determination of the MTD, patients continue to receive their protocol-assigned dose levels of GDC-0084 until progression of their disease or an unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.

 Phase 2a study - Stage 2 Expansion stage (2) of the study will be a three-arm, randomized, open-label expansion study to further characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of GDC-0084 as well as to provide a preliminary assessment of single-agent activity of GDC-0084 in patients with GBM and to compare intermittent dosing MTDs vs.

 QD MTD in regard to safety and clinical activity.

 Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in the expansion cohort in 3 treatment arms (10 per am), according to the defined study eligibility criteria.

 Stage 2 of the study will be initiated with recruitment of new patients as soon as the MTD for intermittent dosing schedules has been determined (Stage 1, Step 3).

 Patients enrolled in Stage 2 may continue the study at the dose allocated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of GDC-0084 in Newly-diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme@highlight

This protocol has a 2-part design: The phase 2a study component is an open-label, multicenter, phase 2a dose-escalation and expansion study to assess the safety, tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical activity of GDC-0084 in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with unmethylated MGMT promoter status as adjuvant therapy following surgical resection and initial chemoradiation with temozolomide (TMZ).

 The phase 2a study is fully detailed in this submission.

 The phase 2b study component comprises an evaluation of clinical activity of GDC-0084 compared to TMZ in as adjuvant therapy following surgical resection and initial chemoradiation with TMZ and will be initiated following the determination of RP2D in the phase 2a study (Part 1).

 The phase 2b component will be will be further detailed in an amendment to this submission.
