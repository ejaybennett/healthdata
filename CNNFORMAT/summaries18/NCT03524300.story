(firstQuint)Clinical Efficacy Between Robotic and Laparoscopic Total Gastrectomy in Patients With Clinical Stage I Gastric Cancer.

 Robotic surgery has been developed with the aim of improving surgical quality and overcoming the limitations of conventional laparoscopy in the performance of complex mini-invasive procedures.

 The study is designed to explore the clinical outcomes of the robotic assisted total gastrectomy by comparing short- and long-term outcomes including financial cost of robotic and laparoscopic assisted total gastrectomy in the treatment of clinical Stage I gastric adenocarcinoma (cStage IA(T1N0M0)or cStage IB(T1N1M0,T2N0M0)).
