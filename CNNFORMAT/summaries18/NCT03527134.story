(secondQuint)Effects of Amantadine on Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction.

 Patients who are 60 years old or older for laparoscopic abdominal surgery will be randomly assigned into two groups: 1) no-treatment group, and 2) amantadine-treated group.

 Each group will have 150 patients.

 In addition, investigators will need 90 subjects in the control group.

 The data of these control subjects will be used to normalize the data of the two studied groups to diagnose POCD.

 The subjects in control groups will also be elderly but without the exposure to anesthesia and surgery.

Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a fairly well-documented clinical phenomenon.

 Investigators will determine whether amantadine can reduce the occurrence of POCD in elderly patients with major abdominal surgery.
