(fifthQuint)Improving Access to Child Anxiety Treatment.

 Anxiety disorders are a significant public health problem that cause suffering for youth and their families, derail normal childhood development, and when left untreated persist into adulthood with high societal costs.

 Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (CBT) including exposure therapy is the treatment of choice, yet multiple barriers limit access to care.

 Even for families with access to care, traditional provider-centered (office based) treatment presents challenges and can limit effectiveness for many youth and families.

 Home- and Community-based exposure therapy is efficacious for patients who previously did not improve with provider-centered services, and input from family stakeholders suggests that treatment in these settings is an optimal match for their needs.

 Patient-centered models involving home visits and provider teams have consistently demonstrated increased treatment accessibility and engagement.

 However, there has been no comprehensive comparison of exposure delivered by patient-centered teams using home visits versus by provider-centered office visits alone for childhood anxiety.

 The absence of comparative effectiveness research (CER) data impedes targeted use of patient centered versus traditional outpatient treatment and would better allocate limited resources, provide the best quality care, and help patients and families make educated decisions about their treatment choices.

 The overall goal of this proposal is to compare two models of service delivery, patient-centered delivery (utilizing novel deployment of personnel) vs.

 traditional provider-centered delivery, of CBT in youth ages 5-18 receiving exposure therapy for anxiety.

 A total of 333 children will be treated, with 189 children randomly assigned to each of the treatment conditions.

 A trained independent evaluator (IE) blind to condition will measure patient and family treatment engagement, anxiety symptoms/severity, and functional impairment at baseline, during active treatment at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24, and 3- and 6-month follow-up after acute treatment.

 The primary aims are to compare the relative effectiveness of patient-centered vs.

 provider-centered treatment for: 1) improving family treatment engagement/satisfaction, 2) reducing anxiety symptoms, and 3) reducing associated disability (quality of life and functional impairment).

 Secondary outcomes are to understand moderators of treatment response including: severity of illness, caregiver burden/family accommodation, and barriers to treatment access and to explore group differences in time course of response, durability of treatment gains, provider volume/capacity and efficiency in patient centered versus provider centered treatment.

 Improving Access to Child Anxiety Treatment@highlight

There is strong evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure is the preferred treatment for youth with anxiety disorders, but outpatient services that provide this type of treatment are limited.

 Even for those who do have access to anxiety-specific treatment, a traditional outpatient model of treatment delivery may not be suitable.

 Among the numerous logistical barriers to treatment access and response is the inability to generalize treatment tools to settings outside of the office.

 Patient-centered (home-based) treatment models that target symptoms in the context in which they occur could be more effective, efficient, and accessible for families.

 The present study aims to compare the efficacy, efficiency, and feasibility of patient centered, home-based CBT with a traditional office-based model of care.

 The question proposed, including proposed outcomes, have been generated and developed by a group of hospital, payer, patient and family stakeholders who will also contribute to the iterative process of protocol revision.

 The investigators anticipate 333 anxious youth to be randomized to receive outpatient treatment using home-based services or treatment as usual using a traditional outpatient model.

 Results of this study are expected to provide evidence for the efficacy and efficiency of patient-centered treatment, as well as increase treatment access and family engagement in the treatment process.
