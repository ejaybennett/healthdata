(fifthQuint)The Effect of ACT and Float REST on Burnout Syndrome.

.

 Burnout is a prolonged response to chronic emotional and interpersonal stressors on the job.

 Burnout syndrome is thus defined as a state of chronic stress that leads to physical and emotional exhaustion, cynicism and detachment, and feelings of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment.

 Human service providers often develop burnout, along with psychological distress, including anxiety and depression.

 Those experiencing burnout are likely to have a number of somatic complaints, such as shortness of breath, headaches, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleeplessness, aches, and lingering colds.

 However, American companies, universities, and the general public, unlike their European counterparts (particularly the Netherlands and Sweden) have been slow to recognize the rise, and by extension, the far-reaching effects, of this negative phenomenon.

 One potential way to address burnout is through mindfulness.

 Mindfulness has been used therapeutically to foster effective emotional and behavioral responding to distress.

 In a systematic review of mindfulness training, decreases in job burnout were evident for healthcare professionals and teachers.

 Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), is one such mindfulness-based psychotherapy.

 ACT has been efficaciously used for chronic pain, anxiety, depression, addiction, and general stress - all issues relevant to burnout syndrome.

 One finding from previous ACT studies on chronic pain and workplace stress alike is that the treatment effects are larger for psychosocial effects than they are for reductions in physical symptoms.

 Therefore, for a burnout intervention to be complete, it may be necessary to include a secondary treatment to supplement ACT.

 One approach that directly addresses physical symptoms is Flotation REST.

 Float REST (Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy), which typically provides sensory isolation and deep relaxation by laying supine in a light-proof, sound-proof, zero- gravity tank with 10-12 inches of water and 1,200 pounds of Epsom salt.

 Preliminary, noncontrolled studies on Float REST have shown promising results for fibromyalgia, muscle tension pain, stress, burnout syndrome, depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder.

 The primary investigator's long-term objective is to establish a safe, cost-effective treatment that addresses whether a combination of a mindfulness-based treatment and Float REST works better than either alone.

 Previous research has indicated a combination of psychotherapy and Float REST results in a significant decrease in degree of depression and anxiety stemming from burnout syndrome and increased positive outlook in life.

 In addition, the research has indicated a significant decrease in extent of painful areas and intensity.

 However, the authors did not indicate the specific form of therapy that was provided to participants, nor did they parse the effects in a controlled, comparative way, or look to see if one treatment bolstered the other.

 Thus, one could reasonably conclude an acceptance and values-based treatment would be the perfect complement to Float REST in order to address both physiological and psychological components.

 All participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions over the span of 12 weeks: ACT training, one hour of Float REST per week, and ACT training + one hour of Float REST per week.

 Participants will complete measures of psychological flexibility (AAQ-II), Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS), the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36; RAND Health), and the Stress Map Inventory before the first week, at week four, at week 8, after the last week.

 There will be an additional follow-up after one month.

 Approximately 45 adults working in the human services industry (behavioral therapists, physical therapists, nurses, doctors, etc.

) will be randomly assigned to the ACT, Float REST, or the ACT + Float REST condition (15 participants per group).

 The aim of this study is to examine whether participants in the ACT + Float REST condition will have larger decreases of the burnout phenomenon than those who receive either only ACT or Float REST.

 Given commercial float centers are becoming more popular and affordable, and that this study would be a pilot study for future research, this additive treatment could improve the quality of life by reducing suffering and increasing psychological flexibility for many individuals.

 The Effect of ACT and Float REST on Burnout Syndrome.

@highlight

In 1982, Steven Hayes, a clinical psychologist, developed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a unique empirically based psychological intervention that uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies, together with commitment and behavior change strategies, to increase psychological flexibility.

 In 1954, John Lilly, a cognitive neuroscientist, developed the sensory deprivation tank (known today as Floatation Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy - Float REST), to access a wide range of healing, higher brain functions, and meditation through an unparalleled deep relaxation state.

 In this study, the investigators aim to examine whether participants in the ACT + Float REST condition will have larger decreases of the burnout phenomenon than those who receive either only ACT or Float REST.
