(fifthQuint)Study of 6b11-OCIK Injection Treatment in Patients With Drug-resistant and Recurrence Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.

 Epithelial Ovarian Cancer remains the most lethal of all gynecologic malignancies.

 Immunotherapy is considered to be one of the most promising approaches in cancer therapy.

 This is a phase I clinical trial of cytotoxic T cell injection induced by dendritic cells loaded with 6B11 anti-idiotype minibody (6b11-OCIK injection) for drug -resistant and recurrence epithelial ovarian cancer.

 The investigators plan to recruit for 10 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.

 The result of this study was statistic and analyzed with the record of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors(RECIST1.

1) evaluation standard.

 In this experiment, the initial dose of 1-2 x 10^9 cell infusion was designed for each patient.

 The primary endpoints of the Phase I study are: Dose limited toxicity (DLT) - it will be used to determine the maximum tolerance dose (MTD).

 Study of 6b11-OCIK Injection Treatment in Patients With Drug-resistant and Recurrence Epithelial Ovarian Cancer@highlight

This is a phase I clinical trial of cytotoxic T cell injection induced by dendritic cells loaded with 6B11 anti-idiotype minibody (6b11 - OCIK injection) for recurrent platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer.

 Main purpose of this research is to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of 6B11-OCIK injection in the treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.

 Moreover, secondary purpose is to evaluate the safety and tolerance of autologous 6B11-OCIK injection in the treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.

 Thirdly, exploratory purpose is to obtain an initial understanding of effect of autologous 6B11-OCIK injection on patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, and evaluate the effect of autologous 6B11-OCIK injection on the immune system of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.
