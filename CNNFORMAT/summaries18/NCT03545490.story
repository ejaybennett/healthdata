(fifthQuint)Early Enteral Nutritional Supplementation on Patients With Oral Cancer Undergoing Radio(Chemo)Therapy After Surgical.

 This clinical trial will be conducted in a single center, prospective, and randomized manner.

 In this protocol, standard radio(chemo)therapy duration is 6 weeks.

 Early enteral nutrition intervention (EEN) refers to starting enteral nutrition intervention 2 weeks before post-operative radio(chemo)therapy begins and stopping this intervention 2 weeks after post-operative radio(chemo)therapy completes.

 Standard enteral nutrition intervention (SEN) refers to starting of enteral nutrition intervention 3 weeks after post-operative radio(chemo)therapy begins and stopping this intervention 2 weeks after post-operative radio(chemo)therapy completes.

 Nutritional supplementation periods for EEN and SEN groups are 10 weeks and 5 weeks, respectively.

 Dietitians will design meal plans for both groups of subjects so that their normal diets will provide 25-30 kcal/d/kg body weight in additional to nutritional supplements.

 Early Enteral Nutritional Supplementation on Patients With Oral Cancer Undergoing Radio(Chemo)Therapy After Surgical@highlight

The target population in the present study is Chinese patients with oral cancer who plan to receive radio(chemo)therapy after surgical resection in outpatient clinic department.

 Investigators hypothesize that enteral nutrition intervention, which is initiated 2 weeks before the start of post-operative radio(chemo)therapy treatment and ongoing 2 weeks after the completion of irradiation treatment, will improve patients' nutritional status, tolerability to radio(chemo)therapy, quality of life, and other clinical outcomes compared to commencement of enteral nutrition during the course of irradiation treatment.
