(secondQuint)Management of Occlusal Dentinal Caries in Deciduous Molars.

 Dental caries is a complex multifactorial disease and is one of the most prevalent diseases throughout history.

 It can cost a lot of money to treat and causes infection, pain and the loss of teeth.

 Choices for managing a carious lesion cover a spectrum of options-from complete surgical excision, where no part of the visible carious tissue is left in the tooth before a restoration is placed, to the opposite extreme, where none of the carious tissue is removed and noninvasive methods are used to prevent progression of the lesion.

 This study compares efficacy of no caries removal and sealing the entire lesion verses partial selective caries removal to soft and to firm dentin in healing and / or preventing progression of moderate to deep occlusal dentinal caries in previously unrestored teeth by clinical and radiographic analysis in 4-7 year old children.
