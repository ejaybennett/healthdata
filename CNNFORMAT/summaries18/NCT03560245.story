(fifthQuint)A Study of Bryostatin in Moderately Severe to Severe Alzheimer's Disease Subjects Not On Memantine.

 Eligible subjects will be stratified based on Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE-2) scores 4-9 vs.

 10-15 and will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment arms: 20 mu g bryostatin or placebo for twelve weeks.

 The first two doses of study drug will be a loading dose 20% higher (i.

e.

, 24 mu g) than the assigned dose and will be administered one week apart.

 Thereafter, the assigned dose of 20 mu g will commence with the third dose and be administered every other week.

 Drug is administered IV by continuous infusion over 45(5) minutes.

 A Study of Bryostatin in Moderately Severe to Severe Alzheimer's Disease Subjects Not On Memantine@highlight

This is a randomized double-blind Placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study comparing bryostatin to placebo for the treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease in subjects not receiving memantine treatment.

 The study is 15 weeks in duration, including a safety and efficacy evaluation 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

 Subjects will receive 7 doses of study drug during the study.

 The primary efficacy endpoint is change in the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) scale score after 12 weeks of treatment from baseline (taking the change in the average of SIB measures observed during the Week 13 to Week 15 time window from SIB at baseline.
