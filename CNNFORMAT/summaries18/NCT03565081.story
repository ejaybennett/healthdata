(thirdQuint)Effects of Progressive Elastic Band Resistance Training.

 Six participants were enrolled in this pilot study.

 Following 24 weeks of progressive elastic band resistance exercise training, significant reduction was observed in their body weight, BMI, and regional extremities fat mass and percentage.

 Regarding the functional performances, there were also significant improvements in their hand grip strength, 3 meter timed up and go, 30 seconds sit to stand, and 2-min step up tests, as early as the 8th week of training.

 Balance function achieved significant improvements after 16 weeks of training.

 Effects of Progressive Elastic Band Resistance Training@highlight

Abnormal body composition with increased body fat mass and decreased lean body mass has been found in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), contributing to reduced physical capacity and impairment.

 The aim of this study was to investigate whether progressive elastic band resistance training can improve physical motor performance and regional body composition in adults with PWS.
