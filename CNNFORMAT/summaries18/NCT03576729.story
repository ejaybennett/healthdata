(fifthQuint)MRS to Determine Neuroinflammation and Oxidative Stress in MPS I.

 Persons with MPS I have a wide range of clinical manifestations including central nervous system (CNS) impairment.

 The role of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress is one avenue of investigation which may clarify the broad neurological impairment in MPS I.

 Finding biomarkers that accurately describe the underlying and ongoing brain pathology is a key not only to understanding the disease, but also to understanding the possibility of new therapeutic approaches for MPS I patients.

 The investigator will compare patients with Hurler syndrome, and Hurler-Scheie or Scheie syndrome, with healthy controls.

 There will be 10 participants in each group, resulting in a total of 30 participants.

 Within the Hurler-Scheie or Scheie syndrome group, the investigator will examine the association of clinical severity with the proposed measures.

 These findings might help determine whether hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which is the treatment for Hurler syndrome patients, results in decreased oxidative stress and neuroinflammation as compared to Hurler-Scheie or Scheie syndrome patients, who are treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT).

 Additionally, these findings might help determine whether therapies directed at reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in MPS I could enhance neurological outcomes.

 Study hypothesis: neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are present in MPS I subjects and are reflective of disease severity.

 MRS to Determine Neuroinflammation and Oxidative Stress in MPS I@highlight

Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress have been shown to be present in persons with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), but their effect on disease severity and disease progression is unknown.

 The investigator intends to employ brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a non-invasive technique, along with analysis of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers in the blood, to measure and determine the level of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and their impact on clinical variability in MPS I patients.
