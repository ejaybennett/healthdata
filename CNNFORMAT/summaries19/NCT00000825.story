(fifthQuint)The Effects of Giving Interleukin-2 (IL-2) Plus Anti-HIV Therapy to HIV-Positive Patients With CD4 Cell Counts of at Least 350 Cells/mm3.

 IL-2, administered subcutaneously in combination with antiretrovirals, has resulted in increased CD4+ cell counts which may retard HIV disease progression.

 Using a smaller patient sampling, this Phase II study helps develop the clinical experience needed to consider formation of a larger, more complete Phase III trial.

 Seventy-two HIV-infected patients (previously treated or naive) are randomized independently to receive either control therapy with antiretrovirals alone OR escalating doses of subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus antiretrovirals.

 In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in at least 9 of 12 patients in Group 1, 12 additional patients are entered into Group 2 and treated as indicated.

 In the absence of DLT in 9 of 12 patients in Group 2, the final 12 patients are entered into Group 3.

 Those patients enrolled in either of the first 2 dose groups who complete 3 courses of therapy have their dose escalated to a maximum dose.

 A course of treatment is defined as 5 days of IL-2 plus antiretrovirals followed by 7 weeks of antiretroviral therapy alone.

 The Effects of Giving Interleukin-2 (IL-2) Plus Anti-HIV Therapy to HIV-Positive Patients With CD4 Cell Counts of at Least 350 Cells/mm3@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of giving IL-2 plus anti-HIV (antiretroviral) therapy to HIV-positive patients with CD4 cell counts (cells of the immune system that fight infection) of at least 350 cells/mm3.

 This study will also examine the ability of antiretroviral therapy combined with IL-2 to boost the immune system.

 IL-2, given through injection under the skin, in combination with anti-HIV therapy can increase CD4 cell counts.

 This study examines 3 doses of IL-2 in order to determine the safest and most effective dose to use.
