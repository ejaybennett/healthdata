(fifthQuint)A Study of Letrazuril in the Treatment of AIDS-Related Diarrhea.

 Letrazuril, the p-fluor analog of diclazuril, has been shown in an animal model to prevent infections by organisms closely related to the intracellular parasite Cryptosporidium.

 Reliable data are needed to show the effectiveness of letrazuril in treating AIDS-related cryptosporidial diarrhea.

 Four groups of eight patients receive escalating doses of oral letrazuril (or placebo).

 In each group, six patients are randomized to receive letrazuril and two patients receive matching placebo.

 In the pharmacokinetics determination phase of the study, patients receive a single dose of letrazuril or placebo following a meal.

 Following a 72-hour blood collection, patients enter the blinded, treatment phase of the study and receive letrazuril or placebo as a single dose daily, after a meal, for 3 weeks.

 Patients with persistent Cryptosporidium oocysts in their stools at the end of the blinded treatment phase may continue with open-label treatment of letrazuril at the same dose for 4 weeks; the dose may subsequently be escalated every 4 weeks, to a maximum, if oocysts persist.

 Patients who have Cryptosporidium oocysts eradicated from their stools will discontinue treatment and be followed for 3 months.

 All patients undergo clinical follow-up at 3 and 6 months.

To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of single doses of letrazuril in patients with AIDS-related cryptosporidial diarrhea; to determine the dose proportionality of single escalating doses of letrazuril; to determine steady-state concentrations of letrazuril; to evaluate the safety and efficacy of escalating doses of letrazuril, compared with placebo, for patients with AIDS-related cryptosporidial diarrhea.

 Letrazuril, the p-fluor analog of diclazuril, has been shown in an animal model to prevent infections by organisms closely related to the intracellular parasite Cryptosporidium.

 Reliable data are needed to show the effectiveness of letrazuril in treating AIDS-related cryptosporidial diarrhea.
