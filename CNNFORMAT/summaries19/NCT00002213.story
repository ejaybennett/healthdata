 This is a multicenter, open-label study.

 A total of 80 patients are treated on this study and include: At least 30 patients with a viral burden of 500 - 40,000 copies/ml.

 At least 30 patients with a viral burden greater than 40,000 copies/ml.

 At least 20 patients with less than 1 year total prior treatment with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).

 All patients receive self-administered, combination antiretroviral therapy for 48 weeks, as follows: 1592U89 plus 141W94 plus DMP 266.

The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give 1592U89 plus 141W94 plus DMP 266 to patients with HIV who have developed resistance to indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, or nelfinavir after at least 20 weeks of protease inhibitor treatment.

 This study also examines how long this combination therapy is effective before patients develop resistance to it.
