(secondQuint)Dactinomycin in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of dactinomycin in patients with persistent or recurrent low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.

 - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive dactinomycin IV over 15 minutes on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients who achieve normal beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) receive 2 additional courses after attaining normal beta-HCG.

 Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 2 months and then monthly for 10 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-42 months.
