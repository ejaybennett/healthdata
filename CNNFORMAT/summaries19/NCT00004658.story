(secondQuint)Phase II Study of Ribose, Uridine, and Thymidine for a Complex Syndrome Involving Excessive 5'-Nucleotidase Activity.

 PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Newly identified patients receive ribose daily for 8 weeks.

 Patients who improve continue therapy.

 If improvement then reaches a plateau, uridine (UR) and thymidine (TDR) are added to the regimen.

 Patients who receive no benefit after 8 weeks of ribose are treated with UR/TDR.

 Patients who improve after 8 weeks of this combination continue therapy.

 Ribose is added to the treatment regimen for patients on UR/TDR at entry.

 At maximal improvement, TDR and UR are sequentially tapered.

 Phase II Study of Ribose, Uridine, and Thymidine for a Complex Syndrome Involving Excessive 5'-Nucleotidase Activity@highlight

OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the efficacy of oral ribose in patients with a complex 5'-nucleotidase syndrome who have not received uridine (UR) and thymidine (TDR).

 II.

 Evaluate the efficacy of UR/oral ribose and UR/TDR.

 III.

 Evaluate the efficacy of oral ribose given in combination with UR/TDR.
