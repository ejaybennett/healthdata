(firstQuint)Phase I Study of Liposome-Mediated Gene Transfer in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis.

 PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene complexed with lipid is administered intranasally to the right inferior turbinate.

 Lipid without CFTR is administered to the left nostril as a control.

 Cohorts of 3 patients are given successively lower doses of CFTR, each dose complexed with 500 micrograms of lipid.

 Patients are followed at days 2-12, 15, and 21, then every 3-4 days for 3 weeks, every 2-3 weeks for 10 weeks, and every 3 months thereafter.
