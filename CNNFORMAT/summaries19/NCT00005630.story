(thirdQuint)Vaccine Therapy and Sargramostim in Treating Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether a specific T-cell response can be induced in patients with stage IB-IV non-small cell lung cancer treated with mutant K-ras peptide vaccine (limited to the specific K-ras peptide mutation in their tumors) and sargramostim (GM-CSF).

 - Determine whether skin test reactivity or HLA type correlates with the induction of anti-K-ras immune responses in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) intradermally (ID) on days 1-10 beginning a maximum of 6 months after complete surgical resection.

 Patients receive mutant K-ras peptide vaccine (limited to the specific K-ras mutation in their tumors) ID on day 7.

 Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed at 4 and 12 weeks.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.

 Vaccine Therapy and Sargramostim in Treating Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

 Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy and sargramostim in treating patients who have non-small cell lung cancer.
