(thirdQuint)Radiation Therapy Plus Hyperbaric Oxygen in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the feasibility and toxicity of hyperbaric oxygen combined with conformal radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

 II.

 Determine the efficacy of this regimen in terms of radiographic tumor response, time to tumor progression, and survival in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Within 2 weeks after surgery, patients receive hyperbaric oxygen over 90 minutes once daily, followed by conformal radiotherapy twice daily 5 days a week for 17 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed within 2 weeks and then every 2 months thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-10 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.

 Radiation Therapy Plus Hyperbaric Oxygen in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme@highlight

RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.

 Hyperbaric oxygen may increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy.

 Combining hyperbaric oxygen with radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme.

 PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining radiation therapy with hyperbaric oxygen in treating patients who have newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.
