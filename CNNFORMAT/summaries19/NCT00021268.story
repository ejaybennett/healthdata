(secondQuint)Tocladesine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of tocladesine in patients with recurrent or progressive metastatic colorectal cancer.

 - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 - Assess any therapeutic activity in patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

 Patients receive tocladesine IV continuously on days 1-5 and 8-12.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tocladesine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 Once the MTD is determined, up to 14 additional patients are treated at this dose level.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-38 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of tocladesine in treating patients who have recurrent or progressive metastatic colorectal cancer.
