(thirdQuint)Gabapentin in Treating Peripheral Neuropathy in Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether gabapentin improves the pain and other symptoms in cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

 - Determine the effect of this drug on symptom distress, mood states, functional abilities, and overall quality of life in these patients.

 - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to neurotoxic chemotherapy (active vs nonactive and discontinued vs completed) and neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (vinca alkaloids vs taxanes vs platinum-based compounds vs combination of two or more of the above agents).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive titrating doses of oral gabapentin twice daily and then three times daily for 3 weeks.

 Patients then receive a fixed dose of oral gabapentin three times daily for 3 weeks.

 Patients cross-over to therapy as in arm II at week 8.

 - Arm II: Patients receive titrating doses of oral placebo and then a fixed dose of oral placebo as in arm I.

 Patients cross-over to therapy as in arm I at week 8.

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at the end of weeks 6, 8, and 14.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.
