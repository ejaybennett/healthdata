(secondQuint)BMS-247550 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the clinical activity of BMS-247550, as measured by the tumor response rate, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan.

 - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the response duration, time to progression, and survival in patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on days 1-5.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive up to 4 additional courses of treatment beyond CR.

 Patients are followed every 3 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
