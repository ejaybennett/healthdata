(thirdQuint)Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the 18-month survival rate in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with carboplatin, gemcitabine, and exisulind.

 - Determine the feasibility and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

 - Determine the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall median survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

 Chemotherapy repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses.

 Patients also receive oral exisulind twice daily beginning on day 1 of course 1 and continuing until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 2 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.

 Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carboplatin, gemcitabine, and exisulind in treating patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
