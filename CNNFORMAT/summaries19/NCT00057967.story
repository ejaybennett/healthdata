(thirdQuint)Alemtuzumab in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Advanced Mycosis Fungoides or Szary Syndrome.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with relapsed or recurrent advanced mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome treated with alemtuzumab.

 - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive alemtuzumab IV over 2 hours three times per week.

 Treatment continues for up to 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 3 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

 Alemtuzumab in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Advanced Mycosis Fungoides or Szary Syndrome@highlight

RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as alemtuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well alemtuzumab works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory advanced mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome.
