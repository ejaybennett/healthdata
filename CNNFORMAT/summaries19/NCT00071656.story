(thirdQuint)Psychosocial Treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Type I.

 ADHD-I is a highly prevalent and serious childhood disorder that affects academic and social development.

 The symptoms of ADHD-I differ from those of the well-studied ADHD Combined Type.

 Unfortunately, studies of psychosocial interventions for ADHD-I are currently unavailable.

 Effective treatments for ADHD-I are still needed.

 Participants are randomly assigned to receive either a behavioral intervention or treatment as usual for 10 to 12 weeks.

 The behavioral intervention includes parent and child skill development groups, family meetings, and consultation with the child's teacher to address attention problems and areas of impairment at home and school.

 Parent and child interviews, teacher and child ratings, and psychoeducational testing are used to assess participants.

 Participants are assessed post-treatment and at a 2-month follow-up visit.
