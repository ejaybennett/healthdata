(firstQuint)Study of AP23573 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Hematologic Malignancies (8669-024)(COMPLETED).

 The primary objective of the trial is to assess the efficacy of AP23573 in patients with specified relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies by evaluating the response rates as defined for the individual malignancy categories.

 Secondary objectives include evaluating time to disease progression, progression-free survival and duration of response; evaluating the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of AP23573; describing health-related quality of life measurements; and exploring the safety and tolerability of AP23573 at the specified dose level.

 Protocol Outline: Open label, non-randomized parallel cohorts of five disease-specific cohorts with a minimum of 21 patients per cohort.

 Each patient receives a fixed dose of AP23573 administered intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes daily for five days (QDx5) to be repeated every 2 weeks.
