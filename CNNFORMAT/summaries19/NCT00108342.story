(thirdQuint)Nicotine Delivery Systems: Research & Treatment.

 The study was designed to compare sampling of several nicotine replacement treatments (NRTs) in contrast to a computer learning control.

 The NRTs include: 2 dosages of nicotine gum, 2 dosages of nicotine lozenges and 2 dosages of oral nicotine inhalers.

 In the sampling group, each participant tries each of the 6 NRTs for 3 minutes.

 In the control, the individuals read about the treatments.

 Dependent measures include: quit attempts, use of NRTs, preferences among NRTs, and learning and motivation.

 Nicotine Delivery Systems: Research & Treatment@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether sampling nicotine replacement treatments (NRTs) is superior to learning about them by computer.

 Testing also covers preferences among the treatments.

 Subjects will be enrolled veterans who smoke.

 Hypothesis: Direct experience ("sampling") of NRTs will increase knowledge about NRTs, motivation/confidence, use of NRTs and quit attempts in contrast to learning about NRTs by computer.
