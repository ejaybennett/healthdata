(fifthQuint)Integrating Clinical Practice Guidelines for Smoking Cessation Into Mental Health Care for Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

 Intervention: The research will test the effectiveness of integrating evidence-based, efficacious treatments for tobacco use disorder into mental health care for patients with chronic PTSD.

 Two different methods for delivering smoking cessation treatment will be compared in a randomized, controlled clinical effectiveness trial conducted at four Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers.

 Smokers undergoing mental health care for PTSD who want to quit smoking will be randomly assigned to either (1) guideline-concordant smoking cessation treatment integrated within ongoing mental health care for PTSD, and delivered by mental health providers (Integrated Care (IC), experimental condition), or (2) specialized smoking cessation treatment, delivered separately from PTSD treatment by a smoking cessation clinic (Usual Standard of Care (USC), comparison condition).

 Primary Hypothesis: IC will be more effective than USC on measures of smoking-related clinical outcomes.

 Secondary Hypothesis: The following treatment process variables will predict smoking abstinence at 12-months post randomization: (a) number of smoking cessation treatment sessions received, (b) type and duration of protocol medications prescribed by providers (bupropion, transdermal nicotine patch, and nicotine gum), (c) degree of subjects' compliance with prescribed protocol medication, and (d) number of quit attempts marked by abstinence of 7 days or more.

 Treatment process variables that predict smoking abstinence will be present to a significantly greater degree in IC than USC.

 Primary Outcomes: The primary outcome measure will be the point-prevalence of smoking abstinence by self-report for the 7 days prior to assessments, obtained at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 following randomization to study conditions.

 Verification of smoking abstinence will be obtained by CO readings (abstinence < 10 ppm) obtained at each assessment interval.

 Salivary cotinine levels (abstinence < 20 ng/ml) will be measured to verify abstinence at months 9 and 12 only, as subjects may still be using nicotine replacement medicines at earlier assessment intervals, confounding cotinine assays.

 Study Abstract: Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are far more likely to smoke than those without mental illness and they smoke more heavily.

 Tobacco use likely contributes to the heightened overall mortality and specific risks for smoking related diseases among veterans with PTSD and commonly co-occurring mental disorders.

 Symptoms of PTSD and associated mental disorders are linked to the maintenance of tobacco dependence, premature dropout from smoking cessation treatment, and relapse to smoking following quit attempts.

 Many efficacious tobacco use treatments exist, but a number of barriers limit the effectiveness of current methods for delivering these treatments in VA health care settings, particularly for the mentally ill.

 Novel approaches to smoking cessation for individuals with PTSD are needed to circumvent these barriers by integrating evidence-based tobacco use treatment into ongoing mental health care.

 The research proposed here will test the effectiveness of integrating evidence-based treatment for nicotine dependence into mental health care for patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

 Two different methods for delivering smoking cessation treatment will be compared in a prospective, randomized controlled clinical effectiveness trial conducted at four Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers.

 Smokers undergoing mental health care for PTSD (n=440) will be randomly assigned to either: (1) practice guideline-concordant smoking cessation treatment that is integrated within ongoing mental health care for PTSD and delivered by mental health providers (Integrated Care [IC]) or 2) smoking cessation treatment delivered separately from PTSD treatment by smoking cessation specialists (Usual Standard of Care [USC]).

 Specific aims of the proposed investigation are (1) to demonstrate that IC is more effective than USC in reducing smoking in psychiatric patients with PTSD and (2) to demonstrate that a number of treatment process variables, including the amount or dose of intervention and patient-specific factors, predict abstinence from tobacco use in smokers with PTSD.

 Intent-to-treat analyses and analyses for treatment completers will be conducted, using a Generalized Estimating Equations approach.

 If the study hypothesis is confirmed, system-wide implementation of the experimental intervention (IC) for veterans with PTSD would double the number of patients who stop smoking compared to the usual standard of care for tobacco use disorder.

 Study findings may have implications for integrating smoking cessation treatment into mental health care for patients with disorders other than PTSD.

 Integrating Clinical Practice Guidelines for Smoking Cessation Into Mental Health Care for Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder@highlight

The primary study objective is to conduct a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial that compares the effectiveness of two approaches for delivering smoking cessation treatment for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

 An approach where smoking cessation treatment is integrated into mental health care for PTSD and delivered by mental health providers (experimental condition) will be compared to specialized smoking cessation clinic referral (VA's usual standard of care).

 Secondary study objectives are to (a) compare the cost outcomes and cost-effectiveness of IC versus USC, (b) identify treatment process variables that explain (mediate) observed differences in smoking abstinence rates for the two study conditions, and (c) determine whether cessation from smoking is associated with worsening of symptoms of PTSD and/or depression.
