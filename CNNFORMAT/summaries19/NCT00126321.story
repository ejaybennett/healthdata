(firstQuint)Cladribine, Cytarabine and Idarubicin in Patients With Relapsed Acute Myelocytic Leukemia (AML).

 Considerable progress has been made in the induction therapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, current therapeutic results are still unsatisfactory in those with relapsed disease.

 The purine nucleoside analogue cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2-CdA) has been shown to be a safe and active agent in acute myeloid leukemia.

 Synergistic interaction between cladribine and cytarabine has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies.

 The current multicenter phase II study was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of cladribine, high-dose cytarabine, and idarubicin in the treatment of patients with relapsed AML.

 Adult patients of all age groups can be enrolled in the trial, but elderly patients will be treated with a less dose-intensive regimen.
