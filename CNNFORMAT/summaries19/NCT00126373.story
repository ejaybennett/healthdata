(firstQuint)A Trial of Wellbutrin for Crohn's Disease.

 Wellbutrin (bupropion) is approved for use as an antidepressant.

 There have been some cases in which people on Wellbutrin had significant improvement clinically in their Crohn's disease.

 In this trial, the hypothesis that Wellbutrin can induce clinical remission in Crohn's disease will be tested.

 The investigators will also be looking to see if Wellbutrin can lower levels of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF).
