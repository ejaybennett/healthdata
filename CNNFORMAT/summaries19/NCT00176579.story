(thirdQuint)Bone Mineral Density and Cancer Recurrence in Patients With Early Stage Prostate Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with clinically significant early stage prostate cancer.

 - Determine whether patients who have a higher level of BMD and have had a radical prostatectomy for cure are less likely to have an early relapse (i.

e.

, less than 3 years) than those patients with a low level of BMD.

 OUTLINE: This is a case-controlled study followed by a prospective, longitudinal, cohort study.

 Patients undergo bone mineral density (BMD) measurements by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry with a densitometer.

 Posteroanterior measurements of the total hip are also recorded.

 Patients also undergo blood collection to examine markers that provide evidence of systemic disease.

 Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Bone Mineral Density and Cancer Recurrence in Patients With Early Stage Prostate Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Measuring bone mineral density may help doctors predict whether prostate cancer will come back.

 It may also help the study of prostate cancer in the future.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying whether bone mineral density affects cancer recurrence in patients with early stage prostate cancer.
