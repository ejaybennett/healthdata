(secondQuint)Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing and Defibrillation in Heart Failure.

 Evaluation of new therapies for the treatment of heart failure should address mortality, morbidity, hospitalization, and cardiac symptoms and function when compared to standard pharmacologic therapy.

 The COMPANION trial is designed to address all of these objectives.

 This clinical investigation is an open-label, prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical trial.

 Every patient enrolled in the study is to be prescribed to optimal pharmacologic heart failure therapy, as tolerated, regardless of randomization.

 Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing and Defibrillation in Heart Failure@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether combined mortality and hospitalization in heart failure patients receiving optimal pharmacologic therapy can be reduced by combining optimal pharmacologic therapy and 1) biventricular pacing therapy alone or 2) biventricular pacing with defibrillation.
