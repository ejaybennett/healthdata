(thirdQuint)Comparison of Two Methods of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) to Support Successful Extubation of Infants of Birth Weights  1500 Grams (C2CPAP).

 Background: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) has been used successfully to promote extubation in the premature infant population (Davis & Henderson-Smart, 2002).

 The two methods of CPAP to be examined are used by many institutions, yet no study has compared these methods to determine which is better in the population of newborns 65 mmHg or a sustained increase in FiO2 of 0.

 Participants: Parents/guardians of eligible infants will be approached and given information regarding the study, and any questions answered.

 They will then be allowed to consider study participation in private.

 The recruiter will return at an agreed time and informed consent will be obtained from those agreeing to participate.

 Parents will be approached in accordance with the guidelines of the NICU @ SWCHSC.

 Infants are eligible if birth weight < 1500 grams, are to be extubated to CPAP and have no known airway anomalies, or suspected genetic anomalies.

 Analysis: Multiple ANOVA analysis will be used for continuous variables, chi-square for categorical variables, including primary outcome.

 Conclusion: The results of this study will determine which method of CPAP is the best method of supporting extubation in the < 1500 g infant.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been used successfully to promote extubation in the premature infant population.

 The two methods of CPAP to be examined are currently used by many institutions, yet no study has compared these methods to determine which is better in the population of newborns 65 mmHg or a sustained increase in FiO2 of 0.
