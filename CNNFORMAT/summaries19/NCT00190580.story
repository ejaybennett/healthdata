(secondQuint)Kanagawa Valsartan Trial (KVT): Effects of Valsartan on Renal and Cardiovascular Disease.

 It is widely recognized that suppression of the renin-angiotensin system ameliorates progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and that CKD is an important risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease.

 However, it has not been fully clarified if amelioration of CKD leads to the lower incidence of cardiovascular disease.

 The purpose of this study is to determine whether the angiotensin II receptor antagonist valsartan, in combination with conventional antihypertensive therapy, will ameliorate progression of both CKD and cardiovascular disease.

 The primary outcome is courses of renal and cardiac function.

 The secondary outcome is a composite of a doubling of serum creatinine concentration, end-stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes.

The purpose of this study is to prove the hypothesis that the progression of renal and cardiovascular disease is more efficiently prevented when the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan is added to conventional antihypertensive therapy.
