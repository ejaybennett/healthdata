(fifthQuint)PET Imaging to Determine the Role of PET in the Assessment of Regional Disease in Breast Cancer (PET PREDICT Trial).

 Patients will have histologic confirmation of invasive breast cancer and will have a FDG-PET scan prior to axillary node assessment.

 All patients will have a sentinel node biopsy if any sentinel nodes can be located.

 Patients with a positive sentinel node will have an axillary node dissection.

 The results of the PET will be compared to the reference standard of histologic examination of all excised (sentinel and non-sentinel) axillary lymph nodes which will be referred to as axillary node assessment.

 Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for PET-FDG will be determined.

The overall goal of this study is to determine how FDG-PET can be incorporated into the assessment of the axilla in the staging and treatment of women with early stage breast cancer.

 A multicentre, prospective, diagnostic accuracy study will be conducted evaluating the ability of positronic emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) to detect the presence or absence of axillary lymph node metastases in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with no clinical evidence of spread of disease beyond the breast.
