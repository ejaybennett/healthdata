(secondQuint)An Efficacy and Safety Study for Epoetin Alfa (PROCRIT) in Cancer Patients Not Receiving Chemotherapy or Radiation.

 The current approved dosage for epoetin alfa is 40,000 Units once per week with an escalation to 60,000 Units once per week if the response is inadequate after four weeks of treatment at 40,000 Units.

 This dosing scheme, while proven to be efficacious, is often inconvenient for both patients and medical personnel.

 This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center pilot study with the objective to investigate the efficacy of epoetin alfa (PROCRIT(R)) with regard to hematopoietic response when administered at 80,000 Units subcutaneously every three weeks in anemic patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

 Patients will receive two epoetin alfa injections (40,000 Units per injection) under the skin once every three weeks for a maximum of 13 weeks, totalling a maximum of four treatments.

 Doses may be reduced depending on the patients' hemoglobin level.
