(secondQuint)ULTRACET (Tramadol Hydrochloride and Acetaminophen) for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain.

.

 This is a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ULTRACET(R) (tramadol 37.

5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg) as add-on therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking an NSAID or a COX-2 inhibitor.

 The patients will be randomized into 2 treatment groups: The first group will receive one ULTRACET(R) tablet 3 times per day for 7 days.

 The second group will receive one placebo tablet 3 times per day for 7 days.

 The primary efficacy measurement will be the patients' average daily pain score.

 Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

 The study hypothesis is that ULTRACET(R) will be well tolerated and the average daily pain relief score for the ULTRACET(R) treatment group will be better than that of placebo group.

 Patients will take one ULTRACET(R) tablet or placebo by mouth 3 times per day, for 7 days.
