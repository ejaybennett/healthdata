(secondQuint)Epoetin Alfa in Treating Patients With Anemia Who Are Undergoing Chemotherapy for Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy, in terms of maintenance of target hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, of interval dosing with epoetin alfa in patients with anemia undergoing chemotherapy for nonmyeloid cancer.

 - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

 Secondary - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to participating center.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I (early intervention): Patients receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 5 courses.

 - Arm II (standard intervention): Patients receive epoetin alfa as in arm I once their hemoglobin level is 10.

5 g/dL.

 Quality of life is assessed prior to start of study treatment, at week 7 during study treatment, and after completion of study treatment.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients will be accrued for this study.
