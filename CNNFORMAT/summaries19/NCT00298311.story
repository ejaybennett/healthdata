(firstQuint)Effect of Home-Based Peer Support on Maternal-Infant Interaction and Postpartum Depression.

 This controlled study will help establish the link between support for maternal caregiving, maternal-infant interaction, infant neuroendocrinology and infant cognitive and social development.

 The primary hypothesis predicts that home-based peer support will improve maternal-infant interactions.

 Secondary hypotheses predict that home-based peer support will: improve infants' cognitive development; improve infants' social development; decrease average daily salivary cortisol levels in infants; reduce maternal depressive symptomatology; and improve maternal perceptions of social support.
