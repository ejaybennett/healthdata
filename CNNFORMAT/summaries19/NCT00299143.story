(firstQuint)Pilot Study on Shear-induced Platelet Aggregation in Acute Coronary Syndromes.

 Predictive factors of recurrence of ACS are not well determined.

 Platelet aggregation and leucocyte activation seem to be involved in the pathogenesis.

 The aim of our study is to compare SIPA, platelet activation and platelet-leucocytes aggregates on the onset of the ACS and 3 months later in 2 groups of patients scheduled for a first episode of ACS or recurrent ACS .

 Pilot Study on Shear-induced Platelet Aggregation in Acute Coronary Syndromes@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether shear-induced platelet aggregation is able to discriminate first acute coronary syndrome (ACS) from recurrent ACS
