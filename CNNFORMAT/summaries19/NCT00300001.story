(secondQuint)Home-Based Symptom Monitoring: Its Impact on Cancer Care Team Behaviors and Patient Outcomes.

 Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.

 One group will be offered an Internet assisted home-based symptom reporting system Cancer Symptom Monitor (CSM) for a twelve-month study period.

 Patient and care team evaluations will be measured using quantitative and qualitative methods (via focus groups).

 The second group will receive "standard care" without home-based symptom monitoring.

 Both groups will be evaluated at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, & 12 months, for symptom levels and overall quality of life during the twelve-month study period.

 Home-Based Symptom Monitoring: Its Impact on Cancer Care Team Behaviors and Patient Outcomes@highlight

The primary research objective of this protocol is to evaluate the impact of integrating a home-based symptom monitoring system in the day-to-day care of cancer patients in community settings on the frequency of supportive symptom interventions, symptom severity, and quality of life.
