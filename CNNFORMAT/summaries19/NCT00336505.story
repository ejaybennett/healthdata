(firstQuint)Study Comparing the Safety and Efficacy of Cethromycin to Clarithromycin for the Treatment of Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

 Lower respiratory tract infections remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide.

 Increasing rates of antibiotic resistance and newer, more pervasive pneumonia-causative pathogens contribute to this statistic.

 Currently available macrolide antibiotics for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia are slowly losing effectiveness, resulting in the need to develop newer drugs to fight resistant infections.

 In this study, we compare the safety and efficacy of a common macrolide, clarithromycin, to a new ketolide, cethromycin.
