(thirdQuint)Pilot Study of Effect of Kaletra on CD4 Response in HIV Positive (+) Patients With Viral Suppression KIMBO Study.

 This is an open-labeled, non-randomized exploratory trial in selected volunteers who meet the stated enrollment criteria.

 This study will assess the impact of Lopinavir/ritonavir on CD4 immune reconstitution.

 All volunteers must have been on antiretroviral therapy with sustained viral load suppression of 1,000 copies/mL.

 An assessment of memory and naive T cell response to antiretroviral regimen change will be performed in this study.

 Dose and dose selection Lopinavir/ritonavir is also approved for once a day dosing.

 The dose of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) for this study will be 400/100mg.

 BID or 800/200mg.

 qd.

 New tablet formulation no longer requires that lopinavir/ritonavir be taken with food.

 We will give the volunteer the option for once a day dosing or BID dosing of Kaletra.

 However, those switching from an NNRTI to Kaletra will initially be placed on BID dosing of Kaletra, and allowed to switch to once-a-day dosing of Kaletra after 4 weeks on study drug.

 Pilot Study of Effect of Kaletra on CD4 Response in HIV Positive (+) Patients With Viral Suppression KIMBO Study@highlight

To explore the hypothesis that the use of Lopinavir/ritonavir will be associated with improved CD4 immune reconstitution in volunteers who fail to demonstrate a significant CD4 cell increase (while on their first antiretroviral treatment regimen) despite sustained viral suppression by a non-Lopinavir/ritonavir-containing regimen
