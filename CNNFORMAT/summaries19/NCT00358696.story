(fifthQuint)Antiretroviral Switch From Didanosine to Tenofovir in HIV/HCV Co-infected Patients.

 Primary objective - to determine the impact of changing part of an effective HAART regimen to tenofovir on maintenance of virologic suppression in HCV co-infected patients.

 Secondary objective - to assess the safety and tolerability over 12 weeks in patients switched to tenofovir.

 Research Method - This will be a single arm observational study to include 30 subjects.

 Patients requiring HCV treatment will be assessed and patients receiving didanosine will be clinically evaluated to determine an appropriate NRTI drug switch.

 Patients who are to switch the didanosine component of their regimen to tenofovir will be eligible to participate in the study and will be followed for a period of observation of up to 4 weeks.

 All patients will be receiving tenofovir as one capsule, once daily.

 The primary endpoint will be maintenance of virologic suppression between the Baseline visit and week 12 in the overall study group.

 Measures of adherence to HAART, safety, tolerability and CD4 cell counts will also be obtained at each study visit, and will constitute secondary study endpoints.

 Antiretroviral Switch From Didanosine to Tenofovir in HIV/HCV Co-infected Patients@highlight

The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of changing didanosine in an effective anti-HIV regimen to tenofovir on virologic suppression.

 We hypothesize that, in patients with maximal virologic suppression on a double class regimen (including two NRTIs and an NNRTI or a PI, boosted with RTV or not), a single drug substitution of didanosine for tenofovir will represent a viable strategy without any negative impact on the virologic efficacy of the regimen.
