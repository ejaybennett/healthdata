(secondQuint)Neural Effects of Mindfulness Training on Attention.

 Mindfulness Meditation Training (MMT) has been used successfully to decrease stress, pain, and adverse health symptoms in a varied subject population.

 MMT has been described as "paying attention in a particular way.

" Although attention is a key component of meditation, little is known about the cognitive and neural changes within the human attention system that result from MMT.

 In this study, we examine the effects of MMT on the human attention system using neurobehavioral measures.

 Here MMT comprises participation in a Mindfulness-Based-Stress-Reduction (MBSR) course, while the comparison group participates in a nutrition education course, both 8 weeks long.

 We compare the performance and neural activity of these groups both before and after participation in the course.
