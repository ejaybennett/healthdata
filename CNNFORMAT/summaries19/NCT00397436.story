(fifthQuint)Pilot Study of Protein Profiling of the Human Epidermal Cells After Ultraviolet Irradiation.

 We will investigate the changes of the epidermal cell proteome after UV irradiation to the forearms of healthy young male volunteers.

 Knowledge of specific molecular markers may provide knowledge of basic biological systems and possibly targeted therapy of inflammation.

 By using combined proteomic methodologies we will be able to quantify protein changes at cytoplasmic and membrane protein levels of epidermal cells in normal vs.

 irradiated skins.

 This study may allow us to obtain fairly comprehensive profile of membrane integrated and cytoplasmic proteins of epidermal cell populations which will facilitate our understand of biological responses to UV irradiation.

 Pilot Study of Protein Profiling of the Human Epidermal Cells After Ultraviolet Irradiation@highlight

The main focus of this pilot study is to construct a fairly complete protein profile of the epidermis.

 This will allow us to study how the epidermis responds to external stressors such as ultra-violet.

 We hypothesize that by using the cutting edge technology, proteomics, we will be able to construct a fairly complete profile of different epidermal cells (keratinocytes, epidermal nerve fibers (ENFs), melanocytes, Langerhans cell,.

etc) of normal and ultraviolet (UV) irradiated skin.
