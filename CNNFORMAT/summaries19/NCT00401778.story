(thirdQuint)Trial of RAD001 in Patients With Operable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

 This is a Phase 1b pre-operative lung cancer trial wherein patients with operable lung cancer will be treated with RAD001 for 3-4 weeks to study the effects of the novel agent in relevant molecular pathways.

 The study will also assess the FDG uptake of the tumor at baseline and upon completion of therapy (before surgery) with a PET scan.

 The safety profile of RAD001 will also be evaluated.

 New agents and regimens are urgently needed for lung cancer treatment.

 With the development of novel agents and small molecules designed to curtail the aggressive aspects of this disease, some progress has been realized.

 However, much more effort and insight will be required for further real gains to be made.

 We propose that studying the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis, known to be abnormal in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and translating that knowledge into therapeutic adjustments can lead to meaningful advances in lung cancer treatment.

 Approximately 35 patients will participate at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.

 Trial of RAD001 in Patients With Operable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)@highlight

This is a Phase 1b pre-operative lung cancer trial wherein patients with operable lung cancer will be treated with RAD001 to evaluate the target effects of this compounds on relevant molecular pathways and on the 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake of the tumor by a positron emission tomography (PET) scan at baseline and immediately prior to surgery.

 The safety profile of RAD001 will also be evaluated.
