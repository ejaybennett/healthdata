(thirdQuint)Cancer Vaccine Study for Unresectable Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (START).

 Ancillary Trial: An exploratory investigation of immune response in peripheral blood after tecemotide (L-BLP25) or placebo vaccination.

 The ancillary study is a sub-study within START.

 This is an exploratory investigation of the immune response in peripheral blood after tecemotide (L-BLP25) or placebo vaccination.

 The main objective is to evaluate whether administration of single-shot, low-dose cyclophosphamide followed by tecemotide (L-BLP25) vaccinations induces specific immune response in peripheral blood to BLP25 (the mucinous glycoprotein 1 [MUC1] antigen) as well as a modulation of cellular and soluble components of the immune response in subjects with unresectable stage III NSCLC.

 Twenty-five of the European START sites will participate in the ancillary study.

 Sample size: up to 60 to 80 subjects All inclusion criteria specified in the START clinical trial protocol except for hemoglobin >= 100 gram/Liter (g/L) All exclusion criteria are the same as specified in the START clinical trial protocol Schedule of events: Blood samples will be taken at baseline, visit week 4, 8 13 and 25 (80 milliliter (mL) whole blood each).

 Cancer Vaccine Study for Unresectable Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (START)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether the cancer vaccine tecemotide (L-BLP25) in addition to best supportive care is effective in prolonging the lives of subjects with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer, compared to best supportive care alone.

 A local ancillary (sub) study in European centers will evaluate the immune response in peripheral blood after tecemotide (L-BLP25) or placebo vaccination.
