(thirdQuint)Banking of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Tumor Cells for Vaccine Generation.

 - It is important to understand that even if the participant consents to allow us to save their leukemia cells, we cannot guarantee that they will be able to receive a vaccine.

 First, we may not be able to make enough vaccine from the collected cells.

 Second, they may not be able to participate in a vaccine study in the future for reasons related to the status of your overall health.

 Third, an appropriate vaccine trial may not be available in the future.

 - In order to make the vaccine, leukemia cells will be collected by one or more of the following methods: drawing blood during one of two visits to the clinic; leukapheresis; bone marrow aspiration; or, surgery to remove a lymph node.

 - The physician will discuss with the participant which approach is best in their case to ensure the highest number of tumor cells collected.

The purpose of this research study is to collect, freeze and store leukemia cells from the blood or bone marrow of patients that have advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that is not in clinical remission.

 This study is a companion study to DF/HCC clinical trial 06-196 in which the participants' own CLL cells may form part of a vaccine treatment for their leukemia.
