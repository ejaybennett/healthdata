(thirdQuint)T-Cell Response in Patients Receiving Trastuzumab and/or Chemotherapy for HER2-Positive Solid Tumors.

 OBJECTIVES: - Assess T-cell activation in blood samples of patients receiving trastuzumab (Herceptin(R)) and/or chemotherapy for HER2-positive solid tumors.

 OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected from patients at baseline and on days 21, 42, and 84 of trastuzumab (Herceptin(R))/chemotherapy.

 Patients may be contacted 3-6 months after completion of trastuzumab/chemotherapy to donate another blood specimen.

 Blood samples are examined for T-cell proliferation and intracellular cytokine production.

 CD8 T-cell response, HER2/neu-specific antibody titers, and skin hypersensitivity test responses are also measured.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.

 T-Cell Response in Patients Receiving Trastuzumab and/or Chemotherapy for HER2-Positive Solid Tumors@highlight

RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

 It may also help the study of cancer in the future.

 PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at blood samples from patients receiving trastuzumab and/or chemotherapy for HER2-positive solid tumors to assess T-cell response.
