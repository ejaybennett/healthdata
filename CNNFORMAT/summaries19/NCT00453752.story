(firstQuint)Non-Invasive Diagnostic and Functional Evaluation of Cardiac Involvement in Patients With Systemic Sclerosis.

 Elevated serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels released from myocytes of ventricles upon stretch have been found in patients with isolated right ventricular (RV) pressure overload.

 However, limited data suggest that serum BNP may be elevated in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), especially with RV dysfunction.

 The aim of this study was to assess serum N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) in SSc patients and to establish whether it reflects the severity of RV overload.
