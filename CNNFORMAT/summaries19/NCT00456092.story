(thirdQuint)Phase II Study With CC-10004 in Psoriatic Arthritis.

 This study is to look at the preliminary efficacy and safety of CC-10004 vs placebo in patients with active psoriatic arthritis.

 Participants must have a minimum of 6 months history of psoriatic arthritis to qualify.

 Prior to the implementation of Amendment 1/UK3 the study was in 3 phases - pre-randomisation up to 35 days, up to 84 days treatment and a 28 day follow up.

 After the implementation of Amendment 1/UK3, the study is in 4 phases - pre-randomization up to 35 days, up to 84 days treatment in the placebo controlled treatment phase, up to 84 days treatment in the active treatment extension phase and a 28 day follow up.

 Treatment groups are 40 milligrams (mg) once daily (od), 20 mg twice daily (bd) or placebo.

 To ameliorate the dose dependent adverse events of CC-10004 (headache and gastro-intestinal (GI) disturbances) there will be dose titration of 10mg od (or placebo) for days 1 to 3 followed by 20 mg od (or placebo) days 4 to 7 in the first week of dosing.

 Patients changing from placebo to active treatment on entry to the extension phase will undergo dose titration of 10mg od for days 85 to 87 followed by 20mg od days 88 to 91.

 Assessments take place after week 1 and then every 2 weeks during the treatment phase.

 Plasma pharmacokinetics of CC-10004 will be evaluated in a subset of patients from each active treatment group during the placebo controlled treatment phase.

 Normal and psoriatic skin biopsies and/or synovial biopsies will be taken for evaluation of histopathology and biomarkers from subsets of patients in each treatment group.

 Phase II Study With CC-10004 in Psoriatic Arthritis@highlight

This study is to look at the preliminary efficacy and safety of CC-10004 vs placebo in patients with active psoriatic arthritis.

 The pharmacokinetics of the compound in patients will also be explored, and biopsies will be taken of the skin and the knee synovium to look at the activity of the drug in the relevant tissues.
