(secondQuint)The Effects of Vacuum-Compression Therapy on the Healing of Diabetic Foot Ulcers.

 Diabetic foot ulcers are common and serious complications of chronic diabetes mellitus.

 The prevalence of foot ulcers among patients with diabetes is 15%.

 The length of hospital stay is approximately 60% longer among patients with foot ulcers, as compared with those without ulcers.

 Diabetic foot ulcers accounts for >50% of all nontraumatic lower-leg amputations.

Although, current preventive methods and treatment modalities have been effective in healing foot ulcers, statistics show high incidence of foot ulcers and amputations in individuals with diabetes.

On the other hand, only a few studies were performed on the effects of Vasotrain in healing diabetic foot ulcers.

 The use of the machine enhances the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the area, which in turn, facilitate wound healing.

the objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of vacuum-compression effects of Vasotrain on the diabetic foot ulcers using stereological method based on Cavalieri's principle in diabetic patients.
