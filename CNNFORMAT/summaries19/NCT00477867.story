(thirdQuint)Economic Outcomes in Patients With Stage III Ovarian Cancer Receiving Paclitaxel and Cisplatin on Clinical Trial GOG-172.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of collecting data on medical resource utilization and costs incurred in the care of patients with stage III ovarian cancer treated with intravenous (IV) paclitaxel and cisplatin vs IV paclitaxel, intraperitoneal (IP) paclitaxel, and IP cisplatin on a randomized, controlled clinical trial.

 - Determine the feasibility of collecting data on resource utilization incurred outside GOG institutions through the use of patient diaries.

 - Assess the work load required to collect this data, in terms of mean number of hours required to complete medical resource utilization forms.

 OUTLINE: Data on medical resource units consumed (including length of hospital stay, length of time using operating room, units of drugs and blood products administered, number of diagnostic tests received, and number of physician visits needed) are collected on all patients.

 Quality of life is assessed prior to randomization on clinical trial GOG-172, prior to the fourth course of chemotherapy, after the sixth course of chemotherapy, and at 3 months and 6 months after the sixth course of chemotherapy.

 Patients complete diaries throughout treatment with chemotherapy and for 12 months after treatment.

 Data collected are used for analysis of economic impact, quality of life, neurotoxicity, and sociologic characteristics associated with these treatment regimens.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.

RATIONALE: Gathering information about patients with ovarian cancer over time may help doctors learn more about a patient's use of medical services and the cost of these services.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is collecting information about the patient's health and use of medical resources over time in patients with stage III ovarian cancer receiving paclitaxel and cisplatin on clinical trial GOG-172.
