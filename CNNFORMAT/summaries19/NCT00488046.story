(secondQuint)Single Group Study of the Safety of and Immune Response to a Bird Flu Virus Vaccine (H5N1) in Healthy Adults.

 According to the World Health Organization, the current pandemic risk associated with avian influenza H5N1 infection is serious, as an increasing number of humans are infected.

 Currently, H5N1 influenza transmission occurs in humans when they are exposed through direct contact to infected poultry or surfaces and objects contaminated by infected poultry feces.

 A pandemic occurs when a new influenza subtype emerges that infects humans, causes serious illness, and spreads easily among humans.

 The development of a safe and effective vaccine is necessary, should a pandemic occur.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live, attenuated A1 virus vaccine, H5N1 (6-2) AA ca Recombinant (A/Hong Kong/213/2003 x A/AnnArbor/6/60 ca).

 This study will last approximately 16 weeks.

 Participation in this study includes a hospital stay in an isolation unit at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.

 All participants will receive two doses of vaccine in nasal spray form, at study entry and sometime between 4 and 8 weeks after initial vaccination.

 Participants will be admitted to the isolation unit 2 days prior to each vaccination.

 A targeted physical exam will occur daily following each vaccination until discharge.

 Participants will not be discharged until nasal washes are negative.

 Vital signs measurement will be done at least twice daily for the duration of the inpatient stay.

 A follow-up outpatient visit will occur approximately 4 weeks following each vaccination.

 Blood and urine collection will occur at selected timepoints throughout the study.

 Single Group Study of the Safety of and Immune Response to a Bird Flu Virus Vaccine (H5N1) in Healthy Adults@highlight

Over the past decade, avian influenza (AI) has become a major health concern.

 The development of a safe and effective vaccine against H5N1 infection is important.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of a new AI vaccine in healthy adults.
