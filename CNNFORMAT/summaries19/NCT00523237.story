(thirdQuint)RAL-eve Study: Raltegravir Substitution Study.

 We enrolled virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected patients with injection site reactions for a switch from enfuvirtide to raltegravir.

 At baseline, enfuvirtide was switched to raltegravir without additional changes to the antiretroviral regimen allowed.

 Viral load, T-cells, and toxicity were evaluated at baseline, 2, 4, 12 and 24 weeks.

 Adherence and injection site reactions were evaluated at baseline, 4, 12 and 24 weeks.

 The single-copy assay was used to measure HIV RNA levels at screening, baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks.

The purpose of this study is to: - Provide raltegravir to subjects with HIV and an undetectable viral load who are experiencing injection site reactions (ISR) to Enfuvirtide, - Monitor the safety and efficacy of raltegravir, and - Assess the change in quality of life in patients who have switched from Enfuvirtide to raltegravir
