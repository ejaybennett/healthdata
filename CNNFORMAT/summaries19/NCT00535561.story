(firstQuint)Iron Deficiency Anemia Can be an Indication for Treatment of Subclinical Hypothyroidism.

 51 Patients presented to our university outpatient internal medicine clinic who are found to have iron deficiency anemia coexisting with subclinical hypothyroidism have been included in this study.

 Patients were randomly assigned to oral iron or oral iron plus levothyroxin therapy.

 The physician and the patients did not know who received oral iron only or oral iron plus levothyroxine treatment.

 Hematologic parameters as well as serum iron, ferritin and iron binding capacity were being measured at the beginning and 3 months after treatment in both groups.
