(firstQuint)Multidose Safety and Tolerability Study of Liposomal Amikacin for Inhalation (Arikace) In Cystic Fibrosis Patients.

 Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a gentic disease resulting from mutations in a 230 kb gene on chromosome 7 known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).

 Study subjects with CF manifest pathological changes in a variety or organs that express CFTR.

 The lungs are frequently affected, the sequelae being chronic infections and airway inflammation.

 The principal goal of both treatment of subjects with CF is to slow the chronic deterioration of lung function.

 Study subjects will be randomized to receive either study drug or placebo (1.

5% NaCl) by inhalation via a PARI eFlow nebulizer.

 Each subject will complete 28 days of daily dosing.

 All study patients will be followed for safety, pharmacokinetics, clinical and microbiologic activity for 56 days post completion of study treatment.

 The total study period will be up to 84 days, with screening visit occurring within the preceding 14 days prior to study day 1.

 Patients will be clinically evaluated during the first 48 hours post first study dose and weekly for the 28 day treatment period and during the follow up visits at study days 35, 42, 49, 56, 70 and 85 days to determine safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical and microbiologic activity.

 Clinical laboratory parameters, audiology testing, clinical adverse events and pulmonary function will be evaluated for all study subjects in order to determine the qualitative and quantitative safety and tolerability of Arikace cent compared to placebo.

 Serum, urine and sputum specimens will be collected at periodic intervals to assess PK.

 Additionally, sputum samples will be collected to determine changes in bacterial density.

 Pulmonary function testing and CFQ-R measurements will be assessed at selected time points throughout the study.

 An exploratory evaluation of a Cystic Fibrosis Symptom Diary (CFSD) will also be implemented.

 Multidose Safety and Tolerability Study of Liposomal Amikacin for Inhalation (Arikace) In Cystic Fibrosis Patients@highlight

This is a study to determine the safety and tolerability of 28 days of daily dosing of 560 mg of Arikace cent versus placebo in patients who have Cystic fibrosis.
