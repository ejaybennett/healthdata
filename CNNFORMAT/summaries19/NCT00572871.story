(fifthQuint)Hormonal and Bone Turnover Marker Response to an Acute Bout of Resistance or Plyometric Exercise.

 Bone tissue responds to impact and strain forces, like high-intensity exercise, by upregulating the bone remolding process, resulting in the deposition of calcium phosphate minerals into the collagen matrix of bone.

 Bone remodeling is a continually active process that involves both activation cells regulating bone formation (osteoblasts) and resorption (osteoclasts).

 Alterations in the balance between formation and resorption are critical for changes in bone density and mineral content to occur, which is regulated by several hormones including vitamin D and growth hormone, the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone, and parathyroid hormone.

 Importantly, it remains unclear how single bouts of physical activity contribute to the overall changes in remodeling and whether those acute alterations can be detected in the hours after exercise.

 Additionally, research studies examining the effects of exercise on bone remodeling often draw blood samples after 24 hours of physical inactivity, potentially diminishing the magnitude of the exercise response.

 Therefore, we plan to evaluate the acute effects of plyometrics and resistance exercise on changes in serum hormones and markers of bone turnover in non-sedentary, healthy males, with or without a moderate calorie supplement.

We are interested in determining if there exist a short-term response in the serum markers and hormones that participate in the regulation of bone tissue formation and breakdown to a single, high-intensity exercise session of weight lifting (resistance exercise) or jumping (plyometrics).

 We are also interested in determining if the bone marker response to exercise is altered by changing the negative energy state caused by the exercise treatment, when subjects are given a moderate calorie meal.
