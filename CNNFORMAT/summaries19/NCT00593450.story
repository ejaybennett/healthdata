(thirdQuint)Comparison of Age-related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials: Lucentis-Avastin Trial.

 Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe vision loss in people over the age of 65 in the United States and other Western countries.

 More than 1.

6 million people in the US currently have one or both eyes affected by the advanced stage of AMD.

 Lucentis(R) is the most effective treatment for neovascular AMD studied to date.

 Bevacizumab (Avastin(R)) and Lucentis(R) are derived from the same monoclonal antibody.

 Following the encouraging clinical trial results with Lucentis(R), several investigators began evaluating intravitreal Avastin(R) for the treatment of CNV.

 Given its molecular similarity to Lucentis, its low cost, and its availability, the interest in Avastin(R) has been considerable.

 Avastin(R) has not been evaluated relative to Lucentis(R).

 In addition, previous studies do not answer the question of whether a reduced dosing schedule is as effective as a fixed schedule of monthly injections.

 Treatment dependent on clinical response has the potential to reduce the treatment burden to patients as well as to reduce the overall cost of therapy.

 Only a single eye in each patient was analyzed.

 At the five year follow-up visit, the subjects will undergo the same examinations and procedures as in the original study; however, the five year follow-up visit deos not involve any study treatment.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of treatment of neovascular AMD with Lucentis on a fixed schedule, Avastin on a fixed schedule, Lucentis on a variable schedule, and Avastin on a variable schedule.

 A five year follow-up visit is being conducted in 2014 to gather information on long term outcomes.
