(thirdQuint)Neuropsychological Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Patients With Acquired Brain Injury.

 Acquired brain injury (ABI) commonly results in persistent cognitive, emotional and motivational problems.

 About 50% of patients involved develop psychiatric illness, most likely in the first year following ABI, which is associated with reduced psychosocial functioning and less favorable rehabilitation outcome.

 Treatment of these complex conditions requires a combination of neuropsychological and psychotherapeutic intervention techniques.

 This study aims at evaluating a combination of neuropsychological intervention methods, which include developing and using compensation strategies for cognitive impairments (attention, memory and executive functions), and psychotherapeutic intervention focusing on emotion regulation, developing positive self-concepts and adjustment of life-goals.

 These therapeutic interventions are modularized and patients are assigned to intervention modules according to results of objective neuropsychological testing and interviews.
