(firstQuint)Far Infrared Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease.

 Alzheimer's destroys brain cells, causing problems with memory, thinking and behaviour severe enough to affect work, lifelong hobbies or social life.

 Alzheimer's gets worse over time and it is fatal.

 Alzheimer's, which has no current cure, is the most common form of dementia.

 It is hereby postulated that far infrared radiation of the central nervous and endocrine systems will help with the management of the disease and possibly cure the disease.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and fatal brain disease.

 This study will investigate the use of far infrared radiation treatment for the disease.
