(fifthQuint)Clofarabine and Non-Myeloablative Allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation.

 Non-myeloablative conditioning allows curative allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation for patients unable to tolerate more toxic conventional conditioning regiments.

 These regiments continue to be refined and evolve.

 No standard regimen is yet agreed upon.

 The incorporation of the newly licenses agent Clofarabine into a non-myeloablative regimen is logical given its recognized anti-leukemic activity.

 This study will assess the safety and efficacy of Cyclophosphamide and Clofarabine in promoting hematopoietic engraftment after allogeneic transplant of blood stem cells.

 Patients eligibility will include those with advanced hematological neoplasms who might benefit from allogeneic blood cell transplant.

 Patients must have adequate organ function and suitable related or unrelated donors for transplant.

 In Phase I of the study 9-12 patients will be treated in order to establish Cyclophosphamide and Clofarabine dose, and to confirm reasonable safety and engraftment efficacy.

 Phase II will treat at total of 20 patients at the selected dose level of Clofarabine and Cyclophosphamide.

 Results will be compared to extensive Penn State Milton S.

 Hershey Medical Center experience using Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide in a similar patient population.

 Supportive care, including graft versus host disease prophylaxis will be similar to that recently used at Hershey Medical Center.

 Primary endpoints will include survival and engraftment as compared to historical results at Hershey Medical Center.

 Disease specific outcomes for frequent diagnoses such as acute leukemia and non-hodgkin's lymphoma will be assessed as secondary endpoints.

 Clofarabine and Non-Myeloablative Allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation@highlight

Allogeneic hematopoietic transplant is curative for many patients with hematological neoplasms but conditions to provide optimal engraftment and anti-tumor efficacy with minimal toxicity are still under way.

 Clofarabine is a newly licensed agent with dramatic anti-leukemic activity.

 Its incorporation into a regimen for pre-transplant conditioning of acute leukemia and lymphoma patients is logical, exploiting both the anti-tumor activities it is recognized to have and the immunosuppressive activity seen with drugs in its class.
