(fifthQuint)Yoga for the Management of HIV-Metabolic Syndromes.

 Very few safe, effective, and novel treatments for metabolic syndromes that develop in HIV-infected people exist.

 These metabolic syndromes may increase cardiovascular disease risk in HIV-infected people and may reduce their quantity and quality of life.

 Practicing a yoga lifestyle intervention may provide a safe, effective and novel therapy for HIV metabolic syndromes, but this alternative form of therapy has not been tested in HIV-infected people with metabolic syndromes.

 In men and women with HIV-related metabolic syndromes, we will determine: 1.

 The safety of practicing a yoga lifestyle in HIV-infected people treated with HAART who are experiencing metabolic and anthropometric syndromes.

 2.

 To quantify the effects of practicing a yoga lifestyle on metabolic and anthropomorphic syndromes in HIV-infected people treated with HAART who are experiencing these syndromes.

 3.

 To quantify the effects of practicing a yoga lifestyle on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in HIV-infected people treated with HAART who are at increased CVD risk because of existing metabolic and anthropomorphic syndromes.

 Yoga for the Management of HIV-Metabolic Syndromes@highlight

We are testing the safety and efficacy of a 16-wk yoga lifestyle intervention on oral glucose tolerance, fasting lipid/lipoprotein levels, body composition, cardiovascular function, quality of life, CD4+ T-cell counts and viral load in HIV-infected men and women with components of The Metabolic Syndrome.

 We hypothesize that a yoga lifestyle intervention will improve metabolic, anthropometric, cardiovascular disease parameters, and quality of life domains without adversely affecting immune or virologic status in people living with HIV.
