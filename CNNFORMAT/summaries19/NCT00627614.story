(secondQuint)Vibro-Acoustography Imaging in Diagnosing Breast Masses in Women With a Breast Mass or Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - To study in vivo detection of breast masses by vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging.

 - To evaluate the performance of VA imaging in differentiating between benign and malignant breast masses identified as BI-RADS 4 or 5.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo clinical mammography of the breast, followed by vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging using ultrasonography over 90 minutes.

 Patients may also undergo further imaging using clinical ultrasonography.
