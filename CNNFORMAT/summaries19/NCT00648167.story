(firstQuint)A Safety and Tolerability Study of Zerenex (Ferric Citrate) in Patients With End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Zerenex cent (ferric citrate) as a treatment for hyperphosphatemia in patients with End-Stage Renal Disease.

 These patients will be switched to Zerenex cent from their current high dose of phosphate binder and, based on their serum phosphorus levels, will be titrated up from 3.

4g/day of Zerenex cent to maximum tolerated and safe doses of Zerenex cent .

 Doses will be adjusted weekly, based on serum phosphorus levels, with the maximum dose administered being approximately 12g/day.
