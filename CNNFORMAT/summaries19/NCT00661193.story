(fifthQuint)S0709: Erlotinib With or Without Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To select a regimen (erlotinib hydrochloride with or without carboplatin and paclitaxel) for further testing against standard treatment, based on median progression-free survival for 3 months, in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer with a Zubrod performance status of 2.

 Secondary - To assess the feasibility of selecting patients for a trial based on central EGFR testing of serum in a cooperative group setting.

 - To evaluate the objective tumor response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial response), in a subset of patients with measurable disease.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-21.

 Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 - Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 2-16.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses.

 Beginning in course 5 and for all subsequent courses, patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride alone on days 1-21.

 Courses with erlotinib hydrochloride repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

 S0709: Erlotinib With or Without Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving erlotinib together with carboplatin and paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well erlotinib works when given alone or together with carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
