(firstQuint)Daclizumab Versus Thymoglobulin in Renal Transplant Recipients With High Immunological Risk.

 The objective of this randomized, multi-center trial is to directly compare the ATG, Thymoglobulin, with the anti-CD25 mAb, daclizumab, in a high-risk, HLA-sensitized renal transplant population, in order to elucidate whether there is any significant difference in the incidence of acute rejection after one year.

 Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either ATG (1.

25 mg/kg/d from day 0 to day 7) or daclizumab (1 mg/kg at days 0, 14, 28, 42 and 56).

 Maintenance immunosuppression comprised tacrolimus, MMF and prednisone.

 The study's primary endpoint was the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection at one year.
