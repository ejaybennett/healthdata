(thirdQuint)Pregabalin in Treating Women With Hot Flashes.

 OBJECTIVES: - To evaluate the efficacy of 150 mg of pregabalin versus placebo on hot flash scores in women with a history of breast cancer or women who do not wish to take estrogen therapy for fear of increased risk of breast cancer.

 - To evaluate the side effect profile of different doses of pregabalin in these patients.

 - To evaluate the effect of 150 mg of pregabalin versus placebo on the secondary outcome of interference of activities from hot flashes in these patients.

 - To evaluate the efficacy and side effect profile of 75 mg of pregabalin versus placebo in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age (18-49 years vs 50 years); selective estrogen-receptor modulator (i.

e.

, tamoxifen or raloxifene) or aromatase inhibitor use (yes vs no); duration of hot flashes ( 9 months); and frequency of hot flashes per 24-hour period (4-9 vs 10).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive 75 mg of oral pregabalin twice daily for 6 weeks.

 - Arm II: Patients receive 150 mg of oral pregabalin twice daily for 6 weeks.

 - Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 weeks.

 Treatment in all arms continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients complete Hot Flash Diaries at baseline and once daily during treatment and the Symptom Experience Diary at baseline and once weekly during treatment.

 Patients also complete the Profile of Mood States and the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale questionnaires at baseline and after completion of study treatment.
