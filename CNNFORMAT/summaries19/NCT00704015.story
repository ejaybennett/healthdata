The purpose of this study was to evaluate if an intervention with smoking cessation starting during the acute hospitalization period and continuing during the acute postoperative phase of 6 weeks would reduce the frequency of overall postoperative complications and wound infections in patients with acute musculoskeletal injuries requiring surgical treatment.

 The secondary aims were to study the short and the long term (1 year) abstinence rate, functional outcome, health related quality of life as well as costs.
