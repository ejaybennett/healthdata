(thirdQuint)Lidocaine and Ketamine Versus Standard Care on Acute and Chronic Pain.

 Participants will be randomized into one of three study groups; Group 1 - Paravertebral Group - ropivacaine is injected near the spine before surgery.

 Midazolam and fentanyl are administered intravenously for sedation.

 Group 2 - Lidocaine/Ketamine - General anesthesia with lidocaine and ketamine administered intravenously throughout your surgery and for 60 minutes after surgery.

 Group 3 - General Anesthesia Alone.

 General anesthesia with placebo administered intravenously throughout surgery and for 60 minutes after surgery.

 All participants will rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10 after surgery and on days 1 and 2 after surgery.

 Participants are called 3 and 6 months after surgery for pain and quality of life assessments.

 Lidocaine and Ketamine Versus Standard Care on Acute and Chronic Pain@highlight

The investigators are conducting this study to find out if intravenous (injected through the vein) infusion of lidocaine and ketamine administered with general anesthesia is as effective as a paravertebral block in lessening pain after surgery and that both of these techniques are superior to general anesthesia alone in reducing pain immediately after surgery and in the long-term.
