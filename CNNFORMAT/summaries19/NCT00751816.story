(thirdQuint)Head & Neck Cancer Survivorship: Physical and Functional Status.

 OBJECTIVES: - Describe the physical and functional well-being of head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors undergoing physical therapy during adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

 - Describe clinical measure of range of motion for the cervical spine and shoulder of HNC survivors undergoing physical therapy during adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

 - Determine the feasibility of an early physical therapy intervention (prior to and during adjuvant treatment) targeting the physical needs of HNC survivors.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo physical therapy weekly for 10 weeks beginning 1 week prior to initiating adjuvant chemoradiotherapy and continuing until 2 weeks after the completion of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

 Patients undergo range of motion assessment and complete a Cancer Survivorship Survey (CSS) at baseline and in weeks 4, 8, 9, and 10 of physical therapy.

RATIONALE: Early physical therapy may be effective in improving range of motion of the neck and shoulders in head and neck cancer survivors who are undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well early physical therapy works in improving physical and functional well-being in head and neck cancer survivors receiving chemoradiotherapy.
