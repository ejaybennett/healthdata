(fifthQuint)Microsurgical Varicocelectomy Versus No Surgery in Men With a Palpable Varicocele and an Abnormal Semen Analysis.

 Study Design This will be a randomized controlled clinical trial to examine the effect of varicocelectomy in men with infertility, an abnormal semen analysis, and a palpable varicocele.

 This approach will allow us to compare (i) the effect of microsurgical varicocelectomy on live birth rates after up to four cycles of alternating intrauterine insemination and four cycles of timed intercourse over 8 months and (ii) the relative effectiveness of intrauterine insemination versus timed intercourse on live birth rates.

 Secondary analyses will explore the effect of the surgical intervention on pregnancy rates, semen analysis parameters, serological hormonal measures in the male subjects, and quality of life measures in both the male and female partners.

 Treatment Two hundred and thirty-two couples will be randomized to the two intervention groups (microsurgical varicocelectomy plus up to four cycles each of alternating intrauterine insemination and timed intercourse or no microsurgical varicocelectomy plus up to four cycles each of alternating intrauterine insemination and timed intercourse).

 Timing We anticipate that it will take 3 years to complete the study.

 Enrollment will begin in year 1 of the study.

 34 couples will need to be recruited per site over the duration of the study to reach the enrollment goal of 232 couples.

 Participants will be enrolled in the study for one year, with the male partner undergoing periodic study assessments at two month intervals.

 Microsurgical Varicocelectomy Versus No Surgery in Men With a Palpable Varicocele and an Abnormal Semen Analysis@highlight

The primary research hypothesis is that microsurgical varicocelectomy will result in an increase in live birth in infertile couples where the male partner has a palpable varicocele and an abnormal semen analysis in comparison to male partners who do not have microsurgical varicocelectomy.

 The secondary hypotheses include: 1.

 To assess whether up to 4 cycles of intrauterine insemination confers any additional increase in live birth rates compared to timed intercourse; 2.

 To examine spousal pregnancy rate as the secondary outcome; and 3.

 To study the effect of varicocelectomy in men with infertility, an abnormal semen analysis, and a palpable varicocele on - Testicular semen analysis parameters; - Serological measures of FSH, LH, total and free testosterone and - Measures of quality of life and sexual function in both partners.
