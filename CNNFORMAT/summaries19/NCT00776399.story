(thirdQuint)Radiofrequency Ablation in Resectable Colorectal Lung Metastasis.

 This will be a phase-II clinical trial.

 Lung metastasectomy is the only therapeutic option to provide a long-survival in patients with colorectal lung metastases.

 Recent studies have shown that radiofrequency (RF) ablation is a safe and useful therapeutic option for the treatment of unresectable lung metastases.

 In this clinical trial, clinical utility of lung RF ablation will be evaluated.

 Patients with resectable lung metastases will receive lung RF ablation.

 All subjects will be followed for overall survival, safety, change in respiratory function, cancer-specific survival, and local tumor progression.
