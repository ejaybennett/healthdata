(secondQuint)Vorinostat and Low Dose Cytarabine for High Risk Myelodysplasia.

 This is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, Phase I/II study.

 Patients will be treated either with arm A or B dosing schedules which contain increasing durations of exposure to vorinostat.

 LD Ara-C will be administered once daily, subcutaneously(SC), at 10 mg/m in Cycle 1 and escalated to 20 mg/m daily in Cycle 2 and above for 14 out of 28 days.

 Oral vorinostat will be administered as 400 mg, once daily either sequentially(Arm A) or concurrently (Arm B) with LD Ara-C in Dose Level #1 for 7 days, Dose Level #2 for 10 days, or Dose Level #3 for 14 days out of each 28-day cycle.

 Patients who do not have disease progression and who continue to meet eligibility criteria may receive up to 3 additional 28-day cycles of treatment.
