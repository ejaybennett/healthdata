(firstQuint)AKIN Criteria: Acute Kidney Injury After On-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG).

 Eight hundred and seventeen patients was enrolled in this series and divided into to groups: Group AKI (-) - patients without acute kidney injury after on-pump CABG.

 Group AKI (+) - patients with acute kidney injury after on-pump CABG.

 AKI was defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of more than or equal to 0.

3 mg/dl ( 26.

4 1/2mol/l) or a percentage increase in SCr of more than or equal to 50% (1.

5-fold from baseline).

 The change in SCr concentration was defined as the difference between immediate postoperative concentration and the highest concentration during the stay in ICU.

 Clinical Outcomes and 30-day mortality was evaluate in this patients.
