(firstQuint)Safety, Tolerability, and Antiviral Activity of ANA598 in Patients With Genotype-1 Chronic HCV Infection.

 The safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of ANA598, administered orally twice daily for 3 days, will be compared to placebo in treatment-naive subjects chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 infection.

 Thirty (30) subjects will be randomized to one of three cohorts described above.

 The ten patients in each cohort will be randomized 8 active: 2 placebo.
