(thirdQuint)Comparing the Effectiveness of Repairing Versus Replacing the Heart's Mitral Valve in People With Severe Chronic Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation.

 CAD occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become blocked as a result of plaque buildup.

 In severe cases, CAD can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart attack.

 After a heart attack, some people may develop a leak in the mitral valve of the heart.

 This condition is known as ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR), and it can cause blood to flow backward into the heart.

 If left untreated, severe IMR can lead to heart failure or serious heart rhythm irregularities, known as arrhythmias.

 People with severe mitral valve leakage routinely undergo one of two surgical procedures to fix the mitral valve: a mitral valve repair procedure, in which a surgical ring is used to repair the valve; or a mitral valve replacement procedure, in which the damaged valve is replaced with a new one.

 Currently, there is no consensus in the medical community as to which procedure is more beneficial.

 The purpose of this study is to determine whether people with severe mitral valve regurgitation should undergo a mitral valve repair procedure or a mitral valve replacement procedure.

 This study will enroll people with CAD who have severe mitral regurgitation.

 At a baseline study visit, participants will undergo a physical examination; blood collection; neurocognitive tests; and questionnaires regarding medical history, medication history, and quality of life.

 In the operating room, participants will be randomly assigned to undergo either the mitral valve repair procedure or the mitral valve replacement procedure.

 Blood, urine, and tissue samples may be collected from participants after the surgery; this is optional and will only be done with prior approval from participants.

 All participants will attend study visits at Day 30 and Months 6, 12, and 24.

 At each visit, participants will take part in a medication history review, a physical examination, an echocardiogram, a cardiopulmonary exercise test, neurocognitive tests, and quality of life surveys.

 Comparing the Effectiveness of Repairing Versus Replacing the Heart's Mitral Valve in People With Severe Chronic Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation@highlight

People with coronary artery disease (CAD) or people who have had a heart attack may develop a leak in the mitral valve of their heart and may therefore need to undergo surgery to fix the valve.

 The best way to fix the mitral valve remains undetermined.

 This study will evaluate whether it is better for people with severe mitral valve leakage to undergo a mitral valve replacement procedure or a mitral valve repair procedure.
