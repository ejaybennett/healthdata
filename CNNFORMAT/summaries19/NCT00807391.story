(secondQuint)Transbronchial Catheter Aspiration and Transbronchial Needle Aspiration in the Diagnosis of Lung Cancer.

 The yield of transbronchial forceps biopsy under fluoroscopy in the diagnosis of peripheral lesion of the lung lies between 32 and 57%.

 Several studies prove an amelioration of success rates by addition of cytological methods such as TBNA, TBCA and bronchial brushing.

 Furthermore, for TBNA and TBCA a significantly higher yield was reported in comparison with transbronchial forceps biopsy.

 TBNA and TBCA are routinely used methods, both techniques are safe, the instruments used are certificated.

 Transbronchial Catheter Aspiration and Transbronchial Needle Aspiration in the Diagnosis of Lung Cancer@highlight

The aim of this study is prospectively to determine the diagnostic sensitivity of Transbronchial Catheter Aspiration (TBCA) in comparison with Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA) in the diagnosis of peripheral nodules and masses of the lung.
