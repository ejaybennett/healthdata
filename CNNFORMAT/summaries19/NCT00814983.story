(secondQuint)Myeloablative Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation Using a Naive T-Cell Depleted Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Graft.

 A cohort of patients (Cohort 1) will be enrolled to receive the currently accepted standard approach to myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

 With the exception of volume and/or plasma depletion (in cases of donor/recipient ABO incompatibility), the peripheral blood stem cell graft will be unmodified.

 The primary purpose of Cohort 1 is to prospectively collect samples for measurement of immune recovery from a relatively homogeneous population of patients treated in a uniform manner.

 Within the limitations of age-matching, patients accrued to Cohort 1 will be incorporated into a larger retrospective historical control group for purposes of comparison with Cohort 2 of the incidence of grade II-IV acute Graft versus Host disease.

 The experimental aspects of this trial will be the use of a naive T-cell depleted peripheral blood stem cell graft (Cohort 2).

 All other aspects of this stem cell transplantation are in line with the standard of care.

 Recruitment to this trial will be stratified by donor type as matched sibling or matched unrelated donor.

 Patients will be conditioned with total body irradiation (1350cGy) and Cyclophosphamide.

 The donor stem cell grafts will come from mobilized peripheral blood of 6/6 HLA-identical family members or 8/8 (HLA A, B, C, DRB1) allele-level matched unrelated donors.

 Myeloablative Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation Using a Naive T-Cell Depleted Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Graft@highlight

The primary objectives will be to measure the safety and efficacy of allogeneic stem cell transplantation using a peripheral blood stem cell graft that has been depleted of CD45RA+ Naive T-cells.

 The secondary objectives will be to measure the pace of immune recovery.
