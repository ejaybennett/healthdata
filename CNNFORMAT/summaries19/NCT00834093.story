(fifthQuint)A Phase II Study of Epstein-Barr Virus-Specific Immunotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.

 Subjects will register and provide a blood sample which will be used to create the immune therapy product.

 This will take about 16 weeks during which time they will receive chemotherapy for their nasopharynx cancer.

 When the immune product is ready the chemotherapy will be stopped and the immunotherapy product will be given to the participant by infusion.

 On the first day of the research treatment, participants will receive infusion #1 of the EBV immunotherapy product.

 Fourteen days later, the participant will receive infusion #2.

 Eight weeks after infusion #2, the research doctor will do some tests to determine the effects that the EBV immunotherapy product has had on the participants tumor.

 If the research doctor thinks that they would benefit from a third infusion of the EBV immunotherapy product and there is sufficient immunotherapy product remaining, the participant my be given infusion #3.

 - Before each infusion of the EBV immunotherapy product participants will have a physical exam, blood work and fiberoptic exam of the nasopharynx if needed.

 - Within 28 days of receiving the EBV immunotherapy product for the first time, we will evaluate the participants tumor by using CT scan and/or MRI.

 A Phase II Study of Epstein-Barr Virus-Specific Immunotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to determine how effective and how safe it is to give an Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) immunotherapy product to participants with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) associated with EBV that has come back or spread to other parts of the participants body.

 The EBV immunotherapy product will be made with white blood cells from the participants blood and takes about 16 weeks to create.

 This EBV immunotherapy product may stop cancer cells from growing and cause the tumors to disappear.
