(secondQuint)Compartmental Overpressures Associated to Reamed Intramedullary Nails.

 Compartmental overpressure is a serious problem in relation to the treatment of tibial shaft fractures.

 When reamed intramedullary nails are used, the risk of suffering a compartmental syndrome must be in mind of surgeons.

 Diagnostic of compartmental syndrome could be difficult just after the surgical intervention, because the patient is under conditions of regional anesthesia or opioids and analgesics, which could mask the symptomatology.

 In fact, when there is a great suspicion of this syndrome, we recommend measuring compartmental pressures; therefore, physicians might apply the term delta-P value, which is the result of the mean arterial pressure minus compartmental pressure.

 If this one is less than 30 mm Hg, a fasciotomy should be performed even when the clinical diagnostic is not clear.

The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of reamed intramedullary nails in tibial shaft fractures (as a standard treatment), in raising intracompartmental pressures and therefore determine if they are a risk factor for compartmental syndrome.
