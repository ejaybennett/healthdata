(firstQuint)Near to Infrared (NIR) Light Neuroprotection in Glaucomatous Optic Neuropathy.

 Ganglion cell dysfunction in glaucomatous optic neuropathy has been ascribed to ganglion cell electrophysiological inactivation and to apoptotic cell death.

 Near-to-infrared light stimulation has been used to induce mitochondrial activation and to prevent apoptotic death through mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c stimulation.

 Near-to-infrared light stimulation might be useful to induce ganglion cell activation and inhibit apoptotic cell death.

 We propose that near-to-infrared light stimulation can be used as an adjuvant treatment combined with ocular hypotensive treatment in glaucomatous patients.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate if near-to-infrared light stimulation can improve retinal ganglion cell function in glaucomatous patients.
