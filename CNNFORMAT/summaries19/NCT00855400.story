(secondQuint)Clinical Trial on the Use of Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cells in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

 Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) typically endure a progressive paralysis due to the continued loss of motoneurons that leads them to death in less than 5 years.

 No treatment has changed its natural history.

 Intraspinal injections of bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) have been able to ameliorate the course of ALS in murine models, acting as pumps of trophic factors that keep the motoneurons functional.

 We have designed a phase I/II clinical trial to check the feasibility of this approach in humans.

The purpose of this clinical trial is to asses the feasibility and the security of the intraspinal infusion of autologous bone marrow stem cells for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis patients.
