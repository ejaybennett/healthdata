(firstQuint)Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of Carbamylated Erythropoietin (CEPO) to Treat Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke.

 Acute ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and severe disability.

 The naturally occurring hormone, erythropoietin (EPO), is able to protect various neuronal tissues from ischemic injury and is beneficial in animal models of acute ischemic stroke.

 Lu AA24493 is a modified (carbamylated) version of EPO, neuroprotective but without the haematopoietic side effects.

 Lu AA24493 is developed for treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke.
