(secondQuint)Study of Tumor and Blood Samples From Women With Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Assess relapse locally or remotely using biomarkers collected from primary tumor and blood samples from women with breast cancer during the first 2 years after diagnosis.

 Secondary - Evaluate all relapses.

 - Assess survival without relapse.

 - Determine correlation between biomarkers and relapse.

 OUTLINE: Primary tumor and blood samples collected during usual care of patients during the first 2 years after diagnosis are analyzed for biomarkers useful in monitoring and diagnosing breast cancer.
