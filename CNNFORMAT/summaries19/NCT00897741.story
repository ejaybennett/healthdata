(thirdQuint)Gene Expression Profiles in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Compare the gene expression profiles of pancreatic cancer cells from the primary and metastatic sites in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

 - Characterize the function of the differentially upregulated and downregulated genes identified by comparing the gene expression profiles of primary and metastatic cells in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Fresh biopsy samples are collected for gene expression profiling and other biomarker/laboratory analyses.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Gene Expression Profiles in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 PURPOSE: This laboratory study uses gene expression profiling to compare primary tumor cells with metastatic tumor cells in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
