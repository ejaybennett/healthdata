(fifthQuint)Lenalidomide and Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome in Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Phase I - Primary - To determine the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide when combined with fixed dose pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride in women with recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

 Phase II - Define the best overall response induced by lenalidomide in recurrent ovarian cancer patients Secondary - To obtain preliminary information on toxicity, response, and time to progression (duration of response) of these patients.

 - Progression free survival Phase I OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

 Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-28 and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Phase II OUTLINE: The phase II component will include patients with measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria treated at lenalidomide 10 mg days 1-28 days of a 28 day cycle (Maximum Tolerated Dose from phase I) with liposomal doxorubicin 40 mg/m^2 to determine efficacy and safety of the combination therapy.

 (Effective with April 2010 revision) After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

 Lenalidomide and Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome in Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving lenalidomide together with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome in treating patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.
