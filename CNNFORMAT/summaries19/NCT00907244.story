(secondQuint)Arterial Spin Labeling Perfusion Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging in Pediatric Brain Tumors.

 The purpose of this study is to get information regarding the usefulness and accuracy of this new MRI technique - termed arterial spin labeling (ASL) - in the diagnosis of pediatric brain tumors.

 This technique can non-invasively measure the blood flow to the brain during MRI examination.

 Because aggressive brain tumors require new blood vessels and a high level of blood supply to support its growth, we believe the tumor blood flow measured using ASL is a reliable indicator of tumor grade.

 This information may be useful for doctors to make treatment decisions and to monitor patients' response to treatment.
