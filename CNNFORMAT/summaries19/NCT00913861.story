(secondQuint)Non-pharmacological Intervention for Colonoscopy.

 Sedative and analgesic drugs are used in most patients related to pain and anxiety during the colonoscopy.

 Analgesia and sedation has adverse effects such as central respiratory depression, obstruction of the upper airways, hypoxia, hypotension and bradycardia.

 Non-pharmacological interventions had beneficial effects during percutaneous vascular or renal procedures.

 In this study we test the hypothesis that the adjunction of hypnosis to pharmacological sedation will decrease the quantity of sedative drugs used and will reduce the patient's anxiety and discomfort.
