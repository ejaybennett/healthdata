This phase I/II study is being conducted to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and efficacy of a combination chemotherapy using docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (DCF) in unresectable advanced esophageal cancer.

 The usefulness of the this regimen is evaluated by RECIST, time to progression and median survival time.
