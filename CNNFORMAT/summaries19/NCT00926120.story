(secondQuint)The Effects of Mogroside Sweetener on Viral Load in TreatmenT Naive Genotype 1 (GT 1) Subjects CHC.

 The primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety and efficacy of administering Mogroside Sweetener "PureLo" to genotype 1 subjects at a dose level of 5 grams every 6 hours for 14 days on hepatitis C viral load and serum ALT levels.

 Percentage change in HCV load over the first 48 hours and daily for 14 days and change in serum ALT levels over the two week period of study, will be calculated for each patient.

 The number of subjects who show a decline in viral load of at least 50% will then be calculated, as will the number of subjects who decrease their serum ALT levels by at least 50%.

 All efficacy and safety analysis will be conducted at the end of the study.
