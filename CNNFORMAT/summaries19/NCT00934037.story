(thirdQuint)Combined Non-invasive Coronary Angiography and Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Using 320 Detector Computed Tomography.

 The Combined Coronary angiography and myocardial perfusion imaging using 320 detectors computed tomography (CORE-320) was designed as a prospective, multi-center, international, blinded study designed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of multi-detector computed tomography using 320 detectors for identifying coronary artery luminal stenosis and corresponding myocardium perfusion defects in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

 The primary analysis will be a comparison of the diagnostic capability of the combination of quantitative 320-MDCT angiography and quantitative perfusion imaging to the combination of conventional coronary angiography and SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging at the patient level.

 A positive patient will be defined as having at least one vessel with a 50% diameter stenosis defined by quantitative coronary angiography and a corresponding positive SPECT territorial myocardial perfusion defect.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of multi-detector computed tomography using 320 detectors for identifying the combination of coronary artery stenosis 50% and a corresponding myocardium perfusion defect in a patient with suspected coronary artery disease compared with conventional coronary angiography and single photon emission computed tomography myocardium perfusion imaging.
