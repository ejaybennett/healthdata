(fifthQuint)Phase I/II Study of Weekly Abraxane and RAD001 in Women With Locally Adv.

 or Metastatic Breast Ca.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of everolimus when administered in combination with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation in women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

 (Phase I) - To determine the antitumor activity of this regimen, as measured by clinical tumor response according to RECIST criteria, in these patients.

 (Phase II) Secondary - To determine the safety and tolerability of everolimus when administered at the recommended phase II dose in combination with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of everolimus followed by a phase II study.

 Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.

 Patients also receive oral everolimus once daily or once every other day on days 1-28.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

 Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation together with everolimus may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus when given together with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and to see how well it works in treating women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
