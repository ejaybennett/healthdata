(thirdQuint)Continuous Transversus Abdominis Plane Nerve Block for Postoperative Analgesia.

 Specific Aim: To determine if adding a continuous Transversus Abdominis Plane nerve block to a single-injection nerve block results in improved postoperative pain control.

 Hypothesis 1: Adding a continuous Transversus Abdominis Plane nerve block to a single-injection nerve block results in lower average pain scores during movement the day following surgery.

 Specific Aim2: To determine if adding a continuous Transversus Abdominis Plane nerve block to a single-injection nerve block results in decreased average pain scores, opioid use, sleep disturbances, and improved patient satisfaction.

 Hypothesis 2: Adding a continuous Transversus Abdominis Plane nerve block to a single-injection nerve block results in decreased average pain scores, oral opioid consumption, sleep disturbances, and improved patient satisfaction the day following surgery.

 Continuous Transversus Abdominis Plane Nerve Block for Postoperative Analgesia@highlight

Research study to determine if putting local anesthetic through one or two tiny tubes next to the nerves that go to the area the patients are having surgery on (abdomen or pelvis), will improve pain control following surgery.

 This study will also help determine if patients require fewer pain pills, experience fewer sleep disturbances, and are more satisfied with their postoperative pain control.
