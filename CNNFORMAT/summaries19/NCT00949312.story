(secondQuint)Studying Lymph Nodes in Patients With Stage II Colon Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether the immunohistochemical and molecular presence of micrometastases in 12 lymph nodes removed during en-bloc resection in patients with stage II colon cancer correlates with 3-year disease-free survival.

 - Evaluate the prognostic significance of molecular markers detected in the primary tumor and develop a microarray-based gene signature for stage II colon cancer.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Tumor tissue and regional lymph node samples are collected during surgery for analysis of micrometastases and molecular markers by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, MM qRT-PCR, qRDNA-PCR, and microarray profiling.

 Patients are followed up periodically for 4 years after surgery.

 Studying Lymph Nodes in Patients With Stage II Colon Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures that look for micrometastases in lymph nodes removed during surgery for colon cancer may help doctors learn the extent of disease.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying lymph nodes in patients with stage II colon cancer.
