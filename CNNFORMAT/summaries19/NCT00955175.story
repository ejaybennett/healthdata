(thirdQuint)Hypofractionated 3-Dimensional Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 ICORG 99-09.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the acute and long-term radio-induced toxicity (any organ) of hypofractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer.

 Secondary - To assess the radiological tumor response rate at 3 months after completion of radiotherapy.

 - To assess the actuarial freedom from thoracic progression rate.

 OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to combined lung volume at 25 Gy ( 30% vs > 30%).

 Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.

 - Group 1: Patients undergo hypofractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 24 fractions (total of 72 Gy).

 - Group 2: Patients undergo hypofractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 22 fractions (total of 66 Gy).

 - Group 3: Patients undergo hypofractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 20 fractions (total of 60 Gy).

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor over a shorter period of time may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of hypofractionated 3-dimensional radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage I, stage II, or stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
