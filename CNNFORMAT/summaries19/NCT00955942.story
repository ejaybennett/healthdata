(thirdQuint)Flaxseed Supplement in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess the feasibility of dietary flaxseed (FS) supplementation in patients undergoing definitive chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

 - To collect toxicity and tolerability data on dietary FS supplementation during definitive chemoradiotherapy.

 Secondary - To validate urinary and serum markers of oxidative stress and FS lignan levels as surrogates of the bioavailability of FS in these patients.

 - To determine if a dose response to daily ingestion of 20 g or 40 g of FS can be observed in plasma lignan levels and urinary markers of oxidative stress.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients consume flaxseed muffins once or twice daily beginning on the first day of radiotherapy and continuing for up to 9-10 weeks.

 - Arm II: Patients consume placebo muffins once or twice daily beginning on the first day of radiotherapy and continuing for up to 9-10 weeks.

 Blood and urine samples are collected periodically for biomarker studies.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.

 Flaxseed Supplement in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy@highlight

RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.

 Flaxseed may help protect normal cells from the side effects of radiation therapy.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects of flaxseed supplement in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
