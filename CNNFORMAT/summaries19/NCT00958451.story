(thirdQuint)Vitamin D Deficiency in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Patients.

 This study will enroll chronic kidney disease patients, stage 3 and 4, who have low serum vitamin D levels as defined by K DOQI Guidelines.

 Patients will be randomized to receive oral daily ergocalciferol or paricalcitol.

 A total of 80 patients will be enrolled, 40 in the cholecalciferol group and 40 in the paricalcitol group.

 Outcomes will be assessed as proportion of patients achieving pre-defined changes from baseline and as absolute changes from baseline values.

 Baseline values will be determined from averaging two consecutive measurements of the variables of interest prior to randomization.

 Vitamin D Deficiency in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Patients@highlight

This is an open label, single center, randomized, active comparator controlled study, comparing the effects of vitamin D replacement using oral ergocalciferol versus paricalcitol on parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD and vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency.

 The purpose of this study is to determine which of these two approaches is more successful.
