(fifthQuint)Cisplatin, Capecitabine, Gemcitabine and Epirubicin or Docetaxel for Patients With Stage III or IV Pancreatic Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Assess 6-months progression-free survival of patients with stage III or IV adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with cisplatin, capecitabine, gemcitabine hydrochloride (PXG) and epirubicin hydrochloride vs PXG and docetaxel.

 - Evaluate the activity and toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 - Arm I (PEXG): Patients receive cisplatin, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and docetaxel on days 1 and 15, and capecitabine on days 1-28.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 - Arm II (PGDX): Patients receive cisplatin, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and epirubicin hydrochloride on days 1and 15, and capecitabine on days 1-28.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients may then undergo surgery if the tumor becomes resectable.

 Cisplatin, Capecitabine, Gemcitabine and Epirubicin or Docetaxel for Patients With Stage III or IV Pancreatic Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, capecitabine, gemcitabine hydrochloride, epirubicin hydrochloride, and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

 It is not yet known whether cisplatin, capecitabine, and gemcitabine hydrochloride are more effective when given together with epirubicin hydrochloride or docetaxel in treating patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving cisplatin, capecitabine, and gemcitabine hydrochloride together with epirubicin hydrochloride compared with giving cisplatin, capecitabine, and gemcitabine hydrochloride together with docetaxel and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV pancreatic cancer.
