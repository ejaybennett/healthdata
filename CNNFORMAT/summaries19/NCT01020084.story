(firstQuint)Salivary Flow Rate and Oral Function.

 Hyposalivation may damage oral functions.

 Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients under hyposalivation present damaged mastication and speech.

 Forty subjects composed 2 groups: Control (C) and hyposalivation (H).

 Masticatory performance (MP) was carried out using artificial material and a 10-sieve method.

 Mandibular movements during speech were obtained using a 3D jaw-tracking device.

 Neither mastication nor speech have been impaired by low salivary flow rate.
