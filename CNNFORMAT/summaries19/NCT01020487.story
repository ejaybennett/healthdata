 The study consists of two parts.

 Part 1 is an open-label single-dose, non-fasting, multicenter study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of paricalcitol capsules in 12 children ages 10 to 16 years with CKD Stages 3 and 4.

 Part 2 of this study will be conducted as a 12 week randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, followed by 12 weeks open-label treatment.

Part 1: To determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 3 1/2g paricalcitol capsules in children ages 10 to 16 years with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD Stages 3 and 4).

 Part 2: To determine the safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules as compared to placebo in decreasing serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) in children ages 10 to 16 years with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease with an initial 12 weeks of double-blinded study drug followed by a minimum of 12 weeks of open-label active drug.
