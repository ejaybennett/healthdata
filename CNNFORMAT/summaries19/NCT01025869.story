(firstQuint)The Clinical Evaluation of the Cinatra Corolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent in De Novo Lesions in Native Coronary Arteries.

 This is a single-arm, multicentre pilot study designed to provide an indication of the effectiveness and safety of the Cinatra cent Corolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System.

 The primary endpoint to be evaluated in this study is late lumen loss (in-stent) at 6 months post-procedure as measured by QCA in the 30 participants undergoing angiography at this timepoint.

 Late lumen loss is defined as the difference between the post-index procedure minimal lumen diameter (MLD) and the follow-up MLD.
