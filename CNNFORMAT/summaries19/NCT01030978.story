(secondQuint)Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in Children With a Family-based Healthy Lifestyle Program.

 Primary Aim: (1) To determine whether youth randomized to the Bright Bodies (BB) Healthy Lifestyle Program have lower 2-hr plasma glucose levels than those randomized to standard lifestyle counseling (control) after 6 months.

 Secondary Aims: (2) To determine if greater conversions from IGT to normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and less development of T2DM occurs for those in the BB vs Control Group; (3)To determine if there is improvement in anthropometric/metabolic parameters in BB vs Control Group; and (4) To determine if there is an improvement in psychosocial and family dynamic outcomes of the child in BB vs Control Group.
