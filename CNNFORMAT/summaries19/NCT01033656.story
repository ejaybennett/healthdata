(fifthQuint)Treatment of Refractory Adult-onset Still's Disease With Anakinra: a Randomized Study.

 Product: Kineret (anakinra) Comparative agents: Methotrexate or azathioprine or leflunomide or cyclosporin A or sulphasalazine Protocol title: An open, randomized study treating refractory adult-onset Still's disease with IL-1ra anakinra (Kineret, compared to an established, single anti-rheumatic treatment Target Disease: Adult-onset Still's disease Patients: 23 patients diagnosed with AOSD, living in the four Nordic countries.

 Study Objectives: To follow the changes in clinical status and disease activity in patients receiving anakinra, compared to those treated with an established DMARD, in addition to corticosteroids in patients with refractory AOSD.

 To compare the changes in disease-related parameters (global health, patient's assessment on disease, laboratory values) in the two randomized groups.

 To assess the safety of anakinra in AOSD.

 To follow-up drug survival, efficacy, tolerability and disease-related parameters of long-term treatment in AOSD (open phase).

 Treatment of Refractory Adult-onset Still's Disease With Anakinra: a Randomized Study@highlight

An open, randomized, parallel-group, comparative, multicentre study.

 Patients on corticosteroids (plus conventional therapy) will be randomized to receive anakinra (Kineret(R)), or one of the following: methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, cyclosporin A or sulphasalazine.

 Patients enter the study if considered refractory to corticosteroids (prednisolone equivalent 10 mg/day) at the time of randomization.

 The randomized phase of the study will be followed by an open-label extension (OLE) phase, to follow-up drug survival, efficacy, tolerability and disease-related parameters of long-term treatment with anakinra or one of the study DMARDs or a combination of study drugs for additional 28 weeks.
