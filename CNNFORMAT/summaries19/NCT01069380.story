(firstQuint)Resting Metabolic Rate in Chronic Bed-Ridden Patients.

 Are standard REE equations suitable for estimating resting metabolic rate in long term, bed ridden, chronically ill patients? Research objective: to measure resting metabolic rate (REE) in long term, bed ridden, chronically ill patients and to compare their measured energy needs to standard REE equations.
