(firstQuint)Pharmacokinetic Study of Milrinone in Babies With Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn.

 Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a condition in which the pulmonary vasculature fails to relax after birth resulting in severe hypoxemia.

 This condition has a high rate of mortality and morbidity.

 The current standard of care is treatment with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO).

 However, for many babies this treatment does not provide sufficient improvement in oxygenation.

 In this study, subjects already receiving nitric oxide will be randomized to one of two dosing regimens of milrinone.

 They will receive milrinone IV for 24 hours and will be monitored for 24 hours afterwards.

 During this time, milrinone assays will be performed by blood sampling.

 Echocardiograms will also be performed to explore the pharmacodynamics of milrinone.

 Safety monitoring will be performed.

The purpose of this pilot study is to determine a safe dose of milrinone to use in a larger study of babies with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).
