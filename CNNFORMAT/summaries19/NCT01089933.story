(thirdQuint)Reducing Pain and Disability After Breast Cancer Surgery.

 Sixty percent of breast cancer patients undergo some form of breast surgery in the treatment of the early stages of the disease.

 The recovery from surgery can be associated with severe disabling pain persisting beyond 12 months after surgery.

 Research in pain has shown that early intervention of acute pain can prevent long term chronic pain.

 At The Ottawa Hospital, patients receive either paravertebral blocks or wound infiltration with local anesthetic for postoperative pain management.

 We would like to compare these two methods of pain control to determine an analgesic technique that will reduce acute and chronic pain, and maximally improve long-term functional recovery and patient's quality of life.

The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of thoracic paravertebral block and multimodal analgesia will decrease chronic pain and arm morbidity in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery with lymph node dissection as compared to patients receiving local anesthesia with multimodal analgesia.
