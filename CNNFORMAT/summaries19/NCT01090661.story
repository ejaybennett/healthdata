(thirdQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Mipomersen on Cardiac Repolarization Conducted in Healthy Subjects.

 This will be a randomized, double-blind, single-site, crossover study in healthy male and female subjects to determine if mipomersen administered as a single therapeutic (200 mg) SC and a single supra-therapeutic (200 mg) IV dose delays cardiac repolarization as determined by the measurement of QT/corrected QT (QTc) interval.

 A total of 60 healthy male and female subjects will be enrolled in this 4-way crossover study, randomly assigned to 1 of 8 treatment sequences, and cross over into 4 treatment periods where each subject will receive both a single SC injection and a single IV infusion during each period.

To assess the electrocardiogram (ECG) effects of mipomersen administered as a 200-mg subcutaneous (SC) therapeutic and a 200-mg intravenous (IV; [2-hour infusion]) supra-therapeutic dose relative to placebo in healthy adult male and female subjects; and to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of mipomersen when administered as a single therapeutic (200 mg) SC and a single, supra-therapeutic (200 mg) IV dose.
