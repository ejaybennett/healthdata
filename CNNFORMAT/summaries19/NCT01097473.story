(firstQuint)Long Term Physical Training in Asthma.

 Physical training is well known to support a healthy lifestyle.

 Patients with asthma are often unnecessarily restricted of physical activities or avoid exercise due to the unpleasant experience of exercise-induced dyspnea.

 As a consequence both children and adults with asthma are less fit than their peers.

 Like in healthy individuals, regular training supports health in asthmatics.

 In short-term training programs improvements of physical capabilities have been achieved in children and young adults with asthma.

 Programs of longer durations than 3 months have not been published in controlled trials.

 Effects of exercise training on quality of life in adult asthmatics are lacking.
