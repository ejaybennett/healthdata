(fifthQuint)Lenalidomide Maintenance Post-debulking in Advanced CTCL.

 OBJECTIVES: - To determine if observation versus lenalidomide maintenance therapy after debulking with gemcitabine hydrochloride or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride with or without radiotherapy prolongs progression-free survival of patients with advanced stage IIIB or IV T-cell cutaneous lymphoma or mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome not previously treated with other intravenous chemotherapy.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to institution, response to debulking treatment (complete response vs partial response), and disease (mycosis fungoides [MF] vs erythrodermic MF/Sezary syndrome).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of prior debulking therapy, patients undergo observation for 560 days.

 - Arm II: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of prior debulking therapy, patients receive oral lenalidomide once a day on days 1-21.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for 20 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter.

 Lenalidomide Maintenance Post-debulking in Advanced CTCL@highlight

RATIONALE: Observation is watching a patient's condition but not giving treatment unless symptoms appear or change.

 Lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer.

 It is not yet known whether observation or lenalidomide is more effective in treating patients who are in complete or partial response after receiving previous gemcitabine hydrochloride or doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying observation to see how well it works compared with lenalidomide in treating patients who are in complete or partial response after receiving previous gemcitabine hydrochloride or doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome for stage IIB, stage III, or stage IV cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or stage IIB, stage III, or stage IV mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome.
