 Pilot Study of Velcade in IgA Nephropathy@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the ability of Velcade(R) (bortezomib) to induce complete or partial remission in patients with severe IgA nephropathy.

 The secondary objectives are to assess clinical outcomes relating to safety and efficacy, such as infection, malignancy, preservation of renal function, partial responders, relapse rate, and to study mechanistic assays to predict remission.
