E) for Confirming Endotracheal Tube Placement in Emergency Intubation.

 Establishing a definite airway, endotracheal tube placement, is an important component for resuscitation.

 A high rate of morbidity and mortality was reported for unrecognized esophageal intubation.

 Therefore, early detection of esophageal intubation is essential for emergency airway management.

 There are several methods being used for endotracheal tube confirmation, such as auscultation of breathing sound, chest X-ray and capnography.

2 However, all of these methods had false-negative rates and not entirely reliable during resuscitation.

 Ultrasound is an indispensable and easily accessible tool in emergency department.

 Recent studies showed that ultrasound can be used to confirm endotracheal tube placement in cadaver model.

 In this prospective study, we investigate the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for endotracheal tube confirmation in emergency intubation The study is conducted in the emergency department at National Taiwan University Hospital and approved by the hospital institutional review board.

 During resuscitation, the duty emergency resuscitation team performs the intubation and confirms the endotracheal tube position by auscultation and end-tidal capnography.

 Meanwhile, the researcher performs ultrasonography examinations for endotracheal tube position.

 A curvilinear ultrasonography transducer is used and placed transversely on the anterior neck just superior to the suprasternal notch and bilateral hemithorax.

 The result of ultrasonography will be compared with auscultation, capnography and chest X-ray.

 Sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography examination is computed to determine the accuracy and effectiveness of clinical use.

Reliable endotracheal tube (ETT) insertion confirmation is essential for critically ill patients.

 Incorrect placement causes a high rate of mortality and morbidity.

 Therefore, early detection of accidental esophageal intubation must be a primary focus of emergency airway efforts in emergency department (ED).

 Although many techniques have been suggested to verify the ETT placement, there is currently no entirely reliable method.

 Ultrasonography (US) is an indispensable and easily accessible tool in ED.

 Several studies of ultrasonographic confirmation of ETT position provided promising results in cadaver model or patient in a controlled operating room setting.

In this study, the investigators have proposed a protocol called T.

R.

U.

E, an acronym for tracheal rapid ultrasound exam, to confirm the ETT position in emergency intubation.

 This method provided a fast, real-time examination to prevent esophageal or endotracheal intubation.
