(firstQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Sub-tenon Ranibizumab for Recurrent Pterygia.

 Ptergyia are chronic fibrovascular lesions of the ocular surface.

 This study is designed to look for a signal of efficacy when the lesions are in a phase of active vascular growth.

 This phase is most often caught in a newly recurring pterygia post-operatively.

 Patients identified with actively growing lesions, will be offered local injections directly beneath the lesions.

 They will be examined for any adverse side effects and regression of the lesion.
