(secondQuint)Cardiotoxicity of Cancer Therapy (CCT).

 The overall study objectives are: 1.

 To determine the longitudinal relationships between circulating NRG-1 levels and incident risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients exposed to anthracycline, trastuzumab, or a combination of the two agents.

 We hypothesize that a sustained increase in NRG-1, indicative of enhanced cardiac stress with exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, is predictive of an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction and heart failure.

 2.

 To study the SNP/haplotype variation in the Neuregulin/ErbB signaling pathway on incident risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

 We hypothesize that there will be SNP/haplotypes variations that are associated with incident cardiovascular outcomes.

 3.

 To determine the longitudinal relationships between echocardiographic measures of strain and strain rate and incident cardiac dysfunction in patients exposed to anthracycline, trastuzumab, or a combination of the two agents.

 We hypothesize that early declines in strain and strain rate are predictive of an increased risk of future cardiac dysfunction and heart failure.

 4.

 To explore the changes in NRG-1 levels and the relationships with novel echocardiographic measures of cardiac function.

 5.

 To create a biobank as a future resource for additional questions in novel biomarkers and genetics.

 6.

 To determine the long-term effects of cancer therapy cardiotoxicity by following patients yearly for a total of 5 years after their exposure to cancer therapy.

The objective of this study is to define the clinical significance of the Neuregulin/ErbB signaling pathway and novel echocardiographic measures of cardiac function in predicting incident risk of chemotherapy cardiotoxicity.
