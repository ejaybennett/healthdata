(fifthQuint)Effects of Rapid-Resisted Exercise and Bright Light Therapy on Ambulatory Adults With Traumatic Brain Injury.

 We will: 1) compare performance of healthy volunteers and ambulatory adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) on a range of motor, neurobehavioral and brain imaging outcomes; and 2) evaluate effects of rapid, reciprocal arm and leg exercise with an elliptical trainer on high-level motor coordination and balance, and neurobehavioral and cognitive functioning in persons with TBI.

 Brain connectivity and changes in connectivity in response to intervention will be quantified.

 We hypothesize even highly functional adults with TBI will have poorer scores on all measures than controls; exercise will lead to significant improvements in motor performance and balance,and neurobehavioral and cognitive functioncompared to an equivalent length of time during which they were not participating in training .

 We further hypothesize that improvements in cortical connectivity and representation will relate directly to functional ones.

 Study Population: 80 adults (50 with TBI) will be recruited so that 20 with TBI and 20 healthy volunteers complete the study.

 Only the TBI group will receive intervention.

 Design: Healthy controls with have a single assessment that includes motor, neuropsychological and brain imaging tests.

 Participants with TBI will have 3 visits with the same motor, neuropsychological and brain imaging tests as the healthy controls.

 They will perform 2 months of fast elliptical training.

 .

 Assessments will occur at 0, 2, and 4 months.

 The exercise device will be an elliptical trainer that exercises the legs and arms with the emphasis on maintaining a fast speed.

 Mild resistance will be provided initially and progressively increased once speed is optimized.

 .

 The training will be performed in the home 5 days per week for 30 minutes.

 Outcome Measures: Performance on complex motor and balance tasks will be assessed with 3D motion capture & EMG, the Smart Balance Measurement System and the High Level Mobility Assessment Tool (Hi-MAT).

 Primary outcomes are Hi-MAT score, reaction time during balance testing and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Ham-D).

 Secondary outcomes will include measures of motor speed and reaction time, dual task performance, memory, anxiety, sleep quality, and responses to stress.

 Cortical connectivity will be quantified using resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which evaluates white matter tracts.

 Cortical activation patterns during imagined walking will be quantified with fMRI.

 Effects of Rapid-Resisted Exercise and Bright Light Therapy on Ambulatory Adults With Traumatic Brain Injury@highlight

Background: - Traumatic brain injury may have a range of effects, from severe and permanent disability to more subtle functional and cognitive deficits that often go undetected during initial treatment.

 To improve treatments and therapies and to provide a uniform quality of care, more research is needed into different treatments for traumatic brain injury.

 - Exercise has been shown to improve movement and balance in people with strokes, cerebral palsy, and other conditions that affect the brain, and can improve symptoms of memory problems or depression.

 Bright light therapy has also been shown to improve mood in people with depression.

 Researchers are interested in studying problems with movement, balance, thinking, and mood in people with traumatic brain injury.

 By comparing the effects of exercise and bright light exposure on brain function, new treatments may be developed for acute traumatic brain injury.

 Objectives: - To compare the effects of exercise and bright light therapy on the brain function of individuals with traumatic brain injury.

 Eligibility: - Individuals between 18 and 44 years of age who either have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury or are healthy volunteers.

 Design: - Individuals with traumatic brain injury will have four outpatient evaluation visits at the clinical center, a 3-month home exercise program, and a 3-month bright light exposure program at home.

 Healthy volunteers will have one evaluation visit at the clinical center.

 - At the first study visit, all participants will have a full physical examination and medical history.

 Individuals with traumatic brain injury will also have an eye exam to determine if it is safe for them to receive light therapy.

 - All participants will have the following initial tests: - Tests of walking and movement, including monitoring by a physical therapist; tests to record joint movement and evaluate muscle function; tests that combine movement, thinking, and speaking; and balance and reaction time tests.

 - Magnetic resonance imaging scans - Tests of thinking and mood, including questionnaires, computerized tests, and simple action tests.

 - Participants with traumatic brain injury will have separate 3-month sessions of exercise and bright light therapy, with additional evaluation visits between each 3-month session and at the end of the study.

 Between the 3-month sessions, participants will have 1 month with no intervention.

 - Exercise sessions will involve regular workouts on an elliptical machine for 30 minutes for 5 days a week, and bright light therapy sessions will involve sitting in front of a light box for 30 minutes for 5 days a week.

 Participants will keep a journal to monitor the effects of the therapy.
