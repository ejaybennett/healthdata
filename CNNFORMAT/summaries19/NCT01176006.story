(fifthQuint)Pilot Study of Reduced-Intensity Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant of DOCK8 Deficiency.

 Background Mutations in the Dedicator of Cytokinesis-8 (DOCK8) gene are responsible for an immunodeficiency disease characterized by: severe cutaneous and sinopulmonary infections with bacterial organisms; extensive cutaneous viral infections with Herpes simplex, Herpes zoster, Molluscum contagiosum, and Human Papilloma Virus; a marked elevation in serum IgE levels and eosinophilia; homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) gene.

 Patients with DOCK8 deficiency die from severe infections, squamous cell carcinomas, or hematological malignancies.

 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents a potentially life-saving treatment for immunodeficiency diseases such as DOCK8 deficiency.

 In this study we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic HSCT for DOCK8 deficiency.

 We are particularly interested in determining whether allogeneic HSCT using different donor sources and conditioning regimens reverses the lethal disease phenotype in DOCK8 deficiency by reconstituting normal host defense.

 The development of lethal squamous cell carcinomas and lymphomas arising from the immunodeficiency in DOCK8 deficiency supports therapeutic intervention before overt malignancy arises.

 Objectives -To determine whether allogeneic HSCT reconstitutes T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte cells and myeloid cells with normal donor cells at one year post-transplant and reverses the clinical phenotype of severe recurrent infections in patients with DOCK8 deficiency.

 Eligibility Patients 5-35 years old with DOCK8 deficiency who have suffered one or more life-threatening infections, or who have developed lymphoma or squamous cell carcinoma, and have a 10/10 matched related donor, a 10/10 matched unrelated donor, a 9/10 matched related donor, a 9/10 matched unrelated donor, or a haploidentical related donor.

 Design - DOCK8 deficiency patients with 10/10 matched related donors and unrelated donors will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine 40 mg/m2/day on days -6, -5, -4, and -3, and busulfan IV (dose based on pharmacokinetic levels) every day for 4 days on days -6, -5, -4, and -3.

 The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan given prior to the start of the conditioning regimen.

 Donor hematopoietic stem cells will be infused on day 0.

 - Post-transplant immunosuppression for graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for recipients of 10/10 matched related and unrelated donors will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on days +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to approximately day 180.

 If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day +180.

 - DOCK8 deficiency patients with 9/10 matched related or 9/10 matched unrelated donors will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 14.

5 mg/kg on days -6 and -5, fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day on days -6, -5, -4, -3 and -2, busulfan IV (dose based on pharmacokinetic levels) once daily for three days on-4, -3 and -2, and 200 cGy TBI on day -1.

 The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan given prior to the start of the conditioning regimen.

 Donor hematopoietic stem cells will be infused on day 0.

 Post-transplant immunosuppression for graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for recipients of 9/10 matched related or unrelated donors will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for two days on day s +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to day 180.

 If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day+180.

 DOCK8 deficiency patients with a haploidentical related donor will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 14.

5 mg/kg on days -6 and -5, busulfan IV (dose based on pharmacokinetic levels) once daily for 3 days on days -4, -3,and -2, fludarabine 30 mg/m2 on days -6, -5, -4, -3, and -2, and 200 cGy TBI on day -1.

 The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan given prior to the start of the conditioning regimen.

 Donor hematopoietic stem cells will be infused on day 0.

 Post-transplant immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for two days on day s +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to day 180.

 If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day+180.

 Pilot Study of Reduced-Intensity Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant of DOCK8 Deficiency@highlight

Background: -DOCK8 deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system and can lead to severe recurrent infections and possible death from infections or certain types of cancers, including blood cancers.

 A stem cell transplant is a life-saving treatment for this condition.

 In this study we are evaluating the efficacy and safety of transplant from different donor sources for DOCK8 deficiency.

 The donors that we are using are matched siblings, matched unrelated donors, and half-matched donors, so called haploidentical related donors, such as as mothers or fathers or half-matched siblings.

 Objectives: -To determine whether transplant of bone marrow cells from different types of donors corrects DOCK8 deficiency.

 Eligibility: - Donors: Healthy individuals between 2 and 60 years of age who are matched with a recipient.

 - Recipient: Individuals between 5 and 40 years of age who have DOCK8 deficiency, have suffered one or more life-threatening infections, or have had certain viral related cancers of cancer and have a stem cell donor.

 Design: - All participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history.

 - DONORS: - Donors will donate bone marrow cells or blood stem cells.

 If donating blood stem cells, donors will receive injections of filgrastim to release stem cells into the blood.

 After 5 days of filgrastim injections, donors will have apheresis to donate stem cells and white blood cells that are present in the blood.

 - Donors who provide the stem cells through bone marrow donation will have their bone marrow cells harvested in the operating room.

 - RECIPIENTS: - Recipients receiving matched related or unrelated donors will receive 4 days of chemotherapy with busulfan and fludarabine to suppress their immune system and prepare them for the transplant.

 Donors receiving haploidentical related donors will receive two doses of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, 5 days of fludarabine, 3 days of busulfan, and one dose of radiation to suppress their immune system and prepare them for the transplant.

 - After the initial chemotherapy and radiation, recipients will receive the donated stem cells as a single infusion.

 Recipients may also receive white blood cells from their stem cell donor to encourage acceptance of the stem cells.

 - After the stem cell transplant, recipients will receive two days of a chemotherapy called cyclophosphamide on day's + 3 and + 4 followed by two drugs tacrolimus and mycophenolate to prevent graft versus host disease where the donor cells attack the patient's body.

 All patients will remain in the hospital for approximately 1 month, and will be followed with regular visits for up to 3 years with periodic visits thereafter to evaluate the success of the transplant and any side effects.
