(secondQuint)Granulocyte-macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor, Interferon and Interleukin-2 as Adjuvant Treatment for Renal Cancer.

 Patients with high-risk RCC have a dismal prognosis.

 To date, no effective adjuvant therapy exists for this patients category.

 We suggest that combination of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon alpha (IFN) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulate immune system from dendritic cells till cytotoxic T-lymphocytes step by step and eliminate residuary tumor cells.

 This prospective, non-randomized, phase II trial assessed low-dose GM-CSF, IFN and IL-2 postoperatively in patients with high-risk renal cell carcinoma.

This prospective study assesses toxicity and potential efficacy of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN) alpha and interleukin-2 (IL-2) postoperatively in patients with high-risk renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
