(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of TRU-016 Plus Bendamustine vs.

 Bendamustine in Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.

 This study consisted of two parts.

 The initial dose escalation stage was a Phase 1b study evaluating the safety and tolerability of two doses of TRU-016 administered in combination with bendamustine to patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

 In the randomized Phase 2 stage of the study, the efficacy and safety of the selected dose of 20 mg/kg TRU-016 combined with bendamustine was compared to bendamustine alone.

 The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TRU-016 and the development of antibodies to TRU-016 were evaluated in both phases of the study.
