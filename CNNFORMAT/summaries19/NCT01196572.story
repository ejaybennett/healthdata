(secondQuint)Efficiency of Cold vs.

 Laser Internal Urethrotomy Treatment of Urethral Strictures.

 The current surgical treatment for anterior urethral stricture includes internal urethrotomy (IU) by cold knife.

 Recurrence rate after such procedure is quoted as 35-70% in 2 to 5 years follow-up.

 Possible surgical alternative procedures include: open surgical urethral re-construction, urethral stents usage & laser IU.

 According to existing data (Nd-YAG laser- retrospective) the recurrence rate after laser IU is far better comparing to cold knife urethrotomy.

 The current research intends to address this question using prospective randomized methods.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether laser internal urethrotomy (IU) is as efficient as cold knife internal urethrotomy for treatment of anterior urethral strictures regarding post operative urination outflow, stricture recurrence rate and possible post- operative complications
