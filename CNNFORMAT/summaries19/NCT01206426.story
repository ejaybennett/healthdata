(thirdQuint)Genetic Determinants of Response to Neoadjuvant Cisplatin-based Chemotherapy in Urothelial Cancer.

 In this trial patients will submit germline (blood) and tumor tissue samples as part of two existing sample collection protocols for analysis of genetic and molecular markers governing response to chemotherapy.

 Pathologic review of tissue samples after neoadjuvant therapy will allow determination of the complete response rate (pT0 rate) and this will be compared between patients with "susceptible" and "resistant" genetic/molecular cisplatin susceptibility variants.

 Primary Endpoint: Analysis of whether a small set of previously-identified germline "cisplatin susceptibility" polymorphisms associate with achievement of a complete pathologic response to neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy in urothelial cancer patients.

 Secondary Endpoints: To perform companion genetic or molecular analyses of other previously-identified gene, SNP, or microRNA "cisplatin susceptibility" candidates in these patients, using tumor and/or germline tissue.

 Exploratory Endpoints: To perform unbiased, hypothesis-generating SNP, gene, or microRNA array studies to identify novel germline or tumor determinants which may predict response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

 Genetic Determinants of Response to Neoadjuvant Cisplatin-based Chemotherapy in Urothelial Cancer@highlight

This is observational clinical trial to study adult urothelial cancer patients treated with cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

 Hypothesis: Identification of genetic and molecular "cisplatin susceptibility" biomarkers will allow identification of urothelial cancer patients most likely to benefit from cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
