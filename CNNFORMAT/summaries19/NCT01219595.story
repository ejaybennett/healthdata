(thirdQuint)Cranberry Proanthocyanidins for Modification of Intestinal E.

 Coli Flora and Prevention of Urinary Tract Infections in UTI-Susceptible Women.

 This is a research study about the number and types of bacteria that cause urinary tract infections (E.

 coli strains) that are present in the intestine.

 The bacteria will be collected and analyzed before and after eating either sweetened, dried cranberries or strawberry fruit pieces.

 This study will help us learn more about whether or not the components of consumed sweetened, dried cranberries or strawberry fruit pieces reduce the numbers of harmful E.

 coli bacteria in the vaginal and intestinal tracts, thereby reducing the number of urinary tract infections among women.

The purpose of the research is to determine if eating sweetened, dried cranberries or strawberry fruit pieces will increase the types of different E.

 coli bacteria in the intestines which may reduce the likelihood of a major, or highly harmful urinary type of bacteria which cause urinary tract infections in susceptible women.
