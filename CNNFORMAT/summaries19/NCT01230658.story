(firstQuint)Prophylactic Enoxaparin Dosing in Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery Patients at St.

 Vincent Carmel.

 FDA-approved enoxaparin dosing for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is a fixed-dose regimen irrespective of body mass index (BMI) or actual body weight (ABW).

 Clinical trials suggest that dosing may be inadequate for obese patients.

 We plan to assess anti-factor-Xa concentrations in patients who received prophylactic enoxaparin after bariatric surgery.

 This prospective study will examine 150 anti-factor Xa concentrations from patients 18 years or older undergoing primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery at St.

 Vincent Carmel Bariatric Center of Excellence.

 Patients receive varying prophylactic enoxaparin regimens at the surgeon's discretion.

 Anti-factor-Xa concentrations are obtained at steady state.
