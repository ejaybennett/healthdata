(fifthQuint)Study to Evaluate Esmolol (Brevibloc) to Manage Cardiac Function in Patients With Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.

 Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains one of the most devastating forms of stroke.

 Over 25% of all stroke related potential years of life lost are from SAH.

 Outcomes are adversely affected by secondary ischemia from cerebral vasospasm, along with cardiac complications.

 Trials performed in patients with SAH have demonstrated benefit after the administration of beta blockers - reducing mortality nearly in half; but concerns over diminishing cerebral perfusion inhibited the widespread adoption of this therapy.

 Our specific aims are as follows: 1.

 To evaluate the clinical effect of esmolol treatment on cardiac systolic and diastolic function, along with cardiac electrophysiology; 2.

 To assess the effects of esmolol treatment on serum adrenergic and cardiac biomarkers; 3.

 To explore the safety of esmolol shortly after SAH.

 The primary outcome will be change in systolic function - ejection fraction by Simpson's rule (baseline versus Day 7 +/- 2 after SAH).

 Study to Evaluate Esmolol (Brevibloc) to Manage Cardiac Function in Patients With Subarachnoid Hemorrhage@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical effect of esmolol treatment on cardiac function and electrophysiology; to assess the effects of esmolol treatment on serum adrenergic and cardiac biomarkers; to explore the safety of esmolol treatment shortly after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

 Patients will be followed for a maximum of 1 month after the index SAH.

 The primary outcome will be change in systolic function - ejection fraction by Simpson's rule (baseline versus Day 7 +/- 2 after SAH).
