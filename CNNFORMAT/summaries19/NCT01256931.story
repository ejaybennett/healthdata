(thirdQuint)Antibody Levels Against 2009 Influenza A H1N1 One Year After Vaccination With Pandemrix and 2010 Fluarix Booster in Organ Transplant Recipients.

.

 Organ transplant patients and staff members of the Transplant Institute who were vaccinated 2009 and received 2 doses of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine (Pandemrix) will be asked to participate in the study.

 Serum samples will be collected approximately one year after completed vaccination with Pandemrix and analysed for haemagglutination -inhibiting antibodies against H1N1.

The frequency of individuals with remaining protective titers will be examined.

 The same individuals will be vaccinated with Fluarix containing antigen from Influenza A California/7/2009(H1N1, A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008.

 The booster effect will be measured one month later.
