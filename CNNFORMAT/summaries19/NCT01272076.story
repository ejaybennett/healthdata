(secondQuint)Cirrus HD-OCT Measurement of Area of Increased Light Penetration Under the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE).

 Specific Objectives: 1.

 To compare Cirrus HD-OCT automated measurements of the illumination area under the RPE to expert manual measurements of areas of hypofluorescence typical of geographic atrophy in fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images.

 2.

 To describe the differences and similarities between Cirrus HD-OCT and fundus autofluorescence images of subjects with geographic atrophy secondary to dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

 3.

 To determine the clinical factors that affect the Cirrus HD-OCT automated measurements of the illumination area under the RPE.
