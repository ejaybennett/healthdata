(fifthQuint)Hormone Therapy Or Chemotherapy Before Surgery Based on Gene Expression Analysis in Treating Patients With Breast Cancer.

 Assessed the feasibility of carrying out a large-scale multi-center trial in which recurrence score (RS) was used to select treatment type in the neoadjuvant setting.

 Whether patients with intermediate RS were willing to be randomized between hormonal and chemotherapy.

 The treatment received was not experimental and considered standard treatment for the type of cancer the participants had.

 What was experimental included the way in which they were assigned to a type of treatment.

 The design of this study was used to help determine if RS can be used to predict which type of treatment women with breast cancer are most likely to benefit from.

 OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups based on RS following Oncotype Dx gene expression profiling.

 - GROUP 1 (RS 25): Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy as in group 2 arm 2.

 All patients undergo surgery and receive hormonal therapy for at least 5 years.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

 Hormone Therapy Or Chemotherapy Before Surgery Based on Gene Expression Analysis in Treating Patients With Breast Cancer@highlight

This randomized pilot clinical trial studied whether the Oncotype DX gene expression "Recurrence Score" (RS) would be useful for helping make a decision about which type of pre-operative treatment, hormone therapy or chemotherapy would be a better for patients with hormone responsive cancers that were not suitable for breast conserving surgery.

 The RS is currently used to predict the risk of distant recurrence and the benefit of the addition of chemotherapy to hormonal therapy in the adjuvant setting.
