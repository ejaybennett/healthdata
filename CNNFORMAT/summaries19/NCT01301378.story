(firstQuint)Patch Graft Material Safety and Effectiveness in Covering Glaucoma Drainage Device Tube.

 This study compares patients who will undergo Molteno 3 shunt implant surgery with 1 group receiving KeraSys patch graft and the 2nd group receiving Tutoplast patch graft.

 The investigators will examine the efficacy and safety of KeraSys in comparison with Tutoplast and monitor the long term effectiveness for preventing tube erosion in Molteno 3 tube shunt surgery for 1 year.
