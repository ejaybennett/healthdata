(fifthQuint)A Study of TRU-016 in Combination With Rituximab and Bendamustine in Subjects With Relapsed Indolent Lymphoma.

 This study was planned to be conducted in 2 parts: a Phase 1b component designed to determine a safe dosing regimen, and a Phase 2 component designed to evaluate the efficacy of BRT compared to BR in subjects with relapsed indolent lymphoma.

 The Phase 2 component was not conducted.

 This was an open-label, non randomized, multiple-dose escalation study to determine the MTD of BRT and to determine a safe dosing regimen for the combination in subjects with relapsed indolent lymphoma.

 The study consisted of a screening period lasting up to 21 days, a treatment period lasting up to 6 cycles (28 days each), and a 60-day follow-up period.

 Up to 12 subjects (2 cohorts of 6 subjects each) were planned for enrollment.

 Two dose levels (10 and 20 mg/kg) of TRU-016 combined with rituximab 375 mg/m2 and bendamustine 90 mg/m2 were evaluated during up to 6 cycles (28 days each).

 TRU-016 was administered by intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle.

 Rituximab was administered by IV infusion on Day 2 of each cycle.

 Bendamustine was administered by IV infusion on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle.

 Subjects received study treatment for up to 6 cycles.

 A Study of TRU-016 in Combination With Rituximab and Bendamustine in Subjects With Relapsed Indolent Lymphoma@highlight

This was a Phase 1 multicenter study of bendamustine, rituximab and TRU-016 (BRT) in subjects with relapsed indolent B-cell lymphoma.

 This was a multiple-dose escalation study to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of TRU-016 given in combination with rituximab and bendamustine and to determine a safe dosing regimen for the combination in up to 12 subjects with relapsed indolent lymphoma.

 The originally planned Phase 2 portion, an open-label, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy of BRT compared with BR, was not conducted.
