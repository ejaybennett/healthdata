(fifthQuint)Dexmedetomidine and Propofol in Children With History of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

 Patients with OSA are at risk for airway obstruction (a condition that makes it difficult to breath) during sedation and anesthesia.

 Dexmedetomidine and propofol are safe and effective drugs regularly used by anesthesiologists.

 These drugs are used to put patients to sleep for operations and certain studies like MRI scans.

 However, there have been no studies describing the effects these drugs have on the upper airway of children, adolescents, and young adults with OSA.

The purpose of this research study is to examine the effects of two commonly used anesthetic drugs, dexmedetomidine and propofol, have on the shape and muscle tone of the upper airway in children, adolescents, and young adults with a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) having an MRI scan.

 The results of this study will help in making the best decisions regarding the anesthesia medications that are most appropriate for children, adolescents, and young adults with OSA during MRI studies.
