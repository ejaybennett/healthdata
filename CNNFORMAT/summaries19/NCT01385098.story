(fifthQuint)Efficacy of Vitamin D Supplementation in Bariatric Surgery Patients.

 The prospective pilot study is designed to evaluate vitamin D status pre-operatively and post-operatively in 37 female patients undergoing either Roux-en Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy at The Methodist Hospital with 32 patients expecting to complete the 12 week trial.

 Women scheduled for either of these two types of bariatric surgery will be considered for inclusion in the pilot study.

 Based on previous research experience at The Methodist Hospital, the majority of bariatric patients are women.

 No children are treated at the Methodist Hospital bariatric center.

 Subjects will be excluded if they have evidence of vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D 2.

63 mmol/L), hypocalcemia (calcium 70 ng/L.

 An increase in serum intact PTH level will be taken to be indicative of a possible negative calcium balance or a vitamin D deficiency (or both).

 Hypercalcemia will be defined as calcium > 2.

63 mmol/L.

 Statistical analysis: Primary Hypothesis: Daily supplementation with 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 for 12 weeks will significantly increase mean serum 25(OH)D levels in obese subjects following bariatric surgery compared to baseline levels.

 Secondary Hypothesis: The percent response above baseline to daily supplementation with 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 will significantly differ between Roux-en Y and sleeve gastrectomy patients.

 Subject Withdrawal: Participants will be withdrawn from the study if serum 25(OH)D levels are identified as within the deficient range so that the patient can receive needed treatment.

 A vitamin D deficiency will be defined as 25(OH)D concentrations less than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and vitamin D insufficiency as 21 to 29 ng/mL.

 In addition, if an abnormally high level of 25(OH)D is obtained (200 ng/mL or 500 nmol/L), we will have the 25(OH)D measurement repeated.

 If the second test is confirmed to be high, then we will withdraw that particular patient from the study for medical follow-up.

 If we find a trend of excess vitamin D among participants, however, we will re-evaluate and consider termination of the study.

 Efficacy of Vitamin D Supplementation in Bariatric Surgery Patients@highlight

As the use of bariatric surgery for treatment of extreme obesity adults continues to rise, clinicians must be aware of pre-existing nutritional deficiencies in overweight and obese patients.

 Nutritional deficiencies are common in patients undergoing bariatric surgery and these deficiencies should be detected and addressed early to avoid post-operative complications.

 To improve long-term outcomes following bariatric surgery, nutritional screening and prescribing appropriate supplementation to prevent nutrient deficiencies is needed.

 Vitamin D deficiency is common following bariatric surgery and has been reported to occur in 50-80% bariatric patients.

The goal of this pilot study is to help develop nutrient supplementation interventions following two types of bariatric surgery: Roux-en Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy.

 Recently, several studies in adults have revealed an inverse relationship between body fat and blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D] levels, the relevant marker of low vitamin D status.

 Although vitamin D is well known for its essential role in bone metabolism and calcium homeostasis, increasing evidence is linking vitamin D to obesity.

 This study will evaluate vitamin D status during post operative daily supplementation of 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 and 1500 mg of calcium through assessment of changes in serum 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphorus at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks following surgery.

 The dietary contribution of vitamin D and calcium will be estimated by food records analyzed using the University of Minnesota 2010 Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR) program.

 Primary Hypothesis: Daily supplementation with 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 for 12 weeks will significantly increase mean serum 25(OH)D levels in obese subjects following bariatric surgery compared to baseline levels.

 Secondary Hypothesis: The percent response above baseline to daily supplementation with 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 will significantly differ between Roux-en Y and sleeve gastrectomy patients.
