(fifthQuint)Behavioral Intervention for Minority Adolescent Women.

 African-and Mexican-American adolescent women with a current STI and history of abuse will be identified at public health and STI clinics within the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District system.

 Women who agree to participate and give informed consent will be randomized into the intervention or control arm.

 Women in the control arm will be interviewed at baseline, be given a targeted physical exam including a STI/HIV screen, pap smear and contraception counseling and will receive abuse and enhanced clinical counseling.

 Women in the intervention arm will be interviewed at baseline, given a targeted physical exam including a STI/HIV screen, pap smear and contraception counseling and enrolled in the intervention.

 Women in the intervention arm will be interviewed and examined again after completing the intervention, to establish a post-intervention baseline.

 All women in the study will be followed over one year, with follow-up interviews including an inquiry about any Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and a targeted physical exams and contraception counseling at 6 and 12 months.

 During the study period, women will be encouraged to return to the study clinic for problem visits if they suspect they have been infected with a STI or require contraception or abuse counseling.

 All analyses of intervention effects will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis.

 Behavioral Intervention for Minority Adolescent Women@highlight

The purpose of this Stage II clinical trial is to test the efficacy of a culturally sensitive, cognitive-behavioral intervention to reduce sexual risk behavior among minority adolescents for prevention of sexually transmitted infection (STI/HIV), unintended pregnancy and abuse by changing high-risk sexual behaviors, decreasing substance use and encouraging contraceptive use.

 Its primary goal is to expand risk-reduction interventions created in previous studies to further increase intervention efficacy for this particularly vulnerable, high-risk group.

 An adolescent intervention has been created and pilot tested in developmental studies.

 Results indicated reductions in substance use, risk behaviors, unintended pregnancy, STI and abuse without reports of adverse outcomes.

 Specific aims of the current study include: 1) To obtain a more in-depth understanding of configurations of psychosocial and situational factors associated with high-risk sexual behavior, substance use, STI/HIV and contraceptive use among abused minority adolescent women with STI; 2) To implement a controlled randomized trial of a cognitive behavioral risk-reduction intervention consisting of 2 small group sessions, 2 individual counseling and 3 support groups for this group; 3) To evaluate the effects of the adolescent intervention model versus enhanced counseling for this group on AIDS Risk Reduction Model (ARRM)-related constructs, high-risk sexual behavior, substance use, abuse recurrence, contraceptive use, unintended pregnancy and STI/HIV at 6 and 12 months follow-up.

 Participants will include a convenience sample of 600 Mexican-and African American adolescent women, aged 14-18 years with a history of sexual or physical abuse and current STI.
