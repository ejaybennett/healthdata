(secondQuint)A Phase 3 Study of 99mTC-EC-DG SPECT/CT Versus PET/CT in Lung Cancer.

 1.

 To demonstrate that SPECT/CT (99mTc EC DG) is not inferior to PET/CT (18F FDG PET/CT) for sensitivity or specificity measures when image interpretation of primary and metastatic lesions are compared against a truth standard in patients with a high likelihood of lung cancer.

 2.

 To expand the patient safety experience using 99mTc EC DG.

 A Phase 3 Study of 99mTC-EC-DG SPECT/CT Versus PET/CT in Lung Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if the images of the primary lesions of lung cancer and any metastatic lesions seen from the investigational SPECT/CT 99mTC-EC-DG scans are the same as the PET/CT 18F-FDG scans.
