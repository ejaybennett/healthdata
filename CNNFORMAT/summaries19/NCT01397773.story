(thirdQuint)Pentraxin-3 in Chronic Renal Failure.

 The investigators planned to involve four group of patients: Hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, pre-dialysis and the control group; with about 25 patients planned to be involved in each group.

 The laboratory parameters to be measured are Pentraxin-3, C-reactive protein (CRP), high sensitive CRP, fibrinogen and interleukin-6.

 Concomitantly, carotis intima media thickness will be measured in the radiology clinic.

 Statistical analysis will be carried on by Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows 13.

0.

 The variables acting on the inflammatory parameters and the correlation between them and carotis intima media thickness will be studied.
