(thirdQuint)Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) With Concurrent Boost for Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.

 Standard external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer involves several weeks of daily treatment sessions.

 Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a newer form of EBRT that gives fewer treatments but higher doses of radiation per treatment.

 In many patients there are certain areas within the prostate with more prominent cancerous growth (intraprostatic lesions), which may require higher doses of radiation (boost) to treat effectively.

 This study will treat the prostate with simultaneous boost(s) to intraprostatic lesion(s) in 5 treatments over 10-14 days.

 Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) With Concurrent Boost for Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with simultaneous boost (higher radiation dose) to areas within the prostate with more prominent cancerous growth (intraprostatic lesions) utilizing intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) planning techniques is a safe and effective treatment in patients with low- and intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer.
