(thirdQuint)Agitation in the Acute Psychiatric Department.

 The patients are assessed with three rating scales (Components of agitation, The PANSS-EC, The Broset Violence Checklist) measuring agitation at admittance and day three thus providing a measurement of the differences during three days of in-patient stay.

 Therapeutic measures and interventions taken are assessed daily with a 18-item checklist.

 Threatening and violent incidents are recorded with The SOAS-R.

 Blood samples for immunological parameters are taken at admittance and discharge giving opportunity to assess changes through the acute psychiatric condition.

 Urine and blood samples are taken at admittance to assess substance use and medications.

 The patients are assess with two self-rating VAS-scales at discharge assessing the suicidal intentions they have had during the stay, aspects of clinical history and assessment for personality disorders.

 Agitation in the Acute Psychiatric Department@highlight

Agitation is associated with a number of acute psychiatric conditions, and frequent in acute psychiatric admissions.

 It is associated with violence towards others, and strongly associated with in-patient suicides.

 The main aims of the study are to assess different clinical presentations of agitation at admittance, and to assess the consequences of these different clinical presentations during the first three days of the stay.
