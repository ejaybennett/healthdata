(secondQuint)A Comparative Effectiveness Study Evaluating the Effects of Thermogenic Supplements on Body Composition.

 In a previous randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled pilot study, subjects taking the nutritional supplements contained in these two weight loss plans had a short-term statistically significant increase in their resting metabolic rates as compared to taking a placebo.

 No increases were found in blood pressure, resting heart rate, or self-reported discomfort when taking the supplement.

 The current study was designed to extend the findings of the pilot study over a 60-day study period using a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled protocol with the same weight loss interventions.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether subjects taking a supplement designed to increase metabolic rate will have a positive effect on body composition (fat mass, muscle mass, and bone density.
