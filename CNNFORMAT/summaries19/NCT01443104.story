(fifthQuint)Sirolimus-eluting Stents With Biodegradable Polymer Versus an Everolimus-eluting Stents.

 Background Coronary artery stents have improved the safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary interventions compared with balloon angioplasty alone (New Engl J Med 1994; 331:489-495).

 Notwithstanding, restenosis is still encountered in 20 to 30% of lesions after implantation of bare metal stents (JAMA 2000; 284:1828-36) and may require repeat revascularization procedures with a negative impact on quality of life and health care expenditures.

 Drug-eluting stents with local, controlled release of therapeutic agents have addressed this problem successfully (Circulation 2003; 107:3003-7).

 Current drug-eluting stents consist of a metallic stent platform and a therapeutic agent, which is either directly immobilized on the stent surface or released from a polymer matrix.

 Polymers currently utilized for drug-eluting stents are either biodegradable or non-biodegradable.

 While biodegradable polymers are released together with the drug and dissolve after a certain period of time, non-biodegradable polymers reside permanently on the stent surface.

 First-generation drug-eluting stents utilized sirolimus and paclitaxel for prevention of restenosis.

 Both drugs are highly lipophilic and show rapid and strong uptake in arterial wall tissue.

 In addition, Sirolimus (Circulation 2001; 104:852-5) and paclitaxel (Circulation 1997; 96:636-45) have been shown to reduce smooth muscle cell proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia, the principal cause of restenosis after coronary stenting in experimental models.

 A polymer-encapsulated stent releasing Sirolimus has been compared with the respective bare metal stent in several randomized clinical trials, demonstrating a consistent reduction in angiographic and clinical restenosis (N Engl J Med 2002; 346:1773-80).

 Similarly, a polymer-based, paclitaxel-eluting stent consistently reduced restenosis and the need for repeated revascularization procedures compared with the respective bare metal stent (N Engl J Med 2004; 350:221-31).

 A meta-analysis of drug-eluting stent trials confirmed the reduction in restenosis and repeat revascularization procedures for polymer-based, drug-eluting stents (Lancet 2004; 364:583-91).

 Moreover, the rates of death and myocardial infarction were comparable to those with bare metal stents, attesting to the safety of these devices, which have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

 Newer generation drug-eluting stents with durable polymer coating utilize Limus analogues such as everolimus, zotarolimus or novolimus.

 Everolimus-eluting stents have been compared to first-generation drug-eluting stents in several randomized clinical trials.

 A pooled analysis of the four largest randomized trials to date comparing everolimus-eluting stents with paclitaxel-eluting stents demonstrated a lower rate of MACE (4.

Coronary artery stents have improved the safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention for coronary artery disease.

 Drug-eluting stents have been shown to decrease neointimal hyperplasia and to reduce the rate of restenosis and target-lesion revascularization as compared to bare-metal stents.

 Drug-eluting stents consist of a metallic platform and a therapeutic substance that is usually released from a polymer matrix.

 A previous study utilizing a bioresorbable polymer has demonstrated a favorable safety and efficacy profile in a large-scale clinical trial as compared to a first-generation druf-eluting stent (LEADERS trial).

 The objective of the study is to compare the safety and efficacy of a sirolimus-eluting stent with a biodegradable polymer with an everolimus-eluting stent with a durable polymer in a prospective multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in routine clinical practice.
