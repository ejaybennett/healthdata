(secondQuint)Effect of Rapid Transfusion With Fluid Management System 2000 (FMS).

 FMS is a standard equipment to prepare for the massive bleeding during the liver transplant surgery.

 This device usually delivers a mixture of red blood cell (RBC), fresh frozen plasma and normal saline.

 Rapid infusion of RBC is known to result in the increase of potassium and the decrease of calcium in the plasma of the patient.

 However there is no report about the consequence of rapid transfusion of the blood mixture in the reservoir of the FMS, especially in the liver transplantation recipients.

 The primary end point of this study is to investigate the change in the plasma potassium and to assess the possibility of hyperkalemia and related morbidity.

 Changes of blood pH and plasma calcium will also be sought.

 Effect of Rapid Transfusion With Fluid Management System 2000 (FMS)@highlight

Rapid infusion of red blood cells is known to result in the increase of plasma potassium.

 The researchers are trying to investigate the change in plasma potassium during rapid infusion of mixed blood components in the reservoir of the fluid management system (FMS) in liver transplant recipients.
