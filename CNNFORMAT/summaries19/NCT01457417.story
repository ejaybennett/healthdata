(thirdQuint)A Study of DKN-01 in Multiple Myeloma or Advanced Solid Tumors.

 Part A of this trial consists of 4 treatment arms of DKN-01.

 It is a dose escalation study in patients with multiple myeloma or advanced solid tumors.

 Patients must be refractory or intolerant to all standard/approved therapy(ies).

 At each dose level, 3 subjects will be treated.

 If none of the 3 subjects develop a dose limiting toxicity after a minimum of 4 weeks of treatment, subsequent dose escalation will proceed according to the same schedule.
