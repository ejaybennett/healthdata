(thirdQuint)Immune Therapy of HPV-induced Cancers.

 The present study is initiated to evaluate vaccination with P16_37-63 -peptide in patients with advanced HPV- and p16INK4a -positive cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal or head and neck cancer.

 Specifically, the present study aims at the following questions: - Evaluation of potential toxicity of the vaccination with P16_37-63 -peptide - Evaluation of the immune response in patients with advanced HPV- and p16INK4a-positive cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal or head and neck cancer before vaccination and after vaccination with P16_37-63.

 In this context, the present study shall demonstrate whether application of P16_37-63 in a vaccination approach is associated with the induction of peptide-related toxicity.

 Hence, the study marks the first step towards the application of P16_37-63 in humans, as it provides information on the safety of P16_37-63 as vaccination agent for the first time.

 Moreover, the study shall provide initial information, whether vaccination with P16_37-63 can induce p16INK4a -specific immune responses in patients with advanced HPV- and p16INK4a -positive cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal or head and neck cancer.

 Thus, it shall provide information, whether P16_37-63 has the potential to elicit peptide-specific immune responses and therefore represent a suitable target for the induction of tumor antigen-specific immune responses in this population.

 The present study marks an important milestone towards a potential application of P16_37-63 as therapeutic agent in the management of patients with advanced HPV- and p16INK4a -positive cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal or head and neck cancer.

 Long-term goal of this approach is to develop novel tools for the palliative and/or adjuvant therapy of patients with advanced advanced HPV- and p16INK4a -positive tumors.

 Immune Therapy of HPV-induced Cancers@highlight

Patients with advanced HPV- and p16INK4a-positive cancers will receive the peptide P16_37-63 in combination with Montanide(R) ISA-51 VG so that an immune response directed against the tumor cells can be induced.

 The aim is to show that vaccination with P16_37-63 is safe and can induce or enhance immune responses against p16INK4a.
