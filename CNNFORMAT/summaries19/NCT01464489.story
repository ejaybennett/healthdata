(firstQuint)Intubation Time With Low Dose Rocuronium.

 The investigators hypothesized that increasing the cardiac output by use of atropine in children might result in a reduction of the intubation time needed to facilitate tracheal intubation.

 Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine TimeEI with a low dose of esmeron (rocuronium) (0.

3 mg.

kg-1) for achievement of successful tracheal intubation conditions during intravenous (i.

v.

) anaesthesia using propofol and alfentanil in children and to determine whether administration of i.

v.

 atropine (atropine sulphate) (10 1/2g.

kg-1) during anaesthesia induction reduced these times.
