(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate CDX-301 (rhuFlt3L) in Healthy Volunteers.

 A total of seven cohorts of healthy volunteers are planned with doses of CDX-301 (rhuFlt3L) ranging between 1 and 75 1/2g/kg and dosing durations between 5 and 10 days.

 Volunteers will be admitted to an inpatient unit during the Treatment Period.

 Blood samples will be collected periodically to assess the effect of CDX-301.

 Volunteers will be followed for safety for 28 days following the last dose.

 Any volunteer who develops anti-CDX-301 antibodies will be followed monthly until the antibody response is below the limit of detection.

 In general, the total duration of the study will be between approximately 33-38 days.
