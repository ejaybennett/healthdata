(secondQuint)Oral Contraceptives, Insulin Resistance and Cardiovascular Risk Profile in Pre-Menopausal Women.

 The oral contraceptive pill is the most commonly used birth control method.

 It is debated whether the birth control pill affects how the body handles insulin and sugar, or whether the pill changes heart disease risk.

 The goal of this study is to evaluate whether certain factors, such as how the body processes hormones, and demographic factors (e.

g.

 body weight and race), influence how the pill affects the handling of insulin and sugar, and heart health.
