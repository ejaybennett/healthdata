(secondQuint)A Study of the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (What the Body Does to the Drug), and Pharmacodynamics (What the Drug Does to the Body) of CNTO 1959 Following a Single Subcutaneous (Under the Skin) Administration in Japanese Participants With Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis.

 This is a randomized (participants are assigned to treatment groups by chance), double-blind (participants and study personnel know what study agents are given), placebo-controlled (a placebo is a treatment identical in appearance to CNTO 1959 but does not contain active drug), single-dose study.

 The study will include 24 participants: 4 groups of at least 6 participants each.

 If it is decided that additional data are needed to define the safety and tolerability of CNTO 1959, an additional group may be enrolled.

 A given dose level may be repeated in newly enrolled participants, or a lower or intermediate dose may be administered based on preliminary data.

 The total duration of participation will be approximately 30 weeks, which includes a screening period of up to 6 weeks before the administration of study agent.

 Participant safety will be monitored.

 Ascending doses of 10, 30, 100, and 300 mg dose of CNTO 1959 and placebo will be administered as single SC injections; however, 2 SC injections may be required for the 300 mg dose level.

 Dosing will be performed for 24 weeks.

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of CNTO 1959 following a single subcutaneous (SC, under the skin) dose administered to Japanese participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
