(secondQuint)Cardioband Adjustable Annuloplasty System for Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Repair.

 The current state of the art management of severe mitral regurgitation is surgical mitral valve repair, either with open chest surgery or mini-thoracotomy.

 However, standard surgical approaches requiring cardiopulmonary bypass are reserved to fit patients with low or moderate surgical risk, and thus several patients are refused surgery because of unfavorable risk-benefit balance.

 Cardioband is an adjustable annuloplasty band designed for mitral valve repair by a transfemoral delivery system.

 Cardioband is intended to remodel the annulus by deployment and fixation along (and direct) the posterior annulus of the mitral valve, in order to correct mitral regurgitation.

 Adjustment can be performed on a beating heart, to optimize correction of mitral regurgitation.
