(firstQuint)A Protocol to Wean From Noninvasive Mechanical Ventilation.

 Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial, with 2 groups: study (protocol weaning group) and control (clinicians' order weaning group).

 Setting: Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU).

 Subjects: Patients >18 yr, noninvasive mechanical ventilation >24 hours.

 Interventions and measurements: Study group (weaning as the protocol) and control group (weaning as the clinicians' order); recording of clinical variables at admission and during RICU stay, and end-point variables (noninvasive mechanical ventilation day, RICU and hospital stay, RICU mortality.

 Expected results: the protocol group's noninvasive mechanical ventilation days is less than clinicians' order group.
