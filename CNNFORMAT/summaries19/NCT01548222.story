(firstQuint)CGM Evaluation of Glucose Excursions in Basal Insulin Treated T2DM at Fasting Glucose Target.

 In many clinical trials, basal insulin is titrated to only a fasting glucose goal.

 The usual final dose is >0.

4U/kg.

 In carefully CGM monitored/titrated studies in both basal insulin alone or in pump-treated T2DM, we have found the basal insulin dose to be <0.

3U/kg.

 This suggests that if guided by a single daily fasting glucose, titration may result in an excessive basal dose.

 This study will examine that issue.

This is a trial to determine if patients who are well controlled and on basal insulin are treated with excessive basal dose.
