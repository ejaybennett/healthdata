(thirdQuint)Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy With Cisplatin and Gemcitabine to Treat Locally Advanced Cervical Carcinoma.

 Many studies have investigated multiagent chemotherapy as a means of intensifying treatment.

 The results of such trials indicate that gemcitabine has considerable activity against cervical cancer when given with cisplatin/RT, however, it is quite toxic.

 The predominant toxicities are gastrointestinal and hematologic.

 Methods to reduce gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity during chemoradiotherapy could mitigate this toxicity and take advantage of the therapeutic benefits of gemcitabine IMRT is an advanced radiation therapy delivery technique that reduces the amount of radiation given to normal tissues and may therefore reduce unwanted side effects.

 IMRT tries to lower the amount of radiation that normal tissues receive, while still delivering the desired amount of radiation to the cancer cells and other areas, such as lymph nodes.

 IMRT does this by using computers to design the best way to aim radiation at the tumor(s), while still delivering a radiation dose comparable to standard radiation.

The primary objective of the study is to identify the highest dose of gemcitabine that can be given safely with cisplatin and pelvic intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in women with locally advanced cervical cancer.

 The investigators hypothesis is that IMRT will reduce gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity, permitting escalating doses of gemcitabine to be feasibly delivered in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.
