(thirdQuint)The Use of Prophylactic Hemoclips in the Endoscopic Resection of Large Pedunculated Polyps.

 The methods for preventing post-polypectomy bleeding (PPB) are not standardised and there are groups that use hemoclips for this purpose.

 The aim of our study is to analyze whether the use of hemoclips reduces PPB complications.

 It is a prospective, randomised study of patients with pedunculated polyps larger than 10mm.

 The patients were included in two groups (hemoclip before polypectomy -HC- and standard polypectomy -SP-).
