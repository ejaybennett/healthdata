(secondQuint)Liposomal Cytarabine in the Treatment of Central Nervous System Resistant or Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children.

 Liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte) is a new formulation of the drug cytarabine, a drug commonly used in the treatment of ALL.

 This formulation of the drug can be given intrathecally (into the spinal fluid), and is released slowly over a longer period, about two weeks.

 This allows a longer exposure of the drug to the central nervous system, and requires fewer intrathecal injections for the patient.
