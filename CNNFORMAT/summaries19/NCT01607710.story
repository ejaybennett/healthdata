(fifthQuint)Locating Regions of Interest in Generalized Anxiety Disorder Using Function Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).

 20 healthy controls and 20 participants with GAD will be recruited.

 Each participant will undergo an MRI session that will last approximately 2 hours.

 The structural MRI will be used when the participant is at rest.

 During the functional MRI (fMRI), a computer screen inside the scanner will display four tasks the participant must complete: (1)Gambling Task, (2)Risk & Ambiguity Task, (3)Reading Emotion from the Eyes (REE) Task, and (4)Emotional Counting Task.

 Locating Regions of Interest in Generalized Anxiety Disorder Using Function Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)@highlight

The investigators are seeking to locate the brain regions of interest in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using both structural (sMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

 The MRI will be used to measure changes in blood flow in the brain while at rest and while completing tasks designed to elicit symptoms of anxiety.

 Results from a nonclinical control group and a GAD group will be compared to determine whether they exhibit different areas of brain activity during the tasks.
