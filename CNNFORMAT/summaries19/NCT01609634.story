(firstQuint)New Infant Formula Trial in Healthy Term Subjects on Growth, Body Composition, Tolerance and Safety.

 This is a "best after breast design" to measure the effect of this new infant formula in healthy term subjects on growth, body composition, tolerance and safety including immune status, gut microbiota, and early indicators (markers) of disease.

 These markers will be explored if they could predict the risk of eczema and other allergic disease, and to evaluate if these markers are influenced by early nutrition.
