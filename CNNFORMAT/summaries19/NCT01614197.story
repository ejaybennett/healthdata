(secondQuint)A Trial of Temsirolimus With Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide in Children With Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma.

 Studies have shown that mTOR inhibitors (MTI) inhibit growth of pre-B and T-cell ALL cell lines in vitro and in ALL xenograft models.

 The MTI temsirolimus was chosen for use in this study due to its weekly intravenous dosing, its more predictable blood levels, and availability of a single-agent pediatric MTD and its sustained biologic effect due to conversion to sirolimus.

 This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of temsirolimus that can given in combination with dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide and etoposide in relapsed ALL, LL or PTL.

 A standard 3-patient cohort dose-escalation design will be used.

 Response to treatment will be evaluated.

 Biology tests will be done to evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD), temsirolimus' effect on glucocorticoid resistance, and mTOR inhibition.

This is a phase I study of temsirolimus (Torisel) combined with dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide and etoposide in patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) or peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTL).
