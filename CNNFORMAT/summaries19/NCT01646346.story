(secondQuint)4D Image-Guided Partial Breast Radiation in Stage 0 and l Breast Cancer.

 This is a pilot study enrolling about 30 patients to evaluate the feasibility of using 4D CT and daily image guidance in Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) to decrease set-up error and individualized planning target volumes to limit the non-target breast tissue dose.

 The two specific breasts constraints which shall be decreased are the V50 (percent volume of breast receiving 50% of the prescribed dose) and the V100 (percent volume of breast receiving 100% of the prescribed dose).

 The goal will be to decrease these to 45% and 23.

5% respectively, which is down 33% from the NSABP B39 standard of 60% and 35%.

The Purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using image guidance and four-dimensional computed tomography to reduce the volume of non target breast tissue that is treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation via the external beam technique.
