(thirdQuint)A Phase II Study of Crenolanib in Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients With FLT3 Activating Mutations.

 This is a Phase II open label study of crenolanib besylate.

 This study will enroll subjects with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with FLT3 activating mutations.

 Two cohorts of patients will be enrolled: those whose AML has recurred after prior chemotherapy without a FLT3 TKI, and those whose AML has progressed after prior therapy with FLT3 TKIs.

 Subjects will take Crenolanib besylate at 100 mg TID until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicities.

 Concurrent hydroxyurea is permitted during the first 28 days of study therapy.

 A Phase II Study of Crenolanib in Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients With FLT3 Activating Mutations@highlight

This pilot Phase II study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of crenolanib in two cohorts of AML patients with FLT3 activation mutations (patients whose leukemia has recurred after prior chemotherapy not including a FLT3 TKI and patients whose leukemia has progressed after prior therapy with a FLT3 TKI).
