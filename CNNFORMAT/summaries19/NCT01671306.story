(thirdQuint)The Association Between Monocyte Subsets and Coronary Collateral Development in Diabetes Mellitus.

 83 diabetic patients with severe coronary artery disease were enrolled in the study.

 These patients were investigated according to their collateral development.

 Monocytes and their subtypes, namely CD14++CD16- and CD14+CD16+ cells were compared in 2 groups.

 The Association Between Monocyte Subsets and Coronary Collateral Development in Diabetes Mellitus@highlight

Monocyte heterogeneity in peripheral blood seems to be important in coronary collateral development in non-diabetic patients with stable coronary artery disease.

 Our aim in this study is to find out any possible relationship between the levels of circulating monocyte subsets and coronary collateral development in type 2 diabetic patients.
