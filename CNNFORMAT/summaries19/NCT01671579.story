(secondQuint)Comparison of Bowel Ultrasound & MR Enterography in the Follow-up of Previously Diagnosed Pediatric Small Bowel Crohn Disease.

 25-30% of individuals with Crohn disease present during childhood or adolescence, and the incidence is rising.

 MRE (magnetic resonance enterography) is considered the standard of care for imaging of pediatric small bowel Crohn's disease.

 Bowel ultrasound is an emerging technology for bowel assessment and offers several advantages over MRE, including lower cost, shorter exam time, and lack of need for sedation and contrast materials and bowel medication.

 The researchers goal is to assess the accuracy of bowel ultrasound in the follow-up of known pediatric small bowel Crohn disease using MRE and the reference standard.

To establish the accuracy of bowel ultrasound in the follow-up of known (previously diagnosed) pediatric small bowel Crohn disease, using MR Enterography (magnetic resonance imaging technology used to obtain detailed images of the small bowel) as the reference standard.
