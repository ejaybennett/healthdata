(fifthQuint)A Phase 1, Open-Label, Dose-Escalation & Expanded Cohort, Continuous IV Infusion, Multi-center Study of the Safety, Tolerability,PK & PD of EPZ-5676 in Treatment Relapsed/Refractory Patients With Leukemias Involving.

 A subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) harbor rearrangements of the MLL gene, which are detected either by cytogenetic or fluorescent in situ hybridization evaluation at the time of diagnosis.

 A protein called DOT1L plays an important role in the malignant process in these leukemias.

 EPZ-5676 is a molecule that blocks the activity of DOT1L, and is therefore being evaluated in the treatment of patients with MLL-rearranged leukemias.

 The dose escalation portion has been completed.

 Currently this study is in the expansion phase and patients with MLL-r and MLL-PTD will receive EPZ-5676 as a 28-day continuous intravenous infusion (CIV).

The purpose of this study is to determine the safe dose of EPZ-5676, to evaluate the safety of EPZ-5676 in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, and to conduct a preliminary assessment of the anti-leukemia activity of EPZ-5676 in patients with acute leukemias bearing rearrangements of the MLL gene.

 Currently this study is in the MLL-r restricted/expansion phase and is only enrolling patients with rearrangements involving the MLL gene, including 11q23 or partial tandem duplications (PTD).
