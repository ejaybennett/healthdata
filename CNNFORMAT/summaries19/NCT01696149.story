(secondQuint)Effects of High and Low Frequency TENS on Sympathetic Skin Response and Skin Temperature.

 15 healthy subjects (8 females, 7 males) with a mean age of 22.

6 3.

7 years participated in this study.

 All subjects participated, randomly, in a 4 Hz TENS session, a 110 Hz TENS session, and a control (off-TENS) session.

 Each session consisted of a 20- minute stimulation period and a 10-minute follow up period.

 Outcome measures: Sympathetic skin response from the simulated (Right) hand and skin temperature of both stimulated (Right) and none stimulated (Left) hand was measured 15 seconds before, just 15 seconds after, and 10 minutes after application of interventions.

 Effects of High and Low Frequency TENS on Sympathetic Skin Response and Skin Temperature@highlight

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of 4 Hz and 110 Hz transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on the sympathetic nervous system via measuring the sympathetic skin response (SSR) and skin temperature.
