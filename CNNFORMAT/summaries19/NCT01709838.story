(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Safety Study of Deferasirox in Patients With Non-transfusion Dependent Thalassemia.

 To assess the efficacy of deferasirox in patients with non-transfusion dependent thalassemia based on change in liver iron concentration from baseline after 52 weeks.

 Also, to evaluate the impact of deferasirox on the quality of life for adults and pediatric patients; correlate changes in serum ferritin and LIC, evaluate efficacy changes in NTDT syndrome, evaluate higher doses of deferasirox, assess endocrine function and examine PK parameters.

To also assess the efficacy of treatment in patients with very high LIC (>15 mg Fe/g dw) at baseline and those who need re-treatment after having reached the target LIC < 3 mg Fe/g dw during the study.

To assess the efficacy of deferasirox in patients with non-transfusion dependent thalassemia based on change in liver iron concentration from baseline after 52 weeks of treatment.

 To provide further assessment of the long-term efficacy and safety of deferasirox in NTDT patients with iron overload (LIC 5 mg Fe/g liver dw and SF 300 ng/mL) for up to 260 weeks.
