(fifthQuint)Influence of Patient-Informed Choice in a Novel Treatment Model for LBP.

 The purpose of this research study proposal is to evaluate patient choice within this physical therapist-led model for non-specific low back pain.

 Evidence exists that patients are eager to play an active role in decisions concerning their health.

 Recent evidence from research supports the benefit of decision aides for consumers, especially those that were accurate and refined to the specific problems of each patient.

 In our proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT), one group of patients in the study will have the opportunity to drive choices within their healthcare model; but only after receiving useful information on what the consequences of their selections will be.

 Patients will receive decision making information to assist in making an informed choice.

 The structured information will organize known results from the research literature to assist patients in understanding the likely outcome of their condition and what they need to adequately manage their own care.

 The control group of patients will receive the Physical therapist-directed care model that is presently used and has shown success.

 Patient outcomes will involve patient self report of improvement and whether or not the patient pursued care for the same condition over a 1 year period of time.

 Influence of Patient-Informed Choice in a Novel Treatment Model for LBP@highlight

1.

 (Primary) To compare the effectiveness of a patient guided choice of care using a patient decision support tool to clinical guided care within a novel care process for non-specific low back pain.

 (We hypothesize that the patient guided choice model will demonstrate significant improvements when compared to the clinician guided care approach) 2.

 (Secondary) To qualitatively investigate which components of the patient choice educational methods were most effective for informed decision making among patients who participate in the patient guided choice of care approach (We hypothesize that dialogue method of patient guided choice will be identified as most useful)
