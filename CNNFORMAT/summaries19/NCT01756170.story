(secondQuint)Postoperative Chemoradiation v.

s Radiotherapy for Lymph Node Negative Cervical Cancer Patients.

 Cervical carcinoma is one of the most common gynecologic cancers worldwide.

 Concurrent radiotherapy with cisplatin-based chemotherapy has become the standard treatment for patients with high risk factors cervical cancer.

 However, the treatment modality in patients with low-risk (lymph node negative) is still disputable.

 It is not yet known whether cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy are more effective than radiotherapy alone in treating these patients.

 Therefore, the investigators are going to perform the efficacy and safety study of postoperative concurrent paclitaxel/cisplatin chemoradiotherapy vs.

 radiotherapy alone in lymph node negative patients with early-stage cervical cancer following radical hysterectomy.

This phase III study is designed to examine if low-risk (lymph node negative), stage I a2-II b cervical cancer patients treated by paclitaxel/cisplatin chemoradiation have greater toxicities but similar survival rate as those treated by radiotherapy alone.
