(thirdQuint)CO2 Versus Air Insufflation for Single-balloon Enteroscopy.

 Currently, air is more frequently used to insufflate gas into the lumen to ensure the visualization of the mucosa.

 However, there're some limitations, for instance, significant amounts of air are usually retained in the small bowel, which will lead to the distention and the pain of the gastrointestinal tract during and after the procedure.

 Carbon dioxide(CO2), comparing to the air, is rapidly absorbed from the intestine, which allows the bowel to decompress more quickly and potentially decreases intraprocedural and postprocedural pain, sedation medication requirements, procedure time, and recovery time.

 It is also to the benefit of deeper intubation depth so that higher total enteroscopy rate and diagnostic rate will be achieved.

 Initial reports indicated that CO2 was effective during the colonoscopy ,ERCP and DBE examination, but it is still uncertain to the SBE procedure.

 CO2 Versus Air Insufflation for Single-balloon Enteroscopy@highlight

Small-balloon enteroscopy is a novel endoscopy system for examination of the deep small intestine.

Initial reports indicated that CO2 was effective during the colonoscopy ,ERCP(endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) and DBE(double-balloon enteroscopy) examination, but it is still uncertain to the SBE(single-balloon enteroscopy) procedure.
