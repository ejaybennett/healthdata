(secondQuint)Left Ventricular Assist Device Combined With Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells Implantation in Patients With End-stage Heart Failure.

.

 End-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) with non-graftable coronary arteries is a common and debilitating problem.

 The ultimate therapeutic goal in such cases is cardiac transplantation which is restricted by donor availability.

 Alternatively, left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are increasingly used as bridge to transplantation or more recently as destination therapy in non-transplant candidates.

 Widely used second- and third-generation continuous-flow LVAD offer symptomatic relief and prolong life.

 However, LV unloading rarely improves native heart function in ischemic hearts.

 We aim to increase myocardial viability and improve native cardiac function in patients with end-stage ICM by injecting allogeneic bone marrow stem cells at the time of LVAD implantation.

@highlight

The aim of the study is to investigate safety and efficacy of intramyocardial implantation of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells in patients with end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation.
