(thirdQuint)Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Image-Guided Prostate Biopsy Following Radical Prostatectomy in Patients With Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate accuracy of the new image-guided targeted needle biopsy using the ex-vivo human prostate as obtained from fresh radical prostatectomy specimens.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo robotic radical prostatectomy, followed by 3 MRI-TRUS fusion image-guided prostate biopsies.

 Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Image-Guided Prostate Biopsy Following Radical Prostatectomy in Patients With Prostate Cancer@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion image-guided prostate biopsy following radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI-TRUS fusion image-guided prostate biopsy may help find and diagnose prostate cancer
