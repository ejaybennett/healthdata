(secondQuint)Effect of Short-Term Intensive Insulin Sequential Exenatide Therapy in Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic Patients.

 The UK Prospective Diabetes Study has shown that -cell function progressively deteriorates over time in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, irrespective of lifestyle and existing pharmacological interventions.

 The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes is one of the major challenges in the treatment of affected patients, and agents that could alter the natural history of this condition would add greatly to current treatment approaches.

 Short-term intensive insulin therapy of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes will improve beta-cell function and usually leading to a temporary remission time.

 The effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on beta-cells is stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin release, followed by enhancement of insulin biosynthesis.

 It is stimulating beta-cell proliferation, induction of islet neogenesis, and inhibition of ss-cell apoptosis.

 Exenatide is synthetic exendin-4, GLP-1 receptor agonist.

 Exenatide exerts direct effects on -cell, which indicates that may contribute to delay disease progression.

 However, no study has evaluated effect of short-term intensive insulin sequential exenatide therapy model on -cell function and glycemic remission rate in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients.

 This current study is thus designed to evaluate effect of short-term intensive insulin sequential exenatide therapy model on -cell function , glycemic control and glycemic remission rate in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients.

The randomized, controlled trial is to investigate and evaluate the effects of short-term continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) sequential exenatide therapy on -cell function, long-term glycemic control and glycemic remission rate in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients.
