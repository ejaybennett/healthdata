The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if treatment with hormone therapy in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone for 8 months controls the disease better than treatment with standard hormone therapy alone.

 Abiraterone acetate is designed to decrease the production of testosterone (male sex hormones), which plays a role in causing prostate cancer to grow.

 Prednisone is commonly used to treat prostate cancer and is given along with abiraterone acetate treatment to help lower or prevent some side effects.
