(secondQuint)Autologous Dendritic Cells in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the safety and tolerability of dendritic cell (DC)-AdGM carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) administered by intradermal injections at study doses and schedule.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate clinical antitumor effects following study treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.

1.

 Parameters include objective response (complete response [CR], partial response [PR]), duration of response in patients with objective response, and time to disease progression.

 II.

 To evaluate immune responses to DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) for numeric determination of CAIX specific T cells in blood.

 III.

 To evaluate immune responses to DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination by cytokine profiling of T cell culture supernatants for characterization of the immune response in subjects with demonstrated immune activation may be performed.

 IV.

 To evaluate immune responses to DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination by anti-sargramostim (GM-CSF) antibody response.

 V.

 To evaluate tumor biopsies for immune cell infiltrates.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive AdGMCAIX-transduced autologous dendritic cells intradermally (ID) on days 1, 15, and 29.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for at least 6 months.

 Autologous Dendritic Cells in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of autologous dendritic cells in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.

 Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells and white blood cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.
