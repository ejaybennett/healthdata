(thirdQuint)Telemedical Coaching for Weight Loss.

 In an occupational health care setting employees with overweight and/or metabolic syndrome will be randomized into a three arm 12-week trial.

 Participants in the telemedical (TM) and telemedical coaching (TMC) group got a weighing machine and a step counter, with automatic transfer into a personalized online portal, which could be monitored from both, the participant and the study centre.

 The TMC group weekly will get care calls from the study centre aiming to discuss measured data and to fix target agreements.

 The control group will remain in routine care.

 Telemedical Coaching for Weight Loss@highlight

Lifestyle changes often fail due to loss of motivation.

 Telemedicine and personal coaching have the potential to support lifestyle change and weight loss.

 Therefore, the aim of our randomized controlled trial is to examine the effect of telemedicine with and without coaching in comparison to a control group on weight loss in overweight participants.
