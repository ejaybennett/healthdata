(firstQuint)Gemcitabine, Ascorbate, Radiation Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer, Phase I.

 This phase 1 study will test the safety of adding high dose ascorbate (vitamin C) to standard chemoradiation.

 The ascorbate is infused during external beam radiation therapy treatment.

 For patients eligible for this trial, standard treatment for their cancer includes radiation therapy combined with weekly gemcitabine (a chemotherapy).
