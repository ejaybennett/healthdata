(secondQuint)A Pilot Study of Oncaspar + Dexamethasone in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory T-Cell Lymphoma.

 This is an open-label, investigator-initiated, single-arm pilot study.

 Patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) will receive Oncaspar(R) every 3 weeks up to a maximum of 8 courses or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 They will also receive dexamethasone 40mg daily for 4 days with every cycle.

 They will be restaged after 2 courses (6 weeks) and after 8 courses (24 weeks).

 Both Oncaspar and dexamethasone have been used together to treat ALL and ENKTL, which is another subtype of T cell lymphoma.

 The combination may provide a collaborative attack against the cancer cell; moreover, the dexamethasone could also prevent some of the side effects of Oncaspar; especially allergic reactions.

 This study will test these two drugs together to determine if they are an effective treatment for T-Cell Lymphoma.

 Each drug is commercially available to the drug market.
