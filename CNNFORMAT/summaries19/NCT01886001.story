(fifthQuint)Topical Umbilical Cord Care for the Prevention of Colonization and Invasive Infections.

 Umbilical catheter associated infections are higher (4.

4 vs.

 3.

4 CLABSIs per 1000 line days) than other central lines such as PICCs and surgically placed CVLin the NICU.

CDC.

gov - NSHN 2010 Report).

 Routine care of the skin entry site (e.

g.

 central line dressing care) is standard for other central lines, but there is no standard for care of the umbilical stump while umbilical lines are in place.

 In a pilot study to evaluate the relationship of umbilical stump colonization with gestational age, the number of days the catheter was in place, and the type of organisms, colonization was detected in 78% of patients.

 There was a direct correlation with colonization and line days as well as an inverse relationship with lower gestational age.

 This pilot data supported the need for the study of interventions to reduce umbilical stump colonization, which may help decrease blood stream infections (BSIs) associated with umbilical lines in the NICU.

 The proposed study will evaluate feasibility of once daily product application.

 Topical Umbilical Cord Care for the Prevention of Colonization and Invasive Infections@highlight

Umbilical catheters are necessary for many infants admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU)and utilized when indicated for up to 7 to 14 days.

 Bacterial colonization can occur at the umbilical stump and potentially lead to serious bloodstream infections (BSIs).

 This study is a prospective, randomized controlled feasibility trial to evaluate three types of hygiene products on umbilical line stumps, on the effect of line colonization and subsequent infections.

 Infants admitted to the NICU with an umbilical line(s) will be randomized into one of four study groups, three products against standard of care (no product).

 The three products that will be evaluated are currently being used in different capacities for skin care in the UVA NICU.

 The study hypothesizes that daily topical application of 1 or more antiseptic to the top of the umbilical stump will decrease colonization of the umbilical stump while umbilical lines are in place.
