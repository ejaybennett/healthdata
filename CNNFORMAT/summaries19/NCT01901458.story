(thirdQuint)Two Different Collection Sets for Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Apheresis With Spectra Optia.

 Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) collected by apheresis are the most common stem cell source for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

 Recently, Terumo BCT introduced a novel automated apheresis system for PBPC collection.

 The Spectra Optia(R) apheresis system uses the Spectra Optia(R) Collection set and the MNC software for PBPC collection.

 This system combines continuous centrifugation (high g) and subsequent cellular collection into an elutriation chamber, where the platelets are elutriated from mononuclear cells.

 An optical sensor detects when red blood cells begin to be elutriated and subsequently triggers the collection of the buffy coat into the product bag by flushing the chamber with donor plasma.

 Thus PBPCs are harvested intermittently.

 In contrast, the same apheresis systems in combination with the Spectra Optia(R) IDL set and the WBC-D software, which has been designed to perform leukodepletion procedures, permits continuous PBPC centrifugation (low g) and harvesting.

 The investigators hypothesis is that the use of the IDL set with manual adaption of the WBC-D-software allows a more efficient PBPC collection compared to the collection set which is recommended for PBPC collection.

 The apheresis time to collect the same amount of target cells dependent on the donors peripheral blood count will be shortened.

 In addition, the investigators want to compare both systems with respect to the cellular composition of the apheresis product and the donors platelet loss and coagulation parameters during apheresis.

The study will determine the advantage of the Spectra Optia(R) IDL set compared to the standard collection set for collection of peripheral blood progenitor cells using the Spectra Optia(R) apheresis system.

 The study will assess the reduction of apheresis time to obtain the required amount of hematopoietic progenitor cells.
