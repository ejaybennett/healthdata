(thirdQuint)Clinical Evaluation of Instrumented Wheel as Biomedical Device Quantifying the Displacement Efficiency.

 * The manual wheelchair is used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to spinal cord lesions, neurological and muscular diseases, lower limb trauma, age .

.

.

etc.

 Although the wheelchair help to regain mobility, this made of displacement is nor natural nor well-to-do.

 - The CIC-IT and TSR (Transmissions Services Roulements, Merignac, France) improved the instrumented wheel, adaptable with all wheelchairs, with information wireless transmission.

 - The primary objective of study is to validate the instrumented wheel of manual wheelchair such as a new device of evaluation of capacities of displacement in ecologic situation.

 - The primary criteria is to compare the mechanical power calculated using instrumented wheel versus the power calculated using ergometer roller during protocol of standard cardio-respiratory stress test.

 This study is interventional, mono-centric, controlled and crossover.

 The population concerned is patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) and users of manual wheelchair.

 Number of subjects projected for the entire study: 62 patients The total duration of participation of each patient: 7 days 2days.

 Clinical Evaluation of Instrumented Wheel as Biomedical Device Quantifying the Displacement Efficiency@highlight

The purpose of this study is to validate an instrumented wheel such as a new biomedical device.

 The physicians will compare this instrumented wheel with another instrumentation "Ergometer roller", each patient will try the both instrumentations, physical and physiological parameters will be measured.

 The increase rate of radial power during the cardiac stress test may be more important when the physicians use the instrumented wheel.
