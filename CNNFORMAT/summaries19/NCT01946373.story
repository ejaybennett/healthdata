(firstQuint)T Cell Transfer With or Without Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Patients With Melanoma.

 The MAT02 clinical trial is a phase 1 clinical trial with the objective to assess the safety, feasibility and immunological efficacy of the combined application of two immunological treatment modalities in patients with metastatic melanoma: 1.

 Cohort A: After a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, 5 patients will receive one bulk infusion of T cells.

 T cells will be expanded ex vivo from autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL).

 In vivo persistence of the infused cells will be supported by administration of IL-2, a T cell survival factor.

 2.

 Cohort B: This adoptive cell transfer (ACT) step will in additional 5 patients be followed by a vaccination with autologous, in vitro-generated, dendritic cells (DC), loaded with autologous tumor lysate and a synthetically produced peptide derived from the tumor associated antigen NY-ESO 1.

The purpose of this study is to learn if dendritic cell vaccine will increase the effect of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes given with chemotherapy and interleukin-2 in patients with melanoma.
