(fifthQuint)Ballistic Strength Training in Stroke: A Pilot Study.

 Research Aims: 1.

 To establish the feasibility of ballistic strength training in stroke and 2.

 To evaluate the effects of ballistic strength training exercises on mobility outcomes, strength and quality of life when compared with usual care.

 Methods: This wil be a prospective, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded pilot study.

 It will be conducted 3 x per week for 6 weeks (i.

e.

 a total of 18 sessions lasting 30 minutes).

 Primary outcome measure: Feasibility - Recruitment - Retention/Attrition - Clinical Feasibility - Safety Secondary outcome measures - measured at baseline and completion - Ten metre walk test (10MWT) comfortable pace - 10MWT maximum safe pace - High level mobility assessment tool (HiMAT): Only in participants where 10MWT is <12.

5s at baseline - Timed up and go test (TUG) - Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) - Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) via AQoL-4D Description of intervention: Control Group: The control group will complete a suite of exercises based upon existing rehabilitation practices that aim to improve mobility after stroke.

 The supervising physiotherapist will select and progress the exercises, recording the performance of exercises in an exercise log and detailing incidence of adverse events.

 Exercise selection will include: gait retraining, cardiovascular fitness, lower limb strengthening, static and dynamic balance Experimental group: The experimental group will complete jump squats on the leg sled, single leg toe push offs (or bilateral where unable to complete single), alternating legs (i.

e.

 bounding), mini tramp jumping, progressing to jogging, quick hip flexion and bounding on land.

 Ballistic Strength Training in Stroke: A Pilot Study@highlight

This pilot study intends to evaluate whether stroke patients can complete ballistic strength exercises for thirty minutes, three times per week over a six week training period in addition to their existing rehabilitation program.

 It will evaluate whether using ballistic training principles, is superior in improving mobility compared with usual care exercises to improve mobility and leg strength in stroke patients.

 In this study there will be 15 participants per group, a total of 30 participants.

 The control group will receive usual care consistent with existing rehabilitation practice and literature.

 The experimental group will perform task specific strength training in a ballistic fashion.
