(fifthQuint)JointADventure: A Worksite Activity-Diet Intervention for Chronic Knee Pain.

 We will utilize a partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois (BCBSIL), a highly supportive wellness partner, with a strong history of investment in the health of its employees and subscribers.

 The combined Activity/Dietary (AD) intervention is administered by health professionals trained in motivational interviewing as healthy lifestyle coaches.

 Over the first 6 months, the coaches provide: - individualized counseling based on a comprehensive assessment of baseline clinical, functional and behavioral factors that are barriers to healthy physical activity and dietary behaviors - group education, the content of which is modeled after the highly successful Diabetes Prevention Program physical activity/dietary intervention, and customized for those with knee symptoms.

 Follow-up assessments continue for 6 additional months.

 Specific aims are to: 1.

 assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial of the JointADventure intervention at this worksite 2.

 estimate the effectiveness of the intervention to decrease body weight, improve dietary habits, and increase objectively-measured physical activity 3.

 to improve objectively measured functional performance 4.

 to improve self-reported arthritis-specific and generic health status and health utility.

 JointADventure: A Worksite Activity-Diet Intervention for Chronic Knee Pain@highlight

JointADventure: A worksite activity-diet intervention for chronic knee pain is a randomized controlled trial evaluation of a physical activity and nutritional worksite intervention to decrease symptoms and disability associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA), a major public health problem and a leading cause of work disability and work absenteeism/presenteeism in the US workforce.

 The overarching goal of this project is to find an effective and sustainable intervention strategy that can assist large populations of persons with or at risk for knee OA to attain and maintain healthy dietary and physical activity behaviors.

 This project has to potential to have a tremendous impact on improving symptoms and quality of life of persons with chronic knee pain and decreasing the functional limitation, work absenteeism/presenteeism, and soaring healthcare utilization associated with knee OA.
