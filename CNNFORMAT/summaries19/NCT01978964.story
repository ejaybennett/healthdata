(secondQuint)Phase 1b Maintenance Therapy Study of ONT-10 in Patients With Solid Tumors.

 Open label Phase 1b maintenance therapy study to evaluate the long-term safety, immunogenicity, and anti-tumor effects of repeat-dose vaccination with ONT-10 in patients with previously treated Stage 3 or 4 solid tumors with histologies that have been associated with expression of the MUC1 antigen as described in the medical literature.

 Patients must have previously been enrolled on the Phase 1 clinical trial ONT-10-001, completed all treatment and follow-up through at least 12 weeks, experienced no dose limiting toxicity, and experienced no progression of disease per the immune-related Response Criteria.

 Patients will receive maintenance ONT-10 every 6 weeks.
