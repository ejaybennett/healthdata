(secondQuint)GAD-M Regimen As First-Line Treatment in Untreated Extranodal NK/T Cell Lymphoma.

 Studies have shown that effects of P glycoprotein mediated chemotherapy resistance reduce the therapeutic efficacy of anthracycline-based chemotherapy of NK/T cell lymphoma, and agents like pegaspargase and large doses of Methotrexate is not affected by the P glycoprotein.

 A number of reports suggest that gemcitabine combined with other chemotherapy drugs has good application prospect in the treatment of lymphomas.

 Dexamethasone is used in combination with other agents for the treatment of lymphomas which may be implicated in the development or growth of some cancers.

 So we explored to evaluate the efficacy and safety of High dose of methotrexate combined with gemcitabine, pegaspargase and dexamethasone (GAD-M regimen) as first-line treatment in patients with untreated extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.
