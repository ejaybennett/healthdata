(fifthQuint)Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibition in Psoriasis Patients With Diabetes (DIP): A Randomized Clinical Trial.

.

 Background: Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease affecting approximately 2% of the world's population.

 It is characterised by keratinocyte hyperproliferation, by aberrant keratinocyte differentiation and by cutaneous inflammation.

 Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is expressed on keratinocytes and its activity is upregulated in psoriasis.

 DPP-4 inhibition suppresses keratinocyte proliferation and restores partially keratinocyte differentiation.

 The main site of DPP-4 activity is cluster of differentiation antigen 26 (CD26).

 CD26 is a marker of T cell activation and is a key molecule in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.

 One case of DPP-4 inhibitor therapy improving psoriasis severity has been reported.

 Agents used to treat psoriasis target commonly the underlying inflammation.

 C-reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive, systemic marker of inflammation.

 In people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) DPP-4 inhibitor therapy decreases CRP concentrations.

 Serum CRP concentrations correlate with psoriasis severity and interventions that decrease the CRP concentration may decrease also psoriasis severity.

 Medications that improve insulin resistance may decrease also systemic inflammation and improve psoriasis.

 We have shown previously, in psoriasis patients without T2DM (both lean and obese), that the fasting insulin concentration and the homeostatic model of insulin resistance (measures of insulin resistance) correlate strongly with the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI, a measure of psoriasis severity: r=0.

9kg/m2 or >30kg/m2) after which they will be allocated randomly, in a 1:1 ratio using blocks, either to Arm A or to Arm B.

 Research participants allocated to Arm A will receive an eighteen week supply of Januvia(R) 50mg tablets (DPP-4 inhibitor) and will receive a six week supply of Diamicron(R) matched placebo capsules (during visit 2).

 The research participants will be instructed to ingest orally two Januvia(R) 50mg tablets once daily for 16 weeks (until visit 5) and to ingest also one Diamicron(R) matched placebo capsule once daily for 4 weeks (until visit 3).

 If a participant has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 50ml/min/1.

73m2 the participant will be instructed to ingest orally one Januvia(R) 50mg tablet once daily (in addition to one Diamicron(R) matched placebo).

 After four weeks research participants allocated to Arm A will receive a further six week supply of Diamicron(R) matched placebo capsules, provided that they have not experienced any severe hypoglycaemic episodes.

 At this stage they will be instructed to ingest orally one capsule twice daily for 4 weeks (until visit 4).

 After four weeks research participants allocated to Arm A will receive a further ten week supply of Diamicron(R) matched placebo capsules, provided that they have not experienced any severe hypoglycaemic episodes, and will be instructed to ingest orally two capsules twice daily for 8 weeks (until visit 5).

 Research participants allocated to Arm B will receive an eighteen week supply of Januvia(R) matched placebo tablets and will receive a six week supply of capsules each containing a Diamicron(R) 80mg tablet (sulphonylurea, during visit 2).

 The research participants will be instructed to ingest orally two Januvia(R) matched placebo tablets once daily for 16 weeks (until visit 5) and to ingest also one capsule containing a Diamicron(R) 80mg tablet once daily for 4 weeks (until visit 3).

 If a participant has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 50ml/min/1.

73m2 the participant will be instructed to ingest orally one Januvia(R) matched placebo tablet once daily (in addition to capsules containing Diamicron(R) 80mg tablets).

 After four weeks research participants allocated to Arm B will receive a further six weeks supply of capsules containing a Diamicron(R) 80mg tablet, provided that they have not experienced any severe hypoglycaemic episodes.

 At this stage they will be instructed to ingest orally one capsule twice daily for 4 weeks (until visit 4).

 After four weeks research participants allocated to Arm B will receive a further ten weeks supply of capsules containing a Diamicron(R) 80mg tablet, provided that they have not experienced any severe hypoglycaemic episodes, and will be instructed to ingest orally two capsules twice daily for 8 weeks (until visit 5).

 The Januvia(R) 50mg tablets will be identical in appearance to the Januvia(R) matched placebo tablets.

 Similarly the capsules containing a Diamicron(R) 80mg tablet will be identical in appearance to the Diamicron(R) matched capsules.

 Participants will be advised to take Diamicron(R) / Diamicron(R) matched capsules immediately prior to food intake/main meals.

 After the initial sixteen weeks of treatment all research participants (in both Arm A and Arm B) will progress to the open-label phase of the trial, and will receive an eighteen week supply of Januvia(R) 50mg tablets (DPP-4 Inhibitor) and will be instructed to ingest orally two tablets once daily for sixteen weeks (unless the eGFR is C in secure, dedicated freezers in the Research Laboratories in the Education and Research Centre in St Vincent's University Hospital.

 The blood will be stored within 12 hours of blood collection.

 Blood that has been stored for future DNA extraction will be destroyed once the DNA analyses are complete.

 Disposal of this material will be in accordance with current practice in this unit and with the written protocols in place in this unit.

 Disposal will involve the use of solid plastic waste containers which will be sent for incineration.

 To protect the research participant's identity, a unique identification code will be assigned by the Investigator, or authorised designee, to each participant's genetic sample and used in lieu of the participant's name.

 This coded form of identification, instead of the participant's name, will appear on all documents/databases.

 Statistical Analysis Plan: Demographic and baseline clinical data will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group.

 Similarly, the primary and secondary efficacy variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group.

 Data from research participants who are not allocated to either arm of the study and who do not receive a supply of either investigational medicinal product will be excluded from statistical analyses.

 T tests (or the appropriate alternative for non-parametric data), using two-sided tests, will be used to test for significant differences between the sets of data obtained.

 The independent samples T test will be used to assess for differences between the effects of the test product (Januvia(R)) compared to the differences of the comparator product (Diamicron(R)).

 Chi square analyses will be used to test for significant differences in categorical variables between the sets of data obtained.

 Subgroup analyses will be performed on those research participants who: complete the visit 6 assessment; have severe psoriasis; have non-severe psoriasis; are male; are female; are obese; and are older than 45 years.

 Early Withdrawal visit All research participants who withdraw early from the study will be advised to agree to attend an early withdrawal visit.

 There will be a separate section in the CRF to be completed if the research participant withdraws early from the study before week 36.

 The research participant's involvement in this study will end following the completion of the End of Study Visit (or Early Withdrawal visit if applicable).

 Once participants have completed their involvement in this study they will be provided with standard treatment by their usual healthcare providers.

 Adverse Events: Comprehensive assessments of any apparent toxicity experienced by the research participant will be performed throughout the course of the study from the time of participant's signature of informed consent.

 Adverse events (AEs) considered related to Study Drug at the End of Study Visit (or Early Withdrawal Visit, if applicable) will be followed until the participant is stable or the AE is resolved or the participant is lost to follow-up.

 Any medical condition, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the Baseline Visit and not related to a protocol-associated procedure, is not an AE.

 It will be considered to be pre-existing.

 Complete and appropriate data on all Adverse Events experienced (observed, volunteered or elicited) during the reporting period will be reported on an ongoing basis in the Adverse Event Form pages of the Case Report Form.

 The investigator will classify the severity of an adverse event.

 The investigator will systematically assess the relationship of the adverse event to the investigational medicinal product.

 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Information about all SAEs will be collected and recorded on the SAE Report Form.

 Each SAE must be reported by the Investigator, or an authorised designee, to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.

 Medical and scientific judgement will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation, but may jeopardise the research participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.

 These will be considered also serious.

 Justification of Population and Method of Estimation: We plan to enrol 40 research participants in total in the two sites.

 The primary objective of the research project is to determine the change in the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) during 16 weeks of treatment with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (Januvia(R), 100mg daily, or 50mg daily for participants with moderate kidney disease) in psoriasis patients with type 2 diabetes.

 This will be compared to the PASI in psoriasis patients with type 2 diabetes during 16 weeks of treatment with a comparator (Diamicron(R) 80mg to 320mg daily).

 Mittal et al.

 have determined previously the effect of twelve weeks of pioglitazone therapy (which lowers glucose levels) on the decrease in PASI in 41 psoriasis patients commencing acitretin therapy18.

 The decrease in the PASI was 64.

2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 49.

2%-79.

3%) in those treated with pioglitazone compared to a decrease of 51.

7% (95% CI, 38.

7%-64.

7%) in those treated with placebo (p=0.

04).

 Based on these data, and assuming a 33% dropout rate, we have calculated that we will require 40 research participants to detect a greater than 5% difference in the change in PASI with 80% power at the 5% significance level.

 Method of Randomisation: The unit of randomisation will be the individual research participant.

 After stratification by centre, by psoriasis severity (PASI 7-10, 10.

1-13 or >13) and by obesity status (BMI 18-24.

9kg/m2, 25-29.

9kg/m2 or >30kg/m2) 40 research participants will be assigned randomly, in a ratio of 1:1 using blocks of 2, to receive either: 1.

 Januvia(R) tablets followed by Januvia(R) tablets; OR 2.

 Diamicron(R) capsules followed by Januvia(R) tablets.

 In order to achieve this we have prepared 9 randomisation lists using a web-based random generator programme.

 One copy of this document will be used for each centre.

 For each participant the investigator, or authorised designee, will chose the appropriate list and will add the participant's identifier to the list in chronological order.

 This list will be thereby used to determine the study treatment which the participant will receive.

 Random allocation will occur at visit 2 (baseline visit) once all screening procedures required at visit 1 (screening visit) have been completed, once it has been confirmed that the participant satisfies all inclusion and exclusion criteria and once the participant completes the four week run-in period.

 Identification numbers will be assigned chronologically in consecutive, ascending order.

 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval: Before initiating this study the Study Protocol, Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), Patient Information Leaflet and Informed Consent Form, applicable advertising, and any other written information to be given to participants will be reviewed and approved by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC/IRB).

 A signed and dated statement that all documents submitted for review have been approved by the IEC/IRB will be given to the Sponsor or designee before the study can commence at a site.

 The membership and the constitution of the IEC/IRB who approved the documents will be also supplied to the Sponsor or designee.

 Ethical Conduct of the Study: This study will be carried out in compliance with the Study Protocol and in accordance with the Sponsor/Contract Research Organisations (CROs) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

 These are designed to ensure adherence to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, as described in: - International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice 1996.

 Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibition in Psoriasis Patients With Diabetes (DIP): A Randomized Clinical Trial.

@highlight

The primary purpose of this study is to determine if sitagliptin (Januvia(R)) improves psoriasis severity after 16 weeks of treatment in 20 participants with both psoriasis and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 We will compare the change in psoriasis severity in 20 participants treated with Januvia(R) to 20 participants treated with 16 weeks of a comparator drug (gliclazide, Diamicron(R)).

 Participants will be recruited from two centres and after a 4 week washout period will be followed prospectively for 36 weeks.

 Participants will be stratified by centre, psoriasis severity and obesity status after which they will be randomly allocated to Arm A or Arm B.

 Participants will be treated with either Januvia(R) and Diamicron(R) matched placebo capsules (Arm A), or Diamicron(R) and Januvia(R) matched placebo tablets (Arm B) for 16 weeks and then proceed to an open-label phase where all participants will receive Januvia(R) for a further 16 weeks.

 Both the research participants and the investigators will be unaware of the trial arm to which the research participant has been allocated (double-blind study).

 Research participants will be prohibited from making any changes to the dose of medications used to treat psoriasis.

 If a participant's plasma glycated haemoglobin level (HbA1c) (reflects a participant's glucose control over the previous 3 months) is above 64mmol/mol eight weeks after commencing one of the study investigational medicinal products (IMPs) insulin therapy will be used to improve glycaemic control.

 Participants will be assessed at 9 study visits over 40 weeks.

 Participants will complete questionnaires, have a medical history recorded and physical examination, blood sampling and skin biopsies taken (in a small number of willing participants at 3 visits).

 The following endpoints will be analysed: Changes in psoriasis severity at 16 and 32 weeks; changes in validated quality of life scores; incidence of adverse events; incidence of discontinuation of one of the study IMPs, time to relapse of psoriasis; changes in cardiovascular disease risk factor profiles; changes in cytokines, hormones, expression of immune proteins in blood and skin biopsies; and genetic profiles that predicts best response to sitagliptin therapy.

 We hypothesize that sitagliptin therapy decreases psoriasis severity.
