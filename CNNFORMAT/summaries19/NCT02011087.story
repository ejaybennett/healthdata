(thirdQuint)Bioelectrical Impedance Phase Angle in Predicting Treatment Outcome in Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving First-Line Chemotherapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the association between phase angle (PA) measurement and progression-free survival (PFS).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the association between PA measurement and treatment-related outcomes of treatment response, adverse treatment events, and overall survival (OS).

 II.

 To determine the feasibility of obtaining PA measurements at a single time point in patients undergoing evaluation in thoracic oncology clinics.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo bioelectrical impedance phase angle measurement on day 1 of treatment.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for two years.

 Bioelectrical Impedance Phase Angle in Predicting Treatment Outcome in Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving First-Line Chemotherapy@highlight

This clinical trial studies bioelectrical impedance phase angle in predicting treatment outcome in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as bioelectrical impedance analysis, may help predict a patient's response to treatment for small cell lung cancer.
