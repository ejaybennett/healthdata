(thirdQuint)Immunoscore in Rectal Cancer.

 The quality of the immune environment in colorectal cancer biopsy samples correlates with disease-free survival and overall survival more so than current staging conventions.

 This study will use a scoring system called 'immunoscore' to characterize the immune enviroment.

 Researchers hypothesize that the immunoscore will correlate with outcomes of colorectal patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation.

 Researchers will also collect samples from melanoma, breast, renal cell, lung, bladder, head and neck, ovarian and thyroid cancers for exploratory research.

 Immunoscore in Rectal Cancer@highlight

This is an observational study of tumor samples and MRI imaging in patients with colorectal, melanoma, breast, renal cell, lung, bladder, head and neck, ovarian and thyroid cancers.

 A tumor sample, MRI scans, and treatment outcome data will be used for research purposes to see if it is possible to predict patients' response to treatment.
