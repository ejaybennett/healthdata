(thirdQuint)Phase 2, Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Multicenter Study of Autologous MSC-NTF Cells in Patients With ALS.

 The MSC-NTF cell therapy (NurOwn cent ) is based on transplantation of autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), which are enriched from the patients' own bone marrow, propagated ex vivo and induced to secrete NTFs.

 The autologous MSC-NTF cells are back-transplanted into the ALS patient into the sites of damage, the spinal cord and the muscles.

 NTFs are potent survival factors for embryonic, neonatal, and adult neurons and are considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS.

 Delivery of appropriate NTFs to the immediate environment of afflicted neurons in ALS patients is expected to improve their survival and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms.

 Previous open-label clinical trials have shown that MSC-NTF cells treatment was well tolerated and appears to be generally safe.

 Some initials indications of clinical benefit were also observed in some patients.

 This multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single combined intramuscular and intrathecal administration of MSC-NTF cells in early-stage ALS patients.

 Patients will be followed for approximately three months before transplantation with their autologous MSC-NTF cells or placebo.

 During this period of time, patient bone-marrow will be harvested and mesenchymal stromal cells will be isolated and expanded.

 Following treatment patients will be followed for a total of six months at monthly visits.

 Phase 2, Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Multicenter Study of Autologous MSC-NTF Cells in Patients With ALS@highlight

This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous (self) transplantation of Neurotrophic factors-secreting Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC-NTF, NurOwn cent ) in patients with ALS .

 MSC-NTF cells are a novel cell-therapeutic approach which is expected to effectively deliver Neurotrophic factors, which are potent survival factors for neurons, directly to the site of damage.
