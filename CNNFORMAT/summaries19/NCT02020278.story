(thirdQuint)An Extension Follow-up Trial to Evaluate the Long-term Safety of Children and Adolescent Subjects With Euvolemic or Hypervolemic Hyponatremia.

 Core Safety Follow-up Component cent For all subjects: To evaluate the post-treatment safety follow-up of children and adolescent subjects with dilutional (euvolemic or hypervolemic) hyponatremia who have previously participated in a tolvaptan hyponatremia trial.

 Optional Tolvaptan Treatment Component cent For subjects who receive optional tolvaptan treatment: To demonstrate that tolvaptan safely and effectively achieves and maintains increased serum sodium concentrations in children and adolescent subjects with dilutional (euvolemic or hypervolemic) hyponatremia when used for both multiple short-term treatments, and/or longer chronic treatments.

The objective of this trial is to provide 6 months of safety follow-up for children and adolescents with dilutional (euvolemic or hypervolemic) hyponatremia who have previously participated in a tolvaptan hyponatremia trial, and to assess the efficacy of tolvaptan in increasing serum sodium for those subjects who receive optional continuing tolvaptan treatment of variable duration (up to 6 months).
