(secondQuint)Exercise Challenge in a Cold Chamber.

 Subjects suffering form exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) usually have a normal lung function testing at rest.

 To provoke asthma symptoms a provocation test is necessary, e.

g.

, by bronchial methacholine testing or by a standardised exercise test on a treadmill.

 The correlation between methacholine and exercise test is fair, possibly because both methods measure different kinds of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

 Moreover, the sensitivity and the repeatability of the exercise test is fair.

 The value of the methacholine test to predict a positive exercise test will be measured.

 We hypothesize that the exercise test in a cold chamber, a combination of two provocation methods cold air and exercise, is more sensitive to detect EIB and that the test has a better repeatability.

 Exercise Challenge in a Cold Chamber@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the exercise-challenge in a cold chamber at 2-4C to the gold standard the metacholine challenge in subjects showing symptoms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

 The sensitivity and repeatability of the exercise test will be measured.
