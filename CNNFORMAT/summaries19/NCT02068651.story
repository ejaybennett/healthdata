 A Community-based Advance Care Planning Programme for Patients With Advanced Disease@highlight

Advance care planning has been recommended as an integral part of care for patients with life-limiting disease, but relevant development in Hong Kong is still in its infancy.

 This proposed study attempts to address this service gap by promoting advance care planning to patients with advanced disease.

 It is hypothesized that the proportion of patients whose end-of-life care preferences were known in the experimental group will be significantly higher than that in the control group.
