(secondQuint)Pilot Study of Efficacy of Mechanical Insufflation Exsufflation in Stroke.

 Mechanical Insufflation- Exsufflation (MI-E) is an assisted coughing machine that has been proven to be very effective in preventing the deterioration of pulmonary function in patients with degenerative neuromuscular disorders.

 Impaired airway clearance in stroke patients is associated with increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia.

 In this pilot study the investigators attempt to assess the efficacy of MI-E as part of a protocol for patients with dysphagia with impaired cough response.

Stroke patients with dysphagia have restrictive lung dysfunction and impaired cough response.

 This pilot study was performed to determine if Mechanical Insufflation Exsufflation (MIE) therapy can help recover impaired cough function.
