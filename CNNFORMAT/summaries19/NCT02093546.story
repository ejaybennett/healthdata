(secondQuint)Translational Companion Protocol to GOG229O.

 Study Visits: The following tests and procedures will be performed during your regular study visits while on GOG02290: During screening and at Day 28 (+/- 3 days): - You will have a tumor biopsy to check for biomarkers.

 - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn to test for biomarkers and circulating tumor cells (CTCs).

 Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to your reaction to the study drug.

 CTC testing checks how many tumor cells are in the blood.

 Between Day 3 and Day 5 and at Day 56 (+/-3 days): -Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn to test for biomarkers and CTCs.

 Length of Study: After blood and biopsy samples have been collected, your participation in this study will be over.

 This is an investigational study.

 Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study.

 Up to 25 will take part at MD Anderson.
