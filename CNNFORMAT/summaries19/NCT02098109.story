(secondQuint)Non-inferiority Study of XM02 Filgrastim (Granix) and Filgrastim (Neupogen) in Combination With Plerixafor for Autologous Stem Cell Mobilization in Patients With Multiple Myeloma or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.

 This study will compare the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called filgrastim (Neupogen) and plerixafor with the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called XM02 filgrastim (Granix) and plerixafor.

 The FDA has determined that Granix is biosimilar to Neupogen, which means that they are similar in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy; however, Granix has not been tested in the context of stem cell mobilization to see how its effectiveness compares to that of Neupogen.
