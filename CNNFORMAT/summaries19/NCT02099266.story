(thirdQuint)Use of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy to Improve Umbilical Cord Blood Stem Cell Homing and Subsequent Engraftment.

 Research has suggested that high levels of erythropoietin (EPO) decreases the ability of infused umbilical cord stem cells to home to the bone marrow.

 The investigators will investigate the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy to decrease the plasma concentrations of EPO prior to UBC transplant and evaluate the resulting impact on UBC homing.

By doing this study, researchers hope to learn the following: - If providing hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy prior to an umbilical cord blood (UBC) transplant will help to improve the homing process - The safety of HBO administration in the setting of the UBC transplant - The effects of HBO therapy on the engraftment process
