(thirdQuint)Curcumin and Cholecalciferol in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage 0-II Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the overall response rate (ORR) based on National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-WG) criteria in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or the Cheson criteria in small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the time to first cytotoxic treatment (TFCT), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) using this regimen.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive curcumin orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 and cholecalciferol PO daily on days 8-28 of course 1 and days 1-28 of subsequent courses.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients achieving partial response or better may receive treatment for a total of 2 years.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3-6 months for 2 years.

 Curcumin and Cholecalciferol in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage 0-II Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma@highlight

This phase II trial studies the efficacy (activity), and tolerability of curcumin and cholecalciferol combination in treating patients with previously untreated stage 0-II chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

 Curcumin and cholecalciferol may prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells.
