(secondQuint)Ruxolitinib in Combination With Pemetrexed/Cisplatin in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 The study consisted of an open-label, safety run-in (consisting of 1 to 4 cohorts of 9 participants each), to confirm the safety of ruxolitinib in combination with pemetrexed/cisplatin in participants with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or recurrent.

 Participants in the safety run-in received open-label ruxolitinib and pemetrexed and cisplatin.

 In the second part of the study, participants enrolled and randomized and received pemetrexed and cisplatin (open-label) and either ruxolitinib or placebo in a blinded manner.

 The dose of ruxolitinib administered was determined from the data produced in the safety run-in phase.

 Treatment consisted of repeating 21-day cycles.

 Participants received infusions of pemetrexed and cisplatin on Day 1 of each cycle and ruxolitinib/placebo was self-administered during the entire cycle.

 Maintenance therapy with ruxolitinib or placebo in combination with pemetrexed, based on the original treatment assignment, was allowed for participants eligible for maintenance therapy.
