(fifthQuint)Effect of Vibration Stimulation Applied to Different Frequencies in Cortical Excitability and Muscular Function: Randomised Clinical Trial.

 The vibratory stimulation is regarded as a new training method and capable of modulating peripheral afferents and cortical projections therapy, which are important in motor control.

 This study aims to determine the effects of different parameters on cortical frequency electric potential and electric potential muscle in healthy young adults.

 Will participate in the study 80 volunteers, these randomly divided into four groups for the experimental procedures.

 The methodological approach consists of an electroencephalographic and electromyographic evaluation before and after 15 minutes of application of vibration through a digital vibrating pad.

 Effect of Vibration Stimulation Applied to Different Frequencies in Cortical Excitability and Muscular Function: Randomised Clinical Trial@highlight

The vibration stimulation is regarded as a new method of training and therapy to change afferent parts and cortical projections, which are important for motor control.

 This study aims to check effects of different frequency parameters for electrical cortical potentials and electrical muscular potentials in healthy young adults.

 80 volunteers will participate in the study, and they will be randomly subdivided in four groups for trials.

 The methodology consists of electroencephalographic and electromyographic assessment before and after 15-minute vibration application with a digital vibratory pad.
