(fifthQuint)The Study of Laparoscopic-assisted Percutaneous Catheter-directed Drainage to Treat Early Severe Acute Pancreatitis.

 According to the unified inclusion and exclusion criteria,We are going to select 60 cases SAP patients who carry on the treatment in our hospital from April 2014 to April 2015,and divide into the experimental group and control group under respect the wishes of patients.

 The experimental group use the method of laparoscopic-assisted percutaneous catheter-directed drainage of SAP.

According to different causes,.

For patients with simple gallbladder stones,it is going to carry out by laparoscopic cholecystectomy or cholecystotomy.

For patients with both gallbladder and common bile duct stones,common bile duct exploration is performed.

Removing necrotic pancreatic organizations and putting the catheter around the region of pancreas.

After the surgery,patient's cavity are continuously douched by catheter using 0.

5% 5-fluorouracil normal saline.

The postoperation therapeutic program is same as the control group.

 The control group use the method of conventional conservative therapy without surgical management,the principles of treatment include:(1)fasting,insert gastric tube,gastrointestinal decompression;(2)complement of blood volume,keeping water ,electrolyte and acid base balance;(3)inhibiting pancreatic enzyme and acid secretion;(4)using broad-spectrum antibiotic at the early phase;(5)improving microcirculation,dextrans and FuFangdanshen by IV;(6)early parenteral nutrition;(7)treatment by chinese herbs;(8)strengthen the function of important organs.

 Contrastive analyse two groups of patient's mortality,the incidence of complications,hospital stay,laboratory tests and other research indicators.

 The Study of Laparoscopic-assisted Percutaneous Catheter-directed Drainage to Treat Early Severe Acute Pancreatitis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of laparoscopic-assisted percutaneous catheter drainage of early SAP(severe acute pancreatitis).

We are going to select 60 cases SAP patients from April 2014 to April 2015 who carry on the treatment in our hospital,and divide into the experimental group and control group under respect the wishes of patient in the case.

The experimental group use the method of laparoscopic-assisted percutaneous drainage to carry on the treatment,the control group patients use conventional conservative therapy to carry on the treatment.

Contrastive analyze two groups of patients clinical care effects.

 Research hypothesis:according to compare the mortality,the incidence of complications ,hospital stay and other research indicators of two groups .

It is supposed that the research indicators of experimental group are lower than the control group ,difference was statistically significant(P<0.

05).

We can draw the conclusion that the method of laparoscopic-assisted percutaneous catheter drainage of early SAP is useful and deserve to be promoted on clinical.
