(fifthQuint)SoLaHmo Radio Stories About Children's Healthy Eating and Exercise.

 Given the high rate of type 2 diabetes mellitus (diabetes) in minority and immigrant communities, implementing culturally and linguistically appropriate health promotion activities that improve families' diet and physical activity behaviors is imperative.

 "Radio Stories" is an education entertainment strategy that has significant potential as a health promotion tool.

 Through a CBPAR process, we aimed to create and test the effectiveness and acceptability of "SoLaHmo Radio Stories" about changing knowledge and behaviors to prevent or manage diabetes for Somali, Latino, and Hmong families.

 Methods: SoLaHmo community researchers interview 3 families (1 Somali, 1 Latino, and 1 Hmong) who have successfully implemented lifestyle changes to prevent or manage diabetes, and then create 3 "radio stories" based on the families' experiences.

 To test the stories, we are conducting a two-arm trial that includes intervention groups (20 people per community) that listen to the radio stories and control groups (20 people per community) that receive a brochure with similar information (N=120).

 Effectiveness and acceptability of the program will be tested with pre-and post questionnaires.

 Anticipated Results: Higher rates of satisfaction, increased knowledge, and intention to change in participants receiving the radio stories, as compared to control group participants, will indicate radio story program effectiveness and acceptability.

The purpose of this study is to use a community based participatory action research (CBPAR) approach to 1) create "radio stories" about Somali, Latino and Hmong families' real success stories with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in managing their disease through implementation of healthful lifestyle behaviors (nutrition and physical activity), and 2) test the effectiveness and acceptability of radio stories on participant intentions to engage in or improve healthful lifestyle behaviors.

 Participants in the Intervention condition listened to the "radio stories" and the participants in the control condition listened to an audio brochure with relevant information.

 We hypothesized that the intervention participants would report higher intensions to engage in various healthful lifestyle behaviors than the control participants after both participants listened to their respective health information.
