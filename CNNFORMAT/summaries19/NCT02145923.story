(thirdQuint)Effectiveness and Safety of MMSCs for Enhancing Hematopoietic Recovery and Prophylaxis of Neutropenic Enterocolitis.

 Patients with verified diagnosis Hodgkin's lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma will undergo peripheral blood stem cell mobilisation and collection (chemotherapy + G-CSF or G-CSF+Plerixafor).

 After that high-dose chemotherapy will be performed according to protocols ICE and BEAM (standard scheme).

 Patient will receive bone marrow derived allogeneic multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells infusion 48 hours after last administration of cytotoxic agent .

 Number of cells calculated according to patient's body weight (1,5-2,0 mln of cells/kg), time of infusion - 30 minutes.

 Two hours later patient will receive autologous peripheral blood cells infusion.

 Effectiveness and Safety of MMSCs for Enhancing Hematopoietic Recovery and Prophylaxis of Neutropenic Enterocolitis@highlight

Subjects will undergo peripheral blood stem cell mobilisation and collection with subsequent high-dose chemotherapy.

 After finalization of high-dose chemotherapy subjects will receive bone marrow derived allogeneic multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells intravenous infusion two hours prior to autologous peripheral blood cells infusion.

 This is a single arm study with no control.

 All patients receive cell therapy.
