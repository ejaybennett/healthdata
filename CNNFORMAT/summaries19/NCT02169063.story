(fifthQuint)Carbon-11 Acetate and Fluorine F 18 Sodium Fluoride PET as a Biomarker of Treatment Response in Patients With Hormone Resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Demonstrate that carbon-11 acetate (11C-acetate) and 18F-fluoride (fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride) PET scans change as a result of treatment for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer by comparison of pre-treatment and 6-12 week post-treatment images (standardized uptake value [SUV], influx constant [Ki], and rate constant [K1]) with clinical response measures.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Compare results from 11C-acetate and 18F-fluoride PET scanning with the patient's clinical bone scan and determine which predicts clinical response better.

 II.

 Compare changes in 11C-acetate and 18F-fluoride PET with changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.

 III.

 Compare changes in 11C-acetate and 18F-fluoride PET with changes in urinary N-telopeptide and bone alkaline phosphatase.

 IV.

 Determine if either baseline uptake or change in uptake for 11C-acetate and/or 18F-fluoride PET is correlated with progression-free survival by Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria (Scher, 2008).

 V.

 Determine if either baseline uptake or change in uptake by 11C-acetate and/or 18F-fluoride PET is correlated with skeletal-related events (SREs) defined as radiographic pathologic fracture, need for radiation to bone, need for surgery, spinal cord compression or malignant hypercalcemia.

 VI.

 Percentage of patients that experience adverse events by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.

0.

 VII.

 For patients who have tissue/blood biomarkers obtained for other indications, directly compare baseline uptake and change in uptake by 11C-acetate and/or 18F-fluoride PET with those biomarkers.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive carbon-11 acetate intravenously (IV) and fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride IV over 1 minute and undergo PET at baseline and at 6-12 weeks after systemic therapy starts.

 After completion of treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5 years.

 Carbon-11 Acetate and Fluorine F 18 Sodium Fluoride PET as a Biomarker of Treatment Response in Patients With Hormone Resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer@highlight

This clinical trial studies carbon-11 acetate and fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride positron emission tomography (PET) as a biomarker of treatment response in patients with prostate cancer that does not respond to treatment with hormones and has spread to other parts of the body.

 Carbon-11 acetate and fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride are radioactive drugs that may be useful in evaluating prostate cancer activity in response to treatment.

 Comparing results of diagnostic procedures such as carbon-11 acetate and fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET done before and after therapy may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.
