(secondQuint)Safety Study of Dinutuximab Combined With Immunotherapy to Treat Neuroblastoma.

 Assess toxicity and safety of subcutaneous GM-CSF and iv IL-2 in enhancing Dinutuximab-mediated ablation of Bone Marrow (BM) disease in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who have achieved a Complete Response or Very Good Partial Response of the macroscopic disease in the investigators institution.

 Assess response of minimal residual disease (MRD) of the anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody Dinutuximab combined with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-2 in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (NB).

 More precisely, to apply real-time quantitative RT-PCR to test the hypothesis that minimal residual disease content of BM after the first treatments with dinutuximab/GM-CSF has significant prognostic impact on relapse-free survival.

 Safety Study of Dinutuximab Combined With Immunotherapy to Treat Neuroblastoma@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety of the triple COG schema with the monoclonal antibody Dinutuximab + cytokines (GM-CSF and IL2) and isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, or RA) in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.
