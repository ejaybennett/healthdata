(fifthQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of Eribulin in Combination With Bevacizumab for Second-line Treatment HER2- MBC Patients.

 Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is incurable, and the majority of patients succumb to their disease within 2 years of diagnosis.

 Patients with MBC usually receive treatment with endocrine or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, and treatment decisions are generally guided by the hormone receptor and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Negative status of the disease, the number and location of metastases, and prior treatment history in both adjuvant and metastatic settings.

 In first- and second-line treatment settings of Metastatic Breast Cancer, numerous cytotoxic chemotherapy agents have demonstrated activity, including anti-tubulin drugs (Taxanes, Vinorelbine), Anthracyclines, and anti-metabolites (Capecitabine, Gemcitabine).

 However, no single agent has demonstrated a clear survival advantage over another, and use of sequential single-agent therapies is the most frequent approach.

 The choice of chemotherapy agent(s) is often determined by a number of factors, including history of prior therapy, treatment-free interval, and patient preference.

 Thus, no single standard treatment exists for patients with advanced disease.

 Patients who progress during or after their first treatment for Metastatic Brest Cancer typically have a short progression-free interval of 4-6 months and survive for 8-12 months.

 New treatment modalities are needed to improve clinical outcome and maintain the quality of life for these patients.

In the second-line treatment setting for MBC, many agents, including antitubulin drugs (Taxanes, Vinorelbine) and antimetabolites (Capecitabine, Gemcitabine), have demonstrated activity, but no agent is clearly superior.

 Although some combinations of cytotoxic agents provide a small progression-free survival advantage, none has demonstrated an OS advantage, and toxicity is generally greater than for single agents.

 At present, there is no standard for this treatment setting.

 New treatments that could delay disease progression without systemic toxicity would represent a significant advancement.
