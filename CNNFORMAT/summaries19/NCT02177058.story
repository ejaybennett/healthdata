(fifthQuint)Reducing Hospitalizations of Nursing Home Residents.

 Hospitalizations of Nursing Home (NH) residents are frequent and associated with numerous complications and increased health care costs.

 Previous research suggests that as many as two-thirds of such hospitalizations may be avoidable.

 Anticipated changes in Medicare reimbursement will reduce financial incentives that favor hospitalization, but could result in reduced care quality if NH staff does not have the training and clinical tools to manage residents in the NH when acute changes occur.

 INTERACT (Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers) is a quality improvement program that utilizes tools based on established clinical guidelines.

 The tools target three key strategies to reduce potentially avoidable hospitalizations: 1) preventing conditions from becoming severe enough to require acute hospital care; 2) managing selected acute conditions in the NH; and 3) improving advance care planning for residents among whom a palliative or comfort care plan, rather than acute hospitalization, may be appropriate.

 Preliminary research involving 30 NHs demonstrated a 17% reduction in hospitalizations compared to the same six-month period in the previous year.

 The cost of the intervention was $7,700; projected savings to Medicare of reduced hospital admissions from a 100-bed NH were $125,000/year.

 While these results are promising, the effectiveness of INTERACT in reducing hospitalizations remains to be tested in a controlled trial.

 The proposed project will therefore involve an interdisciplinary team of experienced NH researchers in conducting a randomized controlled trial to test the implementation of the INTERACT program.

 NHs randomized to the INTERACT intervention will participate in 3-months of training, and receive support during the 12-month implementation period by an experienced nurse practitioner through regular multi-NH conference calls, monthly individual calls, and as-needed telephonic or email communication.

 The effects of implementing the INTERACT intervention on hospitalization rates will be compared to a randomly assigned group of usual care control NHs and a group that will self-monitor hospitalization rates only.

 The hypotheses to be tested are: 1) INTERACT implementation NHs will have a greater reduction in hospitalization rates than the control and monitoring only NHs during the 12-month implementation compared to a 12-month baseline period; and 2) reductions in Medicare expenditures for hospitalizations in the INTERACT intervention NHs will exceed the estimated costs of implementing the intervention.

 The specific aims of this project are to: 1.

 Determine the effectiveness of implementing the INTERACT quality improvement program in reducing hospitalization rates.

 2.

 Calculate the differences in Medicare expenditures for hospitalizations between NHs implementing INTERACT, the usual care control group, and NHs in the monitoring hospitalization rates only group.

 Reducing Hospitalizations of Nursing Home Residents@highlight

This project directly addresses the national imperative for innovative strategies to improve care for Medicare beneficiaries and reduce health care costs.

 The overall objective of the proposed project is to improve the care of older individuals who reside in nursing homes (NHs), and at the same time reduce unnecessary Medicare expenditures.

 This goal will be accomplished by testing a quality improvement program designed to reduce the number of avoidable hospitalizations of NH residents in a randomized controlled trial.

 The primary hypotheses to be tested are: Hypothesis1: Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers (INTERACT) implementation NHs will have a greater reduction in hospitalization rate than the control and monitoring only NHs during the 12-month implementation compared to a 12-month baseline period.

 Hypothesis 2: Reductions in Medicare expenditures for hospitalizations in the INTERACT implementation NHs will be greater than the estimated costs of implementing the intervention.

 Hypothesis 3: The effects of INTERACT on hospitalization rates will be greater among patients on the Medicare skilled benefit for post-acute care, than for long-stay patients.

 Hypothesis 4: The effects of INTERACT on hospitalization rates will be greatest among those NHs with higher vs.

 lower intensity (fidelity) of implementing the program.

 Hypothesis 5: There will be a greater reduction in measures of hospitalizations for conditions defined as "potentially preventable" than for other transfers and hospitalizations.

 Hypothesis 6: Implementation of INTERACT will not be associated with worsening of relevant quality measures in the participating NHs.
