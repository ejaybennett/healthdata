(fifthQuint)HealthMap: an Interactive Health Plan Randomised Trial to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease in People With HIV.

 Participants will be consenting adults 30 years or older without evidence of cardiovascular disease.

The study is a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial of a complex health system intervention with doctor as the unit of randomization and individual patient outcomes defined as primary and secondary endpoints.

 The primary endpoint will be assessed in each participant after 12 months of follow up.

The study intervention will consist of a programme specifically designed for the Australian clinical context that helps people with HIV and their health care providers achieve best practice targets for modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.

 The programme will be available to use during routine consultations to present laboratory results, discuss health priorities and describe goals and actions.

 Patients will be able to access the interactive health plan from home, with associated additional resources, including online peer support.

 Phone and online health coaching will be available for prioritised patients wanting to reduce their cardiovascular risk.

 The primary objective is to determine the effect of the intervention on 10-year risk of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death as estimated by the Framingham risk equation.

 The secondary objective is to alternative cardiovascular risk scores, individual modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life, mental health, self- management capacity, process and economic outcomes.

 HealthMap: an Interactive Health Plan Randomised Trial to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease in People With HIV@highlight

The purpose of this study is to improve the health status of people living with HIV in Australia.

 The overall goal is to rigorously evaluate the impact of interactive health plans and self-management support on chronic condition outcomes in people with HIV.

 The specific aims are to: Aim 1: Using a doctor-level cluster randomised trial, evaluate the effect of interactive health plans and self-management support on coronary heart disease risk and other chronic condition outcomes in people living with HIV.

 Aim 2: Evaluate patient and health care provider experiences and acceptability of interactive health plans and self-management support.

 Aim 3: Evaluate intervention cost-effectiveness and effect on health service utilisation.
