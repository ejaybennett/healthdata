(secondQuint)Safety and Feasibility Study of Intranasal Mesenchymal Trophic Factor (MTF) for Treatment of Asthma.

 The proposed study will assess primary safety and secondary efficacy endpoints of allogeneic UC-MSC-derived MTF administered to patients with asthma.

 Each patient will receive intra-nasal MTF once per week for a period of 4 weeks.
