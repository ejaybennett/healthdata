(fifthQuint)TWILIGHT Study: Effect of Light Exposure During Acute Rehabilitation on Sleep After TBI.

 The investigators will recruit persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) on admission to intensive rehabilitation units.

 Consented participants (who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria) will wear an actigraphy watch for 2 nights to obtain a baseline for sleep pattern identification.

 Prior to treatment, baseline measures (detailed below) will be obtained.

 Participants will be randomized to receive either Bright White Light (BWL) or Red Light (RL) treatment.

 Light therapy treatments will be given for 30 minutes daily in the morning for 10 days, and an Actiwatch will be worn continuously during that period.

 At the end of 10 days, outcome measures will be obtained (as below).

 The specific period of treatment may be affected by the length of stay on the rehabilitation unit.

 For lengths of stay less than the 10 days, subjects will receive the intervention until the day of discharge at which time the outcome measures will be administered.

 The investigators primary outcome measure with be the actigraphic measurement of sleep efficiency.

 Other secondary measures will be participation in therapy, sleepiness, and attention.

 The investigators will also evaluate the anticipated device costs and clinical staff burden involved in utilizing light therapy exposure in an inpatient rehabilitation clinical setting.

 TWILIGHT Study: Effect of Light Exposure During Acute Rehabilitation on Sleep After TBI@highlight

This study proposes to investigate how well Bright White Light Therapy will work in the acute inpatient rehabilitation units for people whom have experienced a traumatic brain injury for the purpose of treating sleep disruption.

 Participants will be assessed based on sleep efficiency, thinking abilities, therapy participation, and perception of fatigue/sleepiness.

 In previous studies dim red light has not had the same effects on function as bright white light, and will be chosen for use as a placebo.

 Each subject will be randomized to receive 30 minutes of either Bright White Light Therapy or Red Light Treatment each morning for 10 days.

 To measure the effect of this treatment, the investigators will measure the each participants sleep daily by using an actigraph watch.

 This watch will record movement continuously.

 The investigators will also measure the subjects' report of how well they slept, whether fatigue is present, and how attentive they are before and after treatment.

 Research Hypothesis: In persons with TBI, prospectively compare overnight sleep in a cohort exposed to morning Bright White Light with a comparison group exposed to Red Light in an acute inpatient rehabilitation setting.
