(firstQuint)Extending Preservation and Assessment Time of Donor Lungs Using the Toronto EVLP System at a Dedicated EVLP Facility.

 Human donor lungs allocated to a participating study transplant center (Study Center) for a specific recipient and meeting study EVLP donor lung inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed by SPONSOR for inclusion into the study.

 Upon retrieval, donor lung(s) will be packaged and transported on ice to the SPONSOR's EVLP facility in Silver Spring, Maryland, no differently than when lungs are recovered, packaged, and transported to any transplant center for implantation.

 The EVLP procedure will be performed by Certified Ex Vivo Lung Specialists using the Toronto EVLP System cent for up to 6 hours, collecting and relaying lung function assessment data hourly or as requested by the Study Center transplant surgeon.

 Additionally, the Study Center surgeon will have the capability to evaluate lung function data and monitor the procedure remotely through a dedicated video link.

 Upon acceptance of an EVLP donor lung by the Study Center, the single lung or lung block is cooled down by the Toronto EVLP System cent to 10 degrees C.

 Thereafter, perfusion and ventilation are stopped and the lung is prepared for hypothermic storage and transport to the accepting Study Center.

This is a safety study to compare the safety of receiving a lung treated with the Toronto EVLP System cent by SPONSOR in SPONSOR's dedicated facility against standard lung transplantation.
