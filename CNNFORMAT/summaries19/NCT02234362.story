(thirdQuint)Vortioxetine for Menopausal Depression.

 Forty-seven peri- and postmenopausal women were enrolled in this open-label study.

 This was an 8-week intervention using open-label vortioxetine with flexible dose between 5-20 mg, dependent on participant response and tolerability.

 In addition to assessment of depressive symptoms, improvement of menopause-related physical and emotional symptoms that occur with MDD, including vasomotor symptoms, cognition, fatigue, anxiety, sleep complaints, and quality of life, were also examined.

 Vortioxetine for Menopausal Depression@highlight

The broad goal of this study was to examine the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine (flexible dose) for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in symptomatic women around the menopausal transition.

 We hypothesized that an eight-week treatment with vortioxetine would promote a significant improvement of depression symptoms and other menopause-related physical symptoms.
