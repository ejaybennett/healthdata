(fifthQuint)The Cost in Oxygen of Surgical Trauma.

 Prospective observational study of non-invasive measurements of VO2 and DO2 pre-operatively and at 8 time points in the 48 hours postoperatively in a cohort of 40 patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery (both open and laparoscopic) with a pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).

 As pilot work examining the relationship between post-operative oxygen consumption and complications in patients having contemporary major abdominal surgery , the investigators need to define and grade the severity of complications.

 The Post-Operative Morbidity Survey (POMS) is a simple outcome scale designed to record the incidence of clinically important complications - specifically complications likely to keep a patient in hospital.

 A POMS score performed on Day 5 is likely to be discriminative between patients who are recovering well, and those who are developing complications.

 POMS is easily performed, has good internal validity and is predictive of a prolonged length of stay.

 POMS is not a simple additive scale; however patients with POMS score of 1 or greater are highly likely to remain in hospital, whereas those with a score of 0 are likely to be able to go home.

 The Cost in Oxygen of Surgical Trauma@highlight

The investigators will examine the relationship between post-operative oxygen consumption (using non-invasive measurement technology ) and complications in patients having contemporary major abdominal surgery.

 The investigators hypothesis is that major surgery may trigger a physiological stress response that results in an increase in post-operative metabolic demand and oxygen consumption (VO2) which must be met by an increased oxygen delivery (DO2).
