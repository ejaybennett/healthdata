(secondQuint)The Life After Stopping Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Study (The LAST Study).

 This is a non-randomized, prospective, single-group longitudinal study.

 The overall objective is to improve decision making for TKI discontinuation in eligible CML patients.

 Patients with CML on treatment with imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib and are in confirmed deep molecular response will stop their TKI.

 Confirmed deep molecular response is defined as BCR-ABL MR4 i.

e.

 > 4 log reduction) for at least 2 years.

 The study will closely monitor patients using standard RQ-PCR testing for molecular recurrence, testing them monthly for 6 months, then every other month until 24 months, and then quarterly until 36 months.

 Concurrently, the study will assess a wide range of PROs before stopping TKIs and after discontinuation in conjunction with PCR testing, though at fewer time points, utilizing online and/or phone questionnaires.

 Patients who have molecular CML recurrence based on RQ-PCR will restart imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib and will continue to be monitored for disease status and health status until the end of the study.
