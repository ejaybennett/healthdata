(thirdQuint)Prediction of Recurrent Events With 18F-Fluoride.

 The investigators intend to recruit 700 patients hospitalised with myocardial infarction and proven multivessel coronary artery disease.

 All patients will undergo a combined CT coronary angiogram (CTCA) and PET scan using 18F-NaF as a tracer.

 Patients will then have clinical follow-up before undergoing a repeat CTCA at 2 years to assess progression of coronary disease.

 Clinical review of all patients will continue until study completion (given 2 years of recruitment this is likely to last 4 years) and following this the investigators will continue to monitor for further cardiovascular events via review of patient electronic health records for a further 5 years.

 Prediction of Recurrent Events With 18F-Fluoride@highlight

This is a multi-centre observational study.

 It will make use of the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) as a marker of coronary plaque vulnerability to detect culprit and non-culprit unstable coronary plaques in patients with recent myocardial infarctions.

 The investigators will then perform long-term follow-up of these patients to determine the prognostic significance of coronary 18F-NaF uptake
