(secondQuint)An Efficacy and Safety Study of a 8 or 12-Week Treatment Regimen of Simeprevir in Combination With Sofosbuvir in Treatment-Naive and Experienced Participants With Chronic Genotype 4 Hepatitis C Virus Infection.

 This is a partly randomized, open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer and study staff), multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study.

 The study will consist of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, an open-label treatment period of 8 weeks or 12 weeks, and a post-treatment follow-up period until 24 weeks after end of treatment (EOT).

 Participants without cirrhosis will be assigned to Group A wherein half of the participants will receive 8 week treatment in Group A1 and remaining participants will receive 12 week treatment in Group A2.

 Participants with cirrhosis, will be assigned to Group B to receive simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir for 12 weeks.

 The duration of participation for each participant, including the screening period, will be approximately 36 or 40 weeks for 8 or 12 week treatment, respectively.

 Efficacy will be primarily assessed by percentage of participants with SVR12.

 Participants' safety will be evaluated throughout the study.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir for 8 or 12 weeks versus a historical control, with respect to the percentage of participants with sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after end of treatment (SVR12) in the overall population.
