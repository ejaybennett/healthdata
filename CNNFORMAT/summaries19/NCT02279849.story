(fifthQuint)Multi-level Communications and Access Strategies to Improve the Food Environment.

 Innovative and culturally appropriate multilevel health communications interventions are desperately needed to address the chronic disease epidemic in high-risk populations, such as low-income urban African Americans.

 However, the vast majority of communications strategies have focused on educating individual consumers about healthy food choices, while in poor urban settings the lower availability of affordable healthy food choices greatly limits the impact of these messages.

 The study team worked with 1 wholesaler and 24 small retail food stores to develop and test novel strategies in Baltimore, Maryland, including: 1) multilevel health communications alone directed at wholesalers, retailers and low-income African American consumers intended to enhance willingness to stock and/or purchase healthy foods; 2) pricing strategies (performance based allowances) directed at wholesalers and retailers to increase their stocking of healthy foods at reduced prices; and 3) combined health communications and pricing strategies.

 Intervention strategies were tailored to meet the needs of the target populations based on formative research and stakeholder input.

 This research study is based on significant field experience in this setting, including the development of evaluation tools to assess change in stocking and pricing of key foods (at the store level), and psychosocial factors, dietary intake, and food purchasing behaviors (at the consumer level).

 There are 3 main study aims: 1.

 Formative research with representatives of multiple levels of the Baltimore food environment (i.

e.

, local wholesalers and retail food store owners) in order to select key foods for promotion, determine appropriate communication strategies (e.

g.

, messages, channels, materials) for each level, and select the most appropriate pricing approach (i.

e.

, performance based allowance structure and stipulations).

 2.

 Pilot the multilevel program with three wholesalers and 24 food stores (6 control, 6 health communications only, 6 pricing only, 6 combined), and assess program implementation through detailed process evaluation.

 3.

 Assess impact of the pilot program on a) the stocking, pricing, marketing, and sales volume of promoted foods at wholesale and retail levels, and b) food purchasing behaviors and associated psychosocial variables (i.

e.

, self-efficacy, intentions, perceived cost) at the consumer level (final sample n=12 consumers/store, 288 total).

 The proposed research seeks to develop effective, multilevel communication strategies to improve diet and reduce risk for diet-related chronic diseases.

 The study team anticipates this design will demonstrate the value of a multi-pronged and multilevel health communications approach to obesity and chronic disease prevention, and will lead to a large-scale trial and informed policies designed to improve food availability and affordability in low-income urban settings.

 Multi-level Communications and Access Strategies to Improve the Food Environment@highlight

The overarching goal of B'More Healthy Retail Rewards (BHRR) is to develop, implement, and evaluate a pilot multi-level communications and pricing intervention to improve access to and consumption of healthy foods in low-income areas of Baltimore City, Maryland.

 BHRR has three primary aims: (1) to conduct formative research with representatives of multiple levels of the Baltimore food environment (i.

e.

, local wholesalers, retail food store owners, and consumers) in order to select key foods for promotion, and determine appropriate communications and healthy food price reduction strategies, (2) to pilot the multi-level program with 2 local wholesale stores, and 24 small corner stores and their customers, and assess program implementation through detailed process evaluation, and (3) to assess impact of multilevel health communications and pricing strategies, combined and separately, on consumer dietary patterns and food source use, food purchasing behaviors, psychosocial variables, food security, and individual weight and height.
