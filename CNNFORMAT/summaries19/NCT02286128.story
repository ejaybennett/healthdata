(fifthQuint)Effect of NF-B Dependent Proinflammation on Osteogenic Differentiation of the Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Type 2 Diabetes.

 This study aims to explore whether proinflammation in type 2 diabetes is an mechanism underlined higher RAGE activation and osteoblast differentiation defect demonstrated in the MSC of type 2 diabetes, as well as the effects of the proinflammation on cellular differentiation and apoptosis of the MSC.

 Type 2 diabetes was known to be in proinflammatory state due to NF-B-dependent cytokine secretion (for example, TNF-, IL1 and IL6), which in turn contribute to NF-B upregulation.

 Because RAGE expression is partly regulated by NF-B signal, the NF-B upregulation in proinflammatory state observed in type 2 diabetes may entail RAGE overactivation in this population.

 Therefore, the proinflammatory state and its correlation to cellular NF-B-dependent RAGE activation is noteworthy to be determined in the MSC of type 2 diabetes.

 Furthermore, the effect of proinflammation on differentiation potential and apoptosis of the MSC in type 2 diabetes remains to be elucidated.

 Effect of NF-B Dependent Proinflammation on Osteogenic Differentiation of the Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Type 2 Diabetes@highlight

This study determines whether NF-B dependent proinflammatory state found in type 2 diabetes yield to a higher RAGE activation in the mesenchymal stem cell, as well as the effects of the proinflammation on osteoblast differentiation impairment and cellular apoptosis in type 2 diabetic patients.

 This study will compare non-diabetic control subjects and type 2 diabetic patients with metformin monotherapy failure in the aspect of 1) serum markers for NF-B dependent proinflammatory state and its intracellular signals, 2) osteogenic differentiation and apoptosis of the mesenchymal stem cells, and 3) serum AGE, RAGE and cellular RAGE activation.
