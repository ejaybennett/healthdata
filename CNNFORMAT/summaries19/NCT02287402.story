(thirdQuint)Postmarketing Clinical Study on AO-128.

 The -glucosidase inhibitor voglibose was developed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.

 Ltd and is one of the most commonly used oral antidiabetic agents in Japan.

 Voglibose is used as first-line treatment for improvement of postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetic patients with inadequate response to diet and exercise therapy and as add-on treatment to other oral antidiabetic drugs and insulin.

 In 2009, voglibose was approved in Japan for the management of prediabetes (IGT).

 This study was a single-group, multi-center, open-label study.

 The study period consisted of a screening period of 1 week or less, a treatment period of 96 weeks or more, and a follow-up period of 48 weeks.

 However, if a patient was assessed as having type 2 diabetes mellitus or normoglycemia, the treatment period was to be ended, and only those assessed as normoglycemic were to proceed to follow-up.

 Follow-up was also to be terminated if patients were assessed as having IGT or type 2 diabetes mellitus during follow-up.
