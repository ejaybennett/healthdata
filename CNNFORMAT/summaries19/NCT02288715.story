(firstQuint)Relationship of Cerebral Perfusion Pressure Variability to Sepsis-associated Encephalopathy.

 Encephalopathy is a common complication of sepsis, impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation (AR) in patients with sepsis is considered related to Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE).

 As AR is important in stabilizing the cerebral perfusion pressure, whether greater variability of CPP is related to SAE and mortality or not remains unclear.

 We conduct this study to evaluate the relationship between them.

 Relationship of Cerebral Perfusion Pressure Variability to Sepsis-associated Encephalopathy@highlight

The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether variability of CPP (cerebral perfusion pressure) is related to sepsis-associated encephalopathy and outcomes of patients with sepsis.
