(thirdQuint)Gene-activated Matrix for Bone Tissue Repair in Maxillofacial Surgery.

 All patients enrolled into the study will receive standard surgery procedures indicated in accordance with medical care standards for the certain disease.

 Maxillofacial bone defects (formed after injuries, surgeries, excision of benign neoplasms and pseudotumors, teeth extraction, etc.

) or areas of alveolar bone atrophy will be the filled by gene-activated matrix "Nucleostim".

 Safety and efficacy of implanted osteoplastic material will be assessed by physical examination, comprehensive laboratory tests, X-ray examination within 60 days after operation.
