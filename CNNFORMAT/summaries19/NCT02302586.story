(thirdQuint)Thoracic Paravertebral Blockade in Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS).

 Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgeries (VATS) include significant postoperative acute and chronic pain because of trocar site tissue damages, intercostal nerve injuries and related inflammatory responses.

 Poorly controlled pain in the early postoperative period usually causes chronic pain, and also affects patients' physiotherapy, mobilization and daily function.

 Our hypothesis in this study is 'thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is associated with an improvement in control of acute and chronic pain after VATS compared to systemic analgesia.

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgeries (VATS) include severe postoperative acute pain which is also a predictor of chronic pain.

 In this study, the investigators aim to compare the postoperative effects of thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) and intravenous patient controlled analgesia (PCA) on the prevention of chronic pain of patients undergoing VATS.
