(secondQuint)Effectiveness and Feasibility of Delivering an Education Program to Patients With an Acute Exacerbation of COPD.

 Following an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) evidence strongly suggests that all patients should be discharged with an action plan, consisting of identified patient responsibilities for their ongoing care and advice on recognizing and seeking help in the event of future acute exacerbations.

 Despite these recommendations, structured chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) specific education is rarely offered within acute hospital settings and, in addition, research in this area is limited.

 This study aims to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of an introductory education program delivered during and shortly after an AECOPD hospitalization.
