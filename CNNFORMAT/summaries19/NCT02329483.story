(fifthQuint)Monitoring the Early Follicular Phase With Androstenedione in Low-dose Step-up Ovulation Induction in High Responders.

 50 patients with anticipated high ovarian response, who are being planned to be conventionally treated with low-dose step-up ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination will be analysed in this study.

 At every control day including the start day, blood samples taken for blood estradiol (and if required progesterone) measurements will be used to measure blood androstenedione and total testosterone levels, as well.

 Hence, we will have defined an early parameter for defining follicular response in the first 5-7 days of low-dose step-up ovulation induction.

 Low-dose step-up ovulation induction will be started at 50-75Units/day of rhFSH and the dose will be increased at not earlier than the 7th day at an increment of +37,5Units/day unless a response is observed ( which is at least a 10mm follicle, selected for growth).

 If more than 3 dominant follicles are selected, the cycle will be cancelled.

 Otherwise, when at least one follicle >16mm is obtained, a 150Microgram sc.

 injection will be administered for ovulation trigger and intrauterine insemination made at the 34th-36th hours.

 Monitoring the Early Follicular Phase With Androstenedione in Low-dose Step-up Ovulation Induction in High Responders@highlight

This study aims to predefine the threshold FSH doses during the early follicular phases in low- dose step-up ovulation induction cycles used to treat anticipated high responders by monitoring total testosterone and androstenedione blood levels.

 The blood levels of total testosterone and androstenedione levels will be measured in patients at the starting day and at every control day when vaginal sonographic folliculometries and blood estradiol measurements are made.

 Hence, we are aiming to define an early monitoring parameter by which we will be able to define a follicular response to treatment before estradiol rise or apparently selected follicular growth.
