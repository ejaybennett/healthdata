(thirdQuint)Metabolic Anomolies Associated With the 6 Month Clinical Evolution of Patients Suffering From Motor Conversion Disorder.

 The secondary objectives of this study are: A.

 To assess whether metabolic abnormalities objectified by PET CT 18 FDH performed at rest at the onset of symptoms may be predictive of persistent disability at 6 months as measured by the EDSS, the NIHSS and WHO status.

 B.

 To assess whether metabolic abnormalities objectified by PET CT 18 FDH performed at rest at 3 months after diagnosis may be predictive of persistent motor disability at 6 months (EDSS, NIHSS, mRS, WHO) C.

 To search for and characterize any abnormalities of metabolism objectified in the initial PET CT 18 FDH predictive of persistent motor disability at 3 months.

 D.

 To determine if there are persistent metabolic abnormalities 3 months post-diagnosis independently of the clinical course (marker trait).

 E.

 Define the brain areas whose metabolism is often altered in patients with motor conversion disorders.

 F.

 Establish a collection of biological samples from patients for future research studies of prognostic biomarkers of a motor conversion disorder.

 Metabolic Anomolies Associated With the 6 Month Clinical Evolution of Patients Suffering From Motor Conversion Disorder@highlight

The main objective of this study is to make a first evaluation of the relationship between metabolic abnormalities objectified by Positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro- D-glucose integrated with computed tomography (PET CT 18 FDH) performed at rest at the onset of symptoms in patients with a first episode of motor conversion disorder and the persistence of a motor disability at 6 months measured by the modified Rankin score (mRS).
