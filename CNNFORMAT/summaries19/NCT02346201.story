(fifthQuint)Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2.

 ADMET 2 will examine in a masked, randomized trial the efficacy of methylphenidate for the treatment of clinically significant apathy in participants with Alzheimer's dementia.

 Efficacy will be assessed as the change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory Apathy subscale (NPI apathy) from baseline to 6 months and score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 6 months.

 ADMET 2 will also examine the safety of methylphenidate for the treatment of clinically significant apathy in participants with Alzheimer's disease by measuring vital signs, electrolyte panels, adverse event reports, and electrocardiograms.

 Safety will also be measured by examining neuropsychiatric symptoms other than apathy using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).

 Changes from baseline to 6 months in other neuropsychological assessments as measured using the Dementia Apathy Interview and Rating (DAIR) scale will also be assessed.

 Cost-effectiveness will be measured by assessing quality of life and economic assessment and cognitive changes using a cognitive battery that includes the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and other scales.

 Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2@highlight

Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2) is a Phase III, placebo-controlled, masked, 6 month, 10-center randomized clinical trial sponsored by National Institutes of Aging involving 200 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

 ADMET 2 is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate as treatment for clinically significant apathy in AD participants.

 ADMET 2 will enroll participants from real world settings such as outpatient, nursing home, and assisted living facilities and will examine the effects of methylphenidate on apathy and cognition.

 ADMET 2 will also conduct careful safety monitoring.
