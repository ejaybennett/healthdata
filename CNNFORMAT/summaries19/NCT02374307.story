(thirdQuint)Falls-prevention in Older People Receiving Home-help Services.

 Falls and falls-related injuries are considered a serious public health issue in the older population.

 Strength and balance exercise in combination with information about falls prevention seems to be effective in reducing falls, but less is known about the effect of this kind of intervention on quality of life.

 Previous studies have shown that older people living at home and receiving home-help services seem to be at high risk of falling.

 We will therefore conduct a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of a falls prevention program on quality of life, fear of falling, falls and physical function in community-dwelling older people who receive home-help services.

 In addition, the cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed.
