(thirdQuint)18F-FES PET/CT in Imaging Patients With Desmoid Tumors.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Establish the avidity of desmoid tumors on 18F-FES PET/CT imaging.

 II.

 Correlate 18F-FES PET avidity with degree of estrogen receptor (ER) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo 18F-FES PET/CT imaging over 30 minutes.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days.

 18F-FES PET/CT in Imaging Patients With Desmoid Tumors@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies fluorine (F)-18 16 alpha-fluoroestradiol (18F-FES) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in imaging patients with desmoid tumors.

 18F-FES binds to estrogen receptors, which are present on desmoid tumors, and gives off radiation that may be detected by PET and CT scans.

 The PET/CT scan forms an image that may show where tumor cells with estrogen receptors can be found in the body.
