(secondQuint)Biliary Drainage in Patients With Duodenal Metal Stent.

 This is a multinational multicenter retrospective cohort study to evaluate the outcomes of endoscopic biliary drainage in patients with a duodenal SEMS.

 Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD), including choledochoduodenostomy, hepaticogastrostomy, antegrade biliary stenting or a combination, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stenting are to be compared.

 Specifically, the outcomes are to be evaluated according to the timing of distal MBO in relation to GOO and the location of GOO.
