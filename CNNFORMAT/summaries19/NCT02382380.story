(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Gadoterate in Patients With Decreased Kidney Function.

 Gadolinium-based intravenous contrast agents are widely used for the enhancement of MRI findings.

 However, these agents have been implicated in varying degrees of nephrotoxicity and therefore are not usually used in patients with renal dysfunction.

 Gadoterate is a Gadolinium agent and previous studies have indicated that it is safe in patients with decreased kidney function.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using Gadoterate in this patient population.

 Participants who have been scheduled for an MRI will choose to either receive Gadoterate contrast as part of their MRI or not receive Gadoterate as part of their MRI.

 Evaluation of Gadoterate in Patients With Decreased Kidney Function@highlight

This study is for individuals with decreased kidney function whose doctor has ordered Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

 Because kidney function is decreased, these patients usually do not receive the intravenous contrast material that can improve the accuracy of the MRI findings.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and benefit of using a contrast material called Gadoterate in patients with decreased kidney function.
