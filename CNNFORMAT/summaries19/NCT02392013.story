 Home Hazard Removal Program to Reduce Falls@highlight

This study evaluates the effectiveness and implementation of a home-hazard removal program to reduce falls in older adults through a community program delivered through the aging services network.

 The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness/implementation trial of 300 older adults at risk for a fall who will be randomized to a home-hazard removal program or usual care and then followed for 12 months.

 Investigators will look at the number of falls at 6 months and 12 months.
