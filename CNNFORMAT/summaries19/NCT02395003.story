(thirdQuint)Study to Investigate Adipocyte Cell and Lipid Turnover in Obese Adolescents.

 The purpose of this study is to test whether the reduced transcription of key lipogenic/adipogenic genes in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in obese adolescents with a High VAT/SAT (visceral adipose tissue/subcutaneous adipose tissue) ratio translates functionally into a reduced in vivo triglyceride (TG) synthesis and adipocyte proliferation, which in turn will contribute to ectopic fat accumulation and insulin resistance (IR).

 To test whether the storage capacity of gluteal SAT is linked to the level of VAT/SAT fat distribution in obese adolescents.

 To explore if changes in dietary fat intake (palmitate intake), alters ceramide concentration in both plasma and adipose tissue (AT) and the Inflammasome complex in the different fat distribution phenotypes and their associations with IR.

Insulin Resistance is the best predictor of whether the obese adolescent will develop type 2 diabetes.

 The present studies will focus on determining what might cause fat to accumulate in the subcutaneous fat regions and lead to local inflammation, causing insulin resistance to develop in obese adolescents.
