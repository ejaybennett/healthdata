(fifthQuint)The INDORSE Study: Inhibition of Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV: Outcomes on Renal Sodium Excretion.

 Background: DPP-4 inhibition improves glycemic control, modestly reduces blood pressure and may also reduce albuminuria in patients with Type 2 diabetes; effects which occur without significantly modifying heart rate or body weight.

 While preclinical studies have demonstrated that DPP-4 inhibition acutely increases urinary sodium excretion in addition to other favorable renal effects (anti-inflammatory, anti-proteinuric), few studies have examined the renal effects of DPP-4 inhibition either acutely or following short-term therapy in humans with type 2 diabetes.

 Considering the world-wide prevalence of Type 2 diabetes and the increasing use of DPP-4 inhibitors amongst patients, it is important to ascertain potential non-glycemic effects of DPP-4 inhibitors including those within the kidney.

 Study Objectives: To determine effect(s) of DPP-4 inhibition on tubular sodium handling, renal hemodynamics, and renal function.

 Study Design: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, Phase IV.

 Study Patients: 32 patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Systolic Hypertension (SBP 120-160 mmHg).

 Endpoints: Fractional excretion of sodium, renal function (measured GFR), renal hemodynamics (effective renal plasma flow, filtration fraction, renal blood flow, renal vascular resistance), systemic hemodynamics (non-invasive cardiac monitoring), plasma neurohormones, urinary vasoactive mediators, markers of free radical stress.

 The INDORSE Study: Inhibition of Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV: Outcomes on Renal Sodium Excretion@highlight

Background: Dedicated renal hemodynamic and renal function studies are lacking for DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with Type 2 diabetes; accordingly little is known regarding the mechanisms mediating the renal effects of DPP-4 inhibitors in humans.

 Objectives: To evaluate the effect of DPP-4 inhibition acutely (single dose) and following short-term therapy (28 days) on renal sodium handling and renal hemodynamics and function in patients with type 2 diabetes and systolic hypertension.

 Design: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, Phase IV.

 Patient population: 32 patients with Type 2 diabetes, HbA1c (6.

5%-9%), with systolic blood pressure ranging from 120-160 mmHg.

 Intervention: subjects will be randomized (1:1) to either sitagliptin (100 mg daily) or to placebo (1 tablet daily) for 28 days.

 Endpoints: Fractional excretion of sodium, renal function, and renal hemodynamics.
