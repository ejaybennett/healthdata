(secondQuint)Dexamethasone for Treatment of Radiation-related Fatigue in Patients Receiving RT for Head-neck and Lung Cancer.

 Subjects will randomly receive either dexamethasone or placebo and begin the study medication during the midpoint of their radiation treatment.

 Study medication will be taken for 14 straight days then stopped.

 Fatigue and quality of life will be measured weekly with short patient completed surveys.

 The number of breaks taken during radiation treatment will also be tracked.

 For safety, blood sugar levels will be checked with finger stick blood draws because dexamethasone is known to cause these levels to increase.

 Study participation will be approximately 3 months.
