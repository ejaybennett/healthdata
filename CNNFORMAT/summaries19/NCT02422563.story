(secondQuint)NeoAdjuvant Chemotherapy Followed by Radical Hysterectomy (OP) Versus Primary Chemo-RADiation in Cervical Cancer FIGO Stage IB2 and IIB.

 The optimal treatment for patients with cervical cancer on FIGO stage IB2 and IIB is controversial.

 There is no randomized comparison of a dose-dense NACT (TP or TIP-schedule) followed by hysterectomy and LNE (investigational Arm A) versus primary chemo-radiation (standard arm B).

 Primary endpoint is the DFS at 5 years, secondary endpoints local control at 5 years, OS at 5 years, QOL, questionnaires on sexual activity/QOL.
