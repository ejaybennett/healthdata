(thirdQuint)Nutraceutical Combination in Patients With Low-grade Systemic Inflammation.

 Will be included in the study 100 subjects with suboptimal LDL cholesterol levels (LDL 100-160 mg / dL) and hsCRP levels> 2 mg / L, divided into two groups of equal numbers, matched by by sex and age, randomized to receive a nutraceutical combination containing red yeast 200 mg, berberine 500 mg and policosanol 10 mg (NC) in combination with a low-cholesterol diet (<200 mg / day) or a low-cholesterol diet only (Standard of Care - SOC).

 All subjects at the time of inclusion in the study protocol will be prescribed the SOC for a period of 30 days (Lipid Stabilization Period: LSP); After 30 days LSP it will be performed randomization in the two intervention arms: NC + SOC or SOC.

 Nutraceutical Combination in Patients With Low-grade Systemic Inflammation@highlight

The investigators tested if a nutraceutical combination with red yeast rice, berberine and policosanol (NC) can significantly modify inflammation, lipid profile and markers of endothelial injury (endothelial microparticles) in subjects with elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).
