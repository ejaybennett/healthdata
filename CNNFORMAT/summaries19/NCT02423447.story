(thirdQuint)Comparison of the Airway Clearance Efficacy of Electro Flo 5000 and the G5 Flimm-Fighter in Patients With CF.

 The investigators hope to enroll 25 patients with cystic fibrosis (with daily sputum production) in this study.

 It is the goal of the proposed study to compare the efficacy, as assessed primarily by sputum weight, of these two different devices (the Electroflo 500 and the G5 Flimm-Fighter) for airway clearance (AC) in CF patients with mild to moderate lung disease, who have stable lung health and perform AC at home as part of their routine therapeutic regimen.
