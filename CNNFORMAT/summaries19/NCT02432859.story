(firstQuint)Electrical Stimulation and Expression of VEGF, VEGFR-2, HIF and NO in the Diabetic Foot Ulcer.

 30 type 2 diabetic patients with ischemic foot ulceration were enrolled.

 Patients were randomly assigned to electrical stimulation (ES, n=15) or sham ES (placebo, n=15) groups.

 ES group received cathodal direct current for 1 h/day, 3 days/week, for 4 weeks (12 sessions).

 Wound fluid sample was collected for VEGF, VEGFR-2, HIF-1 and NO measurement in the first and last treatment sessions before and after intervention.

 Wound surface area (WSA) was measured at 1st, 6th, and 12th session.

 Electrical Stimulation and Expression of VEGF, VEGFR-2, HIF and NO in the Diabetic Foot Ulcer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether electrical stimulation is effective in the expression of VEGF, VEGFR-2, HIF-1 and NO and healing in diabetic foot ulcer.
