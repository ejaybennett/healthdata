(firstQuint)Active Surveillance Exercise Clinical Trial.

 This is a PI initiated, randomized clinical trial of exercise vs.

 usual care among men opting for active surveillance for prostate cancer.

 The AS RCT study is a randomized controlled trial of 16-weeks aerobic exercise (e.

g.

, brisk walking) vs.

 usual care among 150 men with prostate cancer on active surveillance.

 After obtaining written informed consent, enrolled subjects will be scheduled for the baseline assessments.

 The men randomized to the Intervention Arm will engage in an individually tailored aerobic exercise program (home-based walking) following the principles of aerobic exercise training guidelines for adults as recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM).

 The men in the Control Arm will be asked to continue their typical exercise practices for 16 weeks.

 Men in both arms will be asked to complete questionnaires at baseline and at week 16, months 12 & 24.

 Specimens from biopsy will be reviewed by the investigators' collaborator, GenomeDx, for RNA characterization and assessment of the genomic risk scores.

 There is also a non-randomized observational component to the study where we will collect biospecimens, survey, data, and administer one CPET.

 Individuals who will be enrolled to this group include those who do not meet all eligibility criteria for the RCT, or those who do not wish to be in a RCT, but are interested to participate in some lifestyle research.

 This group also provides us with a larger more heterogeneous population to follow long term to examine associations between exercise, biomarkers, fitness metrics, and clinical and psychosocial outcomes.
