(thirdQuint)Continuous Infusion of Ropivacaine Hydrochloride in Reducing Pain After Surgery in Patients With Bladder Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine if continuous infusion of local anesthesia (CILA) decreases post-operative pain after radical cystectomy (RC).

 II.

 To determine if CILA reduces narcotic requirements after RC.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine if CILA decreases length-of-stay after RC.

 II.

 To determine if CILA improves patients satisfaction with post-operative pain control after RC.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive ropivacaine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) continuously over 72 hours after radical cystectomy.

 ARM II: Patients receive normal saline (placebo) IV continuously over 72 hours after radical cystectomy.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up within 30 days.

 Continuous Infusion of Ropivacaine Hydrochloride in Reducing Pain After Surgery in Patients With Bladder Cancer@highlight

This randomized phase IV trial studies how well the continuous infusion of ropivacaine hydrochloride works in reducing pain after surgery in patients with bladder cancer.

 Ropivacaine hydrochloride is an anesthetic drug used to decrease pain by numbing an area of the body without putting the patient to sleep.

 Continuous infusion of ropivacaine hydrochloride may reduce pain and improve the quality of life for patients after bladder surgery.
