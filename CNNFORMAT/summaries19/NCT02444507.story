 This study is designed to assess the bioequivalence of esomeprazole of the TEST product vs.

 the REFERENCE product in healthy volunteers who reside in Taiwan.

 Bioequivalence will be assumed if the 90% confidence interval of the AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax ratio are within the 80-125% interval for log-transformed values.
