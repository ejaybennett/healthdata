(fifthQuint)Re-Examination of Tumor Material and Re-Evaluation of Patient Data From Patients Treated With Neo-adjuvant Therapy.

 Tumor material collected from patients who received neoadjuvant therapy either with four cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m on day 1 every 21 days followed by four cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m on day 1 every 21 days or four cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m on day 1 every 21 days followed by four cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m on day 1 every 21 days will be re-analyzed with the MammaTyper Kit.

 The Kit is an in-vitro molecular diagnostic test for molecular subtyping of breast cancers into Luminal A & B, HER2 and Triple negative.

 It allows quantitative detection of the RNA expression status of the genes for estrogen receptor (ESR1), PgR, HER2 and Ki-67 on the basis of their mRNA present in the samples.

 This prospective diagnostic study will investigate the subtyping-results of the MammaTyper cent analysis and will compare them to the subtyping of the former immunohistochemical analysis performed.

 Based on the MammaTyper cent -subtypes the efficiency of the therapy regimen and the outcome will be re-evaluated from the patient data.

 Re-Examination of Tumor Material and Re-Evaluation of Patient Data From Patients Treated With Neo-adjuvant Therapy@highlight

This is a prospective examination of ribonucleic acid (RNA) extracted from tumor material of breast cancer patients treated with a neo-adjuvant therapy.

 The RNA will be analysed for expression of estrogen receptor (ER 1), progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2 and Ki-67 with MammaTyper cent .

 According to the determined values for the individual parameters at least 4 subtypes can be distinguished to date - Luminal A-type - Luminal B-type - HER2-type - Triple-negative-type As non-clinical endpoint, the agreement of new subtyping with Immunohistochemical methods will be evaluated.

 As clinical objective, the 5 year Distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) and Overall survival (OS) will be reevaluated according to the new subtyping.
