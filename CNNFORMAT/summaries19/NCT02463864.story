(thirdQuint)A Twice-Daily Individual Targeted Exercise Program in Frail Hospitalised Older Medical In-patients (RCT).

 It is well known that older medical patients can experience functional decline following an acute hospital admission and this can persist for up to three months.

 The targeted exercises are designed to prevent this functional decline by maintaining the patients' strength, balance and endurance.

 To counterbalance the considerable time spent with the physiotherapy services in the intervention arm, the control group will receive stretches and relaxation exercises.

 Patients' length of stay is the primary outcome measure.

 Their physical performance and quality of life at discharge and at 3 months post discharge and their readmission rates are the secondary outcome measures.

 A Twice-Daily Individual Targeted Exercise Program in Frail Hospitalised Older Medical In-patients (RCT)@highlight

This study will help to determine whether frail older medical inpatients will benefit from targeted exercise sessions performed twice daily while in hospital.

 Half of the patients will complete targeted strengthening, balance and endurance exercises and the other half, stretching and relaxation exercises.

 The exercise sessions will be assisted and supported by a senior physiotherapist.
