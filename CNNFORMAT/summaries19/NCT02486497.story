(thirdQuint)Adjuvant Gemcitabine Versus 5-FU/Leucovorin Based on hENT1 Immunostaining.

 After surgical resection of pancreatic cancer, the tissue is immunostained by hENT1 antibody.

 The grades of immunostaining are categorized as 0 (0%), 1 (=50%).

 According to the grade, patients with grade 0 or 1 will be treated with 5-FU and those with grade 2 will be treated with gemcitabine.

 After the study, investigators will calculate the overall survival and recurrence free survival of the patients and investigate the role of hENT1 as a predictive biomarker for adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy.

 Adjuvant Gemcitabine Versus 5-FU/Leucovorin Based on hENT1 Immunostaining@highlight

Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) is a membrane transporter which is a predicting marker for gemcitabine chemotherapy.

 However, there is a limited evidence of it as an indicator for adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy.

 In this study, investigators try to investigate the role of hENT1 as a indicator of selection of adjuvant chemotherapy regimen between gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
