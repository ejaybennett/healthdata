(thirdQuint)RRx-001 in Small, Non-small Cell Carcinoma, Ovarian Cancer and Neuroendocrine Tumors Prior to Re-administration of Platinum Based Doublet Regimens (QUADRUPLE THREAT).

 This is an open label, four 'cohort', five-arm, three stage, study for administration of RRx-001 with autologous blood once weekly until progression followed by or in combination with reintroduction of platinum-based doublet therapy according to the treatment schedule listed below: Subjects with SCC will receive one of the following; RRx-001 followed by platinum doublet chemotherapy or RRx-001 in combination with platinum based chemotherapy.

 HGNEC, RRx-001 followed by platinum doublet chemotherapy.

 NSCLC, RRx-001 followed by platinum doublet chemotherapy.

 Platinum Refractory/Resistant Ovarian and MMMT, RRx-001 followed by platinum doublet chemotherapy.

 In addition, all cohorts, following reintroduced platinum doublet, if stable disease or better (>SD) will receive maintenance RRx-001 until progression.

 The following number of patients may be enrolled under each study 'cohort': 26 patients with EGFR T790M negative NSCLC, 52 with SCC, 26 with HGNEC and 26 with resistant/refractory EOC or MMMT.

 RRx-001 in Small, Non-small Cell Carcinoma, Ovarian Cancer and Neuroendocrine Tumors Prior to Re-administration of Platinum Based Doublet Regimens (QUADRUPLE THREAT)@highlight

This study is designed to explore the potential of the epigenetic agent RRx-001 to sensitize patients who previously received and now have failed a platinum based doublet regimen.

 RRx-001 is administered with autologous blood once weekly followed by or in combination with reintroduction of platinum-based doublet therapy.
