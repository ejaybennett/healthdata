(secondQuint)Alvocidib Biomarker-driven Phase 2 AML Study.

 In Stage 1 of the study, all eligible AML patients with demonstrated NOXA BH3 priming of 40% by mitochondrial profiling in bone marrow will receive treatment with alvocidib, cytarabine and mitoxantrone [ACM ('FLAM') regimen].

 In Stage 2, all eligible AML patients with demonstrated NOXA BH3 priming of 40% by mitochondrial profiling in bone marrow will be randomized 1:1 to receive either treatment with ACM or CM (cytarabine and mitoxantrone).

 In the NDHR exploratory arm, all eligible patients with newly diagnosed high-risk (NDHR) AML with NOXA BH3 priming 40% by mitochondrial profiling in bone marrow will receive treatment with ACM.

 In the NOXA exploratory arm, all eligible AML patients with demonstrated NOXA BH3 priming of 30 - 39% by mitochondrial profiling in bone marrow will receive treatment with ACM.

 Alvocidib Biomarker-driven Phase 2 AML Study@highlight

The purpose of this two-stage Phase 2 study is to assess the clinical response (Complete Remission) to FLAM compared to AM treatment in refractory or relapsed AML patients with demonstrated NOXA BH3 priming of 40% by mitochondrial profiling in bone marrow.
