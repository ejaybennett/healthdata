(fifthQuint)Triple-Negative First-Line Study: Neoadjuvant Trial of Nab-Paclitaxel and MPDL3280A, a Pdl-1 Inhibitor in Patients With Triple Negative Breast Cancer.

 Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 21 days.

 You will receive the study drugs in 2 sets of 4 cycles (4 cycles before surgery and 4 cycles after surgery).

 On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will receive atezolizumab by vein over about 60 minutes.

 On Day 1 of each later cycle before and after surgery, if you tolerated the first infusion, you will receive future infusions of atezolizumab by vein over 30 minutes.

 You will receive nab-paclitaxel by vein over about 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1-4 before surgery.

 If you have side effects, the study doctor may decide to lower your dose of study drugs or have you stop taking the drugs.

 You may be able to restart the study drug later at the same or a lower dose.

 The study doctor will discuss this with you.

 Study Visits: On Day 1 of all cycles: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - During Cycle 3, you will have an ultrasound of your breast(s) before surgery.

 Additional imaging may be done as part of your routine care, if the doctor thinks it is needed.

 - During Cycle 3, blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) will be drawn before surgery and at the time of surgery.

 On Days 8 & 15 of Cycles 1-4, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

 Within 6 weeks after you have received 4 cycles of study drugs, you will have surgery as part of your standard of care and part of the tumor tissue that is removed during surgery will be collected for biomarker testing.

 You will be given a surgery consent form that describes the procedure and its risks.

 On Day 21 of Cycle 8, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

 Additional Research Testing: If there is any tumor tissue left over after study procedures, part of this tumor tissue will be sent to the sponsor (Genentech) for further biomarker and immune system testing.

 Before your samples are sent to the sponsor for banking, your name and any personal identifying information will be coded to protect your privacy.

 The sponsor will not have access to the codes that link the samples to your identity.

 MD Anderson will not have oversight of any leftover samples that will be banked by the sponsor for additional research.

 The tissue samples sent to the sponsor for this additional research will be used up during this planned testing.

 Length of Treatment: You may receive the study drugs for about 4 cycles before your surgery and about 4 cycles after your surgery (8 cycles total).

 You will no longer be able to take the study drug, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 You may be able to continue taking the study drugs if the disease gets worse if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

 Your participation on the study will be over after follow-up.

 Follow-Up: Every 6 months for up to 3 years, you will either have a clinic visit or you will be called by a member of the study staff and asked how you are doing.

 If you are called, each call should last about 15-20 minutes.

 Triple-Negative First-Line Study: Neoadjuvant Trial of Nab-Paclitaxel and MPDL3280A, a Pdl-1 Inhibitor in Patients With Triple Negative Breast Cancer@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if receiving atezolizumab and abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) in combination before surgery and atezolizumab alone after surgery can help to control breast cancer.

 The safety of this study drug combination will also be studied.

 This is an investigational stYou are being asked to take part in this study because you have breast cancer that has not responded to chemotherapy, and your doctor thinks it is unlikely to respond to additional standard chemotherapy when given before surgery.

 Atezolizumab is not FDA approved or commercially available.

 It is currently being used for research purposes only.

 Nab-paclitaxel is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of metastatic (has spread) breast cancer.

 The study doctor can explain how the study drug combination is designed to work.
