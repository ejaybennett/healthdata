(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Metformin Effect on Methylglyoxal in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.

 A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial of 120 adult patients will be conducted from June 2015 to June 2017 (2 years).

 Study participants will be recruited from the University of Arizona Medical Center, South Campus clinics (Endocrine clinic, family medicine clinic and general medicine clinic).

 Eighty patients with HbA1c* >6.

0% will be randomized to receive either metformin or a similar inactive placebo for 6 weeks.

 The response of these patients will be compared to 40 patients with normal HbA1c 1/2M range, respectively via mass spectrometry.

 Investigators will be normalizing these values by specific gravity.

 A logbook will be provided to each participant to record their blood sugar measurements at home.

 Investigators will provide glucometer (One Touch glucometer), strips and lancets to patients who never had glucometer before enrolling to our study.

 Participants taking metformin or placebo will be asked to perform an 4-point self-measured blood sugar profile with measurements taken as indicated in the table (once a week).

 Investigators will contact study participants (treatment and placebo group only) by phone at the mid of the study period (D21) to follow up on the recorded fasting blood glucose levels and development of side effects.

 The results of the blood sugar measurements will help the study physicians to adjust diabetes therapy (metformin or the other concomitant diabetes medications) in order that the study subjects maintain appropriate blood glucose control (target pre-meal and bedtime glucose between 90-180 mg/dL).

 The participants in the non-diabetic group, they will not receive either metformin hydrochloride or placebo.

 Their fasting blood glucose, plasma MG level and urine IMZ level will be measured during the study.

 They will not be required to perform 4 point testing.

 They will have all the same clinic visits and lab orders as diabetic patients except receiving the study medication.

 It is hypothesized that plasma MG level in the metformin treatment group will be less than in the group taking the placebo pills, while there will be no significant difference in MG level between the metformin treatment group and the volunteers without diabetes.

 Evaluation of the Metformin Effect on Methylglyoxal in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes@highlight

This study is designed to investigate the effects of metformin, a commonly prescribed first line medication for diabetes and recommended for prediabetes, on the levels of the potentially tissue damaging reactive product (MG) in the blood and its cleared counterpart in the urine (IMZ).

 The study will involve patients with elevated HbA1c randomized to receive either metformin or a similar inactive placebo pill and a group of sex and age matched volunteers without diabetes.

 Study participants will be recruited from the University of Arizona Medical Center, South Campus clinics (Endocrine clinic, family medicine clinic and general medicine clinic).

 Eighty patients with HbA1c >6.

0% will be randomized to receive either metformin or a similar inactive placebo for 6 weeks.

 The response of these patients will be compared to 40 patients normal HbA1c <5.

6% who will not receive either study medication.

 Investigators will compare the plasma MG and urine IMZ concentration/content between the 3 groups before and after the 6-week intervention.

 It is hypothesized that plasma MG level in the metformin treatment group will be less than in the group taking the placebo pills, while there will be no significant difference in MG level between the metformin treatment group and the volunteers without diabetes.
