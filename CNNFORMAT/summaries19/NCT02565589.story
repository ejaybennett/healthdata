(firstQuint)Hyporesponsiveness of Natural Killer Cells and a Dysfunctional Inflammatory Response in Critically Ill Patients.

 Blood samples were collected < 24 hours after admission from 24 intensive care unit (ICU) patients and 24 age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy controls.

 NK cell activities, cytokine concentrations and cytokine production by PBMCs and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated PBMCs were measured.
