(thirdQuint)An Efficacy and Safety Study of Atabecestat in Participants Who Are Asymptomatic at Risk for Developing Alzheimer's Dementia.

 This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), multi-center (more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in participants who are asymptomatic and at risk for developing Alzheimer's dementia.

 The study will consist of a Screening Phase (approximately 90 days), treatment Phase (54 months) and follow-up Phase (7 to 28 days).

 In treatment Phase eligible Participants will be randomized to receive study drug or placebo once daily for up to 4.

5 years.

 The maximum study duration for a participant will be 58 months.

 Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
