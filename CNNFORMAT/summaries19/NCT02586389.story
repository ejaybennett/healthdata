(secondQuint)Specimen Collection From Patients With Non-Hematologic Cancer for Use in Development of a Liquid Biopsy Assay.

 This is a non-significant risk multicenter, longitudinal specimen collection study.

 At the Baseline Visit, whole blood will be collected to be paired with either a previously collected tumor biopsy tissue sample or a prospectively collected tumor tissue sample.

 Whole blood samples will also be collected longitudinally at Interim visits for up to 5 years.

 Interim visits will be on a schedule dictated by their physician's standard-of-care management protocol.

 No more than 100mL of blood will be collected per month.

 Tumor tissue from recurrences will be collected for the duration of subject participation (after the Baseline Visit).
