(firstQuint)Bronchial Trans-epithelial Transport in Patients With Idiopathic Multiple Dilations of the Bronchi.

 Dilations of the bronchi happens for one child over 3000.

 The extended forms may progress to respiratory failure.

 More than one case over two remains of undetermined cause.

 If the prototype is the cystic fibrosis, other abnormalities of ionic transport may be the cause of a failure of mucociliary clearance and enhance the idiopathic dilations of the bronchi.

 The purpose of this study is to identify the abnormalities of bronchial trans-epithelial transport of chloride, sodium and bicarbonate in patients with idiopathic dilations of the bronchi, in comparison to two others groups of patients (without abnormality of ionic transport/with typical cystic fibrosis).
