(fifthQuint)Vibratory Stimuli, A Novel Rehabilitation Method for Preventing Post - Traumatic Knee Osteoarthritis.

 Quadriceps muscle dysfunction and proprioceptive deficits following knee injuries alter walking gait biomechanics in manners that contribute to development of knee osteoarthritis.

 Current rehabilitation techniques are minimally effective for addressing these complications and preventing knee osteoarthritis.

 Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction dramatically increases the risk of knee osteoarthritis, and represents an ideal model for evaluating novel rehabilitation techniques for preventing knee osteoarthritis.

 Direct (local muscle vibration) and indirect (whole body vibration) vibratory stimuli enhance quadriceps function and proprioception, and may improve rehabilitation and reduce the risk of knee osteoarthritis.

 The purpose of this investigation is to determine and compare the acute effects of whole body vibration and local muscle vibration on quadriceps function, knee proprioception, and gait biomechanics in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

 The investigators hypothesize that vibratory stimuli will enhance quadriceps function, knee proprioception, and gait biomechanics in manners that would reduce the risk of developing knee osteoarthritis, and that whole body vibration and local muscle vibration will produce equivalent improvements in these characteristics.

This study will evaluate the acute effects of vibration (whole body vibration and local muscle vibration) on quadriceps function, knee joint proprioception, and gait biomechanics linked to osteoarthritis development in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

 Subjects will be randomly assigned to control (no vibration), whole body vibration, and local muscle vibration groups, and the aforementioned characteristics will be assessed prior to and following the respective interventions.
