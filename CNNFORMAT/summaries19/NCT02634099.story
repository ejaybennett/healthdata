(firstQuint)A Comparison of Three Methods of Hemoglobin Monitoring in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Major Surgery.

 The goal of the study is to compare 3 methods of hemoglobin measurement in pediatric patients undergoing major surgery.

 During general anesthesia investigators will measure and compare at different periods of time blood hemoglobin levels obtained from a radial artery catheter with 2 non invasive methods of measurement using hemocue and SpHb.
