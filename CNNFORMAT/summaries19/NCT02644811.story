(fifthQuint)Miniscrews as Anchorage Device for Orthodontic Treatment.

 Participants are recruited from the orthodontic specialist clinic in Gavle, Sweden.

 After informed consent participants are randomized into Group A and B.

 The treatment starts with extractions of the maxillary first premolars.

 Extractions are performed by the participants general practitioner.

 Orthodontic treatment starts after the tooth extractions.

 All participants get treatment with fixed appliance according to the straight wire concept (3M Victory brackets, .

022 slot size, McLaughlin-Bennet-Trevesi prescription).

 The recommended wire sequence is: .

016 Heat Activated Nickel Titanium, .

019x.

025 Heat Activated Nickel Titanium, .

019x.

025 Stainless Steel.

 Treatment time is about two years.

 The following measurements are taken at: T0 (Before treatment start): Study models, baseline questionnaire, T1 (after tooth extractions, before the orthodontic treatment): Study models, cephalographic x-ray, questionnaire at the evening after tooth extractions, questionnaire one week after tooth extractions.

 T2 (After miniscrew placement (Group A), Before space closure): Study models, cephalographic x-ray, questionnaire at the evening after miniscrew placement, questionnaire one week after miniscrew placement.

 T3 (After space closure and miniscrew removal): Study models, cephalographic x-ray, questionnaire after screw removal.

 Miniscrews as Anchorage Device for Orthodontic Treatment@highlight

The purpose of this trial is to study and compare two different anchorage techniques.

 Adolescent patients in need for orthodontic treatment are randomized into Group A and B.

 Both groups are treated with extractions of the maxillary first premolars and fixed appliance.

 Anchorage is reinforced by miniscrews in Group A and by molarblock in Group B.

 The hypotheses are: - that placement of miniscrews does not cause more pain or discomfort than premolar extractions - that molarblock provides increase of anchorage - that miniscrews have a better anchorage capacity than molarblock - that miniscrews are more cost-efficient than conventional anchorage techniques
