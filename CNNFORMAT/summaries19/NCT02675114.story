(secondQuint)The PARTNER 3 - Trial - The Safety and Effectiveness of the SAPIEN 3 Transcatheter Heart Valve in Low Risk Patients With Aortic Stenosis.

 Prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center trial.

 Patients having an operative mortality < 2% (low operative risk) for surgical aortic valve replacement will be randomized 1:1 to receive either transcatheter heart valve replacement (TAVR) with the Edwards SAPIEN 3 or aortic valve replacement with a commercially available surgical bioprosthetic valve.

 Patients will be seen for follow-up visits at discharge, 30 days, 6 months, and annually through 10 years.

 A subset of PARTNER 3 randomized patients will be enrolled in the Actigraphy/QOL.

 Additional patients will be enrolled in either the Bicuspid Registry, Underrepresented Populations Registry or the Alternative Access Registry.
