(fifthQuint)Physical Function and Activities of Daily Living in Cancer Patients During Chemotherapy.

 A randomised longitudinal study.

 A total of 44 gastrointestinal cancer patients before their first-line chemotherapy are recruited and randomised into one of two treatment groups A: Home based- physical activity or B: wait-control.

 The intervention period is 12 weeks.

 Primary outcome are the ADLs (iADL 1-8; FIM 1-7).

Secondary outcomes are the physical activity, quality of life, peripheral polyneuropathy, chemotherapy regimen, gait speed, postural stability, maximal isometric voluntary force of the upper extremity, Maximal isometric voluntary force (MIVF) and strength endurance of the lower extremity, nutritional state, body composition and perceive functional ability.

 All measurements are standardized and are performed before chemotherapy, after 2 cycles of chemotherapy (4-6weeks) and after 12 weeks.

 Physical Function and Activities of Daily Living in Cancer Patients During Chemotherapy@highlight

The study is a randomized controlled trial with the aim to examine the feasibility and the effects of a home-based exercise intervention program on activities of daily living (ADL) in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment.

 Further outcomes include functional and body status, quality of life, body composition, and chemotherapy completion rate.

 Study participants will be randomized to an exercise intervention group or a wait-list control group
