(firstQuint)Microparticle Enhanced Cytotoxic Transarterial Embolization Therapy.

 Colon or rectal carcinoma that has spread to the liver is considered to be metastatic and is a Stage IV cancer.

 If the metastasized tumor is unresectable, the only current treatment is chemotherapy.

 Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) is considered as a palliative treatment in advanced metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC), with the potential of local tumor control.

 TACE has evolved in the past 8 years to include drug-delivery devices that can target and deliver drugs from small microparticles (DEB-TACE).

 Superselective DEB-TACE has the potential to penetrate deeper into the tumor's vasculature to reach peripheral growing points.

 Loading these microparticles with a cytotoxic drug may improve the level of local tumor control.

 The MIRACLE III study is a controlled, pilot, single center (Italy) study on 18 subjects with pretreated non-resectable mCRC.

The purpose of this study is to determine safety and local tumor control of Embozene TANDEM Microspheres (40um TANDEM) loaded with Irinotecan to treat metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC).
