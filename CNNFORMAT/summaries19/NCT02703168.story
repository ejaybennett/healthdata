 Long-term Performance of SLActive Implants After Immediate or Early Loading@highlight

This is a follow-up study with patients, who participated in the Straumann clinical study CR06/03.

 The objective is the assessment of long-term data (8 and 10 years after implantation) on the performance of immediate and early (28-34 days post implantation) non-occlusal loaded Straumann Tissue Level Implants with SLActive surface when used to support single crowns or 2-4 unit fixed dental prostheses in the posterior maxilla and mandible.

 The primary objective is of the study is to analyse the change in crestal bone levels 8 and 10 years post-surgery compared to 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years post-surgery in the immediate and early loading group.
