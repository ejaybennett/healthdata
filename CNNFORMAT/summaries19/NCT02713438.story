(fifthQuint)Effects of Individual, Dyadic, and Collaborative Plans on Physical Activity in Parent-Child Dyads.

 Individual planning (also known as implementation intentions or action and coping planning) is a regulatory strategy, which refers to making plans on when, where, and how to perform an intended behavior.

 In dyadic planning, a target person is setting plans together with a partner on when, where, and how the target person will individually engage in behavior change.

 The concept of dyadic planning differs from the conceptualization of collaborative plans, where two individuals make plans on how to enact a behavior together.

 The study will evaluate the effects of a short-term planning intervention.

 The intervention includes a total of six sessions: two face-to-face sessions with the experimenter (delivered over two weeks) and three sessions delivered over phone (over the following three weeks), one face-two-face session (delivered at one month after the third session delivered over the phone).

 The delivery has an individual format (the experimenter + the dyad).

 The total time from first to sixth session is 2 months.

 The setting for the interventions will include schools (school nurse office) or/and participant's home.

 The same format, schedule, delivery, and setting will be used for conducting active control group procedures.

 Effects of Individual, Dyadic, and Collaborative Plans on Physical Activity in Parent-Child Dyads@highlight

AIMS: The project aims at investigating of the effects of three types of planning (individual planning, collaborative planning, and dyadic planning) on physical activity.

The influence of three planning interventions are compared with an active control condition, including physical activity education.

 PARTICIPANTS: The effects of the interventions are evaluated among parent-child (aged 10-14) dyads, with a minimum of 50 dyads enrolled into the each arm of the trial (a total of 200 dyads).

 The interventions consist of six planning sessions.

 DESIGN: The dyads are randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions.

 The assessment of the main and secondary outcomes is conducted at the baseline, at 1 week after the first intervention session, at post-intervention (after six intervention sessions are completed), and at 6-, and 12-month follow-ups.

 OUTCOMES: Physical activity constitutes the main outcome, whereas health-related quality of life (HRQOL), body mass index, as well as the self-regulatory strategy called the use of planning (individual, dyadic and collaborative) are secondary outcomes.
