(thirdQuint)Single-dose Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacodynamics of REMD-477 in Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.

 The study will be conducted at two sites in the United States, and approximately 20 subjects with type 1 diabetes will be enrolled.

 Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit, to carefully monitor blood glucose; and establish the baseline insulin requirement for maintaining targeted normoglycemia (postabsorptive: 90-120 mg/dL; and postprandial: <180 mg/dL).

 The patients will then be subjected to a hyperglycemic period (250-300 mg/dL) by a stepwise reduction in insulin infusion.

 After receiving a single SC dose of REMD-477 or matching placebo in a double-blinded fashion, all subjects will be assessed for the post-treatment 24-hour insulin requirement needed to maintain targeted normoglycemia (postabsorptive: 90-120 mg/dL; and postprandial: <180 mg/dL); and to be monitored closely for safety, tolerability and targeted glycemic control, for a 48-hr period.

 After the in-patient residency period, subjects will return to the clinic for weekly out-patient safety follow-up visits for 8 weeks.

 Single-dose Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacodynamics of REMD-477 in Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus@highlight

This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of REMD-477 in subjects who have Type 1 diabetes and are currently receiving insulin treatment.

 This proof of concept study will determine whether glucagon receptor blockade using a single dose REMD-477 can improve short-term glucose homeostasis in people with Type 1 diabetes.
