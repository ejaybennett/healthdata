(firstQuint)Carotid Arteries Stenting Complications: Transradial Approach Versus Transfemoral.

 The use of transradial approach in carotid arteries stenting can significantly decrease the amount of adverse events associated with transfemoral approach such as bleeding or hematoma.

 Otherwise providing transradial approach is fraught with technical difficulties of common carotid artery canulation that can result in embolic complications.

 Taking into account the absence of studies in this area of medicine, providing investigation evaluating parameters of safety for both methodics is very actual.
