(thirdQuint)Tissue Perfusion Indices as Predictor of Outcome in Poly Trauma Patients.

 Poly trauma patients have high incidence of mortality and morbidity in spite of improvements and advances in facilities.

 However, no doubt that early resuscitation and interventions make a big difference upon the overall outcome.

 A lot of methods, indices, laboratory and biomarkers have been utilized to evaluate the progress and quality of resuscitation and the early hospital interventions in such group of critically ill patients including central venous pressures, urine output, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and gastric tonometry.

 Most of recent means focus upon the regional tissue perfusion rather than global, however some researches have tried the difference between arterial and venous CO2,oxygen tension or content ( Pv -a co2& Pa -v O2 ) in addition to dynamic changes in lactate(3) as predictors for tissue perfusion in sepsis patients after establishment of sepsis campaign (bundle).

Early intervention and resuscitation based upon a lot of clinical, laboratory findings make a big difference regarding outcome in poly trauma patients, the study uses the dynamic lactate change and the difference between arterial and venous CO2, oxygen tension or content as indicators for tissue perfusion.
