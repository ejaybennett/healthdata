(fifthQuint)Concurrent DBS Local Field Potential Analysis and Stimulation in a Closed-Loop Neuromodulation Device.

 The goals of this study are to evaluate local field potentials (LFP) and associated beta, gamma and other band oscillations and their correlation with disease pathophysiology and clinical status of the patients, and to potentially determine a more objective biomarker of response to deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment.

 This study aims to find evidence that changes in the power and coherence of the beta and gamma bands can be consistently linked to DBS adjustment and associated clinical effects.

 This approach can be of significant potential benefit to provide a foundation for closed loop DBS therapy in patients with continuous DBS adjustments.

 This study will use a novel bi-directional neural interface system that can chronically and simultaneously record, sense, process and telemeter LFP signals from DBS electrode (Rouse et al.

 2011) to study the stability and subsequent change to LFP linked to the clinical state relevant to the present disorder, and DBS stimulation at rest and during motor and cognitive tasks.

 This investigation will be conducted at the Ohio State University.

The purpose of this clinical study is to allow the investigation of local field potential (LFP) signals in patients treated with DBS of the STN.

 This study will identify common LFP biomarkers observed as a function of disease symptoms, medication effect, fluctuations in disease, and changes resulting from adjustments from current standard practices of DBS programming.

 The data collected and LFP markers identified will serve as guidelines for future stimulation predicted programming.
