(fifthQuint)Pilot Study of Fecal Transplantation Using a Unique Diet for Donor and Recipient in Mild to Moderate Treatment Refractory Colitis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

 The first exploratory phase will take place in 34 subjects aged 18-60, with refractory established UC, over 12 weeks.

 Study type- It will be an open label 3 arm multicenter randomized controlled single blinded study, with review of endoscopic activity by blinded reviewers.

 Patients will be randomized to one of three groups; Group 1 will undergo standard fecal transplantation by colonoscopy on day 1 and 60 ml rectal enemas on days 2 and 14 from the same donor without dietary conditioning, while Group 2 will undergo the same transplantation (colonoscopy and enemas at night day 2 and day 14), with dietary pre-conditioning of the donor for 14 days and dietary treatment of the recipient immediately after transplantation and for the following 12 weeks.

We will attempt to use the same donors for group 1 and 2 by using the preconditioning stool for group 1 and the post conditioning stool for group 2 in order to control for the "donor effect".

 Group 3 will receive dietary therapy only.

 Should the first stage be successful, The investigators will continue the fecal transplantation trial to reach our target enrolment number ( 76 patients) for transplantation.

 This second stage of the study will involve fecal transplantation in an additional 52 patients in order to have a total of 76 transplanted patients from the two phases.

 since physicians will be able to distinguish between stool and colored saline during colonoscopy.

 Subjects may continue their stable medications but should not start new medications during the 8 week period unless they fail to respond.

 Steroid weaning can commence from day 14.

 Patients will be seen on weeks0, 2, 6, 8, 12 and during week 20.

 Week 6 will be only a dietitian visit.

 The last visit is a visit off diet to evaluate sustainability of the initial intervention, safety and changes in BMI due to FT or diet.

 A telephone conversation to assess SCCAI will be made at week 1 and week 7.

 At each visit (weeks 0, 2, 6, 8, 12, 20) patients will have Weight, a disease activity score, PGA, CBC, CRP, albumin and complete chemistry panel performed.

 Adverse events and medications used will be recorded at each visit.

Stool samples for microbiome (16S rDNA, Short chain fatty acid analysis) and Calprotectin will be measured locally at baseline, weeks 2, 8 and 12.

 All patients (patients in group 1,2 and 3) will have a repeat sigmoidoscopy performed at week 8.

 A food frequency questionnaire will be performed on week 0 and a food diary will be collected at week 2 and 12.

 A compliance questionnaire will be completed on weeks 2, 8and 12.

 A 24 hours recall will be collected at weeks 0, 2 and 6.

 Open Label treatment of refractory patients: Patients in group 1 and 3 who do not improve by week 8 ( day 56) may be treated with the identical protocol used in Group 2 at the physicians discretion or receive any other therapy.

 These patients will be seen at day 14 and 56 as above, and have the same monitoring of dietary compliance by food diaries at days 14 and 56 and biological samples as above.

 Patients in group 1 or 2 in remission from FT, may receive up to 2 rescue enemas during the 8 weeks of the study from their original donor.

 Pilot Study of Fecal Transplantation Using a Unique Diet for Donor and Recipient in Mild to Moderate Treatment Refractory Colitis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease@highlight

Changing the microbiota has become the most intriguing target for intervention in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

 Dietary therapy is successful in mild to moderate Crohn's disease and may be effective in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) as well, though dietary interventions in UC are just getting underway.

 However these interventions are less likely to be effective for the more severely inflamed or refractory end of the spectrum.

 Fecal transplantation (FT) has been suggested as a method to treat refractory IBD, but most studies have been unsuccessful in establishing remission and especially prolonged remission.

 The investigators hypothesize that this is due to selection of random donors and the inability to maintain an optimal microbiota eco system post transplant.

 Diet is a powerful tool to modulate the microbiota.

 The investigators propose to modify FT using a novel protocol and approach that we have developed.

 We have developed a unique diet that is geared to rectify dysbiosis in UC and damage to the mucous layer in active UC.

 The investigators intend to condition both donor and recipient with the diet to achieve optimal conditions for transplant to succeed for both donor and recipient .

The investigators intend to evaluate this protocol in adults with active UC that are refractory to medications.

 The investigators will start with a randomized controlled trial involving 76 transplanted patients, however in the first pilot stage The investigators will enroll 34 patients, and extend the study if there is a trend for better outcomes with the dietary conditioning protocol.

 Furthermore, The investigators hope to identify successful donors during this period to use during the study extension.
