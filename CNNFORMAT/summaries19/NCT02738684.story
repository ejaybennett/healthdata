(secondQuint)A Study to Predict Gefitinib' s Efficacy for Lung Cancer by Plasma Free Nucleic Acids EGFR Gene Mutation Test.

 Results of the study will clarify that if the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) EGFR mutation could be used as a screening method for EGFR-TKI targeted therapy for late stage lung cancer patients, as well as a standard for the therapy efficacy.

 This study can be used as a standard to assess gefitinib' s efficacy after 8 weeks of treatment in IIIB or stage IV lung cancer through tumor tissue negative, ctDNA positive EGFR mutation.

 A Study to Predict Gefitinib' s Efficacy for Lung Cancer by Plasma Free Nucleic Acids EGFR Gene Mutation Test@highlight

This project aims to do a small sample exploratory study, to predict EGFR-TKI targeted therapy gefitinib' s efficacy in late stage lung adenocarcinoma patients (phase IIIB or IV), who have negative tissue EGFR gene mutation, positive plasma free nucleic acid EGFR gene.
