(thirdQuint)A Phase 1 Clinical Study of AZD4635 and Durvalumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies.

 The study will be conducted in two segments.

 The first segment of the study (Phase 1a) will be a dose escalation design in order to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of AZD4635 given as monotherapy and in combination with durvalumab.

 The MTD will be determined by assessing adverse events and the incidence of abnormal laboratory measures.

 Once the maximum tolerated monotherapy dose of AZD4635 has been determined, combination dosing with durvalumab will start in a new cohort of patients at one dose level lower than the highest tolerated dose of AZD4635 monotherapy.

 The combination therapy cohorts in Phase 1a will also have a 2-week monotherapy lead-in after which patients who tolerate monotherapy AZD4635 will then continue twice daily dosing of AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab (anti programmed-death ligand 1 [PD-L1]) at the fixed dose of 1.

5 grams IV every 4 weeks.

 When the maximum-tolerated dose in the combination setting is determined, additional patients with advanced solid malignancies will be enrolled to a dose expansion portion to explore further the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biological activity at the selected doses.

 Approximately 24 to 42 patients with advanced solid malignancies will be treated in Phase 1a.

 When the maximum-tolerated dose in the combination setting is determined, additional patients with advanced solid malignancies will be enrolled to a dose expansion portion to explore further the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biological activity at the selected doses.

 Approximately 24 to 42 patients with advanced solid malignancies will be treated in Phase 1a.

 If the MTD for either AZD4635 monotherapy or the AZD4635/durvalumab combination is not reached dose expansion may take place at dose levels of AZD4635 and durvalumab other than MTD.

 The second segment of the study (Phase 1b) will consist of an additional expansion cohorts in tumour types where there is a rationale for potential efficacy of the study treatment.

 The additional dose expansion cohorts will use doses that do not exceed the highest tolerated dose determined during the dose escalation segment of the study in patients with: - Post-immunotherapy non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (AZD4635 monotherapy or AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab).

 - Other post-immunotherapy solid tumours (AZD 4635 monotherapy).

 - Immune checkpoint-naive metastatic castrate-resistant prostate carcinoma (mCRPC) (AZD4635 monotherapy or AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab).

 - Immune checkpoint-naive colorectal carcinoma (CRC) (AZD4635 monotherapy).

 - Other immune checkpoint-naive solid tumours (AZD4635 monotherapy).

 A Phase 1 Clinical Study of AZD4635 and Durvalumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies@highlight

This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter study of continuous oral dosing of AZD4635 administered as a single agent and then in combination with a PD-L1 antibody, durvalumab.

 The study design allows an escalation of dose with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients.

 The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab.
