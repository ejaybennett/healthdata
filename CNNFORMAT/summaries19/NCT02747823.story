(fifthQuint)PK Bioequivalence Single-dose Safety Tolerability Study in Healthy Male Volunteers to Compare CBT124 & Avastin(EU&US).

 Cipla BioTec, a pharmaceutical company (company developing drugs), is developing its own formulation of bevacizumab called CBT124 which is similar to Avastin(Registered Trademark).

 The formulation is, intended for intravenous (into a vein) administration for the treatment of certain cancers.

 CBT124 is also a type of monoclonal antibody with a proposed biological activity similar to bevacizumab.

 Research on CBT124 indicates that it should act the same as Avastin(Registered Trademark) in the body.

 It is expected that CBT124 will provide all the clinical advantages of the marketed drug Avastin(Registered Trademark).

 The main purpose of this study is to test that whether CBT124 behaves the same in the human body as Avastin(Registered Trademark) i.

e.

 produce the same amount/concentration of drug in the blood as the EU and USA marketed drug, Avastin(Registered Trademark).

 This is called a 'biosimilar' study.

 The study will compare the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) (the levels of drug in the blood), pharmacodynamics (PD) (what the drug does to the body) and immunogenicity (body's immune (body's defense system) response) of the 3 drugs when given intravenously (into a vein) to healthy male participants: new drug called CBT124, marketed drug Avastin(Registered Trademark) approved in United States (US), marketed drug Avastin(Registered Trademark) approved in European Union (EU).

 The results will be compared to see if these drugs behave the same and are therefore equivalent.

 In order to measure this, blood samples will be collected after treatment has been given and the amount of drug in the blood measured at specific times.

 In addition, the study will also compare and analyse the effect the drug has on your immune system from blood samples.

 Safety and tolerability of both drugs will also be monitored and compared.

 PK Bioequivalence Single-dose Safety Tolerability Study in Healthy Male Volunteers to Compare CBT124 & Avastin(EU&US)@highlight

This study aims to investigate the bioequivalence of new formulation of bevacizumab called CBT124 and safety when compared to two already marketed formulations, one approved in US and other in EU of Avastin(Registered Trademark).

 Adult healthy male aged 18 to 50 years (both inclusive) can participate in this trial.

 Participants will be randomised (allocated by chance) to either a test formulation or one of the two marketed formulations of bevacizumab.

 Drugs will be administered intravenously once only.

 The study will compare the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) (the levels of drug in the blood), pharmacodynamics (PD) (what the drug does to the body) and immunogenicity (body's immune response) of the 3 drugs.

 In order to measure this, blood samples will be collected at various points after treatment has been given.
