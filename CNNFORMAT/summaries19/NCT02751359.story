(thirdQuint)Characterization of the Analgesic Effect of CBD in Healthy, Normal Volunteers.

 This within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will assess the analgesic and subjective effects of a range of CBD doses (0, 200, 400, or 800 mg, po).

 Volunteers will participate in 4 outpatient laboratory sessions over the course of 4 weeks during which the analgesic effects of CBD will be assessed using the Cold-Pressor Test (CPT), a laboratory model of pain which has predictive validity for the clinical use of analgesics.

 The order of CBD dose will be randomized across participants.

 Secondary measures will include subjective and physiologic effects of CBD.
