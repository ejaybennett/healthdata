(secondQuint)Individualized Pneumoperitoneum Pressure in Colorectal Laparoscopic Surgery Versus Standard Therapy (IPPCollapse-II).

 In the last two decades laparoscopic surgery has settled as a less invasive surgical approach compared to open surgery.

 It is associated with lower perioperative morbidity and hospital stay.

 There is growing evidence that increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), even for short periods of time, is associated with increased perioperative morbidity (pain, increased inflammatory markers peritoneal injury worse splanchnic perfusion abnormalities hemodynamic and ventilatory .

).

 The study is a prospective multicenter randomized clinical intervention trial to assess the impact of IAP individualization strategy (IPP-Individualized pneumoperitoneum Pressure) relative to a IAP standard strategy (SPP-Standard pneumoperitoneum Pressure) using a validated scale (VAS) (PQRS- Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale).

 Postoperative pain in the first 24 hours (area under VAS curve , opioid rescue, referred pain to the shoulder) and surgical stress and inflammatory markers (neutrophil/lymphocyte, ratio,C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, procalcitonin) are also measured.

 Postoperative complications are evaluated by Clavier-Dindo classification.

The purpose of this study is to assess the post-operative recovery quality of the Individualized Pneumoperitoneum Pressure Therapy in Colorectal laparoscopic surgery versus standard therapy using a quality validated scale of postoperative recovery of their stay in the Post-Anaesthesia Recovery Unit.
