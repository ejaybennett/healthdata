(fifthQuint)Effect of Tube Feeding on Gastroesophageal Reflux in Preterm Infants.

 Due to several promoting factors related to the physiological immaturity of the gastro-intestinal tract, gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) is a frequent condition among preterm infants.

 GER clinical presentation may vary within a wide range of symptoms, being vomiting, regurgitations and cardiorespiratory events the most common in the preterm population.

 Combined pH and multiple intraluminal impedance (pH-MII) is currently considered the best choice for GER diagnosis in preterm infants.

 While pH monitoring is limited to the detection of acid reflux, combined pH-MII effectively identifies both acid and non-acid GER, which is predominant in preterm infants.

 Moreover, it allows to evaluate the height reached by the refluxate within the esophageal lumen and to distinguish retrograde fluid bolus movements (reflux) from the anterograde ones (swallows).

 In the last decade, GER pharmacological treatment has increasingly widespread in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs).

 The provision of anti-histamine2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors in the preterm population, however, might lead to such adverse effects as an increased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and infections.

 Hence, to avoid a useless and potentially harmful pharmacological overtreatment, a step-wise approach, firstly promoting conservative strategies, is currently considered the most advisable choice for GER management in symptomatic preterm infants.

 Postural and dietary interventions are the most common conservative strategies and their efficacy in improving GER symptoms and features has been largely investigated.

 As previously assessed by pH-MII, both prone and left-side positions were more effective than the right-side or supine ones to significantly improve both acid and non-acid GER features.

 Feed thickening is widely employed to reduce vomiting and regurgitations in symptomatic term infants; with regard to the preterm population, however, little data is currently available.

 The efficacy of thickened fortified human milk on preterm infants with GER symptoms has been previously investigated, observing no benefits.

 Furthermore, standard human milk fortification itself has been shown to increase GER frequency in preterm infants.

 With regard to anti-regurgitation (AR) formulas, the effectiveness of a specific AR formula, thickened with amylopectin and specifically tailored for preterm infants' nutritional needs, has been recently evaluated; the tested thickened formula effectively reduced the number of acid GERs, but no difference was observed in the frequency of non-acid GERs and in the mean esophageal acid exposure, which is known to be the main determinant for the development of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).

 Thus, according to these data, feed thickening seem to be almost ineffective in improving GER symptoms and features in preterm infants.

 Due to their prematurity, preterm infants 33 weeks gestation, undergoing a diagnostic pH-MII evaluation.

 Overall, thirty preterm infants 33 weeks gestation will be enrolled if suffering from moderate/severe GER symptoms and if a diagnostic 24-hour pH-MII monitoring has been scheduled to evaluate GER features, according to our clinical practice.

 During the 24-h pH-MII monitoring, each infant will receive his meals (usually 8) according to the following sequence: - 1st meal: optional modality (not considered for statistical analysis); - 2nd meal: continuous feeding over 3 hours; - 3rd meal: bolus feeding; the feeding tube remains in place for the whole post-prandial period; - 4th meal: bolus feeding; the feeding tube is removed after feed administration; - 5th: continuous feeding over 3 hours; - 6th : bolus feeding; the feeding tube remains in place for the whole post-prandial period; - 7th: bolus feeding; the feeding tube is removed after feed administration; - 8th: optional modality (not considered for statistical analysis).

 Healthcare assistants will inspect the correct application of this sequence.

 The pH-MII device in use for this study (Comfortec pH-MII Sandhill Scientific(R)) is a nasogastric probe with seven rings, composed by six dipolar impedance channels and one antimony electrode responsible for pH detection and placed in the middle of the distal impedance dipole.

 Due to these characteristics, pH-MII is able to measure the esophageal height reached by refluxate and to identify the direction of esophageal bolus movements, thereby distinguish between a retrograde flow (reflux) and an anti-retrograde flow (swallow).

 The distance between the infant's nose and LES will be determined with Strobel's formula: [baby length (cm) x 0.

252 + 5)] - 13%.

 After placement, the probe's position will be radiographically confirmed.

 Data from the pH-MII recording will be automatically acquired on a portable Sleuth Sandhill Scientific system and then stored in a personal computer containing a specific software (BioVIEW Analysis Sandhill Scientific, version 5.

0.

9).

 Data analysis will be performed by the aforementioned software and confirmed by direct visual evaluation.

 Statistical analysis will be performed by SPSS 20 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, SPSS Inc.

, Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows.

 Differences between the different modalities in terms of GER frequency and features will be tested by Friedman test (level of significance: p <0.

 Effect of Tube Feeding on Gastroesophageal Reflux in Preterm Infants@highlight

Due to several promoting factors, gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) is very frequent in preterm infants.

 To limit the potentially harmful widespread of pharmacological treatment, a step-wise approach, which firstly undertakes conservative strategies, is currently considered the best choice to manage GER in the preterm population.

 Among the most common conservative strategies, postural measures seem to effectively reduce GER features in symptomatic preterm babies, whereas feed thickening is almost ineffective.

 Due to their prematurity, preterm infants 33 weeks) undergoing a diagnostic combined pH and multiple intraluminal impedance (pH-MII) for GER evaluation.
