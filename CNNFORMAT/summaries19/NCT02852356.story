(secondQuint)Validation Study Using a Time-lapse Morphometry MIRI Imaging Incubator.

 Following randomization and standard ovarian stimulation protocols to obtain a sufficient number of mature (MII) oocytes, these oocytes will be fertilized by Intra-Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI).

 If a patient has been randomized to the study group, all inseminated oocytes and subsequently all fertilized diploid (2PN) zygotes will be placed in the CultureCoin and then into the MIRI-TL Time-lapse incubator and cultured as per normal protocol to the blastocyst stage (Day 5/6 or 7).

 Top quality blastocyst(s) will be transferred and monitored for implantation, pregnancy and ongoing birth.

 Embryo transfers will either occur in a fresh or frozen embryo transfer cycle.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the MIRI-TL time-lapse incubator and CultureCoin dish compared to standard big-box incubators and standard culture dishes used for embryo culture.
