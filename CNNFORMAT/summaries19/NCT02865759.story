(secondQuint)Mindfetalness to Improve Pregnancy Outcome.

 The investigators have randomized 33 antenatal clinics in Stockholm to the intervention (receiving information about Mindfetalness) and 30 to routine care.

 The randomization was performed in blocks according to varying yearly volumes of pregnant women and socio-economic residential area.

 Three small clinics, with a total of 85 women listed in 2015, were not randomized.

 Another four clinics, receiving referrals of women with need for specialized care, were not randomized either.

 The recruitment is restricted to the 63 randomized clinics.

 In a pilot study in one antenatal clinic, the intervention has been tested among 102 women.

 A run-in period will start at high-volume antenatal clinics 1 September 2016, one month before the investigators start to register the women that will be observed for pregnancy outcome.

 All information, including that of possible effect-modifying and possible confounding factors, will be fetched from population-based registers and linked by the personal identify number unique for each resident in Sweden.

 The Swedish Medical Birth Register, Obstetrix, the Swedish Educational Register, the Prescribed Drug Register and the National Patient Register provide the information.

 By this design, and the analyses according to the intention-to treat principle, attrition and differential misclassification of outcome becomes negligible.

 Non-differential misclassification of the predictor (Mindfetalness or no Mindfetalness) will be substantial, diluting the effect estimates.

 This dilution may be compensated by the large size of the trial.

 Since the unit of randomization is the antenatal clinics residual confounding is an issue.

 The investigators will have, however, information on important possible confounding factors, including educational level, age, parity, body mass index, country of birth, diabetes mellitus before the pregnancy, certain other pre-pregnancy diseases, previous stillbirth, gestational diabetes mellitus and preeclampsia.

 During the fall of 2016 the investigators will submit articles giving a project description and results from the pilot study.

To improve pregnancy outcome, 39 000 pregnant women will be randomized to receive information about Mindfetalness or to routine care.

 The level of randomization will be the antenatal clinics in the Stockholm area.
