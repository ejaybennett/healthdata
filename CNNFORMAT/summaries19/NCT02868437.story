(thirdQuint)Effectiveness of Hyaluronic Acid Gel in the Prevention of Intrauterine Adhesions After Second Trimester Abortion.

 Intrauterine adhesions are the major long-term complication of curettage for retained products of conception.

 The risk of adhesion is higher after second trimester abortion.

 This complication may result in infertility, recurrent miscarriages and irregular periods with dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain.

 They have been reported that the intrauterine application of auto-crosslinked hyaluronic acid gel following hysteroscopic adhesiolysis or hysteroscopic surgery significantly reduces the formation of post-operative intrauterine adhesions.

 The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled study is to evaluate the efficacy of self-crosslinked hyaluronic acid gel in the reduction of development of de-novo post-curettage adhesions at 2 months follow-up.
