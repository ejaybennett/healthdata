(thirdQuint)Ox Bile- Conjugated Bile Acids Sodium in Type II Diabetes Mellitus.

 This is a single-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single dose, randomized, controlled trial.

 Participants will receive 28 days (+/- 4 days) of treatment to study the effect of delayed (ileocolonic)-release ox bile extract 500 mg BID (twice daily) on insulin sensitivity, gastric emptying of liquids and solids (measured by scintigraphy) and weight loss I overweight and obese type 2 diabetic subjects.

 Participants will be receiving therapy with DPP4 inhibitors alone or in combination with metformin.

 Blood samples will be collected at defined times to measure glycemia, FGF-19 and incretins (GLP-1 [glucagon-like peptide-1], OXM [oxyntomodulin], PYY 3-36 [peptide YY]) fasting levels and responses to the meal.
