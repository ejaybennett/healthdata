(secondQuint)Technical Development for Pediatric Cardiovascular MRI.

 The purpose of this protocol is to allow development and testing of new MRI techniques suitable for evaluating patients with cardiovascular disease, congenital heart disease, fetal cardiac structure, function, and physiology, and other fetal organ analysis.

 Individuals referred to Children's National Medical Center for a clinically indicated cardiac MRI or cardiac catheterization by their primary referring cardiologist or obstetrician, and who are enrolled in this study may also undergo additional research imaging.

 Since such technical development work often depends on preliminary studies in healthy volunteers, the protocol also recruits healthy subjects.
