(fifthQuint)Diagnostic Interview and One-session Cognitive Therapy in Treatment of Dental Fear.

 Purpose is to compare diagnostic interview (n=20) to diagnostic interview and one-session treatment of dental care (n=10).

 Partners come from three different places, 10 from each: public and private dental care and dental school.

 Participants from dental school take part to one-session treatment.

 All participants have normal dental care before final interview.

 Hypotheses is that dental fear/anxiety will decrease one category (5 points) when measured by Modified dental anxiety scale (MDAS) before the intervention and after normal dental care.

 Visual Analogue Scale is used to measure the strength of unpleasant feeling before and after intervention in both groups.
