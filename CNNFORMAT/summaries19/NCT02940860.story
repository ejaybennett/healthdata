(firstQuint)Iron Isomaltoside and Iron Sucrose for the Treatment of Iron Deficiency Anemia in Non-Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease.

 Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a common problem associated with many chronic diseases such as chronic kidney disease (CKD).

 IDA can have a substantial medical and quality of life (QoL) burden on the subjects, and treatment of these subjects includes treatment of its underlying cause and restoration of haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations and iron stores.

 This study is planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of iron isomaltoside compared to iron sucrose in subjects with IDA and NDD-CKD.
