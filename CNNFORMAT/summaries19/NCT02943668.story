(secondQuint)Deferasirox in Treating Patients With Very Low, Low, or Intermediate-Risk Red Blood Cell Transfusion Dependent Anemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the activity of iron chelation therapy (ICT) with deferasirox, in patients with anemia as a result of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Reduction in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirements.

 II.

 Hematologic improvement.

 III.

 Change in serum ferritin levels from baseline to the end of the study as measured on a monthly basis.

 IV.

 Safety and tolerability of deferasirox.

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Marrow samples will be taken to study erythropoiesis and the impact of iron overload on erythropoiesis.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive deferasirox orally (PO) once daily (QD).

 Treatment continues for up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

 Deferasirox in Treating Patients With Very Low, Low, or Intermediate-Risk Red Blood Cell Transfusion Dependent Anemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well deferasirox works in treating patients with very low, low, or intermediate-risk anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome that depends on red blood cell transfusions.

 Deferasirox may treat too much iron in the blood caused by blood transfusions.
