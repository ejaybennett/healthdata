(fifthQuint)IV Ascorbic Acid in Advanced Colorectal Cancer.

 Linus Pauling and Dr Ewan Cameron have published two retrospective studies about using high dose vitamin C to treat cancer patients forty years ago.

 Their studies have shown that high dose vitamin C usage could significantly prolong overall survival of patients with advanced cancer.

 Recently, preclinical study has shown that human colorectal cancer cells harboring KRAS or BRAF mutations are selectively killed by high levels of ascorbic acid (AA).

 High dose of AA impairs tumor growth in Apc/KRASG12D mutant mice.

 Previous phaseI clinical trials have found that high dose (1.

5g/kg or 90g/m2) iv AA is well tolerated in cancer patients.

 This protocol is a phase III, study of ascorbic acid (AA) infusions combined with treatment with FOLOX +/- bevacizumab versus treatment with FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab alone as first-line therapy in patients with recurrent or advanced colorectal cancer.
