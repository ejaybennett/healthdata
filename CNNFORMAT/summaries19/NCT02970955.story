(secondQuint)Prospecitve Observational Study on a Risk Adaptive Scheme for SBRT for Thoracic Nodes Metastases.

 The observational study is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of a risk adaptive scheme of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SRT) in oligometastatic patients with thoracic nodes metastases, medically inoperable, using VMAT RapidArc approach.

 The potential advantage of this technique is the ability to deliver a more selective irradiation to tumour's target while reducing doses to normal tissue, optimizing the therapeutic window.

Oligometastatic patients with inoperable thoracic nodes metastases from any primary, except for hematologic malignancies, will undergo a risk adaptive scheme of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
