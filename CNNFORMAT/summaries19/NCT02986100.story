(secondQuint)Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion Following a Single Oral Dose of [14C]-Rucaparib.

 This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, mass balance study in patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors.

 Approximately 6 patients will be enrolled.

 The study will consist of 2 parts: a mass balance part (Part I) and a rucaparib treatment part (Part II).

 Each patient will receive a single oral dose of 600 mg [14C] rucaparib (approximately 140 mu Ci) in the fasted state.

 Patients will be confined at the study site for the collection of blood samples and excreta for a maximum of 13 days, from Day -1.

 The patient can be discharged sooner than Day 13, if the discharge criteria are met.

 If the cumulative recovery of radioactivity exceeds 90% of the administered dose or if radioactivity in urine and feces is < 1% of the administered dose over a 24 hour period on two consecutive days, as determined by quick counts.

 In Part II, the treatment with rucaparib in 28-day cycles will continue until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for discontinuation.

 Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion Following a Single Oral Dose of [14C]-Rucaparib@highlight

The purpose of this study is to characterize the mass balance, absorption, metabolism, and elimination pathways of orally administered [14C] rucaparib followed by cycle by cycle treatment with rucaparib continuing until disease progression or other reason for discontinuation
