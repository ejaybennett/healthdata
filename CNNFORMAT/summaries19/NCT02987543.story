(secondQuint)Study of Olaparib (Lynparza) Versus Enzalutamide or Abiraterone Acetate in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (PROfound Study).

 This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of olaparib versus enzalutamide or abiraterone in subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have failed prior treatment with a new hormonal agent (NHA) and have a qualifying tumor mutation in one of 15 genes involved in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway.

 Subjects will be divided into two cohorts based on HRR gene mutation status.

 Approximately 340 subjects will be randomized 2:1 (olaparib : investigator choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate) into the trial.
