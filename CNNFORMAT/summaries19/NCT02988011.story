(fifthQuint)Improving Glucose and Lipid Metabolism Through Caloric Restriction Using Diet or Surgery (CRUDOS).

 By using omics platforms such as genomics, proteomics and metabolomics we can have large amount of information about metabolic changes at both tissue and whole body level.

 In parallel to this, clinical imaging modalities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) have developed rapidly, allowing for whole-body studies of how different tissues are involved in systemic diseases.

 Furthermore, new hybrid systems such as integrated PET-MRI provide combined information of human morphology and function.

 The integration of PET with MRI reduces the radiation dose compared with PET-CT to acceptable levels for metabolic studies.

 To handle the large amounts of data from these examinations we are currently developing an image analysis concept, "Imiomics", that allows holistic analysis of whole-body imaging data with integration of non-imaging data.

 In the current study, we plan to use PET-MRI as well as imiomics methodology, together with gold standard methodology to assess insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in vivo.

 We aim to conduct a randomized study (CRUDOS study; Caloric Restriction Using Diet Or Surgery) to study glycometabolic effects before and after gastric bypass surgery and low-calorie diet in subjects at different stages of glucose tolerance (i.

e.

 obese subjects with and without T2D).

 Improving Glucose and Lipid Metabolism Through Caloric Restriction Using Diet or Surgery (CRUDOS)@highlight

In this explorative randomized clinical study, the investigators aim to study metabolic, cellular, and molecular changes that occur during weight loss in obese subjects with and without type 2 diabetes.

 Using novel "imiomics" (imaging technique using PET/MR bioinformatics) analyses to examine possible metabolic differences between energy restricted diet and gastric by-pass surgery on whole-body and tissue specific insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, metabolite and protein profiles, fatty acid metabolism, ectopic fat content, and gene expression in adipose tissue.

 This study aims to identify novel biomarkers and drug targets for type 2 diabetes as well as validate promising and established biomarkers in an interventional model for improved glucose metabolism.
