(thirdQuint)High Intensity Interval Training for People With Stroke Deficits.

 Using a randomized design, the study will evaluate the effects of 3 HIT sessions combined with 2 MICE sessions per week on cardiovascular fitness and mobility compared to MICE training 5 days/week.

 Participants post-stroke will be randomly assigned to either MICE (5 days per week (dwk-1)) or combined HIIT (3 dwk-1) with MICE (2 dwk-1).

 Both groups will be exercising 5 times per week (walking on a treadmill with harness for fall protection); 3 times at the centre and 2 times at home.

 Outcome measures will be conducted before and after 24 weeks of training.

 High Intensity Interval Training for People With Stroke Deficits@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of an exercise training strategy called high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to moderate intensity continuous exercise (MICE), on walking function and cardiovascular fitness in stroke patients.

 Hypothesis: HIIT will result in significantly greater benefit to fitness and mobility than MICE.
