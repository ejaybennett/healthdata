(secondQuint)Aerobic, Resistance, Inspiratory Training Outcomes in Heart Failure.

 Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms of dyspnea, exercise intolerance and decreased quality of life.

 A weakness in both inspiratory and peripheral muscles is also reported.

 Aerobic training (AT) improves the functional status of HF patients (level of evidence IA).

 Additional benefits of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and/or resistance training (RT) when combined with aerobic training (AT) in HF symptoms have also been found.

 Four exercise groups will be studied in order to identify the optimum exercise program I.

 Aerobic-Resistance-Inspiratory training (ARIS) group II.

 Aerobic-Resistance training (ARS) group III.

 Aerobic-Inspiratory training (AIS) group IV.

 Aerobic Training (AT) group.

 Aerobic, Resistance, Inspiratory Training Outcomes in Heart Failure@highlight

This study investigates the effects of aerobic, resistance, inspiratory training modalities outcomes in functional capacity and quality of life of heart failure (HF) patients, aiming for the 'optimum' (greek, =aristos) training program for HF patients.
