(thirdQuint)Exercise and Nutrition Program in Improving Physical Activity and Dietary Behavior in Non-Active, Overweight, or Obese Latinas.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Adapt an effective evidence-based exercise and nutrition program to meet the needs of rural Latinas.

 II.

 Implement the adapted program in a rural Latina population.

 III.

 Evaluate feasibility and potential to improve physical activity and dietary behavior of the adapted program in a rural Latina population.

 OUTLINE: Phase I: Create a community advisory board to adapt Strong Women Healthy Hearts Program (SWHHP) using feedback on the existing SWHHP from Latinas residing in the community.

 Phase II: Conduct a small pilot study to assess effectiveness of the adapted program (one group pre-post design, with data collected at three time points).

 INTERVENTION GROUP: Participants undergo instructor-led exercise and nutrition education classes for 60 minutes each twice a week for 12 weeks.

 Exercise and Nutrition Program in Improving Physical Activity and Dietary Behavior in Non-Active, Overweight, or Obese Latinas@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies how well an evidence-based exercise and nutrition program adapted for Latinas works in improving physical activity and dietary behavior in non-active, overweight, or obese rural Latinas.

 An exercise and nutrition program may reduce the risk for developing certain cancers, obesity, and chronic health conditions in Latinas who are non-active, overweight, or obese.
