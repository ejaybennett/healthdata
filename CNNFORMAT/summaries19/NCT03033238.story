(thirdQuint)Multicenter Bone and Joint Health Study.

 MOST study participants in the "Existing Cohort" (3,026 subjects) were enrolled in the original study in 2003-2005.

 Surviving Existing Cohort participants without end-stage knee osteoarthritis will be asked to participate in the 144-, 152-, 160- and 168-month follow-up contacts.

 In addition, in 2016-2018 the cohort will be enriched by the recruitment of an additional 1,500 "New Cohort" participants with early or mild knee symptoms.

 The goal of the study is to find novel strategies to prevent disease at an early stage.

 Multicenter Bone and Joint Health Study@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate opportunities for prevention and treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA) by evaluating potentially modifiable risk factors for disease and poor pain and physical function outcomes especially among those with early or mild knee symptoms.

 The goal of the study is to find novel strategies to prevent disease at an early stage and to limit the impact of disease once it has occurred.
