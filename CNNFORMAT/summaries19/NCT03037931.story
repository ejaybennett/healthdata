(secondQuint)Randomized Placebo-controlled Trial of FCM as Treatment for Heart Failure With Iron Deficiency.

 This is a double-blind, multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the effects of IV FCM compared to placebo on the 12-month rate of death, hospitalization for worsening heart failure, and the 6-month change in 6 minute walk test (6MWT) for patients in heart failure with iron deficiency.

 After an initial screening period of up to 28 days, eligible participants will be stratified by region and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to FCM or placebo for treatment.

 Study drug administration will occur on Day 0 and Day 7 (2) as an undiluted slow IV push, with additional study visits planned at 3 month intervals, and additional dosing administered every 6 months as applicable.

 In a subset of sites, all participants will return for recurrent laboratory assessment (chemistry, hematology and iron indices) at Day 21 ( 7) after each course of investigational treatment.

 For all participants, hematology, ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT), with appropriate safety evaluations, to determine additional treatment, will occur at 6 month intervals.

 Randomized Placebo-controlled Trial of FCM as Treatment for Heart Failure With Iron Deficiency@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of iron therapy using intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), relative to placebo, in the treatment of participants in heart failure with iron deficiency and with a reduced ejection fraction.
