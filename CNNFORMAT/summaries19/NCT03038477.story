(thirdQuint)A Study of Durvalumab in Patients With BR PDA Following Neoadjuvant Therapy and Successful Surgical Resection.

 Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) patients who have successfully underwent R0/R1 resection of PDAs following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, between 1-3 months after the completion of planned adjuvant chemotherapy will be enrolled and randomized at a 1:1 ratio into two arms (56 per arm).

 Patients in Arm A will be given anti-PD-L1 antibody, durvalumab, every 2 weeks for a maximum of 26 doses if there is no radiographic evidence of disease recurrence.

 Patients in Arm B will be observed.

 Blood draws for immune monitoring and serum banking will be collected at the following time points: Arm A - before Cycles 1, 2, 4, 7 and End of Treatment (EOT) visit; Arm B - before Cycles 1, 4, 7, and End of Treatment (EOT) visit.

This is a two-arm, open-label, phase II study of in adult patients who have successfully undergone R0/R1 resection of PDAs following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and completion of adjuvant chemotherapy.

 Within 1-3 months of treatment completion, patients will be enrolled and randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive durvalumab versus observation.
