(fifthQuint)A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Intranasal Esketamine in the Rapid Reduction of Symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder, in Adult at Imminent Risk for Suicide.

 This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance which contains no drug) that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), multicenter (when more than one hospital or study team work on a medical research study) study.

 Study will enroll participants with suicidal ideation who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide.

 The study will consist of a screening evaluation performed within 48 hours prior to the Day 1 intranasal dose immediately followed by a 25-day double-blind treatment phase (Day 1 to 25), and a 65 day follow-up phase (Day 26 to Day 90).

 The total study duration for each subject will be approximately 13 weeks.

 Participants' safety will be evaluated throughout the study.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine 84 milligram (mg) compared with intranasal placebo in addition to comprehensive standard of care in reducing the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), including suicidal ideation, in participants who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide, as measured by the change from baseline on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at 24 hours post first dose.
