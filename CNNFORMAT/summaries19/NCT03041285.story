 Both groups receive the same standard radiotherapy dose.

 Group 1 will receive the lower dose (400 mg) of idronoxil suppository daily and Group 2 800 mg daily.

 Recruitment into Group 2 will only commence once all Group 1 patients have completed the 13-day treatment course of idronoxil suppository without excessive unexpected toxicity.

 The total treatment duration is 26 days for both groups.

 WEEK 1: Days 1-5: 1 or 2 lesions will receive 20-25 Gy (radiotherapy dose unit) radiotherapy in 5 daily fractionated doses .

 WEEK 2: Rest week.

 No radiotherapy.

 Start NOX66 on Day 14 WEEK 3: DAYS 15-19: NOX66 therapy.

 DAYS 15-19: Remaining lesions (maximum 3 lesions) each to receive 20-25 Gy RT in 5 daily fractionated doses.

 WEEK 4: DAYS 20-26: NOX66 therapy.

 Both groups will have prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) scans before starting treatment and three months after the last fraction of radiotherapy to assess treatment response.
