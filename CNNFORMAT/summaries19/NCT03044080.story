(thirdQuint)Effects of Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A (BoNT/A) Free of Complexing Proteins in the Spastic Equinovarus Foot.

 Spasticity is present in 38% of patients at six months after stroke.

 Equinovarus foot, with or without claw toes and striatal foot, is especially common.

 There is a weak to moderate evidence in favor of the use of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) in the equinovarus foot, stiff-knee and in other patterns that may interfere with gait ability.

 Specifically, BoNT/A increases walking speed in stroke patients with spastic equinovarus foot.

 Repeated use of BoNT/A may lead to the appearance of neutralizing antibodies, so its effect may decrease over successive infiltrations.

 Among the differential characteristics of incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin(R)) there is a reduced inactivated botulinum neurotoxin content and the lack of complexing proteins, which would diminish antigenicity and not suppose a decrease of the effect before successive infiltrations.

 The objective of this project is to determine the effect on walking speed of repeated use of BoNT/A in post-stroke spinal equinovarus foot in three consecutive injections at 6-month intervals and to investigate whether the sustainability of the effect is greater in incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin(R)) than in onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox(R)).

 All patients will receive 200-300 units of BoNT/A (Xeomin (R) or Botox (R)) that will be distributed according to the individual clinical pattern of spastic equinovarus foot.

 Effects of Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A (BoNT/A) Free of Complexing Proteins in the Spastic Equinovarus Foot@highlight

Clinical randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness on walking speed of repeated use of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A)in the post-stroke spastic equinovarus foot in three successive infiltrations at 6-month intervals, checking if the sustainability of the effect is greater in incobotulinumtoxin A (Xeomin(R)) than in onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox(R)).
