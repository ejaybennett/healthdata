(fifthQuint)RGB(Red- Green-Blue) Measurement of the Nasal Mucosal Image.

 This study enrolled 73 patients with AR (Group 1) and 73 normal healthy individuals(Group 2) with no nasal pathologies and respiratory tract infection attending to the outpatient clinic of the tertiary referral center.

 Patient's symptoms were questioned and noted by using Lebel Symptom Score Scale.

 Clinical examination was also done to help diagnose and exclude acute respiratory tract infection.

 All of the patients had positive skin prick test results for at least one of the most common aeroallergens.

 All patients and controls were examined by the same 4 mm 0endoscope and light source, and all endoscopic photographs of the septum and both inferior turbinates were taken.

 Each image was marked with standardized points at the anterior part of the nasal mucosa on both sides (2 points each right and left sides of the anterior septum and 2 points each anterior part of the inferior turbinates).

 These points were numbered 1 and 2 over the right inferior turbinate; 3 and 4 over the right side of the anterior septum; 4 and 5 over the left inferior turbinate; 6 and 7 over the left side of the anterior septum.

 RGB(Red- Green-Blue) Measurement of the Nasal Mucosal Image@highlight

The aim of this study was to evaluate the color values of the nasal mucosa, which is easily assessable by a direct, non-invasive, objective photographic measurement, for the purpose of presenting a diagnostic objective parameter of allergic rhinitis (AR).

 All patients and controls were examined by the same 4 mm 0endoscope and light source, and all endoscopic photographs of the septum and both inferior turbinates were taken.
