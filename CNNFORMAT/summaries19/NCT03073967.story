(thirdQuint)Trial on Efficacy and Safety of Pritelivir Tablets for Treatment of Acyclovir-resistant Mucocutaneous HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) Infections in Immunocompromised Adults.

 The Trial comprises 2 Parts, Part A and Part B.

 Part A is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, comparative design to assess the efficacy and safety in subjects with ACV-resistant mucocutaneous HSV infection, treated with oral pritelivir or intravenous foscarnet.

 Part B is an open-label, multi-center design to assess the efficacy and safety of pritelivir in subjects with ACV-resistant-mucocutaneous HSV and who either: 1.

 present with foscarnet-resistance/intolerance, or 2.

 developed foscarnet resistance/intolerance during treatment in Part A (no improvement after at least 5 days of foscarnet therapy or intolerance to foscarnet requiring cessation of foscarnet treatment).

 Pritelivir trial medication, in both Part A and Part B, will be given orally as single daily doses of 100 mg (following a loading dose of 400 mg as first dose) until 7 days after the mucocutaneous HSV lesions are healed or up to a maximum of 28 days, whichever is earlier.

 Foscarnet, in Part A, will be given as intermittent infusions at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or 60 mg/kg every 12 hours (to be adjusted in case of renal impairment) for a minimum of 1 hour Duration until 7 days after the mucocutaneous HSV lesions are healed or up to a maximum of 28 days, whichever is earlier.
