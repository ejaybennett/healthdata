(thirdQuint)Head and Neck Maskless Immobilization Device in Immobilizing Patients With Intracranial Tumors Undergoing Radiation Therapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the setup accuracy and reproducibility of the maskless immobilization device (MID) in patients undergoing brain radiation therapy (RT) for intracranial tumors.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the patient comfort and quality of life with the MID compared to the thermoplastic mask.

 Head and Neck Maskless Immobilization Device in Immobilizing Patients With Intracranial Tumors Undergoing Radiation Therapy@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies how well head and neck maskless immobilization device works in immobilizing patients with intracranial tumors undergoing radiation therapy.

 Maskless immobilization device may help to prevent movement of head during radiation therapy and immobilize patients with the same accuracy and reliability as the standard thermoplastic mask routinely used for patients with brain tumors receiving radiation therapy.
