(fifthQuint)Laser in Caries Treatment - PatientsView, Pulpal Reactions and Survival of Fillings.

 The study is a prospective, single-blind, randomized and controlled investigation.

 Patients between 15-40 years with at least two primary caries lesions radiographically assessed as the same size were recruited.

 In each patient one cavity was excavated with rotary bur and one with Er:YAG laser technique after a randomized allocation of the lesions to one of the intervention methods.

 The time requested for excavation to hard/firm dentin and local anaesthesia were measured.

 Directly after each treatment a questionnaire focusing on the experiences of the current treatment and if the laser method will be chosen in the future was answered.

 Postoperative pain was measured with a questionnaire one week after the treatment.

 Six, 12 and 24 months after the fillings were made an evaluation of pulpal status and the quality of the fillings will be performed.

 Laser in Caries Treatment - PatientsView, Pulpal Reactions and Survival of Fillings@highlight

The aim of this study was to evaluate the excavation time, patients experiences, pulpal reactions and survival of fillings when carious tissue was removed with Er:YAG laser compared to rotary bur.

 A prospective, single-blind, randomized and controlled investigation was performed.

 Patients with at least two primary caries lesions radiographically assessed as the same size were recruited.

 In each patient one cavity was excavated with rotary bur and one with Er:YAG laser technique.

 The time requested for excavation and local anaesthesia were measured.

 The prevalence of postoperative symptoms, pulpal vitality and the quality of fillings will be investigated during two years after the excavation occasion.
