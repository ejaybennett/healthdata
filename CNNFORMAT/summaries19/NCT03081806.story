(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of X0002 Spray in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Knee.

 Every subject will have a pre-screening interview by phone or other methods to find if the subject may meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

 After a Screening Period, a subject with the Kellgren-Lawrence Radiographic Grade 1, 2, and 3 will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio of active: placebo (ie, 2 subjects to active treatment and 1 subject to placebo) and stratified based on the K-L grade 1, 2, or 3, bilateral or unilateral knee OA, gender, BMI (30vs.

>30), and age (65vs.

>65).

 Before the first screening visit, there is a pre-Screening Telephone Call or email interview, the Screening Period of at least 14 days up to 3 weeks will consist of two visits for the assessment of eligibility including radiographic evaluation of the target knee joint space, all screening visits and week 2, 4, 8, 12 visits are show in Study Flow Chart of Double-blind Period, and the open label period will be started from the Week 12 visit.

 All subjects treated with active drug or placebo complete the 12-week double-blind study will enter this Open-label study and will be treated with active drug, X0002.

 Subjects will be required to sign the Informed Consent before participation in the study.

 Each subject will enter the open label phase and receive X0002 study treatment for 40 weeks starting on the Week 12 visit.

 Qualified site personnel will contact subjects 1 week (Week 13) after the Week 12 visit to check if there are adverse events (AEs).

 Subjects will return to the site at 22, 32, 42, and 52 weeks after the start of treatment for efficacy and safety assessments.

 The Week 12 visit will be the EOS visit of double-bind treatment period and the Week 52 visit will be the EOS visit of the study.

 On the final day of dose administration of Week 12 and Week 52 visits, radiographs and 3D qMRI will be performed to assess changes in the target knee joint space and cartilage (morphometry), sub-chondral bone, osteophyte volume, 3-D bone shape, bone marrow lesion (BML) size, synovitis, effusion, meniscus morphology, cartilage morphology and attrition.

 For subjects with bilateral knee pain, both knees will be treated, but the most symptomatic knee (ie, the most painful knee as measured by the WOMAC(R) 3.

1 pain subscale score at Screening) will be designated as the target knee for efficacy analyses.

 For subjects with unilateral knee pain, only the symptomatic (target) knee will be treated.

 Subjects taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other analgesics may enroll in the trial, but will discontinue any analgesic therapy for the duration of the study, starting at least 14 days prior to administration of the first dose of study medication (ie, for an analgesic washout period before Day 1).

 Subjects will be allowed to take rescue medication (up to six 325 mg tablets [total of 1950 mg] of acetaminophen per day; provided by the Sponsor) for residual knee or other body pain starting at the first screening visit during screening and treatment periods except during the 24 hours prior to the screening visit 2, Baseline (Day 1), Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 22, Week 32, Week 42, and Week 52(EOS).

 Subjects will record the following information in a Daily Diary during the Screening Period: the amount of knee pain in the target knee while walking during the preceding 24 hours (using a 100 mm visual analog scale [VAS]), the times and number of sprays for each administration of study medication (starting on the first screening visit), the times when the subject washes his/her knees and/or takes a shower, the number of tablets of rescue medication taken that day and the times taken, the reason for taking the rescue medication (eg, target knee pain, contralateral knee pain, headache, low back pain), the use of Curel Itch Defense Lotion, any other concomitant medications taken that day, and any AEs occurring that day.

 The study treatment may cause dry and/or itchy skin; therefore, Curel Itch Defense Lotion (available at any pharmacy) can be applied to treat the affected area and recorded in the diary.

 The VAS version of the WOMAC will be used for the Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints.

 Efficacy endpoints will be assessed at Screening visits, Day 1, the Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 22, Week 32, Week 42, and Week 52(EOS) visits.

 Safety assessments will be performed at each visit and will include assessment of AEs, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, and oral temperature), clinical laboratories, physical examination, skin irritation, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) as indicated in the study flow chart.
