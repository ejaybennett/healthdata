(fifthQuint)CHARM II: Chemotherapy for Ablation and Resolution of Mucinous Pancreatic Cysts.

 Pancreatic cystic lesions are increasingly encountered and typically discovered incidentally on cross-sectional imaging, occurring in approximately 2% of all American adults with a 37% prevalence in individuals over 80.

 Most of theses cyst are mucinous ( neoplastic) in origin and represent precursor lesions for pancreatic adenocarcinoma Discovering a pancreatic cyst typically presents a treatment dilemma, with options including either indefinite radiographic surveillance with MR (magnetic resonance ) or CT imaging or surgical resection, both of which have significant limitations.

 Surveillance carries significant economic and possible psychological burdens while waiting for signs of malignancy to develop, as well as radiation exposure with computed tomography.

 On the other hand, surgical resection possesses a significant risk of serious adverse events (20%-40%) and mortality (1-2%).

 This clinical dilemma delineates the pressing need to develop effective, but more minimally invasive, approaches for the elimination of these premalignant pancreatic cysts, and among these, endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle infusion (EUS-FNI) has emerged as an innovative and promising approach.

 Between November 2011 and December 30 2015, investigators from interventional endoscopy, surgical oncology, hematology oncology and pathology of the Penn State Hershey Medical Center conducted the CHARM clinical trial.

 This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, single-center study with an N of 46 patients required for 80% power to prove non-inferiority.

 Final results from CHARM I : Patients treated included 23 females and 16 males with the majority of lesions located in the body and head of the pancreas.

 Both the alcohol and alcohol-free groups recorded 47% rates of complete ablation at six months which increased to 64% for both groups at the 1 year completion.

 With one patient with complication in alcohol arm (6%) and no complication in free alcohol arm.

 The overall objectives of CHARM II are to verify the significant findings of CHARM I in a multi-center trial as requested by national investigators in this field.

 We hypothesize that cyst infusion with a chemotherapeutic cocktail following normal saline lavage will result in cyst ablation rates that do not significantly differ from those achieved by a single chemotherapeutic infusion following ethanol lavage.

 Furthermore, we hypothesize that the removal of alcohol will decrease adverse event rates associated with pancreatic cyst ablation.

 In order to retest and confirm this hypothesis, we propose a multi-center, prospective, randomized double-blind, controlled study to evaluate pancreatic cyst resolution rates with or without ethanol lavage.

 This is an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, multi-center study evaluating ethanol lavage and chemotherapy for the ablation of mucinous and indeterminate pancreatic cysts with malignant potential.

 Patients will be randomized to one of the following treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio: Control Group: Cysts will be lavaged for 3 minutes with 98% EtOH (ethanol) and then infused with an admixture of 3mg/ml paclitaxel and 19mg/ml gemcitabinel.

 Study Group: Cysts will be lavaged for 3 minutes with normal saline and then infused with an admixture of 3mg/ml paclitaxel and 19mg/ml gemcitabine.

 At 3 months post ablation, the patient will undergo a follow-up EUS examination in the same manner as the initial EUS exam.

 During this exam, a complete pancreaticobiliary evaluation will be conducted and the diameter of the previously treated cystic tumor measured in the x and y dimensions to assess 3 month response.

 Any cyst still >15mm and amendable to repeat ablation will undergo a second EUS-guided chemoablation treatment using the same lavage and ablation agent that the patient was randomized to initially.

 At 12 months after the initial ablation, the patient will be seen in the GI clinic and undergo either MRI-MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) or enhanced CT scan for a full pancreaticobiliary evaluation and to assess the end-point treatment response.

 CHARM II: Chemotherapy for Ablation and Resolution of Mucinous Pancreatic Cysts@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapeutic pancreatic cyst ablation using ethanol lavage followed by the infusion of a single agent chemotherapeutic agent (paclitaxel) compared with alcohol free, saline lavage followed by infusion of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic cocktail (paclitaxel + gemcitabine) for the ablation of pancreatic cystic neoplasms using endoscopic ultrasound fine needle infusion (EUS-FNI) for agent delivery.

 The ultimate purpose os a safe and more effective EUS-FNI , method to eliminate there pre cancerous cyst and prevent a significant percentage of pancreatic cancer.
