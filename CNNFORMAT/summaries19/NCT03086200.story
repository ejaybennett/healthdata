(secondQuint)CCTG 603: Randomized Controlled Trial of iTAB Plus Motivational Interviewing for PrEP Adherence in Transgender Individuals (The iM-PrEPT Study).

 A total of 300 HIV-uninfected transgender or gender non-conforming individuals, defined as currently identifying as a gender different from sex assigned at birth, with high-risk transmission behavior will be enrolled into this study.

 Each participant will be followed for a maximum of 48 weeks after enrollment.

 The primary endpoint will be measured at 48 weeks, or the last week on study if the participant is discontinued early.

 All participants will start PrEP with TDF / FTC fixed dose combination taken once daily.

 Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the iTAB text messaging adherence reminder intervention either with or without brief motivational interviewing (MI-b) for suboptimal adherence.

 All participants will receive the iTAB system to provide personalized, automated text messages to support and monitor adherence.

 In the MI-b arm, poor adheres by iTAB reporting will receive targeted MI-b via telephone.

 Both groups will receive PrEP in accordance with standardized comprehensive methods of prescribing, which includes risk reduction counseling, adherence counseling, and clinical assessments with safety monitoring, as well as HIV and STI screening.
