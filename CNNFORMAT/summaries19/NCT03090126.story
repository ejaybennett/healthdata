(secondQuint)Assessment of Therapeutic Education About Non Invasive Ventilation in Patients With Chronic Respiratory Failure (QoVNI).

 Therapeutic education about non invasive ventilation in patients with chronic respiratory failure and alveolar hypoventilation is assessed during the first six months of ventilation thanks to a questionnaire.

 Moreover, the impact of this therapeutic education on non invasive ventilation compliance, blood gas, dyspnea and nocturnal desaturation is assessed.
