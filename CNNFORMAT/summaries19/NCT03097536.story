(thirdQuint)Migraine and Homeostasis:What Can we Learn From Glucose.

 The purpose of this pilot and feasibility study is to assess if changes in blood glucose both trigger migraine and can provide analgesia.

 This information will provide a vital basis for the mechanism of migraine and offer insights into better treatments as well as prevention.

 This is a pilot unblinded randomized trial with two independent components, Aims 1 and 2.

 It is not possible to blind the current protocol both in terms of the blood sugar readings and the luna bar, non-luna bar intervention.

 Migraine and Homeostasis:What Can we Learn From Glucose@highlight

Patients with migraine often report that stressors such as skipping a meal can bring on a migraine whereas some patients report that their migraine improves with food.

 Few studies to date have looked at the relationship between blood glucose (sugar) and migraine.

 We are conducting this study to better understand whether or not changes in blood glucose levels can trigger migraine or provide relief during a migraine attack.
