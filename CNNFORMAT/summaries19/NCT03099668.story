(fifthQuint)Multidisciplinary Team Care in Rheumatoid Arthritis.

 Hypotheses 1.

 Holistic review by a multidisciplinary team leads to improved outcomes such as improved disease activity, physical function and quality of life (QOL) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

 2.

 These improved outcomes are likely mediated via improvements in medication adherence, coping, disease specific knowledge and improved self-efficacy.

 3.

 A "One Stop Arthritis Clinic" (OSAC) where patients are seen by a multidisciplinary team co-located in time and space, is an effective solution to delivering multidisciplinary care.

 Specific aims Primary: To determine whether a multidisciplinary review, as compared to routine review by the treating rheumatologist, leads to improved QOL as measured by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimension 3 Level (EQ-5D) index at 6 months in patients with RA with deemed stable disease activity.

 Secondary: 1.

 To examine the effect of the multidisciplinary review, as compared to routine rheumatologist review on RA disease activity (measured using the disease activity score in 28 joints, DAS28), pain (measured using a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS), and physical function (measured using the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire, mHAQ).

 2.

 To examine the effect of the multidisciplinary review, as compared to routine rheumatologist review on several secondary measures including self-efficacy (as measured using the Rheumatoid Arthritis Self Efficacy, RASE), Disease Specific Knowledge (DSK) using a Patient Knowledge Questionnaire (PKC), coping and medication adherence (using the MARS questionnaire, pill counts and adherence proportion percentage) 3.

 To examine the effect of the multidisciplinary review, as compared to routine rheumatologist review on patient experience Background and Significance Burden of disease: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease affecting approximately 0.

5 -0.

7% of the population; and most common in working-age adults.

 Inadequately treated RA is a leading cause of disability, work loss and productivity loss due to irreversible joint damage in this relatively young group of the population, in the prime of their productive work-life.

 "Treat to Target" (T2T) approach: It has been clearly shown, that a T2T approach, in which therapy is escalated at regular intervals according to a pre-determined protocol and driven by consistent measurement of disease activity, is superior to routine care in achieving remission, and T2T is now standard of care.

 A validated, clinically sensitive composite disease activity measure, the DAS28 is routinely used to measure disease activity, and is a good predictor of disability.

722 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.

156.

 Allowing for an alpha error of 5%, and 95% power to demonstrate a minimal clinically important improvement of 0.

1 in the EQ-5D index, we would need a sample size of 128 for a 1:1 randomisation (64 in each arm).

 After allowing for a 10% dropout rate, we plan to recruit 140 patients (70 in each arm) to this study.

 Approximately 60 patients with RA are seen weekly at NUH.

 The OSAC runs once a week and has a capacity of 6 patients per clinic session.

 If we can randomize 8 patients per week (of which half would be randomized to the intervention arm, to be seen at OSAC), we would be able to recruit an adequate number of subjects in about 18 weeks.

 The consultation fee for the study participants' baseline visit (OSAC or routine rheumatology review) would be paid for through the grant funding; thus providing an incentive for patients to participate, and also overcoming the cost barrier for referral to OSAC.

 Follow up for all patients would be completed about 9 months after the last patient is recruited; thus the study can be completed in about 14 months.

 Statistical analysis: All analysis will be done using Stata(R) statistical software.

 The mean EQ-5D index at 6 months of patients in the intervention and control groups will be compared using the Student's t-test.

 Logistic regression will be used to calculate the odds of achieving a minimal clinically important difference in QOL (as measured by a 0.

1 increase in the EQ-5D index) between the intervention vs.

 the control group while controlling for confounders such as age, gender, disease duration, disease severity (seropositivity, presence of erosions at baseline), disease activity (DAS28) and mHAQ at baseline.

 We will further determine whether self-efficacy, coping, adherence and DSK can improve prediction of QOL when they are added to the regression model.

 Strengths and limitations This is a randomized controlled study, thus controlling for bias in terms of allocation of patients to MDT care.

 Disease activity outcomes are blinded; as joint counts will be performed by a blinded assessor.

 The case report form is designed to be comprehensive, such that all possible outcomes of importance will be collected.

 Though cost-effectiveness is not one of the outcomes to be studied, the data collected are adequate to do a cost -effectiveness analysis if necessary.

 The main limitation of the study is that the patients cannot be blinded to the intervention (MDT care).

 This is inherent to the nature of the intervention.

 In addition, outcome assessors cannot be blinded to several of the outcomes, as they are determined from patient reported questionnaires; thus may be biased in favour of MDT care.

 Radiographic outcomes in terms of joint space narrowing and erosions are not collected as part of this study, as typically changes in these need time ( 1 year) and are relatively insensitive to subtle interventions such as ours.

 However, increasingly outcomes important to the patient are thought to be the most preferred outcomes to study, and have been shown to be predictive of radiographic damage.

 Multidisciplinary Team Care in Rheumatoid Arthritis@highlight

A randomised study of multidisciplinary care (MDT) versus routine care in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

 Patients with RA are randomised either to a single visit to a "one Stop Arthritis Clinic' (OSAC) or to see their usual rheumatologists.

 Data are collected at the baseline visit, and again at subsequent clinic visits (approximately 3 and 6 months).

 Outcomes such as quality of life, disease activity, physical function, disease specific knowledge, coping and self efficacy are evaluated.

 Assessment of comorbidities and preventative care (cancer screening, vaccinations, cardiovascular risk assessment and optimisation) are also assessed between the 2 arms.
