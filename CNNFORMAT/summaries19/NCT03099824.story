(thirdQuint)A Study of the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of GC4711 (Oral Capsule) Compared to GC4419 (IV Infusion) in Healthy Volunteers.

 GTO-003 is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study conducted in Australia to compare the safety and pharmacokinetics of orally administered GC4711 with Intravenously administered GC4419, with an assessment of food effects.

 The study will be conducted in healthy adult volunteers, in two parts.

 In Part 1, a standard, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study will be performed.

 In Part 2, the conduct of which will be contingent on results of Part 1, a food effect cohort will be studied to investigate the effect of food on absorption.

 Consenting subjects will undergo screening procedures within 28 days of the start of dosing.

 Pharmacokinetics (PK) (parent drug and major metabolites) will be assessed in plasma and urine from all subjects.

 Part 1: GC4711 or matching placebo will be administered once by mouth for a single dose at escalating doses starting with one capsule (82 mg) and escalating to 5 capsules (410 mg).

 The oral GC4711 drug product will be enteric-coated size 0 Capsugel Vcap Plus hard gel capsule containing GC4711 in a liquid formulation.

 It is anticipated that at least 5 dose cohorts will be tested and depending on safety and PK outcome, additional serial cohorts may be added.

 Subjects in all cohorts will receive a single dose of oral GC4711 or placebo 48 hours after a single dose of IV GC4419 administered over 60 minutes.

 For all cohorts, 8 subjects per cohort will be enrolled, randomized 6:2 to active GC4711 or matched placebo.

 All cohorts will include a sentinel cohort consisting of two subjects, one randomized to oral GC4711 and one to matching placebo who will be observed for 24 hours with safety data reviewed by the treating investigator before dosing of 6 additional subjects in the full cohort (5 active: 1 placebo).

 After each cohort, safety and PK data will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and the internal Galera study team before proceeding to the next cohort.

 Depending on the inter-subject variability in oral bioavailability, additional subjects may be added to one or more dosing cohorts or additional cohorts may be added.

 Subjects will also undergo electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring at selected PK time points, to include the estimated Tmax, (anticipated to be 2-4 hours after a dose of GC4711), to assess the relationship between drug exposure to GC4419/GC4711 and effects on the QT interval.

 Part 2: After completion of the single-ascending dose portion of the study, a separate cohort of subjects will receive a single dose of GC4711 (at a dose no higher than previously found to have an acceptable safety profile), under fasted or fed conditions, followed, after a 7-day washout period, of a second single dose of oral GC4711, at the same dose as before, under the opposite condition (fed or fasting).

 In the food effect cohort, subjects will be randomly assigned 1:1 to the fed-fasted sequence (i.

e.

, either fed-first or fasted-first).

 For the fed condition, subjects will receive a standard meal.

 There will be no placebo dosing or IV GC4419 dosing in the food effect cohort.

 Approximately 58 health adult volunteers will be enrolled into this study: 40 in Part 1 and 18 in Part 2.

 For each cohort, the study will consist of a Screening period, a Baseline visit and an Active Phase.

 The duration for an individual subject will depend on their assignment to study part.

 A Study of the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of GC4711 (Oral Capsule) Compared to GC4419 (IV Infusion) in Healthy Volunteers@highlight

The purpose of the phase 1, GTO-003 clinical study is to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of a new drug called GC4711 when given as an oral tablet.

 This study will compare capsules containing a liquid suspension of GC4711 when given orally to a similar drug called GC4419 which will be given as an intravenous infusion.

 This study will also assess the effect of food on GC4711.
