(fifthQuint)OCT and Scaffold Embedding After NC Balloon.

 This study is a single-center, prospective, observational study designed to enroll 50 subjects presenting with stable angina pectoris or acute coronary syndromes requiring treatment of de novo lesions.

 Consented subjects are to undergo PCI and have a lesion without angiographic calcification.

 Eligible subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria for BVS scaffold implant will have a BVS-specific implantation protocol with high pressure post-scaffold implantation ballooning, designed to specifically address the issue of incomplete BVS expansion.

 Because the scaffold is compliant, a perfectly embedded scaffold is sometimes observed in a lesion with soft plaque, resulting in a smaller intra-luminal scaffold volume that may reduce the event rate.

 Enrolled subjects will have OCT ( optical coherence tomography ) pre and post BVS implantation to assess the change in the intraluminal scaffold volume and the prevalence of scaffold embedding from post-scaffold implantation (using the moderate pressure of 12 atm) to post-dilation high pressure (16-20 atm), non-compliant ballooning in relation to the underlying plaque.
