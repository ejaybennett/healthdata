(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Using the Combination Treatment of SHR-1210, Gemcitabine and Cis-platinum by Recurrent and Metastatic NPC Subjects.

 This is an open-label, single center, nonrandomized, Phase 1 study to evaluate safety and efficacy of using the combination treatment of SHR-1210, gemcitabine and cis-platinum by recurrent and metastatic NPC.

 The safety of SHR-1210 will be assessed by ongoing reviews of clinical laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and adverse events.

 Evaluations of immune safety will also be conducted (immune-related adverse events (AEs), or labs of autoimmune sera, inflammatory events, and immunogenicity).

 Safety evaluations (both clinical and laboratory) are performed at baseline, before each study treatment, and throughout the study.

Tumor response will be assessed by radiographic examination in screening visit and every 2 cycles after first dose.
