(secondQuint)Effectiveness, Safety and Clinical Outcomes of Paritaprevir/Ombitasvir/r+Dasabuvir 8 Weeks.

 HCV chronic infection affects 200 million people worldwide.

 HCV antiviral treatment has evolved rapidly since 2011.

 The introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) achieve great effectiveness with minimum SAEs and short treatment duration.

 However, studies evaluating efficacy and safety of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ ritonavir and dasabuvir during 8 weeks are limited in real clinical practice.

 The aim of the study is to evaluate in clinical practice the efficacy and safety of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ ritonavir and dasabuvir administered for 8 weeks in treatment-naive participants with genotype 1b hepatitis C virus (HCV).
