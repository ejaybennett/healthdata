(secondQuint)Study of ADCT-502 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors With HER2 Expression.

 Study ADCT-502-101 is the first clinical study with ADCT-502 in patients with Advanced Solid Tumors with HER2 Expression.

 ADCT-502 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of an engineered version of the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, directed against the human HER2 receptor, conjugated to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin.

 ADCT-502 specifically binds to HER2, and once internalized, releases the PBD dimer to allow cross-linking of DNA and eventually trigger cell death.

 The study will be conducted in 2 parts.

 In Part 1 (dose escalation) patients will receive an infusion of ADCT-502, at escalating doses.

 Part 1 will continue until the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended dose(s) and schedule(s) for expansion are determined.

 In Part 2 (expansion), patients will be assigned to the recommended dose level of ADCT-502 identified in Part 1 by the Dose Escalation Steering Committee.

 For each patient, the study will include a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment period, and a follow-up period to assess disease progression and survival for up to 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug.

 The total study duration will be dependent on overall patient tolerability to the study drug and response to treatment as patients may continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 It is anticipated that the duration of the entire study (Parts 1 and 2) could be approximately 3 years from first patient treated to last patient completed.

 Study of ADCT-502 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors With HER2 Expression@highlight

This study evaluates ADCT-502 in patients with Advanced Solid Tumors with HER2 Expression.

 Patients will participate in a dose-escalation phase (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2).

 In Part 2, patients will receive the dose level identified in Part 1.
