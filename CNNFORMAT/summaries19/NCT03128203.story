(firstQuint)Effects of Intranasal Oxytocin on Striatal Functional Connectivity.

 In a double-blind, between-subject, placebo controlled design, investigators plan to investigate the effects of oxytocin treatment on resting-state functional connectivity.

 Subject will receive either intranasal oxytocin or placebo administration and go through a seven-minute resting-state scan in MRI scanner to test whether oxytocin changes functional connectivity in the brain.

 Trait anxiety and mood questionnaires will be administered as control variables.
