(thirdQuint)The Impact of Vitamin D Supplementation on Glucose Metabolism in Chinese Women With Former Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.

 Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance that is first identified during pregnancy, excluding diabetic patients diagnosed before pregnancy.

 GDM can not only have an adverse effect on the pregnant women and the developing fetus, but also can have long lasting effects after birth.

 GDM can elevates risks of abnormal glucose metabolism postpartum.

 Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be associated with insulin resistance and impaired -cell function.

 Our previous research also implied that the level of vitamin D is much lower in the women of impaired glucose regulation after birth with history of GDM.

 This prospective randomized, control clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D administration on insulin resistance and -cell function among women with vitamin D deficiency(25OHD -cell function and markers of inflammation in Chinese women with former GDM and vitamin D insufficiency.

Vitamin D deficiency are related to insulin resistance and impaired beta-cell function.

It is reported that the level of vitamin D is lower during pregnancy and postpartum in the women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.

 The investigators hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation to women after birth with previous gestational diabetes may improve glucose metabolism.
