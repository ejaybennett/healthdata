(thirdQuint)Ultrasonographic Measurements of Uterine Junctional Zone and Association With In Vitro Fertilization Treatment Outcome.

 Ultrasounds of women who achieve pregnancy after IVF treatment will be compared to ultrasounds of women who do not achieve pregnancy.

 Their uterine junctional zone thickness will be compared.

 The study hypothesis is that the uterine junctional zones of women who did not achieve pregnancy will be thicker than those of the women who do achieve pregnancy.
