(fifthQuint)Limited English Proficiency Occupational Therapy Patients Receiving Interpreter Services Perception of Quality of Care.

 The sampling frame will consist of adults, age 18 or older, with limited English proficiency (LEP), with an upper extremity injury or disorder, that have been referred to occupational therapy (OT) at Midwest Orthopaedics at Rush (MOR), require services that span four weeks or more, agree to use of interpreter services, agree to completing a paper and pencil survey at the end of four weeks, and agree to be interviewed after four weeks of occupational therapy services, following completion of the survey.

 LEP is determined by a preference to receive medical information in a non-English language.

 Sampling frame is four participants.

 The sampling frame will be purposive.

 As LEP individuals present for OT services they will be recruited for participation.

 Recruitment could happen simultaneously or in tandem.

 The comparison group sampling frame will consist of adults, age 18 or older, proficient in English, with an upper extremity injury or disorder, that have been referred to OT at MOR, and require services that span four weeks or more.

 English proficiency is determined by use of English as preferred language.

 Sampling frame is four participants.

 For each LEP individual recruited, the following English-speaking individual will be asked to participate.

 When participants in each group are recruited, further recruitment will cease.

 The total sampling frame will be eight.

 Enlisting an English proficient individual following recruitment of an LEP individual ensures having equal participation in each group.

 A paper and pencil survey will be administered in person at MOR after the initial occupational therapy visit and at the end of four weeks of OT services to the 4 Limited English proficient subjects and 4 English-speaking subjects, for 16 completed surveys.

 Completion will take place in a private room in the OT department.

 Subjects will self-select a 4 digit identification code that they will write in at the top of the survey.

 The sole purpose of the code is to match the pre-OT satisfaction survey with the post-OT satisfaction survey.

 No personal identification markers will be used on the surveys.

 Interviews will be conducted with each LEP individual following four weeks of OT services and after completion of the paper survey.

 No personal identification markers will be placed on the interview form.

 The interviews will be conducted in person at MOR, in a private room in the OT department.

 The primary investigator will present the open-ended questions with the assistance of Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) interpreter services.

 The documented data will be reviewed by the primary investigator for emerging themes that may provide insight and additional information.

 Limited English Proficiency Occupational Therapy Patients Receiving Interpreter Services Perception of Quality of Care@highlight

A systematic literature review from March through June 2014 supports the premise that limited English proficiency (LEP) persons face barriers and disparities to medical care that English-speaking persons do not face.

 Language barriers have a negative impact on health and health care, including lower health status, lower likelihood of having a primary care provider, lower rate of preventative care, higher use rate of diagnostic tests, higher rate of severe psychopathology diagnoses, and higher risk of drug complications .

 Additionally, LEP persons experience problems with effective communication with providers, inappropriate diagnoses and treatments, lower comprehension of medication instructions and adherence to regimens, fewer follow up visits, low quality care, poorer health outcomes, and low patient satisfaction.

 Research has proven a relationship between LEP and health care outcomes, specifically a relationship between positive outcomes and use of professional interpreters.

 Not sharing a common language creates a barrier to providing safe, effective, client-centered Occupational Therapy (OT) and knowledge of outcome satisfaction for this population.

 Using trained interpreters would reduce the barriers created by language discordance.

 This evidence-based project intends to measures the influence of interpreter service on LEP patients' perceived quality of care using a satisfaction survey.

 Gathered data will be used to consider development and implementation of practice guidelines for use of professional interpreter services for LEP patients receiving OT services at Midwest Orthopaedics at Rush.

 Development and implementation of practice guidelines that include use of trained interpreters when providing OT services to LEP patients will facilitate a client-centered approach and improve quality of care for this population.

 The project is also being implemented as part of a degree requirement for the Doctorate of Occupational Therapy Program at Chatham University.
