(firstQuint)Glenoid Bone Grafting for RTSA: Clinical & Radiographic Outcomes.

 Glenoid bone loss is a known issue with reverse shoulder implants and can lead to issues with implant fixation and stability over time.

 To address this issue an extended peg glenoid baseplate is used and area around plate is augmented with bone (auto or allo)graft material to encourage bony callous growth around the implant.

 This study is to look at this area of concern and determine if glenoid bone loss is occurring in the patients where these measures have been taken to deter its development.
