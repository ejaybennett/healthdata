(fifthQuint)Virus Specific Immune Lymphocytes (Virus-CTL) in the Treatment of Opportunistic Viral Diseases Post Transplantation.

 Background: Opportunistic infection virus related diseases are major causes of transplant-related morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients, especially in the early post-transplant period.

 CMV, EBV, adenovirus (ADV), BK virus (BKV) and other viruses after transplantation, which may lead to life-threatening infections.

 Adoptive immunotherapy with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) reactive with specific viral antigens has proven to be effective without stimulating acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) owing to the significantly reduced nonspecific alloreactivity.

 Here, the investigators aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple infusions of mix opportunistic infection virus peptide cytotoxic T lymphocytes cells in patients.

 Objective: Primary study objectives: Infusion of autologous or allogenic Virus-CTL to patients by I.

V.

, to evaluate the safety.

 Secondary study objectives: To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of IV-infused autologous or allogenic Virus-CTL cells.

 Design: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained through apheresis.

 T cells from PBMC will be activated and enriched by dendritic cells with virus specific peptides.

 Cell preparation time is approximately 12-17 days.

 Subject will receive infusions of 1x105~4x106 cells/kg body weight of virus-CTL via IV infusion at 4 times.

 Patients are followed 1 week after the final infusion, monthly for 3 months, and then every 3 months until the trial ends.

 Virus Specific Immune Lymphocytes (Virus-CTL) in the Treatment of Opportunistic Viral Diseases Post Transplantation@highlight

Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) result in significant morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients in China.

 Antiviral drugs are usually used for prophylactic purposes and treatment after early detectable viral load.

 Unfortunately, some patients may develop resistance to antivirals.

 In addition to patient with HSCT, immune compromised patients may also been the targets for these opportunistic viruses.

 Thus in this study, the safety and efficacy of CMV and EBV specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) will be determined.
