(fifthQuint)Project IMPACT: CHW Intervention.

 The Goal of this study is that: 1.

 EHR-based decision support and performance feedback interventions will be more effective in improving hypertension control for South Asian patients than standard care; 2.

 A combined EHR-CHW intervention will be more effective in improving hypertension control for South Asian patients compared to standard care and the EHR-based intervention Investigators hope to implement and assess the efficacy of CHW-led coaching through promotion of team-based care and use of culturally tailored education to improve hypertension control and mitigate risk factors related to CVD among South Asian patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

 Study findings can provide translatable and scalable models for other limited English proficient communities.
