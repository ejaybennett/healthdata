 G-CSF Administration in IVF in a Preferable Preceptive Endometrium Score@highlight

This is a controlled preminary trial intended to increase the implantation rate of IVF cycles, by using more than one known procedure, endometrial scratching, evaluating the status of the adhesive factors as V3 integrin, L-selectin ligand MECA-79, E-cadherin and ICAM-1, as a determinant for intervention by G-CSF, according to a score that can be done on a small sample obtained during scratching, then give G-CSF for the scores less than 4 intrauterine and subcutaneously.
