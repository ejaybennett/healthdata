(firstQuint)Correlation Between Radiographic Bone Density in CBCT and Implant Stability Quotient Value: Clinical Observational Study.

 Dental implants have been widely used in the field of dental rehabilitation.

 Nowadays implant sucess rate is very high but to keep faliure rate as low as possible patient selection is very important especially regarding bone density to achieve high primary stability.

 Primary stability plays an important role in successful osteointegration of dental implants.

 This study was done to correlate between the bone density pre operatively measured on CBCT represented by HF unit and implant stability measured post operatively by ostell device represented by ISQ unit.
