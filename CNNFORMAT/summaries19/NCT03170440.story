(fifthQuint)Non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation and Sleep.

 Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) frequently co-occur and these patients often have disrupted sleep.

 Patients with PTSD are more likely to wake up multiple times a night.

 Further, autonomic and behavioral components during sleep are consistent with a continued fight or flight defensive state while asleep.

 This includes higher heart rate, lower parasympathetic tone, and greater likelihood of nightmares.

 Further supporting this stress response, cortisol levels are inversely related to the proportion of slow wave sleep observed in these patients.

 PTSD is also associated with higher insomnia severity scores as well as regional neurotransmitter disruptions in systems critical for the regulation of affect.

 Poor sleep quality is associated with several poor health outcomes that overlap with those that are experienced in PTSD.

 These include poor cognitive performance and affective lability as well as associations with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and inflammatory diseases including arthritis.

 Prior research has argued that the etiology of large portion of PTSD related symptoms include disrupted sleep.

 Effective treatment of sleep problems in this population could have substantial impact on these symptoms and improve quality of life.

 Current prescription pharmacological approaches often have side effects like negative impact on sleep architecture, addiction, and cognitive performance consequences.

 Further, veterans often report that they use alcohol and other drugs in order to fall asleep and stop nightmares, compounding the issue.

 Vagal nerve stimulation approaches have potential, especially in this population, to improve sleep quality and to also improve emotional/cognitive state.

 Further, brain effects of vagal nerve stimulation include attenuated activation of limbic structures critical to manifestation of symptoms in PTSD including the amygdala as well as reduced physiological arousal including decreased blood pressure.

 Thus, our objective is to determine the effect of tVNS in changing sleep architecture and subjective quality including autonomic state and subsequent (next morning) emotional and cognitive performance in patients with PTSD (with and without mild TBI) and combat expose healthy controls.

The study team will use a within-subject cross-over design in a sleep lab based study to assess the impact of tVNS administered at "lights out" on several critical sleep variables including sleep onset, sleep architecture and autonomic profile, and morning emotional state, sleep quality evaluation, and cognitive performance.

 Non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation and Sleep@highlight

Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) frequently co-occur, and these patients often have disrupted sleep.

 Poor sleep quality is associated with several poor heath outcomes that overlap with those that are experienced in PTSD.

 These can include poor cognitive performance and difficulty with emotional regulation.

 Effective treatment of sleep problems in these individuals could substantially improve these symptoms and quality of life.

 Transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a non-invasive electrical stimulation technique that has been previously shown to moderate the response of the sympathetic nervous system and reduce hyperarousal in patients with mTBI and PTSD.

 In this study, our objective is to determine the effect of tVNS in changing sleep architecture and subjective sleep quality, as well as changing emotional and cognitive performance.
