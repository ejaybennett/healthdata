(fifthQuint)Influence of Dietary Nitrate on Skin Inflammation.

 Nitric oxide (NO) is an important substance produced continuously by all blood vessels.

 It is thought to maintain health, in part, by preventing and suppressing inflammatory responses.

 NO is normally generated at the endothelium by a group of important enzymes called nitric oxide synthases.

 However, in chronic inflammatory states such as those seen in cardiovascular disease (CVD), the endothelial isoform of the enzyme becomes dysfunctional and produces less NO, and the NO that is produced is scavenged by the products of oxidative stress.

 Giving NO back to the blood vessel to mediate its beneficial effects is not straightforward.

 However, the Ahluwalia Group have shown that dietary inorganic nitrate, both as a capsule and a dietary intervention with nitrate-rich beetroot juice, has a number of beneficial effects in CVD states.

 This beneficial effect is mediated through it's endogenous conversion from nitrate to nitrite in the mouth, and then from nitrite to NO via nitrite reductases within the blood vessel.

 The Investigators have shown benefit of inorganic nitrate in pre-clinical models of CVD, early mechanistic studies in healthy volunteers, and anti-inflammatory benefits in patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and those suffering acute heart attacks.

 The Investigators wish to prospectively investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of inorganic nitrate using a cantharidin-induced blister model of acute inflammation.

 This allows investigation of the innate immune system's response to an acute insult and characterise the inflammatory and resolution phases.

 Cantharidin is commonly used as a vesicant in the treatment of plantar verrucae and molluscum contagiosum, and experimentally to study the pharmacokinetics of drugs within the interstitial space.

 This will be a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel limb study supplementing 24 healthy volunteers with dietary-rich beetroot juice versus nitrate-deplete placebo juice, to investigate blister formation, and inflammatory cell recruitment and activation.

 Influence of Dietary Nitrate on Skin Inflammation@highlight

This study evaluates the potential anti-inflammatory effects of inorganic dietary nitrate in a model of acute inflammation relevant to cardiovascular disease (CVD).

 Green leafy vegetables contain large amounts of inorganic nitrate, and research suggests that this nitrate has beneficial effects on the heart and blood vessels.

 The Ahluwalia Group have shown anti-inflammatory benefits of inorganic nitrate in pre-clinical models of CVD, early mechanistic studies in healthy volunteers, and in patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and those suffering acute heart attacks that translate to cardiovascular benefits.

 Understanding the mechanism of how this is achieved may open new therapeutic options in CVD.

 The Investigators therefore wish to explore whether inorganic nitrate might alter inflammatory responses using a blister-model of acute skin inflammation.

 This study is a randomised control trial with parallel limbs where half of patients receive nitrate-rich beetroot juice, and the other half a nitrate-deplete placebo beetroot juice.
