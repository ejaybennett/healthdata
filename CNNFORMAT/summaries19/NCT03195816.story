(secondQuint)A Computer-based Cognitive Stimulation in Mild Cognitive Impairment With White Matter Hyperintensities.

 White matter hyperintensities (WMH) can appear in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and have been associated to executive, attention and processing speed deficits.

 Some findings indicate that the presence of WMH may contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in addition to ss-amyloid, suggesting a greater vulnerability of MCI.

 One important challenge is to prevent or slowing down the progression of WMH.

 Few studies investigated the effects of computerized cognitive interventions in MCI with WMH, which deserve special attention.

 This study aim to investigate the effects of an intensive computer-based cognitive stimulation (CCS) program on the verbal learning in episodic memory in MCI with WMH and to explore the effects on the progression of WMH at 1-year interval.
