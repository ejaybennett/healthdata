(fifthQuint)Clinical Values of Voiding Diary for Diagnosis and Treatment for Monosymptomatic Enuresis in Children.

 During the first visit to a doctor, a questionnaire about nocturnal enuresis will be filled in and additional tests will be done according to the standard procedure to screen out who have monosymptomatic enuresis.

Then participants will complete a 3-day voiding diary or a 7-day voiding diary before treatment.

 During the second visit to a doctor, doctors will diagnose by voiding diary which type of enuresis is present.

 Participants need to fill in the 3-day or 7-day voiding diary at 1, 3 and 6 months after standard treatment.

 About 800 patients from 5 to 18 years old will be included in this prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center and large sample study and will be followed up at the outpatient clinic.

 Clinical Values of Voiding Diary for Diagnosis and Treatment for Monosymptomatic Enuresis in Children@highlight

Nocturnal enuresis is common problem in children who are from 5 to 18 years old and do not spontaneously urinate at least 2 times a week for more than 3 months.

 It can lead to major distress for the children and their parents.

 The investigators hypothesize that the 3-day voiding diary as the same as the 7-day voiding diary could be a diagnostic tool to provide information on the diagnosis and classification of nocturnal enuresis.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate the reliability and sensitivity of 3-day versus 7-day voiding diary to diagnose nocturnal enuresis.
