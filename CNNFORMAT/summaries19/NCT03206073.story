(fifthQuint)A Phase I/II Study of Pexa-Vec Oncolytic Virus in Combination With Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in Refractory Colorectal Cancer.

 Background: - Immune-based approaches in colorectal cancer have unfortunately with the notable exception of immune checkpoint inhibition in microsatellite instable (MSI-hi) disease been largely unsuccessful.

 The reasons for this are unclear but no doubt relate to the fact that in advanced disease colorectal cancer appears to be less immunogenic, as evidenced by the lack of infiltrating lymphocytes with advancing T stage - Pexa-Vec (JX-594) is a thymidine kinase gene-inactivated oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered for the expression of transgenes encoding human granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and beta-galactosidase.

 Apart from the direct oncolytic activity, oncolytic viruses such as Pexa-Vec have been shown to mediate tumor cell death via the induction of innate and adaptive immune responses - Tremelimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA-4 expressed on the surface of activated T lymphocytes and causes inhibition of B7-CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation.

 Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1.

 - The aim of the study is to evaluate whether the anti-tumor immunity induced by Pexa-Vec oncolytic viral therapy can be enhanced by immune checkpoint inhibition.

 Objective: -To determine the safety, tolerability and feasibility of Pexa-Vec oncolytic virus in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition in patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.

 Eligibility: - Histologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer.

 - Patients must have progressed on, been intolerant of or refused prior oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-containing, fluorouracil-based, chemotherapeutic regimen and have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection.

 Patients who have a known KRAS wild type tumor must have progressed, been intolerant of or refused cetuximab or panitumumabbased chemotherapy.

 - Patients tumors must be documented to be microsatellite-stable (MSS) either by genetic analysis or immunohistochemistry OR microsatellite-high with documented disease progression following anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy.

 - Patients must have at least one focus of metastatic disease that is amenable to pre- and ontreatment biopsy.

 - Willingness to undergo mandatory tumor biopsy.

 Design: - The proposed study is Phase I/II study of Pexa-Vec oncolytic virus at two dose levels in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

 - Patients with advanced microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (or MSI-hi disease that is refractory to PD-1 monotherapy) will receive Pexa-Vec, administered IV at a dose of either 3 x 108 plaque forming units (pfu) (DL1) or 109 pfu (DL2) every 2 weeks for 4 doses, in 4 separate arms A1, A2, B1, and B2.

 The first administration will be on Day (minus) 12, followed by administration on Days 2, 16 and 30 (i.

e.

 4 doses in total).

 - Arms A1 and A2: In addition to the oncolytic virus patients will also receive durvalumab at a flat dose of 1500 mg as an intravenous infusion beginning on Day 1 followed by q28days until off-treatment criteria are met.

 - Arms B1 and B2: In addition to the oncolytic virus patients will also receive tremelimumab 75 mg and durvalumab 1500 mg as intravenous infusions beginning on Day 1 followed by q28days for 4 doses with subsequent continuation of the durvalumab alone until off-treatment criteria are met.

 - Pexa-Vec will commence on Day (minus) 12 to facilitate tumor biopsies following oncolytic virus alone.

 All patients will undergo a baseline tumor biopsy and a post treatment biopsy.

 The timing of the post-treatment biopsy will depend on assignment.

 The assignment will be balanced with an equal number assigned to each timing group.

 Patients will be assigned to receive the second biopsy on Day 1 (i.

e.

 after one dose of Pexa-Vec alone) or Day 29 (i.

e.

 after the combination of immune checkpoint inhibition and Pexa-Vec).

 (Specific dates of biopsy will have a window of 72 hrs.

 to allow for logistical issues; however, the biopsy will not be performed within 48 hrs.

 after Pexa-Vec administration).

 - Accrual ceiling will be set at 35 to allow for patients replaceable for reasons other than toxicity.

 - Patients will be restaged every 8 weeks +/- 3 days.
