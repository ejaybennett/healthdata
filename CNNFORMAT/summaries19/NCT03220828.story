(fifthQuint)Evaluation of Technology-Based Stress Reduction Techniques Prior to Vascular Access.

 Anxiety among children undergoing vascular access is common.

 Not only is high anxiety traumatic, but research indicates that high anxiety in children before surgery leads to adverse outcomes such as increased pain and analgesics requirements, delayed hospital discharge, and maladaptive behavioral changes.

 Treating anxiety may decrease any of these undesirable behaviors.

 In this study, investigators hope to determine if technology based distractions (VR headsets, AR headset, tablets, or BERT projector) are more effective than standard care for preventing high anxiety before vascular access.

 As a secondary aim of the study, we seek to determine if the use of technology based distraction will result in higher parent and patient satisfaction as well as evaluate which techniques are most effective.

 As a tertiary aim we seek to understand if passive or active interventions are more effective in decreasing anxiety.

 Evaluation of Technology-Based Stress Reduction Techniques Prior to Vascular Access@highlight

Preprocedural, preoperative, and prevascular access anxiety in pediatric patients has been previously shown to increase the likelihood of family stressors, postoperative pain, agitation, sleep disturbances, and negative behavioral changes.

 The purpose of this study is to determine if a non-invasive distracting devices (Virtual Reality headset, Augmented Reality headset, tablet, or bed mounted Video Projection unit (i.

e.

 BERT, Bedside EnterRtainment Theater)) is more effective than the standard of care (i.

e.

, no technology based distraction) for preventing anxiety before vascular access among hospitalized children undergoing vascular access prior to anesthesia, procedures, surgery, blood draws, port access, or peripheral IV placement.

 The anticipated primary outcome will be reduction of child's anxiety during and after vascular access.
