(fifthQuint)EUS-guided RFA for Solid Abdominal Neoplasms.

 RFA causes tissue destruction through the application of a high frequency alternating current, generating local temperatures above 60C and leading to coagulative necrosis.

 The technique has been widely used in many solid organ tumours and has been shown to result in 5-year survival rates comparable to surgery.

 The technique is currently the standard therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal pulmonary metastasis particular in patients that are not suitable for surgery.

 The current study would be a multi-center prospective study involving four high volume international institutions.

 Consecutive patients suffering from solid neoplasms of the liver, stomach and adrenals would be recruited.

 EUS-guided RFA would be performed using a 19-gauge RFA electrode and a VIVA RF generator (STARmed, Korea).

 The primary outcome would be the overall adverse events rate.

 Secondary outcomes include mortality, technical success rate, completion ablation rate, 1 & 3 year overall and disease-free survival.

 EUS-guided RFA for Solid Abdominal Neoplasms@highlight

Radiofrequency ablation has been used for treatment of solid neoplasms of the liver, lung, kidney and adrenal.

 Recently, EUS-guided RFA has become available and the device allows EUS-guided treatment of solid abdominal neoplasms.

 The procedure has been shown to be feasible in the porcine pancreas and was used to treat small groups of patients that are not suitable for surgery suffering from pancreatic cancers.

 The aim of the current study is to perform a multi-center prospective study on EUS-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of solid abdominal neoplasms.

 The hypothesis is that EUS-guided RFA is safe, feasible and effective for treating solid abdominal neoplasms.
