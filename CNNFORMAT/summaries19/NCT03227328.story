(fifthQuint)CHemo-ENDOcrine Therapy in Advanced Breast Cancer.

 Randomized clinical trial of concomitant chemoendocrine therapy versus chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy as first line treatment of luminal B metastatic breast cancer.

 Primary Objective: To compare the efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy and AI versus chemotherapy followed by AI in terms of progression free survival (PFS).

 Secondary objectives: To compare between treatment arms: - quality of life (EORTC quality of life questionnaire(QLQ) QLQ -C30 and QLQ-BR23) - toxicity (CTCAE version 4.

03) - time to treatment failure - time to progression to the therapeutic strategy - best response rate - duration of response - clinical benefit rate - overall survival (OS) - correlative biomarkers of response to chemotherapy and endocrine therapy: - tissue markers (on the primary tumor and / or metastatic tissue) - circulating markers (e.

g.

 CTCs, ctDNA) Assuming a median PFS of 6 months for patients undergoing first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, in order to detect an increase of PFS of 3 months (from 6 to 9 months, hazard ratio 0.

67) in patients receiving concomitant chemo-endocrine therapy, with a two-tail logrank test at 90% power and 5% significance level, 150 patients must be enrolled in each arm (300 patients overall, with 256 expected events) in a period of 24 months, with further 12 months of follow up.

 Comparisons between the two treatment arms will be performed using the stratified log rank test and building Cox proportional-hazard models, with or without inclusion of the main know prognostic and predictive factors.

 CHemo-ENDOcrine Therapy in Advanced Breast Cancer@highlight

Prospective, open label, multicenter, randomized phase III study, comparing two strategies as first chemotherapy-based treatment for locally advanced or metastatic luminal breast cancer.

 - Arm A: concomitant chemotherapy plus an aromatase inhibitor (AI); the AI must continue until disease progression or toxicity or patient refusal; chemotherapy may be stopped after achievement of maximum response (generally after at least about 3-6 months of treatment) or in case of toxicity or patient refusal.

 - Arm B: chemotherapy followed by an AI at the time of progression to chemotherapy (if an endocrine therapy is deemed indicated by the treating physician) or as maintenance therapy after achieving maximum response to chemotherapy (generally after at least about 3-6 months of treatment) or after stopping chemotherapy for toxicity or patient refusal.
