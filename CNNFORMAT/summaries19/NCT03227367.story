(firstQuint)Osteoclast Impairment in Chronic Periodontitis by Regenerative Materials.

.

 Study design Fifty-five individuals from a suburban population were recruited.

 Out of them, 5 individuals refused to participate in the study.

 Finally, 50 participants were selected and divided into two groups, control group [Healthy individuals]: 25 Males/Females, aged 25 to 35 years and test group [Chronic periodontitis patients]: 25 Males/Females aged 30 to 45 years.

 Demographic variables and periodontal parameters were measured in both the groups.

The investigators explored the effect of Platelet rich fibrin (PRF)/Biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) on differentiation and survival of osteoclasts obtained from peripheral blood of Chronic Periodontitis patients.

@highlight

The present study is an effort to investigate the hypothesis that Platelet Rich Fibrin/Biphasic Calcium Phosphate may play a role in inhibiting osteoclasts differentiation and in bone loss.
