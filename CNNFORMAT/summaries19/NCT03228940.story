(fifthQuint)Safety and Effect of Oral RVX000222 in Subjects With Fabry Disease.

 Fabry Disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by mutations in the GLA gene coding for the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (-GAL A).

 As a consequence globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), the enzyme's substrate, is not metabolized efficiently.

 The result is progressive accumulation of Gb3 and related glycosphinglolipids, particularly in blood vessels of the skin, kidney, heart and brain, causing severe complications such as cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy and other cardiovascular related issues, as well as renal failure and end stage renal disease, ischemic stroke and peripheral neuropathy.

 RVX000222 is a BET inhibitor which modulates the expression of a variety of genes; in a number of Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials RVX000222 significantly affected markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), alkaline phosphatase, components of the complement and coagulation cascades, and markers of reverse cholesterol transport in patients with CVD.

 Due to its beneficial effects on several pathways downstream of Gb3 accumulation and MACE reduction, RVX000222 holds promise as a potential add-on therapy to accompany enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in FD patients.

 In addition to regulating disease related pathways, RVX000222 treatment significantly affects putative markers associated with FD such as Afamin and intercellular and vascular adhesion molecules in cell cultures.

 Safety and Effect of Oral RVX000222 in Subjects With Fabry Disease@highlight

Fabry Disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by mutations in the GLA gene which translates into decreased activity or lack of function of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (-GAL A) and accumulation of the enzymes substrate, i.

 Cardiovascular and renal complications are among the leading causes of death in FD patients.

 RVX000222 is a BET inhibitor which modulates the expression of a variety of genes and, due to its effects on pathways downstream of substrate accumulation and reduction of major cardiac events, holds promise as a potential add-on therapy to accompany enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in FD patients.
