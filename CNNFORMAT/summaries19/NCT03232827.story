(fifthQuint)The Impact of Waterpipe Tobacco Flavors on Waterpipe Smoking Intentions, Perceptions, Patterns, and Toxicant Exposure.

 After completing the initial screening by phone, participants will be informed of the study procedures and invited to the lab to complete three WP smoking sessions.

 Participants will perform exhaled carbon monoxide testing (eCO< 10ppm) and confirm that they have not used any nicotine/tobacco/marijuana products over the last 12 hours.

 Pregnancy exclusion will also be confirmed with a urine test, and pregnancy tests will be completed at each visit throughout the study.

 Participants will be randomized and complete study procedures in self-selected dyads.

 The sessions will be counterbalanced and include: 1) smoking preferred flavored-sweetened WP tobacco, 2) smoking unflavored-sweetened WP tobacco, and 3) smoking unflavored-very low sweetened WP tobacco.

 Participants will complete all three study visits in the laboratory.

 Pre-session abstinence from tobacco for at least 12 hours will be mandatory for all participants.

 Abstinence will be confirmed via participant self-report and an exhaled carbon monoxide monitor (< 10 ppm) for tobacco use.

 Participant dyads will smoke hookah ad libitum for up to 1 hour.

 This procedure will be completed for all visits.

 Participants will also complete a minimum 48-hour washout period between sessions.

 Participants will not be allowed to eat, drink or use their phone during the session.

 Initially, one piece of charcoal will be lit and placed on top of the foil.

 Our preliminary studies, as well as other WP laboratory trials, indicate that one piece of charcoal will not be sufficient for one WP session; thus, participants will be provided additional pre-weighed pieces to use as they wish.

 Use of additional charcoal will be recorded.

 Participants will smoke ad libitum and a WP puff topography device will discretely record smoking behavior throughout the session, including puff duration, number of puffs, puff volume, puff flow rate, and time between puffs.

 Blood samples (15mL per sample) and eCO will be collected immediately pre- and post-waterpipe session.

 Self-report measures will be administered.

 The Impact of Waterpipe Tobacco Flavors on Waterpipe Smoking Intentions, Perceptions, Patterns, and Toxicant Exposure@highlight

The overall aim of the current study is to determine if flavorings contribute to the initiation and maintenance of waterpipe (WP) smoking and also influence how a WP is smoked, which has implications for both risk of dependence but also smokers' level of exposure to tobacco-related toxicants.

 Using a randomized crossover-design, 76 current WP smokers (38 low dependent, 38 high dependent) will complete three counterbalanced WP smoking sessions (preferred flavored-sweetened, unflavored-sweetened, and unflavored-very low sweetened) that are preceded by 12 hours of tobacco/nicotine abstinence.

 Sessions will be separated by a standard 48-hour washout period.
