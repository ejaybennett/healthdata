(thirdQuint)Extended Cancer Education for Longer-Term Survivors in Primary Care for Patients With Stage I-II Breast or Prostate Cancer or Stage I-III Colorectal Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Develop the EXCELS intervention to facilitate engaged self-management of cancer follow-up for cancer survivors.

 II.

 Evaluate the efficacy of EXCELS intervention in a small randomized controlled trial.

 III.

 Assess/refine intervention usability and acceptability for primary care patients.

 OUTLINE: PHASE I: EXCELS intervention is developed and assessed.

 PHASE II: Participants are randomized into 1 of 4 arms.

 ARM I: Participants receive National Cancer Institute's Facing Forward brochure.

 ARM II: Participants have untimed access to the EXCELS mobile web application.

 ARM III: Participants also receive 4 calls of 15-20 minutes each over 3 months focusing on assisting survivors with addressing challenges to receiving preventive service and health care.

 ARM IV: Participants have access to EXCELS website as in Arm II.

 Participants also receive 4 health coaching calls as in Arm III.

 Patients are followed up at 6 months, 12 months and 18 months post randomization.

 Extended Cancer Education for Longer-Term Survivors in Primary Care for Patients With Stage I-II Breast or Prostate Cancer or Stage I-III Colorectal Cancer@highlight

This study tests four different methods of educating patients about follow-up care (NCI facing forward, brochure, EXCELS website alone, EXCELS health coaching alone and EXCELS website & health coaching combination) after cancer treatment ends.

 While it is known that patients need information to guide follow-up it remains unknown how to best provide this in primary care.
