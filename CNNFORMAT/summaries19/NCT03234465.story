(fifthQuint)Determination of Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of AG013 in Oral Mucositis Compared to Placebo When Administered Three Times Per Day.

 This is a Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, multi-center trial in which subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or AG013.

 AG013 is a mouth rinse formulation of Lactococcus lactis strain sAGX0085, deficient in the gene coding for thymidylate synthase and producing human TFF1 (Trefoil Factor 1).

 Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in the study.

 To protect subjects from unanticipated safety risks, enrollment and treatment in the double-blind study will continue until 10 subjects on AG013 have been recruited.

 The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety data after these 10 subjects on AG013 have completed study treatment.

 If there are no safety signals identified, the study will continue to recruit the planned number of subjects.

 There are 4 study periods as described below: screening, active treatment, short term follow-up and long term follow-up.

 The screening phase will be no longer than 4 weeks.

 The active treatment phase will be between 7 and 9 weeks depending on the subject's prescribed CRT (chemoradiation therapy) plan.

 The short term follow-up phase will be 4 weeks in duration.

 The long term follow-up will continue until 12 months post CRT.

 Oral mucositis (OM) assessments will begin at the start of CRT and continue until the subject has completed short term follow-up or until the OM resolves (as defined by a WHO (World Health Organization) score of 1), whichever comes first.

 Long term follow-up will continue for 12 months to assure that AG013 does not adversely impact the tumor response to anti-neoplastic therapy.

 Determination of Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of AG013 in Oral Mucositis Compared to Placebo When Administered Three Times Per Day@highlight

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of topically administered AG013 compared to placebo for reducing Oral Mucositis (OM) in patients undergoing chemoradiation for the treatment of head and neck cancer, as measured by the duration, time to development, and overall incidence of OM during the active treatment phase, beginning from the start of chemoradiation therapy (CRT) until 2 weeks following its completion.

 The effect of AG013 on patient-reported symptoms and analgesic use during the active treatment phase, and on the cumulative radiation dose administered before the onset of OM will also be evaluated, as will biomarkers and, in a subset of subjects, the PK (pharmacokinetic) profile of AG013.
