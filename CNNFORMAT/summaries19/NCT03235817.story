(thirdQuint)A Comparison of Different Ventilation Strategies in Infants Using the PLMA.

 The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a breathing device that sits above the vocal cords and allows the patient to breathe in and out adequately under general anesthesia (GA).

 The ProSeal cent laryngeal mask airway (PLMA cent ) is a specialized type of LMA with a design that permits the delivery of higher pressures to help the patient breathe in and out (ventilate) and also contains a channel to suction the stomach.

 Infants under GA may breathe through a PLMA in different ways.

 Spontaneous ventilation consists of the infants breathing on their own through a PLMA cent .

 Pressure support ventilation allows the patient to breathe on their own with additional help from the anesthesia machine.

 Pressure control ventilation allows the patient to breathe with the help of an anesthesia machine.

 An infant undergoing surgery requires a deep level of general anesthesia which negatively affects their ability to ventilate.

 Thus, infants may not breathe in oxygen and carbon dioxide out adequately at this level of anesthesia and it may be beneficial to provide some level of support to enhance carbon dioxide exchange and to avoid hypoventilation.

 This study will attempt to determine whether pressure support ventilation improves ventilation in infants undergoing outpatient surgery.

 A Comparison of Different Ventilation Strategies in Infants Using the PLMA@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to compare difference between breathing by oneself or with the partial help from an anesthesia machine in infants under general anesthesia.

 Hypothesis: Infants undergoing general anesthesia with a PLMA cent will be better ventilated (improved breathing) with the help of the breathing machine versus breathing on their own.
