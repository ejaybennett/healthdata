(secondQuint)Late Effect of Ablation on Premature Ventricular Complex Ablation.

 On tissue level ablation lesion deepens and enlarges by time following the procedure.

 Based on this, investigators aimed to seek patients who has no acute success but late success.

 This phenomenon occurs in some patients.

 Investigators investigate the characteristics of those patients on both procedural and clinical aspects.

 Investigators enroll patients applied during prespecified dates.

 Late Effect of Ablation on Premature Ventricular Complex Ablation@highlight

Premature Ventricular Complex (PVC) ablation is performed in certain indications.

 Generally acutely abolition of PVC at the time of ablation accepted as successful ablation.

 However in some patients this effect occurs lately.

 In this study investigators sought late effect of ablation
