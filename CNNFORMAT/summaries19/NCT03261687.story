(secondQuint)The Effects of a Water Based Exercise Programme and a Land Based Exercise Programme on Women Experiencing Pregnancy Related Pelvic Girdle Pain.

 This study aimed to address whether a water exercise programme improves pain and quality of life in pregnant patients with Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP) compared to a land-based exercise programme and the feasibility of undertaking a large-scale research programme.

 Twenty-three participants with diagnosed PGP, recruited at St George's Hospital London, were randomised into two groups (water or land exercise).

 Each group received, four, once-weekly exercise sessions on land or water.

 Exercise effects on PGP were measured using a variety of outcome measures.

 Outcomes were assessed at baseline and post four weeks exercise.
