(fifthQuint)TransplantLines: the Transplantation Biobank.

 The last decades, the acute period after transplantation has markedly improved due to improved tissue-matching techniques and better immunosuppressive drugs.

 However, nowadays the major aim after transplantation is the long-term patient and graft survival which are still poor, where half of the RTR looses their graft after 10 years.

 With TransplantLines we are setting up an extensive biobank to improve the long-term survival after transplantation.

 Moreover, we are one of the few studies to collect across transplant specialities.

 Like mentioned in the brief summary, extensive questionnaires will be send to participants prior to the visit containing multiple questionnaires (e.

g.

 SF-36, WHODAS, PQ-SGA etc.

).

 During the visit, we will collect multiple blood samples who will be taken during the regularly visit to the clinician.

 Moreover, two tubes from 24-hour urine collection will be collected, faeces, hair and nails will be stored.

 Finally, physical tests and cognitive tests will be performed with the participants (e.

g.

 2-min walking test, 4m walking test, timed-up-and-go test etc.

).

 TransplantLines: the Transplantation Biobank@highlight

TransplantLines is an observational cohort study in all solid transplant recipients, i.

e.

 kidney, heart, lung, liver, small bowel and pancreas.

 In this study we will gather questionnaires about topics affecting transplant recipients, e.

g.

 QoL, work and physical capacity.

 Moreover, we will collect multiple urine and blood samples for analysis.

 Additionally, we will store hair, nails and faeces from the transplant recipients.

 Next to this, we will perform physical capacity tests and cognitive tests.
