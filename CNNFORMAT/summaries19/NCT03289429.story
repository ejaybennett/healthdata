(firstQuint)Antiarrhythmic and Cardioprotective Effects of Atorvastatin Versus Magnesium Sulfate in Cardiac Valve Replacement Surgery.

 Arrhythmia is a common complication after cardiac valve surgery.

 Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is the most common type of arrhythmia after cardiac surgery.

 It has different leading causes, including myocardial injury, inadequate myocardial protection, the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass, and electrolyte imbalance.

 Beta blockers, amiodarone, and magnesium sulfate are used for the management of POAF.

 Statin is used commonly for its lipid lowering action, however, some studies shows that statin has powerful pleiotropic effects including its antiarrhythmic effect.

 This study aims to compare the antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective effects of Atorvastatin versus magnesium sulfate after cardiac replacement surgery.
