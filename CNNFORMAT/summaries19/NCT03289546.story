(secondQuint)The Active Mind Study.

 The investigators will test the feasibility and acceptability of a combined mindfulness training + aerobic training intervention, vs.

 either alone or none to improve cognitive function in older adults with cognitive impairment.

 The investigators will also obtain estimates of effect sizes (and confidence intervals) on cognitive function.

 Preliminary analyses will be conducted to explore the mediating role of changes in aerobic capacity, physical activity, vascular risk factors, and mindfulness skills.

 Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 3-, and 6- months since baseline.
