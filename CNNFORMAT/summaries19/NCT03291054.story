(fifthQuint)Epacadostat and Pembrolizumab in Patients With GIST.

 While targeted therapy with imatinib has significantly improved survival for patients with inoperable and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), the majority will eventually progress after a median of 20-26 months.

 Standard second-line treatment with sunitinib has a response rate of 7%, and third-line treatment with regorafenib has a response rate of only 5%.

 More effective treatments for imatinib-refractory GIST are needed.

 This study aims to assess the efficacy of combined IDO and PD-1 inhibition with epacadostat (IDO inhibitor) and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) in patients with imatinib-refractory GIST.

 Epacadostat and Pembrolizumab in Patients With GIST@highlight

Primary objective is to assess the efficacy of combined IDO and PD-1 inhibition in a single arm phase II trial of epacadostat and pembrolizumab in patients with advanced imatinib-refractory GIST, using a primary endpoint of overall response rate.

 Secondary objectives are to evaluate the progression free survival (PFS), the overall survival (OS), the response rate and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of combined epacadostat and pembrolizumab treatment.

 The investigator hypothesizes that treatment with epacadostat and pembrolizumab will increase the response rate compared to what has been historically achieved with salvage tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
