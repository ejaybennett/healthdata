(fifthQuint)Diffusion MRI in Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy (CSM).

 CSM is the most common form of spinal cord injury and is the leading cause of progressive disability in patients over the age of 65.

 A major shortcoming limiting the clinical management of CSM is the lack of quantifiable metrics to 1) base clinical decisions and 2) predict potential for functional recovery following surgical intervention.

 DBSI MRI will provide imaging biomarkers to more reliably predict a patient's clinical course, response to therapy, and long-term prognosis.

 Patients who are diagnosed with CSM will have an MRI using the DBSI technology preoperatively and at 24 months.

 Surgical patients will be assessed with the Neck Disability Index (NDI), Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), hand grip dynamometer and Manual Muscle Testing (MMT), the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale (mJOA), and the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), the Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Nurick scoring.

 A control group of healthy volunteers will have an MRI using the DBSI technology when enrolled and then again 24 months later.

 Diffusion MRI in Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy (CSM)@highlight

Patients who have been diagnosed with Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy will be asked to undergo an MRI using diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) technology.

 The patients will have this MRI preoperatively and at 24 months postop.

 The investigators believe that with this imaging, biomarkers will be able to be seen to assist in prediction of long term outcomes in patients with spinal cord compression.

 These patients will be compared to healthy cohorts who will also undergo an MRI using the DBSI technology.
