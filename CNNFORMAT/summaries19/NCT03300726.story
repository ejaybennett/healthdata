(thirdQuint)Synaptic Injury and Functional Connectivity in Alzheimer's Disease.

 SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1: Investigate correlations between CSF biomarkers of synaptic injury (Ng and SNAP-25) and functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN) using resting-state fMRI (adjusting for age, gender, apolipoprotein-E4 [APOE4] genotype, task performance, and regional brain atrophy) in MCI/AD and controls.

 Aim 2: Examine correlations between CSF biomarkers of synaptic injury and functional connectivity (FC) within the semantic memory network on task-activated fMRI using the Famous Name Discrimination Task (FNDT) (adjusting for age, gender, APOE4 genotype, task performance, and regional brain atrophy) in MCI/AD and controls.

 Synaptic Injury and Functional Connectivity in Alzheimer's Disease@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine cross-sectional associations between CSF markers of synaptic injury (Ng and SNAP-25) and functional connectivity in default and semantic memory networks using 3T- fMRI in individuals with MCI (i.

e.

 the earliest clinically detectable stage of cognitive impairment) due to AD or mild AD dementia (CDR 0.

5-1; n=15) and cognitively normal controls (CDR 0; n=15).
