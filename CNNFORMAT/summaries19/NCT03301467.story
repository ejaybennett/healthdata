(firstQuint)Controlled Trial Evaluating Avacopan in C3 Glomerulopathy.

 C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is characterized by evidence of alternative complement activation based on C3 deposition in the glomeruli.

 There are two forms of the disease: dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN).

 There is no approved treatment for patients with C3G.

 This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of avacopan (CCX168) in patients with C3G.

 The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of avacopan compared to placebo based on histologic changes in kidney biopsies taken before and during treatment.
