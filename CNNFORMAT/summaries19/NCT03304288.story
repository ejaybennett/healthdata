(firstQuint)The Combination of Low-dose Rituximab and ATRA as the Treatment of Steroid-resistant/Relapse Immune Thrombocytopenia.

 Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a severe bleeding disorder.

 Approximately 2/3 of patients achieve remission from first-line therapies.

 However, the underlying mechanism of steroid-resistant or relapsed ITP is not well understood; thus, treatment remains a great challenge.

 Rituximab has been shown to partly improve the complete remission rate of ITP.

 All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has an immunomodulatory effect on haematopoiesis, making it a possible treatment option.

 A multicentre prospective study was performed in non-splenectomized ITP patients who were either resistant to a standard dose of corticosteroids or had relapsed.

 Patients were randomized to the low-dose rituximab+ATRA and the low-dose rituximab monotherapy groups.

 Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment.

 Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study, in order to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of low-dose rituximab and ATRA in patients with steroid-resistant/relapsed ITP.
