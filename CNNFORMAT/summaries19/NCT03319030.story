(fifthQuint)Aerobic Exercise in Boys With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).

 Recently, the American Academy of Neurology released new guidelines for children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) with an updated recommendation to include moderate aerobic exercise.

 Historically, children with DMD were advised to not exercise as it was thought to accelerate muscle loss.

 Today, there is new data suggesting that moderate aerobic exercise that does not strain muscle may be beneficial and improve a child's quality of life with regard to heart disease, fatigue, and other factors of overall health.

 Although it is expected that children who exercise will experience health benefits, there is no scientific evidence indicating a positive or negative effect in a DMD population.

 This study is trying to understand the role of aerobic exercise in boys with DMD and how it may impact heart, muscle, and lung function using newly identified biomarkers.

 The goal is to correlate increased aerobic exercise with improved functional outcomes and changes in biomarkers.

 The data collected from this study will allow future development and implementation of an innovative and disease-specific home aerobic exercise program that in the future will be recommended to families of children with DMD.

This research study wants to learn more about Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and exercise.

 Today it is unknown how exercising impacts boys with DMD.

 The investigators believe that increasing activity and aerobic exercise may help with heart, lung, and muscle function.

 The investigators are hoping to compare physical strength and blood samples of boys with DMD to see if there are any differences between kids who exercised more as a child versus those who didn't.
