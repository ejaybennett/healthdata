(fifthQuint)Evaluation of Patient Outcomes From the Kidney Allograft Outcomes AlloSure Registry.

 The AlloSure test has been approved for Medicare coverage for clinical use when a physician determines there is a need to assess the probability of allograft rejection in kidney transplant recipients.

 Accurate and timely detection of allograft rejection and effective treatment are essential for long-term survival of renal transplants.

 The DART study validated the ability of the non-invasive AlloSure test to measure donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) to discriminate active rejection in a renal transplant recipient.

 Use of the test will inform and may reduce invasive percutaneous renal biopsy procedures among patients with risk of rejection.

 Evaluation of Patient Outcomes From the Kidney Allograft Outcomes AlloSure Registry@highlight

This is an observational study to evaluate safety and efficacy outcomes in renal transplant recipients in whom post-transplant care is managed using AlloSure(R).

 AlloSure(R) is a non-invasive test to measure donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA).

 The AlloSure test is intended to assess the probability of allograft rejection in kidney transplant recipients with clinical suspicion of rejection and to inform clinical decision-making regarding the necessity of renal biopsy in such patients at least 2 weeks post-transplant in conjunction with standard clinical assessment.
