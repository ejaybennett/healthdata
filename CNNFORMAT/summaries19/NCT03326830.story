(thirdQuint)Prehospital High-Flow Nasal Oxygen Therapy.

 Patients with respiratory distress and an SpO2 below 90% in the prehospital setting will be randomized to receive either high-flow nasal oxygen therapy through a dedicated device or standard oxygen therapy through standard devices such as nasal cannula or face mask.

 Need of mechanical ventilation either invasive or noninvasive from enrollment to day 28 and time course of oxygenation between first SpO2 measured on scene and arrival to the hospital will be the main outcome measures.

 Prehospital High-Flow Nasal Oxygen Therapy@highlight

The purpose of the present project is to compare High-Flow Nasal Oxygen therapy with Standard Oxygen therapy, initiated in the prehospital setting in patients with acute hypoxemia respiratory failure, in terms of oxygenation at arrival to the hospital and need of mechanical ventilation during the subsequent 28 days
