(firstQuint)A Study Raindrop Near Vision Inlay in Presbyopes Implanted in Corneal Pockets.

 Patients must be presbyopic with a reading add from +1.

5 to +2.

5 D, and both emmetropes (MRSE from -0.

5 to +0.

5 D) as well as ametropes (requiring concurrent LASIK) are included in the investigation.

 In the non-delayed approach, the corneal pocket is created and inlay implanted on the same surgical day.

 In the delayed approach, the corneal pocket is created and dissected but the corneal inlay is not implanted.

 After one to three months, the corneal inlay is implanted on a second surgical day.
