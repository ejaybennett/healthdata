(fifthQuint)Glycemic Control in T2DM Through Non-Surgical Periodontal Therapy.

 The overall evidence that CP has a role in the causal pathway of DM is yet limited and inconsistent.

 Although intervention research has suggested that treating CP may improve glycemic control and insulin resistance in Type-2 DM patients; yet there is limited data concerning the effects of adjunct antibiotic therapy (AAT) in addition to scaling root planning (SRP) in treating CP for long lasting results.

 Therefore, it is suggested that further research with bigger samples must be undertaken for a successful periodontal therapy that may help improve glycemic control at desired levels and long durations.

 This study is designed to evaluate the effects of periodontal therapy [SRP, metronidazole (MET) and oral hygiene instructions (OHI)] through a three-arm trial comprising of SRP+MET+OHI group, SRP+OHI group and OHI+ Delayed Therapy (DT) group, on HbA1c, FPG, FPI levels and Insulin Resistance calculated through Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) to fill the research gap.

 A parallel group, single blind three-arm design randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted over a period of approximately 2 years.

 More than 1000 patients will be screened for CP with T2DM to recruit 150 participants for the study.

 They will be randomly allocated in each group (with 50 in each group).

 Post-therapy follow-up will be for 1, 3 and 6 months to evaluate short term and long term changes in status of CP, FPG, FPI and HbA1c respectively.

 Structured screening form will be used to collect baseline information.

 HbA1c, FPG levels and IL will be recorded at standardized lab, whereas, CP will be evaluated using standardized periodontal indices by calibrated examiners.

 Stata version 11.

0 will be used for all kind of data management.

 Descriptive analysis will be performed using frequency percentages of the categorical variables whereas, mean (standard deviation) will be calculated for all continuous study variables.

 Inferential statistics will include Chi-square test to assess proportional differences of the categorical variables between the three interventional groups.

 Whereas, one-way Analysis of Variance test (ANOVA) will be used to evaluate the mean differences of the continuous variables in three different groups.

 McNemar's Chi-square and Repeated Measure Analysis of Variance (RMANOVA) will be used to assess differences in categorical and continuous variables respectively over time for each intervention group; and particularly to assess second secondary study objective.

 For insulin resistance HOMA-IR will be calculated to assess an association between CP and insulin resistance.

 Glycemic Control in T2DM Through Non-Surgical Periodontal Therapy@highlight

The idea of "Mouth-Body Connection" has recently been introduced, according to which oral health is considered as a vital constituent of general health; like-wise many systemic disorders have oral manifestations.

 Recently it is submitted that incident and prevalent chronic periodontal infection, known as chronic periodontitis (CP) possibly has a causal relationship with diabetes mellitus (DM) having effects on HbA1c, fasting plasma/ blood glucose (FPG/ FBG) and fasting plasma/ blood insulin (FPI/ FBI) levels.

 Experimental research has suggested that treating CP may improve glycemic control and insulin resistance in Non-Insulin Dependent Type-2 DM patients (T2DM).

 However, there is limited data concerning the need and effects of adjunct antibiotic therapy (AAT) along with scaling root planning (SRP) in treating CP for long lasting results.

 Therefore, it is suggested that further research with larger samples must be undertaken for a successful periodontal therapy that may help improve glycemic control at desired levels and longer durations.

 This study is designed to evaluate effects of periodontal therapy [SRP, metronidazole (MET) and oral hygiene instructions (OHI)] through three-arm trial experiment comprising of SRP+MET+OHI, SRP+OHI and OHI+ Delayed Therapy (DT) groups on HbA1c, FPG, FPI levels and Insulin Resistance calculated through Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) to fill research gap.

 This study will target around 1000 patients with CP screened for T2DM at selected Periodontal Clinics of Dow University dental hospitals to recruit 150 participants randomly allocated in each group (50 in each group).

 Post-therapy follow-up results will be assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months to evaluate short and long term changes in status of CP, FPG, FPI and HbA1c.
