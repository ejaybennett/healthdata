(secondQuint)Circulating Tumor DNA After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.

 Patients with an invasive breast cancer on neoadjuvant chemotherapy (with the exception of cT2cN0 tumors) are preselected before the surgical procedure.

 They are definitely included during the post-surgery visit following the analysis of the surgical specimen (only patients whose tumor did not achieve a complete pathological response are included).

 Sequential plasma samples for ctDNA mutations analysis will be taken during the post-surgery visit (within 2-5 weeks after surgery) and every 6 months (+/- 1 month) thereafter for 5 years.

 In case of relapse patients will be proposed to participate to an optional research program with a blood test for ctDNA assessment and biopsies from a metastasis (when these biopsies are clinically indicated).
