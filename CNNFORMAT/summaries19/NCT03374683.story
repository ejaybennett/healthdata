(fifthQuint)Randomized Controlled Trial of a Risk Reframing Tool to Change Mothers' Parenting Associated With Children's Risky Play.

 The study uses 3-group parallel randomized controlled trial design.

 Participants will be recruited through advertising on social media, distributing notices through our networks, snowball sampling, and posting notices in community centres.

 The aim is to obtain complete data on 375 participants, thus the investigators will recruit at least 501 mothers to account for attrition.

 Interested participants will complete a questionnaire in REDCap electronic data capture tool hosted at British Columbia Children's Hospital Research Institute to answer eligibility questions and provide informed consent.

 Enrolled participants will be sent a link to the baseline questionnaire package to be completed in REDcap.

 Once participants are deemed eligible for the study, they are allocated to one of the three conditions: 1) Control group; 2) RR digital tool; and 3) RR in-person workshop.

 Participants in Condition 1 will be provided with a link to the Position Statement on Active Outdoor Play, which includes information on research and recommendations for action.

 Participants in Condition 2 will be provided with a link to the RR digital tool to complete at their leisure.

 Participants in Condition 3, will be scheduled to attend the RR in-person workshop.

 The randomization schedule was generated beforehand in sealedenvelop.

com using blocks of size 3, 6, and 9.

 The list was then transferred to REDCap.

 Honoraria will be paid at each time point as compensation for participation.

 Participants attending in-person RR workshops are provided with an additional honorarium to compensate them for any expenses incurred in attending, such as travel or childcare.

 Participants have equal likelihood of assignment to each condition (33%).

 They will not be blinded to allocation, because the nature of the intervention does not allow it.

 They will be informed of their allocated treatment after completing the baseline questionnaires.

 Allocation will be concealed to the researchers at participant assignment and data analysis.

 Furthermore, the RR in-person workshop facilitator does not need to be blinded to allocation, as the other two arms do not have a facilitator.

 Participants will complete a questionnaire package at three time points: Baseline (T1), 1-week post-intervention (T2), and 3-months post-intervention (T3).

 Survey data will be collected and managed using REDCap.

 The study hypotheses are: 1.

 Mothers completing the RR digital tool will have a significantly greater increase of tolerance for risk in play than mothers in the control condition.

 2.

 Mothers completing the RR in-person workshop will have a significantly greater increase of tolerance for risk in play than mothers in the control condition.

 3.

 A greater proportion of mothers completing the RR digital tool will attain their behaviour change goal, than mothers in the control condition.

 4.

 A greater proportion of mothers completing the RR in-person workshop will attain their behaviour change goal than mothers in the control condition.

 Randomized Controlled Trial of a Risk Reframing Tool to Change Mothers' Parenting Associated With Children's Risky Play@highlight

Children's risky play is associated with a variety of positive developmental, physical and mental health outcomes, including greater physical activity, self-confidence and risk management skills.

 Children's opportunities for risky play have eroded over time, limited by parents' fears and beliefs about risk, particularly among mothers.

 We have developed a digital and in-person workshop version of a tool to reframe parents' perceptions of risk.

 We will examine whether the tool increases mothers' tolerance for risky play and influences parenting behaviour change, in the short and long term, and whether these changes are greater than those in the control group.

 We will conduct a single-blind (researchers and outcome assessors) randomized controlled trial and will recruit at total of 501 mothers of children aged 6-12 years.

 The risk reframing (RR) digital tool is designed for a one-time visit and includes three chapters of self-reflection and experiential learning tasks.

 The RR in-person tool is a 2-hour facilitated workshop in which participants are guided through discussion of the same tasks contained within the digital tool.

 The control condition consists of reading the Position Statement on Active Outdoor Play.

 Primary outcome is increased tolerance of risk in play, as measured by the Tolerance of Risk in Play Scale.

 Secondary outcome is self-reported attainment of a behaviour change goal that participants set for themselves.

 We will test the hypothesis that there will be differences between the experimental and control groups with respect to tolerance of risk in play and goal attainment.
