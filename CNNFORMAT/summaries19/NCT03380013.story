(secondQuint)OMT to Improve Feeding After Hypothermia.

 Infants affected by neonatal encephalopathy (NE) have been shown to have better survival rates and improved long term neurodevelopment following treatment with therapeutic hypothermia.

 However, a barrier to hospital discharge for these infants is a successful transition from gavage to either breast or bottle feeding.

 Often, the factor delaying hospital discharge is slow transition to full oral feeds.

 Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) helps to effectively stabilize and regulate the autonomic nervous system as well as the cranial nerves important in the sucking and latching reflexes, which may in turn help to ease the transition to full oral feeding.

 We hypothesize that infants who receive OMT will accelerate the transition to full oral feeds, thus decreasing their overall length of hospitalization compared to historical matched controls.

 OMT to Improve Feeding After Hypothermia@highlight

The goal of this study is to determine if infants with neonatal encephalopathy will achieve full oral feeds faster after therapeutic hypothermia has completed if they are treated with osteopathic manipulative treatment.

 The treated infants will be compared to matched historical controls.
