(fifthQuint)Prostate Boost Irradiation With Stereotactic Body RT (SBRT).

 In this study we investigate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as a boost radiotherapy treatment, following pelvic radiotherapy, in patients with high risk prostate cancer (PrCa) treated with Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT).

 One hundred patients with localized high risk PrCa will receive ADT for a total of 3 years.

 Three months after initiation of ADT all patients will receive pelvic (lymph node and prostate) treatment of 45Gy in 25 fractions (5 days per week).

 Then patients will be randomized to receive either The conventional radiotherapy (CRT) of 33 - 35 Gy in 16 fractions (5 days per week - over 22 days) (comparator arm) or SBRT boost treatment of 19.

5 - 21 Gy in three fractions (1 treatment per week - over 22days) (experimental arm).

 SBRT boost treatment will be delivered with either cyberknife or VMAT technique.

 Prostate Boost Irradiation With Stereotactic Body RT (SBRT)@highlight

A randomized controlled open-label trial in patients with high risk prostate cancer.

 Eligible and consenting patients will be randomly allocated to receive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) boost to prostate or conventional radiotherapy boost to prostate in 1:1 ratio.

 Prostate radiotherapy boost will be administered after standard pelvic radiotherapy.

 Subjects will be followed for 24 months post radiation treatment for Quality of Life assessment and toxicity.
