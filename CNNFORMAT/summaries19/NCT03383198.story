(secondQuint)Pectoralis (II) Block With Liposomal Bupivacaine vs Bupivacaine for Breast Surgery.

 This research hopes to determine the duration of patient-reported analgesia provided by ultrasound guided PEC II field block injections.

 The design of the study randomly assigns the side of injection of the study drugs into each patient.

 All patients are having bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.

 Visual analog pain scores (VAS) will be recorded serially for both sides of the patient's chest in hopes of determining a difference in duration and efficacy of the two drugs.

 In addition to VAS scores, a subjective, binary question will be our primary outcome: does one side of your chest have more surgical pain than the other? We hope that his question, despite being entirely subjective, overcomes interpatient variability of numerical pain score reporting.

 Pectoralis (II) Block With Liposomal Bupivacaine vs Bupivacaine for Breast Surgery@highlight

This is a randomized controlled pilot study evaluating length of pain control with either liposomal bupivacaine or with bupivacaine plus decadron after PEC II injection in patients having bilateral mastectomies with immediate reconstruction.
