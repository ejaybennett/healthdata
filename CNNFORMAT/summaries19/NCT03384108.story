(secondQuint)In Vivo Assessment of Glutamine Utilization by Bone Marrow Plasma Cells.

 Twenty healthy adult study participants between the ages of 18 and 60 years will be recruited to participate in this pilot study that will include two groups: a) Ex Vivo group (10 volunteers) and b) In Vivo group (10 volunteers).

 Volunteers will be recruited to either group in a sequential alternating fashion.
