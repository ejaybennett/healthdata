(fifthQuint)Heart Rate Variability and Hyperthyroidism: Evaluation of the Short-term Effects of Propanolol.

 Objective: The aim of our study was to evaluate the short term effects of Propanolol on heart rate variability in patients with hyperthyroidism.

 Design: In ten patients newly diagnosed as having hyperthyroidism and naive of all treatment specific for hyperthyroidism, we evaluated the short term effects of Propanolol on heart rate variability (HRV).

 Methods: We measured heart rate variability by power spectral analysis during 2 hours of rest and during Ewing's tests before and after the administration of Propanolol 40mg/12 hours orally for 72 hours.

 Other outcomes included mean heart rate, mean R-R interval during 2-hour rest.

 The study questions the systematic adjunction of Propanolol early in the treatment of hyperthyroidism.
