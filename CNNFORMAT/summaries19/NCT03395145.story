(firstQuint)Bone Volume Changes After Socket Preservation Using Geistlich Bio-Oss Collagen and Mucograft Seal.

 In the last decade dental implants have become widely used for oral rehabilitation.

 But, the usage of dental Implants might be difficult in cases of alveolar bone deficiencies.

 Different ridge preservation techniques were successfully used, using membrane with or without bone substitutes.

new grafting material is Mucograft Seal, a collagen matrix graft, which originally used as an alternative to the connective tissue graft for the treatment of gingival recessions.

 Mucograft has demonstrated a good tissue reaction with high biocompatibility and a low shrinkage tendency, in order to increase the amount of keratinized gingiva in the augmented area.

 Study Hypothesis: The observed changes in ridge dimensions when using Geistlich Bio-Oss(R) Collagen and Geistlich Mucograft(R) Seal as ridge preservation will be less pronounced in comparison to natural healing after tooth extraction.
