(secondQuint)Web-Based Communication Education for Breast Cancer Survivorship Care.

 This two-phase study develops and tests the usability and efficacy of a culturally relevant, web-based patient education program, hereafter known as E-Talkcare, in improving Chinese immigrant breast cancer survivors' competence, perceived control, and self-efficacy in cancer care communication (intermediate outcomes), and patient-reported symptoms, adherence to breast cancer survivorship care guidelines, and quality of life (distal outcomes) versus the usual care control arm.

 In Phase I, we will use community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to develop the intervention to educate participants about culture and communication by demonstrating how to ask for and verify information with doctors and use personalized symptom reports, and by providing question prompt lists for doctor visits.

 In Phase II, we will test the intervention in a pilot randomized control trial (RCT).

 Using Los Angeles cancer registry cases, we will enroll and randomize 118 Chinese immigrant women (diagnosed with stage 0-III breast cancer and 1-3 years post-diagnosis) to either the E-Talkcare intervention or a usual care control arm.

 We will conduct telephone interviews at baseline (i.

 Web-Based Communication Education for Breast Cancer Survivorship Care@highlight

This two-phase research plan will develop and test a culturally relevant, web-based patient education program, hereafter known as E-Talkcare.

 The intervention aims to empower Chinese cancer patients to effectively communicate with different providers in different healthcare settings.
