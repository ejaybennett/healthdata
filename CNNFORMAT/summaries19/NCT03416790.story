(fifthQuint)IMPAACT 2015 - Evaluation of the HIV-1 Reservoir in the Central Nervous System of Perinatally-Infected Youth and Young Adults With Cognitive Impairment.

 IMPAACT 2015 is a cross-sectional, exploratory study aiming to investigate the central nervous system (CNS) reservoir in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents and young adults on effective antiretroviral therapy with neurocognitive impairment.

 The study will assess the frequency with which HIV is detected in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in this population and assess whether detectable HIV in the CSF correlates with markers of inflammation and neuronal injury.

 CSF will be examined for persistence of HIV-1 RNA or DNA despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) and for evidence of intrathecal inflammation.

 Perinatally-infected youth and young adults are of particular interest because there are very limited CSF data available in this population and reasons to be concerned about the CNS reservoir.

 In addition, measures of HIV-1 RNA in the CSF and associated biomarkers have not previously been explored in this population.

 A better understanding of viral persistence in the CSF, as well as CSF biomarker profiles, will provide preliminary data to move the field forward in understanding the role of the CNS in HIV-1 persistence and will have implications for future HIV-1 remission research.
