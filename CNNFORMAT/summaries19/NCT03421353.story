(thirdQuint)AZD9150 Plus Durvalumab Alone or in Combination With Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced, Solid Tumours and in Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.

 This international, multicenter study will be conducted in three parts, designated A, B, and C.

 A complementary anti-tumour strategy will be used in this study with 2 immuno-therapeutics applied to restore effective anti-tumour immunity at 2 distinct stages: promoting the effector function of T-cell responses with an anti-PD-L1 mAb, durvalumab, while hindering immune escape in the tumour bed with AZD9150.

 In addition, chemotherapy will be added to this combination to investigate possible future enhancement of response.

 In preclinical models, conventional platinum-based chemotherapy has been shown to induce T-cell activation through the release of tumour-specific antigens during cancer cell death.

 The elimination of persistent tolerogenic tumour antigen environment via chemotherapy-induced debulking may also play a role in generating an effective immune response.

 In this setting, immunotherapy has the potential to mount an ongoing and dynamic immune response that can kill tumour cells for an extended time.

 Part A of the study will be conducted in 5 arms.

 The primary objective of Part A is to assess the safety, tolerability, and finding the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of AZD9150 given every two weeks (Q2W) plus durvalumab given every four weeks (Q4W) in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

 In addition, the primary objective is to assess the safety, tolerability, and finding the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of AZD9150 plus durvalumab in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

 Approximately 30 to 78 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)-evaluable patients will be enrolled in this arm.

 Part B will be conducted in 2 arms and randomised 1:1.

 The primary objective of Part B is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of durvalumab in combination with AZD9150 at different dosing schedules in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 Approximately 90 efficacy-evaluable patients will be enrolled in this arm.

 Part C will be one single arm.

 The primary objective of Part C is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of durvalumab and AZD9150 with chemotherapy in 1st-line non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

 Approximately 45 efficacy-evaluable patients will be enrolled in this arm.

This is a phase Ib/II, open-label multicentre study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumour activity of AZD9150 plus durvalumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced, solid tumours and subsequently in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
