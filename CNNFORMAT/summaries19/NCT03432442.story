(fifthQuint)Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Ivermectin in Pediatric Dengue Patients.

 The research team has planned to conduct three interim analyses for safety and one final report.

 The interim analyses will be conducted as follows: 1.

 First interim analysis: After the completion of the last volunteer of the group with body weight >30 kg receiving ivermectin 400 1/2g/kg every 24 hours for a total of three times (i.

e.

 the sixth volunteer).

 2.

 Second interim analysis: After the completion of the last volunteer of the group with body weight >30 kg receiving ivermectin 600 1/2g/kg every 24 hours for a total of three times (i.

e.

 the twelfth volunteer).

 3.

 Third interim analysis: After the completion of the last volunteer of the group with body weight 15 to 30 kg receiving ivermectin 400 1/2g/kg every 24 hours for a total of three times (i.

e.

 the twelfth volunteer).

 The results of each interim analyses will be submitted to DSMB to determine whether the study is safe to be conducted in the next group of volunteers.

 Additionally, the results of interim analyses and the safety assessments from DSMB will be submitted to all ECs.

Design and Outcomes This research study is designed as open-label, sequential dose-escalating clinical trial.

 There will be two phases of enrollment.

 In the first phase, pediatric dengue patients with body weight greater than 30 kg will be recruited.

 The first six volunteers will be administered with 400 1/2g/kg every 24 hours for a total of three times.

 The last six volunteers will be administered with 600 1/2g/kg every 24 hours for a total of three times.

 In the second phase, pediatric dengue patients with body weight between 15 to 30 kg will be recruited.

 Similar to the first phase, the first six and the last six volunteers will be administered with 400 1/2g/kg and 600 1/2g/kg every 24 hours for a total of three times, respectively.

 A total of 24 volunteers will be recruited from Faculty of Medicine Siriraj hospitals
