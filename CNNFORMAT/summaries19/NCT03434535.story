(thirdQuint)A Pilot Study of Remote Monitoring to Improve Health Related Quality of Life After Surgery for Prostate Cancer.

.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using digital technology and remote monitoring to track health-related measures in men following prostate cancer treatment.

 All participants will complete a health-related quality of life survey each month for 3 months.

 The digital survey will be administered on a programmed tablet.

 The participants in the intervention group will also receive an activity sensor and weight scale.

 Health state data from this group will be generated over a 3 month period and remotely monitored.

 These data will be used to provide personalized feedback regarding the participant's progress towards established goals.

 Health-related quality of life will be compared between participants in the intervention group, who receive (1) tools to monitor their activity and weight and (2) personalized feedback, versus participants in the control group, who receive standard of care.

 The potential improved adherence to healthy behaviors of the participants receiving personalized feedback may translate to to improved health-related quality of life.
