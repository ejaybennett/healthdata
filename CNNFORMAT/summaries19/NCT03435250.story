(firstQuint)Study of AG-270 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphoma With MTAP Loss.

 The purpose of this Phase 1, multicenter, open label study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AG-270 and characterize its dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) when given daily by mouth to subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma with homozygous deletion of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP).

 The first portion of this study is dose escalation, where cohorts of subjects will receive ascending oral doses of AG-270 to determine the MTD, the dose with maximum pharmacologic activity or a maximum feasible dose.

 In the dose expansion portion of the study, additional subjects will be treated at the MTD (or one of the described alternative doses) to further characterize that dose's safety, tolerability, PK and PD, and to detect preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity.

 The dose-expansion phase of the study will support the selection of a dose for future clinical studies (recommended Phase 2 dose [RP2D]).
