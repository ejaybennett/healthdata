(secondQuint)Effects of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy and Low Level Laser Therapy in Myofascial Pain Syndrome.

 Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) inducing photochemical and photothermal effect, increases blood flow and vascular permeability and improves cell metabolism.

 All these lead to muscle recovery.

 It also activates somatosensory receptors of the skin and reduces local pain and muscle spasm.

 The specific mechanisms of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in treating musculoskeletal pain remain unclear.

 It reduces pain and inflammation by modulating nitrogen-monoxide (NO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

 It can destroy sensory unmyelinated nerve fibers, and stimulate neovascularization and collagen synthesis in degenerative tissues.

 Effects of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy and Low Level Laser Therapy in Myofascial Pain Syndrome@highlight

This study evaluates the effects of low level laser therapy and extracorporeal shock wave therapy in patients with myofascial pain syndrome of the upper trapezius.

 Half of the patients receive laser therapy, half of them receive shock wave therapy for three weeks.
