(thirdQuint)Effect of Violent First-Person Shooter (FPS) Video Games on Shooting Accuracy.

 Violent shooting games are used to train soldiers and police officers.

 This research tests whether violent shooting can train people to shoot targets in the head, both during gameplay (Pilot Study) and after the game is turned off (Experiment Proper).

 Participants in both studies played a violent shooting game with humanoid targets that rewarded headshots, or a nonviolent shooting game that punished shots to bull's-eye targets with faces.

 The experiment proper also included a nonviolent non-shooting game.

 In the pilot study, gameplay was recorded.

 In the experiment proper, participants shot 16 "bullets" from a realistic gun at a mannequin following gameplay.

 Consistent with operant conditioning theory, participants who played a violent shooting game that rewarded headshots had the most hits to targets' heads.

 Preferential exposure to violent shooting games was also positively correlated with hits to the mannequin's head.

 Nonviolent shooting games influenced in-game behavior, but did not influence behavior outside the game.

The present research tests the effects of violent shooting games on behavior within the game (Pilot Study) and on behavior after the game is turned off (Experiment Proper).

 The Experiment Proper is an exact replication of a previous study conducted in our lab that was retracted (see citation), but with a larger sample to get more reliable results (N=287 rather than N=151).
