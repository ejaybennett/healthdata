(fifthQuint)Therapeutic Alliance Tensions and Repair in Psychotherapy Practices.

 Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for many mental disorders, yet there is a gap between research and practice.

 Research indicates that: the therapist-patient alliance is important to reduce patient symptoms, alliance tensions are detrimental to patients, and those therapists who identify and repair alliance tensions can improve patient outcomes.

 In this study we will use state of the art research to train community-based therapists in evidence-based interventions to identify and repair alliance tensions.

 Trained therapists and their patients will be compared to therapists who provide usual care to their patients.

 We will measure improvement in therapists' skills in identifying and repairing alliance tensions and how this is associated with better patient mental health outcomes.

 We will also interview trained therapists to identify the best ways of improving the training and disseminating the findings to psychotherapists across Canada.

 Research to improve practicing therapists' ability to identify and repair therapeutic alliance tensions will result in better mental health outcomes for patients.

 Therapeutic Alliance Tensions and Repair in Psychotherapy Practices@highlight

This study evaluates a professional development program intended to improve the relationship or alliance between therapists and patients/clients who are receiving psychotherapy in the community.

 Half of the participating therapists will receive training to detect and improve alliance with new patients while half will not.

 The professional development training is expected to improve therapists effectiveness in identifying and correcting alliance tensions which will, in turn, improve therapeutic outcomes for patients/clients.
