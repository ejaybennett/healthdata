(fifthQuint)N-of-1 Trials In Children With Hypertension.

 Pediatric hypertension, a growing problem, often requires prescription of antihypertensive medication.

 Pediatric hypertension specialists lack an evidentiary base on which to establish definitive clinical practice guidelines for first-line therapy.

 Significant practice variation is an unsurprising consequence.

 Routine choice of the same first-line therapy for most patients with hypertension, absent testing other options, may delay correction of blood pressure for months or years.

 Failure to incorporate patient preferences in medical decision-making may also contribute to decreased patient satisfaction and adherence.

 Large parallel-group, comparative effectiveness trials are likely not on the horizon for this population.

 Moreover, heterogeneity of treatment effects would minimize the generalizability of such a trial to all patients.

 This is a parallel-group, randomized clinical trial to test whether the n-of-1 trial approach is superior to usual care in normalizing blood pressure while minimizing exposure to compliance-reducing side effects.

 N-of-1 Trials In Children With Hypertension@highlight

The single patient (n-of-1) randomized trial is an underused approach to resolving therapeutic uncertainty by using a patient's own data to inform an individualized treatment plan.

 The proposed research is designed to assess whether the n-of-1 trial approach improves blood pressure control.

 This trial will advance learning about not only the treatment of pediatric hypertension but also the use of a neglected type of randomized trial to optimize the care of each patient.
