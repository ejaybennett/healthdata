(thirdQuint)MRgFUS in the Treatment of Hand and Hip Osteoarthritic Pain.

 Pain caused by osteoarthritis is a matter of huge impact, in terms of quality of life, social and economic burden.

 Global aging of the population is going to worsen the problem.

 The hand is the most affected site in the upper limb, and involvement of the trapeziometacarpal joint is highly prevalent, with significant limitation of functionality when it happens.

 In the lower limb, the hip and the knee share the leading position in the clinical scenario, with the former being historically the most frequently submitted to joint replacement.

 At any site, the vast majority of joint replacement surgery procedures are performed because of pain.

 MRgFUS has recently demonstrated a great potential in treating pain caused by different medical conditions, including osteoarthritis.

 The aim of the work is to study the feasibility, the safety and the potential efficacy of MRgFUS in treating pain from osteoarthritis in two "hot" spots: the hip and the trapeziometacarpal/scaphotrapezial joint.

This project aims at performing a pilot study to provide data on safety and potential efficacy of Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS) in the treatment of pain caused by trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis (OA) and/or scaphotrapezial OA, and by hip OA, while exploring the potential application of MRgFUS to two different and central joints burdened by OA.
