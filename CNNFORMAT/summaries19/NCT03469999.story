(secondQuint)Dysport on Energy Expenditure.

 Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the leading cause of disability in children, with the most widespread type of CP being spastic CP which negatively affects physical function.

 Specifically it is reported that there is an increase in energy expenditure and oxygen consumption in children with CP.

 Single event multi level chemoneurolysis with abobotulinumtoxinA has been found to be an effective treatment for patients with spasticity to reduce energy expenditure by increasing walking efficiency; however many of these studies have conflicting methodological approaches.

 Therefore this study aims to evaluate the single event multilevel chemoneurolysis with Dysport(R) on energy expenditure and gait in children with spastic diplegia CP.
