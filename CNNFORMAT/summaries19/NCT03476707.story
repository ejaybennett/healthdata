(secondQuint)Association of Anemia With Hospital Costs in Elective Colorectal Surgery.

 This study will examine the association between preoperative anemia (hematocrit less than 0.

39; low blood counts) and hospital total costs from elective colorectal surgery.

 Total costs will be defined as the combination of direct and indirect costs ascertained using standardized patient-level costing algorithms (i.

e.

 the standard way that hospital measure their costs).

 Adjustment will be made for factors that are likely to influence both the presence of anemia and costs of care.

 Association of Anemia With Hospital Costs in Elective Colorectal Surgery@highlight

The objective is to measure the adjusted association between preoperative anemia and total hospital costs.

 We hypothesize that patients with anemia before surgery will have higher hospitalization costs than people without anemia.
