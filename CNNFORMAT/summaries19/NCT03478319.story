(firstQuint)A Study of ACE-2494 in Healthy Subjects.

 Subjects will be evaluated for study inclusion/exclusion criteria during the screening period (within 4 weeks prior to Day -1) and eligible subjects who have signed the informed consent form (ICF) will be enrolled and treated with study drug (ACE-2494 or placebo) on Day 1.

 Subjects will be randomized (3:1, ACE-2494: placebo) to receive either one dose (on Day 1 in Part 1) or three doses (on Days 1, 29, and 57 in Part 2) of study drug.

 The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of ACE-2494 in healthy postmenopausal women.

 The secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, including serum biomarkers, fat, lean, and bone mass (DXA), muscle volume and intramuscular fat fraction (MRI), and strength (QMT).
