(thirdQuint)Improving Patient Motivation and Participation in Rehabilitation Program Through Social Games.

 A 12-week three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the effects between the single-player game, competitive game and a control group (i.

e.

 conventional training) on the motivation, exercise duration and functional improvement in a rehabilitation program.

 A mix of quantitative method (i.

e.

, questionnaire) and qualitative methods (i.

e.

, interview and observation) were used.

 The outcome measurements were: (1) motivation: Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), (2) participation: exercise duration, (3) functional improvement: nine-hole peg test (NHPT) and box and block test (BBT), and (4) user feedback.
