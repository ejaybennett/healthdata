(thirdQuint)Stress Reduction Training for Emotion Regulation and Well-Being.

 This research study seeks to understand how stress reduction training influences neural responses (brain activation) and behavior related to stress, including emotions, desires, and reactions to adverse events such as social conflict.

 The full research project will be conducted over approximately 4-6 weeks, and will consist of two data collection sessions on the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) campus, one before and one after a 14-day stress reduction training course conducted via mobile phone (SmartPhone).

 The two courses entail instructor-facilitated stress reduction exercises previously shown to reduce stress and improve well-being.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to a mindfulness course or an active coping course.

 Both of these courses - mindfulness training (MT) and coping training (CT) - involve expert-facilitated mental wellness techniques.

 MT emphasizes mindfulness-based techniques to reduce stress and promote well-being, whereas CT emphasizes established emotion regulation techniques to reduce stress and promote well-being.

 Some study details are purposely omitted at this time to preserve scientific integrity.

 Stress Reduction Training for Emotion Regulation and Well-Being@highlight

This study will examine whether stress reduction training - which a growing body of research indicates has manifold benefits for behavior regulation, emotion regulation, and other salutary outcomes of relevance to this proposal - predicts lab-based and daily life-based neural and behavioral outcomes indicative of reduced stress, including emotions, desires, and reactions to adverse events such as social conflict.
