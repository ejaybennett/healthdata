(fifthQuint)Longitudinal Assessment of Cartilage Injury and Remodeling After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture and Reconstruction:.

 Overall Study Design: This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of patients undergoing primary ACL reconstruction following ACL rupture.

 Surgical treatment and treatment timelines do not deviate from the national and international standards of care.

 Enrolled patients for study participation will undergo assessments involving blood, urine, and synovial fluid collection, clinical evaluation involving questionnaires and joint laxity testing, and MRI analysis.

 Patient Selection and Enrollment: The participating physicians at each site will identify potential subjects from their clinics' patients according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed below.

 Based on surgical volumes at both sites, patients generally undergo ACL reconstruction 8-12 weeks after initial screening.

 In the preoperative timeframe, all patients will undergo standard physical therapy to address pain, swelling, and motion deficits, as is standard of care at both institutions.

 Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction will be performed by Dr.

 Bedi at the University of Michigan, by Professor Ao at Peking University, and by 5 additional surgeons at Peking University.

 All surgeons will utilize a standardized single-bundle technique with a hamstring or bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft.

The proposed study will establish novel relationships between intra-articular mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) recruitment, synovial inflammation, biomarkers of cartilage degeneration and joint inflammation, clinical patient factors, and downstream alterations in cartilage composition and morphology to provide novel insights into the pathoetiology of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) after ACL injury and reconstruction.

 The study aims to enroll N=38 total patients with primary, isolated rupture to their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), who have agreed to participate in the study and who will undergo primary surgical reconstruction by an orthopaedic physician at our two sites.

 Patients will undergo baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), baseline clinical evaluation, and undergo a baseline blood draw.

 Subsequent imaging and clinical evaluations will be longitudinally performed at several postoperative timepoints up to 12 months postoperatively.
