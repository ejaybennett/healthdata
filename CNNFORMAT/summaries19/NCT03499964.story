(firstQuint)ROBUST III- Re-Establishing Flow Via Drug Coated Balloon For The Treatment Of Urethral Stricture Disease.

 ROBUST III is a prospective, multi-center, single blind randomized controlled clinical trial in a 2:1 allocation of treatment versus control device.

 This study is an adaptive design with an interim analysis for sample size re-estimation performed after 60 subjects have been enrolled.

 The interim analysis will be be undertaken following completion of the 6-month follow-up data from these subjects.

 Based on the results of the interim analysis, the final total sample size required for the study will be re-estimated.

 A minimum of 140 subjects, and a maximum of 200 subjects (pending the re-estimation) will be enrolled in the study.

 A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the interim analysis results, including the sample size re-estimation and make recommendations related to trial continuation to the sponsor.
