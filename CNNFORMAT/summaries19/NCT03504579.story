(fifthQuint)Rt-fMRI Neurofeedback and AH in Schizophrenia.

 Auditory verbal hallucinations (AH) have long been a hallmark of schizophrenia (SZ) and are one of its major diagnostic features.

 They are difficult to manage with existing treatment options.

 Here, neurofeedback will be used to regulate the superior temporal gyrus (STG) activation which will not only lead to activation changes in the STG, but also to changes in the default mode network (DMN).

 The investigators will study SZ patients with medication resistant AH in the rt-fMRI intervention arm and in the sham-rt-fMRI arm.

 In both arms, the task and the rt-fMRI session structure will be identical.

 The SZ-intervention group will receive feedback from the STG while SZ-sham group will receive feedback from the motor cortex.

 In addition, 2 functional fMRI tasks will examine the effect of rt-fMRI neurofeedback and of sham-rt-fMRI on brain response.

 The investigators will randomly assign 48 SZ patients to either SZ-intervention (n=24) or SZ-sham-rtfMRI (n=24).

 The STG targeted neurofeedback is predicted to bring changes in brain regions involved in AH (STG and DMN) in SZ-intervention group only.

 The R61 GO criterion will be BOLD signal reduction in the STG, and resting state connectivity reduction between MPFC-PCC, post rt-fMRI-feedback in SZ-intervention group.

 Rt-fMRI Neurofeedback and AH in Schizophrenia@highlight

Auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia are one of the major symptoms of this disease and a major source of psychological discomfort.

 They are often difficult or impossible to treat with existing methods.

 This study will test the use of real-time fMRI neurofeedback to mitigate auditory verbal hallucinations in patients whose hallucinations are resistant to medication.

 Half of the patients will receive real time fMRI neurofeedback from a brain region involved in auditory hallucinations and half will receive it from motor cortex.
