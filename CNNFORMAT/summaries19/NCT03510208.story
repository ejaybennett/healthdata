(thirdQuint)Panitumumab-IRDye800 in Diagnosing Participants With Malignant Glioma Undergoing Surgery.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine/verify the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of panitumumab conjugated to the optical dye IRDye800CW (panitumumab-IRDye800), as an imaging agent in patients undergoing surgery for malignant glioma.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the efficacy of panitumumab IRDye800 in identifying malignant glioma compared to surrounding normal central nervous system tissue.

 II.

 Determine whether a loading dose of panitumumab is necessary to achieve an effective tumor-to-background ratio.

 III.

 Determine the optimal timing of the surgical procedure to maximize the tumor-to-background ratio.

 OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of panitumumab-IRDye800 followed by a phase II study.

 Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

 GROUP A (Cohorts 1a, 2a, & 3): Participants receive panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 0, and following a 15-minute observation period, receive panitumumab-IRDye800 IV over 60 minutes.

 Participants then undergo near-infrared fluorescence (NIR) imaging during standard of care surgery 1-5 days after receiving panitumumab-IRDye800.

 GROUP B (Cohorts 1b and 2b): Participants receive panitumumab-IRDye800 IV over 60 minutes on day 0.

 Participants then undergo NIR imaging as in Group A.

 After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up on day 15 and then again on day 30.

The phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of panitumumab-IRDye800 in diagnosing participants with malignant glioma who undergo surgery.

 Panitumumab-IRDye800 can attach to tumor cells and make them more visible using a special camera during surgery, which may help surgeons better distinguish tumor cells from normal brain tissue and identify small tumors that cannot be seen using current imaging methods.
