(secondQuint)The Effect of Scent on Pregnancy Induced Nausea, Vomiting, and Quality of Life.

 The inhalation of certain essential oils has been found to reduce feelings of nausea and to improve quality of life during pregnancy.

 The essential oils used in this study are applied topically to the temples and jaw line every 4-6 waking hours over a 6-day period.

 Each application will produce an exposure that lasts up to 30-45 minutes before fading.

 At the end of each day, nausea and vomiting levels will be assessed using a validated measurement instrument.

 Quality of life is measured using a 30-question tool that measures both pregnancy-related quality of life and pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting.
