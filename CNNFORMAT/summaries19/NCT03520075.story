(secondQuint)Study of ASTX029 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 ASTX029 is a synthetic small molecule inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1/2.

 ASTX029 has not been previously evaluated in human subjects.

 The Phase 1 portion of this study will assess safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose, the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and the recommended dosing regimen of ASTX029 administered orally.

 The Phase 2 portion will assess preliminary clinical activity in tumors characterized by gene aberrations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway that may confer sensitivity to ASTX029.
