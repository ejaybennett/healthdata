(thirdQuint)MyT1DHero: an mHealth Intervention for Type 1 Diabetes.

 This research seeks to realize the potential and test the efficacy of MyT1DHero to improve adolescent users' glycemic control and adherence to blood glucose monitoring.

 The investigators' goal is to help families receive more social support, and to improve diabetes knowledge, self-efficacy, family communication, and quality of life.

 The investigators further seek to decrease family conflict among children with T1D and their parents.

 In a 12-month RCT, investigators will randomize 166 adolescents and their parents to one of two groups: (1) attention control, or (2) the MyT1DHero app.

 Adolescents enrolled in the study will be 10-15 years old, and will have been living with T1D for 5 years at the start of the study.

 The primary outcome will be a change in the participants' HbA1C from baseline levels at the start of the study, to levels measured after 12 months.

The overall objective of the proposed research is to improve HbA1c, adherence to treatment plans, and family communication surrounding adolescents' self-management of T1D.

 The investigators will test the efficacy of the MyT1DHero app against an attention control group.

 This will allow investigators to better understand the health and psychosocial improvements being made through the app.
