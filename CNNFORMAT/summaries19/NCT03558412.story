(firstQuint)A Clinical Trial of Decitabine in Relapse and Refractory T-lymphoblastic Lymphoma.

 This is a prospective, open,investigator initial clinical trial with a single arm, aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of decitabine combined with Second-line chemotherapy regimens( BMF-90 or CODOX-M/IVAC) in relapse and refractory T-lymphoblastic lymphoma.

 A total of 40 patients are planned to be enrolled into the study.

 Patients with diagnosis of relapse and refractory T-lymphoblastic lymphoma will be treated with decitabine plus BMF-90 or CODOX-M/IVAC, respectively according to the previous chemotherapy regimen.

 The primary end point is responder rate (RR) and time to progression (TTP), and the secondary end points include overall survival (OS) and the median survival time (MST).
