(thirdQuint)CMV-MVA Triplex Vaccination of Stem Cell Donors in Preventing CMV Viremia in Participants With Blood Cancer Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Establish the feasibility and safety of priming CMV immunity in donors by Triplex vaccination prior to peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Examine if Triplex vaccination of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) donors has an impact on CMV events.

 OUTLINE: Donors receive multi-peptide CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine injection between days -60 and -14 prior to granulocyte colony stimulating factor mobilization.

 Participants undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation on day 0.

 After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 1 year.

 CMV-MVA Triplex Vaccination of Stem Cell Donors in Preventing CMV Viremia in Participants With Blood Cancer Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well multi-peptide CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara (CMV-MVA Triplex) vaccination of stem cell donors works in preventing cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia in participants with blood cancer undergoing donor stem cell transplant.

 Giving a vaccine to the donors may boost the recipient's immunity to this virus and reduce the chance of CMV disease after transplant.
