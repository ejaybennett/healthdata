(secondQuint)Identifying Serum Cytokine Profiles of Distinct Inflammatory Phenotypes in Severe Asthma.

 A prospective observational study of 90 adults diagnosed with severe asthma and on regular follow-up and 15 control subjects will be investigated.

 Stable (controlled or partly-controlled) status (of all) and exacerbated-status (if any) serum cytokine levels [IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-25, IL-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-17A, periostin) will be evaluated.

 Also nasopharyngeal brush samples will be obtained for respiratory tract panel work-up with PCR in exacerbated patients.

 Effect of viral infections' on cytokine response in different inflammatory phenotypes will be evaluated.

 Identifying Serum Cytokine Profiles of Distinct Inflammatory Phenotypes in Severe Asthma@highlight

The aim of this study is to determine and compare serum cytokine levels of six different severe asthma inflammatory phenotypes differentiated by their atopy, peripheral eosinophilia and/or chronic rhinosinusitis and/or nasal polyposis status.
