(secondQuint)Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Guided Therapy Versus Empirical Therapy for the Rescue Treatment of Helicobacter Pylori Infection.

 Helicobacter pylori (H.

pylori), which infects about 50% of the global population, has been recognized as a main risk factor of multiple gastric pathology, especially non-cardiac gastric cancer.

 Strong evidence supports that H.

pylori eradication is an effective approach to reduce the incidence of those pathological processes.

 Antimicrobial susceptibility test can pick out sensitive drugs to kill Helicobacter pylori, and reduce secondary drug resistance.

 But, there is a lack of high quality RCT to compare its efficacy with empirical regimen in the rescue treatment.

 Our study aims to assess the efficacy of 14-day antimicrobial susceptibility test guided triple therapy for the rescue treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.

 Comparing this regimen with 14-day Empirical Tailored Therapy to tell which one is better in clinic practice.

 We also want to find whether the 14-day antimicrobial susceptibility test guided triple therapy has less adverse effects with fewer drugs.

The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy of 14-day antimicrobial susceptibility test guided triple therapy for the rescue treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, then comparing it with 14-day empirical tailored therapy to tell which one has a better performance in both efficacy and safety.
