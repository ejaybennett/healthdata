(thirdQuint)Detection of Chlamydia Trachomatis, Neisseria Gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma Genitalium by Real-time Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) After Pooling Pharyngeal, Anorectal and Urinary Samples, in Men Who Have Sex With Men.

 Patients detected positive for one of the three (Sexually Transmitted Infection)STIs (Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Mycoplasma genitalium) on one site will be re-sampled twice at each of the three sites (pharynx, rectum, urine) before receiving antibiotics.

 Then, a real-time multiplex PCR will be performed on the pooled sample (merging pharyngeal, anorectal and urinary samples) versus on each of the three samples separately (i.

e.

 standard of care) to compare both sensitivities.

 Detection of Chlamydia Trachomatis, Neisseria Gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma Genitalium by Real-time Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) After Pooling Pharyngeal, Anorectal and Urinary Samples, in Men Who Have Sex With Men@highlight

This study aims to compare the sensitivity of detecting Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium by real-time multiplex PCR in a pooled analysis (i.

e.

 gathering pharyngeal, anorectal and urinary samples) versus the standard of care (where a real-time multiplex PCR is made in each of the three samples).
