(fifthQuint)A Comparative Study of a Combination of Zidovudine, Didanosine, and Double-Blinded Nevirapine Versus a Combination of Zidovudine and Didanosine.

 Previous in vitro studies suggest that HIV that has already developed resistance to AZT and ddI is less able to develop resistance to nevirapine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

 Thus, convergent combination therapy with these three drugs in HIV-infected patients may prove more effective.

 Patients are randomized to receive AZT/ddI plus either nevirapine or placebo daily for 48 weeks, with possible extension for at least 12 weeks.

 At eight participating sites, ACTG 808 and 809 will be conducted as virologic and pharmacokinetic substudies.

 A Comparative Study of a Combination of Zidovudine, Didanosine, and Double-Blinded Nevirapine Versus a Combination of Zidovudine and Didanosine@highlight

To assess the safety and toxicity of zidovudine (AZT)/didanosine (ddI) versus AZT/ddI combined with nevirapine in HIV-infected patients, and to obtain preliminary anti-HIV activity data using immunologic and virologic markers.

 Previous in vitro studies suggest that HIV that has already developed resistance to AZT and ddI is less able to develop resistance to nevirapine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

 Thus, convergent combination therapy with these three drugs in HIV-infected patients may prove more effective.
