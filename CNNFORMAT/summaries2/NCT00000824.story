(fifthQuint)A Study of Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) Therapy in HIV-Infected Patients.

 With lower CD4 counts, HIV-infected patients may not be able to produce dendritic cells and lymphocytes, special types of immune cells that generate HIV-specific CTLs.

 Infusion of CTLs generated from the dendritic cells and lymphocytes of an HIV-negative sibling may enable the body to recognize HIV more readily and increase immune response against the virus.

 Dendritic cells and lymphocytes are obtained from an HIV-negative sibling.

 HIV-specific CTLs are generated from these cells and then infused into the HIV-infected patient monthly for 6 months.

 Siblings must be able to donate on multiple occasions, and patients are followed every 2-4 weeks during the study.

 Patients are screened over 3 months prior to study entry.

 A Study of Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) Therapy in HIV-Infected Patients@highlight

To define the safety of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generated from sibling-supplied dendritic cells and lymphocytes and infused into an HIV-infected patient.

 To determine the efficacy of these CTLs in helping the immune system to fight HIV.
