(thirdQuint)A Study of Trimetrexate in the Treatment of Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia (PCP) in Patients With AIDS Not Previously Treated for PCP.

 TMTX is an experimental new drug which is effective for treatment of PCP, but has been given to only a few patients.

 Therefore it is not certain if TMTX is better, the same as, or not as effective as conventional drugs against PCP.

 Increasing doses of TMTX are used in combination with LCV as initial treatment for PCP in 50 AIDS patients.

 Doses are increased for 21 days on a once daily and then a twice daily basis.

 Dose escalations occur in subsequent groups of patients.
