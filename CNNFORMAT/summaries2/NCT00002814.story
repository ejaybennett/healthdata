(thirdQuint)Combination Chemotherapy for Patients With Brain Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the response rate in patients with refractory or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma treated with paclitaxel (TAX) and topotecan (TOPO) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support.

 II.

 Determine survival in these patients.

 III.

 Describe the toxicity of TAX/TOPO/G-CSF.

 IV.

 Evaluate tumor p53 expression in relation to response to TAX/TOPO/G-CSF.

 OUTLINE: All patients receive paclitaxel, topotecan, and G-CSF every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses and until 2 courses beyond maximum response.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for relapse and survival.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be entered if there are 1-3 responses in the first 20 patients.

 Combination Chemotherapy for Patients With Brain Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy using paclitaxel and topotecan, plus G-CSF, in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma that is refractory or recurrent.
