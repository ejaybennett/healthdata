(firstQuint)Rituximab in Treating Patients With Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 This study will evaluate the partial, complete, and overall response rates to rituximab of subjects with lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 Subjects will receive rituximab by IV infusion over several hours once a week for 4 weeks, followed by maintenance therapy as repeat course of the same dose and schedule rituximab at 6, 12, and 18 months.

 This was a single-arm study with multiple treatment periods added by amendment (ie, Secondary Group), with results reported by treatment period.

 As this was always considered a single-arm study, there was no intent to report the results for the initial treatment period separately as the Initial Group vs the Secondary Group.
