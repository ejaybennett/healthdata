(thirdQuint)Gemcitabine Plus Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Refractory Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the safety and tolerability of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin in patients with refractory metastatic or locally advanced pancreatic cancer (phase I portion of the study closed as of 7/5/00).

 II.

 Determine the objective tumor response rate to this combination regimen in this patient population.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation and efficacy study.

 Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 immediately followed by oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 3 weeks.

 Patients achieving stable disease, partial response, or regressive disease continue with therapy.

 Patients achieving complete response for two consecutive evaluations receive an additional 2 courses of therapy.

 Phase I (closed as of 7/5/00): Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

 Phase II: Patients receive the MTD of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin as in phase I.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 4 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-52 patients (12 patients to phase I (phase I closed as of 7/5/00) and 20-40 to phase II) will be accrued for this study within approximately 11-28 months.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in treating patients who have refractory locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
