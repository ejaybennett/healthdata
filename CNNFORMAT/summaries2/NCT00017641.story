(secondQuint)Phase I Study of Immune Ablation and CD34+ Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Support in Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.

 PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour for 2 doses.

 Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning 24 hours after completion of cyclophosphamide and continuing until leukapheresis is complete.

 Leukapheresis continues daily until target number of cells is harvested.

 CD 34+ cells are isolated from peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in vitro.

 Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2, anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 10 hours on days -4 to -2, and G-CSF SC beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.

 Patients undergo reinfusion of CD34+ PBSC on day 0.

 Patients are followed weekly for 90 days, monthly for 1 year, and at 2 years.
