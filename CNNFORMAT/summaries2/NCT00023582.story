(fifthQuint)HIV and Genital Herpes Among High-Risk Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM) in Lima, Peru.

 HIV incidence is high among MSM in Lima, Peru, and bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HSV-2 are prevalent in both recently and chronically HIV-infected MSM as well as HIV-uninfected MSM.

 Bisexual HIV-infected MSM could be an important "bridge" transmitting HIV and other STDs to women.

 Interventions to reduce both HIV and STDs are urgently needed among MSM in Peru.

 Given these associations and the high prevalence of STDs among MSM in Lima, prevention of HIV infections is dependent partially on innovative methods to control bacterial and viral STDs among high-risk HIV-uninfected MSM.

 The data from this prevention preparedness study is critical for future HIV prevention and vaccine trials that will be conducted in Peru.
