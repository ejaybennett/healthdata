(firstQuint)Therapy for Depression With Co-occurring Panic or Anxiety Symptoms.

 Many depressed patients also experience significant symptoms of panic or anxiety.

 This study will compare the effectiveness of a new therapy called interpersonal psychotherapy for depression with panic or anxiety symptoms (IPT-PS) with that of traditional interpersonal psychotherapy for depression (IPT).

 Participants are randomly assigned to receive up to 24 weeks of treatment with either IPT-PS or traditional IPT.

 Improvements in interpersonal functioning, quality of life, and symptoms of depression and anxiety will be assessed at the end of therapy and at a 3-month follow-up.
