(secondQuint)Tight Glycemic Control in Critical Care Patients.

 Reduction of morbidity-mortality in critical care patients with tight glycemic control had been proven in surgical patients only.

 Study Hypothesis: In critical care patients, medical or surgical, a glucose serum level between 80 - 110 mg/dL means a lower mortality than patients with glucose levels of more than 110 mg/dL.
