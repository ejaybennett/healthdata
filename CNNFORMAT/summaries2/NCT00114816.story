(fifthQuint)Docetaxel Followed by CEF (Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin and 5-Fluorouracil) Compared to Docetaxel and Capecitabine Followed by CEX (Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin and Capecitabine) as Adjuvant Treatment for Breast Cancer.

 This is an open-label, two-arm, randomized multi-center phase III trial to compare efficacy and safety of a taxane-anthracycline regimen to a taxane-anthracycline-capecitabine regimen as adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer with an intermediate-to-high risk of cancer recurrence.

 Patients diagnosed with early breast cancer with an estimated risk of 25% or greater for distant recurrence within 5 years from the diagnosis will be randomly allocated to one of the following 2 arms (1:1): - Arm A -- 3 cycles of docetaxel 80 mg/m intravenous (i.

 Use of trastuzumab is allowed in HER-2 positive disease.

 Patients will be followed up for 5 years post-randomization.

 Docetaxel Followed by CEF (Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin and 5-Fluorouracil) Compared to Docetaxel and Capecitabine Followed by CEX (Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin and Capecitabine) as Adjuvant Treatment for Breast Cancer@highlight

This study compares two chemotherapy regimens as adjuvant treatment for breast cancer.

 The study participants are randomly allocated to receive either 3 cycles of docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil) or to receive 3 cycles of docetaxel plus capecitabine followed by 3 cycles of CEX (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and capecitabine).

 The study participants are required to to have a medium to high risk for breast cancer recurrence.

 The primary aim of the study is to investigate whether addition of capecitabine to a standard taxane/anthracycline regimen will influence recurrence-free survival.
