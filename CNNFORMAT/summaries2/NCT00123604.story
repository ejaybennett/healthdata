(firstQuint)Vascular Effects of Carvedilol Versus Metoprolol in Hypertensive Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.

 Carvedilol and metoprolol are two commonly used blood pressure medications that have both been shown to be effective in controlling hypertension.

 Although in the same drug class, preliminary data have shown that these medications may have different vascular effects.

 This study will assess which medication is better at improving artery health independent of their blood pressure lowering effects.

 Artery health will be assessed non-invasively by ultrasound.

 Certain markers of atherosclerosis found in the blood will also be measured.
