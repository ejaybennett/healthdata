(thirdQuint)The Relationship Between Voiding Dysfunction and Intravesical Sensory Threshold in Diabetes Women.

 Diabetes is a common metabolic disease of multiorgan involvement.

 The American Diabetes Association reported that the prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) in the United States is currently 6% and rising.

 The increase is secondary to a rising incident in obesity, as well as a change in the criteria for the diagnosis of DM from a fasting blood glucose 140 mg/dl to 126 mg/dl.

 Besides impaired blood glucose regulation, many direct and indirect sequelae of DM can occur.

 Triopathy of diabetes including retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy are familiar to every internist.

 Lower urinary tract dysfunction is one of the most common complications in this group of patients.

 We look at the difference of intravesical sensation in diabetic women by current perception test; then, we can find the patient with diabetic cystopathy in early stage.

 We compare the groups of diabetic women with or without voiding dysfunction by urodynamic study.

 CPT test for intravesical sensation will be applied.

 The Relationship Between Voiding Dysfunction and Intravesical Sensory Threshold in Diabetes Women@highlight

The investigators will recruit a cross-sectional group of diabetic women in internist clinics.

 UDS will be applied for voiding function in each case.

 Intravesical electrical stimulation will be used to test CPT per 5 Hz, 250 Hz, 2000 Hz for the patients.

 The differences of intravesical CPT between diabetic women with and without voiding dysfunction will be determined.
