(firstQuint)Treatment of Mania Symptoms With Drug Therapy.

 Mania is a serious condition characterized by extreme excitement, mental and physical hyperactivity, insomnia, and disconnected thoughts.

 Symptoms of mania are common in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

 When associated with these conditions, mania reaches psychotic proportions and often includes hallucinations, paranoia, and feelings of omnipotence.

 Such symptoms may put individuals with mania and those around them at risk for physical harm.

 Drug therapies that can safely and effectively treat symptoms of mania are needed.

 This study will compare three drug combinations in their ability to treat symptoms of mania in people with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.

 This study will last 26 weeks and will comprise two parts.

 In Part 1, participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments: divalproex-extended release (DV-ER) and lithium, DV-ER and quetiapine, or DV-ER and placebo.

 Participants will receive their intervention for 12 weeks.

 Participants will have weekly study visits for the first 4 weeks of Phase 1; biweekly study visits will occur for the following 8 weeks.

 After Phase 1, participants who have not responded to their drug regimen will complete their participation in the study.

 Participants whose symptoms of mania have decreased will be enrolled in Phase 2.

 During this 14-week continuation phase, participants will continue the drug regimen they began in Phase 1.

 Participants will have biweekly study visits in Phase 2.

 During each study visit in Phases 1 and 2, participants will be interviewed about their mania symptoms.

 Mania, depression, quality of life, and overall functioning scales will assess participants at study entry, at the end of Phase 1, and at the end of Phase 2.

 Participants over 50 years of age will have an electrocardiogram (EKG) at study entry to determine cardiac function.
