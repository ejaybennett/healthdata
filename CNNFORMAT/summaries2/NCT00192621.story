(secondQuint)Seronegatives and Metabolic Abnormalities Protocol 2 (SAMA002): Study to Compare the Effect of Kaletra and Combivir in HIV-Negative Healthy Subjects.

 Antiretroviral medications, used to treat HIV infection, cause side effects.

 These include changes in the way that fat is laid down on the body.

 This results in fat loss from some parts of the body, with fat deposits at other sites, giving a characteristic look known as "HIV associated lipodystrophy" or HIVLD.

 With these changes, there are also abnormalities in glucose and fat metabolism (collectively termed metabolic abnormalities).

 In HIV negative populations, these metabolic changes are associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD).

 The aim of this study is to investigate if changes in the body's handling of fats and glucose occur with a short course of treatment in HIV negative subjects and if these correlate to an increased risk of CVD.

 Seronegatives and Metabolic Abnormalities Protocol 2 (SAMA002): Study to Compare the Effect of Kaletra and Combivir in HIV-Negative Healthy Subjects@highlight

This is a randomised study of the effect of treatment with Combivir (zidovudine [AZT] and lamivudine [3TC]) and Kaletra (lopinavir [LPVr]), alone and in combination, on the development of abnormalities in lipid and glucose metabolism in HIV negative healthy subjects.
