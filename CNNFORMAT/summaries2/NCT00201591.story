(thirdQuint)Training at Different Intensities in Coronary Artery Disease -Effects on Myocardial Function.

 Peak oxygen consumption was measured by gas-analysis.

 Myocardial function was measured by echocardiography.

 Exercise was performed on treadmills under close supervision of an exercise physiologist.

 Patients had to complete over 70% of sessions to be included in analysis.

 Three sessions were scheduled every week.

 Heart rate (HR) was about 85 % of max HR in the high intensity group, and about 65 % in the moderate intensity group.

 Training at Different Intensities in Coronary Artery Disease -Effects on Myocardial Function@highlight

The study investigated if aerobic endurance exercise of different intensity has different impact on the physical capacity and myocardial function in patients with coronary artery disease.

 Patients with stable CAD trained for 10 weeks, and oxygen consumption and myocardial function were measured before and after this period.

 Patients were randomly assigned to each exercise group.
