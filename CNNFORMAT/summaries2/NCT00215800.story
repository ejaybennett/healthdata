(firstQuint)The Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Ampligen in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

 This study will be a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, equal parallel groups study conducted at up to fifteen (15) centers to compare the safety and efficacy of Ampligen(R) IV versus placebo IV in 230-240 patients with CFS/ME.

 Patients will be randomized and stratified to receive either Ampligen(R) intravenously or placebo (normal saline) intravenously.

 Fifty percent (50%) of the patients will be treated with Ampligen(R) IV and 50% of the patients will be treated with placebo IV.

 Patients will be studied until 64 weeks (STAGES I plus II) have passed or until: 1) removed because of toxicity, 2) they withdraw voluntarily, 3) a change in the patient's medical condition makes continued participation unsafe, 4) the patient becomes non-compliant with the requirements of the protocol or 4) the Sponsor terminates the study.
