(fifthQuint)Vaccine Therapy, GM-CSF, and Interferon Alfa-2b in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cancer That Expresses Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA).

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of interferon alfa-2b (IFN--2b) when administered with recombinant vaccinia-CEA(6D)-TRICOM vaccine, recombinant fowlpox-CEA(6D)-TRICOM vaccine, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-expressing carcinoma.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the effect of IFN--2b on tumor cell expression of CEA and MHC class I antigens in patients treated with this regimen.

 II.

 Determine the immunologic effects of this regimen in these patients.

 III.

 Determine any objective anti-tumor responses that may occur in response to this regimen in these patients.

 IV.

 Determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of interferon alfa-2b (IFN--2b).

 COURSE I: Patients receive recombinant vaccinia-CEA(6D)-TRICOM vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1.

 Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-4 and IFN--2b* SC on days 9, 11, and 13.

 COURSES II-IV: Patients receive recombinant fowlpox-CEA(6D)-TRICOM vaccine SC on day 1.

 Patients also receive GM-CSF as in course 1 and IFN--2b* SC on days 1, 3, and 5.

 NOTE: *The initial cohort of 6 patients does not receive IFN--2b.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After 4 courses, patients who do not have progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity may receive recombinant fowlpox-CEA (6D)-TRICOM vaccine, GM-CSF, and IFN--2b every 28 days for 2 more courses and then every 3 months for up to 2 years.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IFN--2b until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 Six additional patients are treated at the MTD; these patients must be HLA-A2 positive.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 4 months and then every 6-12 months for up to 15 years.

 Vaccine Therapy, GM-CSF, and Interferon Alfa-2b in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cancer That Expresses Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA)@highlight

This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interferon alfa-2b when given together with vaccine therapy and GM-CSF in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer that makes CEA.

 Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells that make carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).

 Biological therapies, such as GM-CSF, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.

 Interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of cancer cells and slow cancer growth.

 Giving vaccine therapy together with GM-CSF and interferon alfa-2b may kill more cancer cells that make CEA.
