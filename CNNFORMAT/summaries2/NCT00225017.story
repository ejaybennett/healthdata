(firstQuint)Switch to Atazanavir and Brachial Artery Reactivity (SABAR) Study.

 HIV-infected subjects on a stable protease inhibitor (PI) containing antiretroviral regimen with plasma HIV RNA 130 mg/dL or fasting triglycerides levels >200 mg/dL, will be randomized (1:1) to continue their current antiretroviral regimen or to switch the PI to atazanavir (ATV).

 Brachial artery reactivity will be measured before (at entry) and 12 and 24 weeks after subjects are randomized.

 ARM A: Switch current PI to atazanavir 400 mg once daily plus current > 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for 24 weeks.

 Subjects currently on ritonavir (RTV) (400 mg BID or greater) or RTV-boosted PI ( 2 NRTIs) for 24 weeks Brachial artery reactivity in response to two vasoactive stimuli (increased forearm blood flow and nitroglycerin) will be assessed by measuring brachial artery diameter.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the change in brachial artery reactivity in HIV-infected subjects with elevated lipid levels who are switched to an atazanavir containing antiretroviral regimen
