(fifthQuint)N-acetylcysteine in Non-Acetaminophen Pediatric Acute Liver Failure.

 The Pediatric Acute Liver Failure (PALF) Study Group to identify, characterize, and develop management strategies for infants, children and adolescents who present with acute liver failure.

 The PALF study group includes 20 sites (17 in the United States, 2 in the United Kingdom, and 1 in Canada).

 The primary objective of the Pediatric Acute Liver Failure (PALF) study is to collect, maintain, analyze, and report clinical, epidemiological, and outcome data in children with ALF, including information derived from biospecimens.

 Patients enrolled in the PALF study registry were able to enroll in the NAC study providing they met the additional required inclusion/exclusion criteria.

 N-acetylcysteine in Non-Acetaminophen Pediatric Acute Liver Failure@highlight

We have completed patient enrollment in the the double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous (IV) N-acetylcysteine (NAC) vs.

 placebo for the treatment of non-acetaminophen ALF.

 The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of intravenous NAC in children with ALF for whom no antidote or other specific treatment is available.

 Inclusion in the NAC Study required enrollment in the Pediatric Acute Liver Failure (PALF) Study Registry.
