(secondQuint)Timing of Target Enteral Feeding in the Mechanically Ventilated Patient.

 Mechanically ventilated patients, within 48 hours of initiating mechanical ventilation, are randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive trophic enteral feedings for 96 hours followed by advancement to goal feeding rates or initial advancement to goal feeding rates.

 Primary endpoints are ventilator free days, ICU-free days, gastrointestinal intolerances, development of nosocomial infections, and mortality.

 Timing of Target Enteral Feeding in the Mechanically Ventilated Patient@highlight

This study tests the hypothesis that initial trophic enteral feedings will increase the time alive and free of mechanical ventilation as compared to initial goal enteral feedings in patients who are mechanically ventilated.
