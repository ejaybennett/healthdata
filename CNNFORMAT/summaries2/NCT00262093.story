(firstQuint)Angiogenesis Markers in Primiparas Versus Multiparas: Relevance to Preeclampsia Incidence.

 Primiparity is one of the main risk factors for having preeclampsia during pregnancy.

 Recently, sFlt-1, soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1, has been shown to be a major molecule involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.

 Higher sFlt-1 mRNA, higher serum levels of sFlt-1 as well as lower PlGF, placental growth factor, have been found in preeclamptic patients.

 We intend to check the angiogenesis profile of primiparas as compared to multiparas.

 Angiogenesis Markers in Primiparas Versus Multiparas: Relevance to Preeclampsia Incidence@highlight

The reason for having a higher incidence of preeclampsia in primiparas may involve angiogenesis imbalance in these patients.
