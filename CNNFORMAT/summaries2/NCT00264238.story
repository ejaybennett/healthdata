(firstQuint)Memantine Augmentation in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.

 The purpose of this study is to determine whether memantine (Namenda), in doses up to 20 mg/day, will be effective in treating the OCD of adult patients who have not responded to their OCD medication.

 Memantine is not FDA approved for OCD, but is approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.

 Memantine appears to work by regulating the activity of glutamate, one of the brain's specialized messenger chemicals, which may play a role in OCD.

 All patients in the study will receive memantine; no one will receive placebo.
