(fifthQuint)Radiation Therapy Followed By Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Young Patients With Supratentorial Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the toxicity of hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART) in pediatric patients with nonpineal supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors.

 Secondary - Determine overall and relapse-free survival of patients treated with HART followed by adjuvant combination chemotherapy comprising lomustine, cisplatin, and vincristine.

 - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 - Radiotherapy: Patients undergo hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART) twice a day, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks.

 - Adjuvant combination chemotherapy: Six weeks after the last radiotherapy dose, patients receive oral lomustine once and cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1 and vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15 .

 Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Radiation Therapy Followed By Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Young Patients With Supratentorial Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors@highlight

RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lomustine, cisplatin, and vincristine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving radiation therapy followed by combination chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving radiation therapy followed by combination chemotherapy works in treating young patients with supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors.
