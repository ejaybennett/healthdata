(fifthQuint)Impact of Ventricular Catheter Used With Antimicrobial Agents on Patients With a Ventricular Catheter.

 Objective: 1.

 To assess the cranial and extracranial infection rate of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis versus antibiotics-impregnated catheter.

 2.

 To assess the patients' outcome and carry out cost analysis for systemic antibiotic prophylaxis versus antibiotics-impregnated catheter.

 Design: Prospective randomized controlled trial Hypothesis: The use of antibiotics-impregnated catheter instead of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis will not increase the rate of cerebrospinal fluid infection, will decrease the rate of opportunistic/nosocomial infection and improves the overall outcome in these patients; that would convert into a reduction in treatment cost of these patients.

 Method: After ventricular catheter insertion, patients will be randomized into one of the two groups: 1.

 Periprocedural antibiotics: Only ie Unasyn and Rocephin and insertion of the antibiotics-impregnated ventricular catheter.

 2.

 Periprocedural antibiotics and prophylactic dual antibiotics ie Unasyn and Rocephin and insertion of ventricular catheter without impregnation of antibiotics.

 Primary outcome variable: Cerebrospinal fluid infection and extracranial infection.

 Sample size: We aim to recruit a total of 180 patients with 90 patients in each arm and expect to complete patient recruitment in 2-3 years.

 The calculation is based to detect a difference of nosocomial infection rate between 20% and 40%, with 5% level of significance and 80% power.

 Projected results and significance: The project has a good chance to be the first clinical study to the outcome and cost impacts of antibiotic-impregnated ventricular catheter.

 Impact of Ventricular Catheter Used With Antimicrobial Agents on Patients With a Ventricular Catheter@highlight

External ventricular catheters are used for intracranial pressure monitoring and temporary cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage in neurosurgery.

 The incidence of ventriculostomy-related cerebrospinal fluid infections had been quoted as between 2.

2% to 10.

4% in the more recent literature.

 Previous prospective studies in the investigators' unit have shown that the use of dual antibiotics prophylaxis in patients with external ventricular drain was associated with decreased incidence of CSF infection but was complicated with opportunistic extracranial infections.

 The current practice is to cover with prophylactic dual antibiotics unless guided by microbiology results for all patients with external ventricular drain.

 In recent years, cerebrospinal fluid shunt catheters impregnated with antimicrobial agents have been available.

 Experimental studies have shown that they provide protection against staphylococcal aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci strains for between 42 days and 56 days.

 Theoretically, they provide the antibiotic prophylaxis locally without the associated complications of systemic antibiotics.

 It is hypothesized that the use of antibiotic-impregnated catheters instead of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis will not increase the rate of cerebrospinal fluid infection, will decrease the rate of opportunistic/nosocomial infections and improves the overall outcome in these patients; that would convert into a reduction in treatment cost of these patients.
