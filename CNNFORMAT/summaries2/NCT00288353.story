(firstQuint)Estimating and Reducing the Cardiovascular Risk of Patients With Schizophrenia Drugs From Lipid Measures and Ischemic Electrocardiographic Changes.

 The primary goal of this study is to examine the triglyceride/HDL ratio and the ischemic EKG changes in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder.

 The secondary goal is to identify those subjects in the top tertile for the highest risk of IHD as defined by TG/HDL ratios (>>3.

5) and ischemic EKG changes with and without clinical ischemia, e.

g.

 angina and to see if these risk factors can be reduced or reversed by a change of antipsychotic medication, dietary counseling, enrollment into available exercise groups, etc.
