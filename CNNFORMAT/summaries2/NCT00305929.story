(secondQuint)Study of WST09 in Prostate Cancer After Radiation: Repeat Procedure.

 Multi-centre, phase II, open-label, 12-month clinical trial for patients that previously received a vascular-targeted photodynamic treatment (VTP) with WST09 (Tookad) and still have histological findings (prostate biopsies) indicating the presence of localized cancer.

 The WST09-mediated VTP procedure consists of an I.

V.

 infusion of WST09 (Tookad) at 2 mg/kg, in combination with the per-cutaneous interstitial delivery of monochromatic laser light (of a wavelength of 763nm) via the trans-perineal implantation of illumination fibres, positioned in the prostatic lobes.

 In a previous Tookad trial, escalating doses of laser light were used with a fixed dose of WST09 (2 mg/kg) in patients with localized prostatic cancer.

 Patients who underwent the procedure but still have positive prostate biopsies (residual cancer) may benefit from an additional WTS09-mediated VTP procedure.

 Thus, the aim of this study is to treat patients still presenting with localized prostate cancer with a second WST09-mediated VTP procedure.

 Study of WST09 in Prostate Cancer After Radiation: Repeat Procedure@highlight

This is a multi-centre, phase II, open-label, 12-month clinical trial for patients previously treated with WST09 (Tookad) who have positive prostate biopsies for cancer.

 The study aims at delivering a second WST09 treatment for the purpose of eradicating the localized prostate cancer.
