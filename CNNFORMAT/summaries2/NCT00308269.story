(thirdQuint)Study of Vintafolide (MK-8109, EC145) for the Treatment of Recurrent or Refractory Solid Tumors (MK-8109-006, EC-FV-01).

 This is a dose escalation study of vintafolide administered by intravenous (IV) bolus or infusion during weeks 1 and 3 of a 4-week cycle to participants with solid tumors refractory to current therapies.

 Vintafolide is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cells via a folate vitamin receptor.

 Experimental evidence shows that the target receptor is over-expressed in many human cancers.

 There are no previous human studies of vintafolide treatment; however, lab research (research in test tubes and/or animals) using vintafolide has shown activity against tumors in animals.

 This activity in animal models suggests that vintafolide may be useful as chemotherapy against human cancers.

 Study of Vintafolide (MK-8109, EC145) for the Treatment of Recurrent or Refractory Solid Tumors (MK-8109-006, EC-FV-01)@highlight

This is a Phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of vintafolide (EC145) in participants with relapsed or refractory advanced tumors.

 The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of vintafolide given by intravenous bolus or infusion.

 The efficacy of the treatment will also be measured.
