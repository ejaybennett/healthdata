(secondQuint)Efficacy & Safety of Prophylaxis With Bemiparin in Cancer Patients With a Central Venous Catheter (BECAT).

 Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in patients with cancer principally in association with central vein catheters (CVC).

 The clinical benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis for CVC-related VTE in cancer patients remains unclear.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the administration of Bemiparin in cancer patients with a central venous catheter (CVC).

 This study is designed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

 On the day of CVC insertion, eligible patients are randomly assigned to receive subcutaneously either bemiparin (3,500 UI/day) or placebo by using preloaded syringes for 45 days.

 The primary efficacy endpoint will be the combined incidence during the double blind treatment period of Clinical or symptomatic CVC-DVT verified objectively (Doppler ultrasonography or phlebography)and subclinical or asymptomatic CVC-DVT confirmed by elective bilateral Doppler ultrasonography performed 455 days after randomization.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the subcutaneous administration for 45 days of Bemiparin (3,500 UI/day) in cancer patients with a CVC, to prevent CVC-related deep venous thrombosis (CVC-DVT)
