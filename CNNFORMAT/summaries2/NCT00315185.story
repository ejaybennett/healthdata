(secondQuint)Study of Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, and Cetuximab for Advanced Lung Cancer.

 This research study is being done to determine if cetuximab will improve efficacy of standard chemotherapy.

 This agent targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

 EGFR sits on the outside of tumor cells and controls tumor cell growth.

 This agent has been looked at alone and with other chemotherapy drugs in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 It has shown to be safe and can shrink tumors.

 There is little information about the combination of this agent with both paclitaxel and carboplatin.

 This study combines cetuximab with monthly carboplatin and weekly paclitaxel.
