(fifthQuint)Primary & Booster Study in Infants to Demonstrate Non-inferiority, Persistence & Immunogenicity of Hib-MenC Vaccine.

 This multicenter study is open and consists of a primary and a booster phase.

 The study has 2 treatment groups with NeisVac-C cent + Infanrix cent hexa as active controls.

 In the primary phase, one blood sample will be collected from all subjects for immunogenicity analyses- one month after the second vaccination dose.

 In the booster phase, two blood samples will be collected: prior to and one month post booster vaccination.

 Primary & Booster Study in Infants to Demonstrate Non-inferiority, Persistence & Immunogenicity of Hib-MenC Vaccine@highlight

The purpose of this primary vaccination phase is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of two doses of Biologicals' Hib-MenC conjugate vaccine when given with Infanrix cent penta to infants (at 3 & 5m) compared to NeisVac-C cent given with Infanrix cent hexa.

 The purpose of the booster vaccination phase is to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of the Hib-MenC vaccine given with Infanrix cent penta at 11 m of age versus NeisVac-C cent given with Infanrix cent hexa, as well as the antibody persistence prior to the administration of the booster doses.
