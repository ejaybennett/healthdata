(thirdQuint)Fluphenazine in Treating Patients With Refractory Advanced Multiple Myeloma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety of high-dose fluphenazine hydrochloride in patients with refractory advanced multiple myeloma.

 - Determine the pharmacological properties of this drug.

 - Determine the effectiveness of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive high-dose fluphenazine hydrochloride IV 3 times on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Fluphenazine in Treating Patients With Refractory Advanced Multiple Myeloma@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluphenazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of fluphenazine and to see how well it works in treating patients with refractory advanced multiple myeloma.
