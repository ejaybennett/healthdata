(fifthQuint)Follow up Glucose Levels Among Infants of Diabetic Mothers.

 A retrospective study of 250-300 IDMs, born in a single large medical center.

 Data will be collected as follows: Gestational age, birth weight, sex, delivery mode, type of maternal diabetes, other maternal diseases, feeding mode.

 Glucose levels as were recorded according to newborn protocol (1,2,4,6 hours after delivery, and then every 8 hours for total of 48 hours).

 Data of hypoglycemia treatment, if given, will be collected.

 Later we will statistically try to determine the risk factors for developing hypoglycemia and the "safe" time and glucose levels to stop monitoring.

 Follow up Glucose Levels Among Infants of Diabetic Mothers@highlight

Infants to diabetic mothers (IDM) are at risk for developing hypoglycemia after birth.

 Glucose level follow ups are recommended to each IDM.

 However, there are no recommendations as to how long this follow up should be performed for, nor are there "safe" glucose levels that allow stopping glucose monitoring.

 The aim of the study is to retrospectively follow up glucose levels among IDMs in order to find risk factors for developing hypoglycemia and determine time and glucose levels that would permit monitoring cessation.
