(firstQuint)Effects of Systemic NO-Inhibition on Renal Hemodynamics in Patiens With Polycystic Kidney Disease and Chronic Glomerulonephritis.

 In a randomized, placebo controlled design, the effects of systemic treatment with monomethyl-L-arginine are studied on: 1.

 renal hemodynamics 2.

 renal sodium excretion and lithium clearance 3.

 blood pressure and heart rate 4.

 plasma levels of vasoactive hormones in patients with adult polycystic kidney disease and chronic glomerulonephrits.

 The results are compared with a group of healthy control subjects.
