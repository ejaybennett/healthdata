(thirdQuint)Polyvinylpyrrolidone-Sodium Hyaluronate Gel in Reducing Pain From Oral Mucositis in Young Patients With Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Examine the feasibility and acceptability of polyvinylpyrrolidone-sodium hyaluronate gel in pediatric patients experiencing oral pain from mucositis after cancer therapy.

 OUTLINE: This is a prospective, uncontrolled, open-label, pilot, multicenter study.

 Beginning before hospital discharge or day 3 after chemotherapy, patients use oral polyvinylpyrrolidone-sodium hyaluronate gel mouth rinse for at least 1 minute, 3 times per day or as needed.

 Treatment continues for 48 hours.

 Patients with persistent oral pain may continue treatment with polyvinylpyrrolidone-sodium hyaluronate gel beyond 48 hours.

 Oral pain and acceptability (i.

e.

, taste) of polyvinylpyrrolidone-sodium hyaluronate gel are assessed periodically using self-reported rating scales.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
