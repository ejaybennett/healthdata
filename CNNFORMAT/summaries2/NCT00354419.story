(fifthQuint)Cyclophosphamide, Antithymocyte Globulin, and Total-Body Irradiation in Treating Patients With Severe Aplastic Anemia Undergoing Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 The objective of this study is to determine the lowest dose of total body irradiation combined with cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin that will achieve sustained engraftment in patients with severe aplastic anemia transplanted with unrelated umbilical cord blood.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of total-body irradiation (TBI).

 MYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 to -4, -6 to -3, or -5 to -2 and antithymocyte globulin IV on days -6 to -4, -5 to -3, or -4 to -2.

 TBI: Patients undergo TBI twice daily on days -3, -2, and/or -1.

 UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD TRANSPLANTATION (UCBT): Patients undergo UCBT on day 0.

 Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.

 GRAFT-VS-HOST DISEASE (GVHD) PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or orally (twice daily for patients >= 6 years of age or 3 times daily for patients = 50 kg or 3 times daily for patients < 50 kg) beginning 4 hours after UCBT and continuing until approximately day +0.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

 Cyclophosphamide, Antithymocyte Globulin, and Total-Body Irradiation in Treating Patients With Severe Aplastic Anemia Undergoing Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant@highlight

RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of abnormal cells.

 It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells.

 When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

 Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.

 Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil before and after transplant may stop this from happening.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of total-body irradiation when given together with cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin in treating patients with severe aplastic anemia undergoing umbilical cord blood transplant.
