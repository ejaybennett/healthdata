(secondQuint)Compliance With Once-Daily Divalproex Extended-Release Tablets (Depakote-ER) Versus Multiple-Daily Dose Valproic Acid Capsules (Depakene) in Epilepsy:.

 x_ Prospective x__ Single-center __ Multicenter x__ Open-label __ Double-blind __ Single-blind x_ Randomized (please provide randomization ratio): 1:1 This population includes both patients whose seizures are relatively well- controlled on their present conventional, enteric-coated, twice-daily or three-times daily Divalproex sodium (Depakote(R), [DR]) regimen.

 Patients on DR monotherapy are preferred, but not required.

 Partial onset seizures and primarily generalized seizures will both be represented in this study.

 Patients will be randomized in 1:1 fashion.

 Group #1: 10 patients will be randomized to IR-VPA, to be taken 3 to 4 times a day, in a total daily dose equivalent to DR.

 The dosing regimen will likely be taken at meal times for those receiving IR-VPA tid (not q 8 h), and additionally at bedtime for those on a QID (not q 6 h) regimen.

 The choice of TID vs QID regimen will be dictated by the patients' total daily dose requirements, with the attempt to keep the number of 250 mg capsules identical for each dose throughout the day.

 Group #2: 10 patients will be randomized to ER, to be taken once-daily in the AM or PM at the investigator's discretion and patient's choice, since dosing ER in the AM or PM does not substantially differ as to plasma VPA concentrations [17].

 Once AM or PM once-daily ER dosing is chosen for a patient, it will not be changed.

 ER once-daily dosing will incorporate the recommended dose-proportional increase of 8-20% in total daily dose over that of DR for patients with epilepsy (18).

 However, only one tablet strength (500 mg ER) will be utilized, so total daily dose will be rounded to the nearest 500 mg increment.

 A total of 20 patients should provide sufficient power (80%) to adequately detect a statistically (p 35% and < 75% on three separate occasions or two consecutive occasions during the study.

 Primary Measures: The primary efficacy parameter will be the difference in mean compliance rate (defined as the # does taken divided by the # doses prescribed) for the ER vs IR-VPA group at Day + 42.

 Secondary Measures: 1) The change in compliance rate from Day 0 to Day +42 will be compared for both groups; 2) The precision of dose administration, determined by the number of doses administered within + 15 min of their assigned times will be compared for all dose times over the course of the study between the two groups; 3) Drop out rates for both groups, due to lack of seizure control, adverse effects or noncompliance, will be compared between groups.

 x_Statistical analysis assistance may be required None foreseen.

 Patients selected for this study will only be those who, upon recommendations or orders from their physician, will be switched from multiple-daily dose of divalproex-DR to the divalproex extended-release formulation, administered once-daily or to IR-VPA.

 This project is considered "research" by virtue of the randomization of epilepsy patients to two different groups, utilizing dosage formulations and regimens commonly encountered in clinical practice.

 Compliance With Once-Daily Divalproex Extended-Release Tablets (Depakote-ER) Versus Multiple-Daily Dose Valproic Acid Capsules (Depakene) in Epilepsy:@highlight

To determine, in a randomized, parallel open-label fashion, compliance rates between once-daily extended-release divalproex sodium tablets (Depakote-ER(R), Abbott Labs) versus multiple-daily dose valproic acid capsules (Depakene(R), Abbott Labs) in an epilepsy population.
