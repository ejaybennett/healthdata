(secondQuint)Effect of Chia Seeds (Salvia Hispanica L.

) on Glucose Control in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.

 Cohort studies have linked consumption of whole grain with a reduction in the risk of developing diabetes and heart disease.

 Grain of the plant Salvia hispanica alba (Salba) contain a high concentration of -3 fatty acids in addition to being a rich source of vegetable protein, fiber, calcium and antioxidants which have cardiovascular protective effect.

 To address the paucity of randomized, well-controlled clinical studies supporting the long-term cardioprotective benefits of whole grain we investigated the effects of a novel grain Salba in type 2 diabetes.

 Comparison(s): Participants on a conventional diabetes diet (50% carbohydrate, 20% protein, 30% fat) receive either addition of Salba or matched control supplement for 12 weeks separated by a 4-week washout period.
