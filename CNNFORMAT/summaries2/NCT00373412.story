(fifthQuint)Trial of pDNA CMV Vaccine (VCL-CT02) Followed by Towne CMV Vaccine (Towne) Challenge.

 This is a Phase 1, single-center, randomized, open-label trial of the live, attenuated Towne CMV vaccine administered as a "challenge" to healthy, CMV-seronegative, adult subjects who previously receive the CMV immunotherapeutic trivalent pDNA-based vaccine, VCL-CT02, given by intramuscular route at Days 1, 7 and 14 or who receive no VCL-CT02.

 Up to 12 healthy, CMV-seronegative subjects will be enrolled.

 If a subject consents and meets all eligibility criteria, the subject will be randomized to the VCL CT02 (N=6)or control (N=6) groups.

 VCL CT02-assigned subjects will receive VCL CT02 (1 mg weekly x 3) and then on Day 77 will received Towne vacine (3000 pfu subcutaneously).

 Control-assigned subjects will receive Towne alone.

 Safety will be monitored and both antibody to CMV gB and T-cell responses to CMV antigens will be measured at specified intervals for 252 days post Towne challenge.

 Trial of pDNA CMV Vaccine (VCL-CT02) Followed by Towne CMV Vaccine (Towne) Challenge@highlight

Objectives of this trial are to: Evaluate the kinetics and magnitude of the CMV-specific immune response post-Towne challenge (3000 pfu) in healthy CMV-seronegative volunteers who receive VCL CT02 administered (1 mg weekly x 3) 3 months previously compared to randomized controls who do not receive VCL CT02 as measured by: 1.

 antibody titers for gB; 2.

 T-cell IFN-g ELISPOT; 3.

 T-cell proliferation assays for IE1, pp65, and/or gB; and 4.

 cytokine and phenotypic flow cytometry responses to pp65, IE1, and/or gB.

 Evaluate the safety safety of Towne challenge in healthy CMV-seronegative adult subjects who have previously been immunized with a trivalent pDNA CMV vaccine (VCL-CT02) administered intramuscularly.

 Our hypothesis is that the immune response to Towne vaccine 3000 pfu challenge after VLC-CT02 priming will be greater than that after Towne vaccination alone.
