(secondQuint)A Placebo-Controlled Study Assessing Lateral Branch Radiofrequency Denervation for Sacroiliac (SI) Joint Pain.

 30 subjects with SI joint pain confirmed by SI joint injections will be randomized to receive either L4 and L5 primary dorsal rami and S1-3 lateral branch radiofrequency denervation or sham denervation.

 To facilitate patient blinding, in both groups 1 ml of lidocaine will be injected before true (or sham) denervation so patients cannot feel heating.

 The stimulation will be the same for both groups and blinding assessed after the procedure.

 Follow-up visits will be at 1,3 and 6-months postprocedure.

 A Placebo-Controlled Study Assessing Lateral Branch Radiofrequency Denervation for Sacroiliac (SI) Joint Pain@highlight

In order to determine whether L4 and L5 primary dorsal rami and S1-3 lateral branch radiofrequency denervation is effective for sacroiliac (SI) joint pain, we are conducting a randomized, controlled study.
