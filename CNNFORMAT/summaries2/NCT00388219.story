(firstQuint)Single Dose Trial Comparing the Plasma Levels of Two Different Analgesic Transdermal Patch Formulations.

 Main: to demonstrate the bioequivalence of the new buprenorphine transdermal patch T2rev formulation containing 13 mg buprenorphine (Test) as compared to Transtec (R) PRO 70 mu g/h patch transdermal patch containing 40 mg buprenorphine as reference (Reference) after single patch application.

 Pharmacokinetic target parameters are AUC, AUCo-t, and Cmax.

 Further: To assess the safety, tolerability, skin tolerability and adhesiveness of the patch applications.
