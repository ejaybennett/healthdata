(fifthQuint)Annexin A3 (ANXA3) as Protein-Based Marker for Non-Invasive Molecular Diagnostics of Prostate Carcinoma.

 The aim of this multi centre and double-blinded study was to investigate specificities and sensitivities of early detection of prostate cancer with a new protein biomarker, annexin A3, using urine after digital rectal examination/massage (exprimate urine) in direct comparison to the corresponding measurements of the gold standard, total PSA.

 The material obtained by this non-invasive procedure was moreover used to determine appropriate cut-off values and optimal fractions (e.

g.

 after centrifugation) and calibrations for quantitative measurements of this novel marker.

 Patients (500-750) were (and are) continuously recruited from four clinical centres in Germany (Berlin, Tubingen, Ludwigshafen) and Austria (Innsbruck).

 The major aspect was: cent Can annexin A3 provide a better specificity than tPSA, in particular in the grey zone of PSA (2-10 ng/ml) and can annexin A3 thus contribute to a significant reduction of invasive transrectal biopsies?.

 Annexin A3 (ANXA3) as Protein-Based Marker for Non-Invasive Molecular Diagnostics of Prostate Carcinoma@highlight

Emerging from a differential proteomic study of sample pairs of prostate cancer and benign tissue, annexin A3 (ANXA3) was chosen as a potential novel biomarker for the early and non-invasive diagnosis of prostate cancer.

 We wanted to show or investigate, that: - ANXA3 can be detected in urine after standard digital rectal examination.

 - ANXA3 has better specificities than tPSA, in particular in the grey zone of PSA - ANXA3 can help avoid unnecessary biopsies - ANXA3 can in the long run replace PSA as a marker
