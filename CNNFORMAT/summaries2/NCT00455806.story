(fifthQuint)Esomeprazole, Moxifloxacin and Amoxicilin for Rescue Therapy of Helicobacter Pylori Infection.

 Successful H.

 pylori eradication therapy remains a challenge in medical practice.

 Currently, a PPI - based triple therapy containing clarithromycin, amoxicillin or nitroimidazole given for 7 days is the recommended first line treatment approach with an expected eradication success rate of approximately 80%.

 As second-line treatment option in case of failure, a RBC-based quadruple therapy is currently recommended curing another 80% of patients, leaving a subset of patients with persistent H.

 pylori infection.

 Resistance to fluoroquinolones is low in most countries,hence these compounds are potential candidates for second-line and rescue treatment.

 The new fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin launched by Bayer in 1999 for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, has a broad antibacterial spectrum comparable to levofloxacin but fewer phototoxic and central nervous system excitatory effects.

 The possible role of moxifloxacin in H.

 pylori eradication is since under clinical investigation.

Successful H.

 pylori eradication therapy remains a challenge in medical practice.

 Despite promising data for first-line, second-line and rescue treatment options based on clinical trials as well as guidelines and expert recommendations, success rates can often not be reproduced in general practice.

 Rescue options for patients with failed initial or second-line therapy are definitely needed.

 The new fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin may represent an effective and save treatment option (in combination with a PPI and amoxicillin) for rescue therapy of H- pylori positive patients.

However, optimal duration of therapy (7-day course vs 14-day course) has to be determined
