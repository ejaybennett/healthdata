(firstQuint)Characteristics of Patients With Amyloidosis & Heart Failure Being Evaluated for a Heart Transplant.

 Systemic amyloidosis is a progressive disease leading to organ failure and death.

 Treatment has improved survival with stem-cell transplantation.

 Unfortunately, patients with amyloidosis and severe heart failure are not eligible for stem-cell transplantation.

 The average rate of survival for patients with amyloidosis who receive a heart transplant is decreased.

 Previous trials have raised the possibility that survival may be increased in patients with amyloidosis, if chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation is performed after a heart transplant.

 We plan to review data of patients with amyloidosis and heart failure who were being evaluated for a heart transplant.
