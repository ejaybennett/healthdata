(thirdQuint)Diagnosis of Active and Latent TB Infection With IFN-y Assays in African Children.

 The study follows children in contact with TB.

 Those with positive TST will be offered chemoprophylaxis and all children will be followed for 2 years to describe IFN-y responses over time, identify symptoms of active TB and if these symptoms are associated with IFN-y and other cytokine responses.

 Children with suspicion of TB attending health centres will also be investigated using routine diagnostic tests and IFN-y and other cytokines responses to evaluate if the latter could be used in improved diagnostic approaches.

 Diagnosis of Active and Latent TB Infection With IFN-y Assays in African Children@highlight

Study based in Southern Ethiopia Purpose - to explore if children in contact with adults with TB have positive acute reactants such as IFN-y and other cytokine responses; if these responses discriminate between high and low risk of disease progression and whether these could be incorporated into improved diagnostic approaches.
