(thirdQuint)Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III, Stage IV, or Relapsed Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With First-Line Chemotherapy.

 Overall Goals: - to evaluate the safety and induction of anti-tumor immunity by administration of an immunogenic human tumor cell vaccine, and assess immune response in relation to clinical outcome.

 Primary Aim: - to evaluate the safety of administering a heat shock protein gp96-Ig-secreting allogeneic tumor cell-vaccine (gp96-Ig vaccine) in patients with advanced NSCLC.

 Secondary Aims: - to study the immune response to vaccination, - to monitor clinical responses and - to recommend a dose-schedule combination for further testing in an initial Phase II trial of vaccine efficacy.

 Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III, Stage IV, or Relapsed Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With First-Line Chemotherapy@highlight

RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill non-small cell lung cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the effects of gp96-Ig vaccine therapy in treating patients with stage III, stage IV, or relapsed non-small cell lung cancer treated with first-line chemotherapy.
