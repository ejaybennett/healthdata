(secondQuint)A Study to Compare Effectiveness and Safety of Darunavir/Ritonavir (DRV/Rtv) 800mg/100mg Once Daily Versus DRV/Rtv 600mg/100mg Twice Daily in Early Treatment-Experienced HIV-1 Infected Patients (ODIN).

 This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study in which 590 patients will be randomly assigned to receive either DRV/rtv 800/100 mg daily or DRV/rtv 600/100 mg twice daily along with the selected OBR.

 An OBR will consist of at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) selected by the investigator.

 The study will include a 4 week screening period, 48-weeks of treatment period and 4-weeks of follow-up.

 The study will also consists of extension phase after Week 48: in regions where DRV is not yet commercially available or reimbursed by the health care system, patients who complete the 48 weeks of treatment with DRV/rtv and who continue to benefit from this treatment, will have the opportunity to continue DRV treatment as a 600 mg twice daily dosage until DRV is reimbursed and available via the public and/or private health care system or until its development is discontinued.

 Safety evaluation will consists of adverse events (including specific toxicities), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram, physical and skin examination.

The purpose of this study is to test if being treated with darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/rtv) 800/100 mg daily is as effective as being treated with DRV/rtv 600/100 mg twice daily, in early antiretroviral (ARV)-experienced patients when given along with selected optimized background regimen (OBR).
