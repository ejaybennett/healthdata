(secondQuint)Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Primary Breast Cancer With Epirubicin/Docetaxel and Carboplatin/Docetaxel.

 Most of the women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are in the situation that an operation is possible.

 Using a neoadjuvant therapy the rate of breast-conserving surgery can be extended and tumor cell proliferation may be inhibited.

 Further the neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an in-vivo-activity-test for the used drugs.

 Epirubicin, Docetaxel and Carboplatin have shown antineoplastic activity against solid cancer alone and in combination.

 Using two different combinations of these three drugs, first 3 cycles Epirubicin/Docetaxel and then changing to Carboplatin/Docetaxel for 3 further cycles it is assumed that the results of the therapy will improve.

 Main criterion is the determination of pCR, second criteria are the rate of breast-conserving surgery, tumor response and therapy-dependent toxicities.

 Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Primary Breast Cancer With Epirubicin/Docetaxel and Carboplatin/Docetaxel@highlight

The purpose of this study is to optimize results in neoadjuvant chemotherapy of local advanced primary breast cancer.

 Therefore patients become first 3 cycles of Epirubicin/Docetaxel followed by 3x Carboplatin/Docetaxel.
