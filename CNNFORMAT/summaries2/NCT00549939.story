(fifthQuint)Alfuzosin Treatment in Children and Adolescents With Neurogenic Urinary Bladder Dysfunction.

 Patients who met the study entry criteria were randomized (2:1:2:1) to one of the 4 dosage groups (Alfuzosin 0.

1 mg/kg/day, matching placebo 0.

1 mg/kg/day, Alfuzosin 0.

2 mg/mg/kg, matching placebo 0.

2 mg/kg/day).

 Patients received their treatment using either solution or tablet formulation depending on age as follows: - Solution to children 2-7 years of age or, children and adolescents 8-16 years of age if they were unable to swallow tablets or they preferred to take the solution or if they had a body weight 30kg.

 - Patients receiving Alfuzosin continued with their dosing regimen.

 - Patients receiving Placebo were switched to Alfuzosin with a dose corresponding to their randomization dose group.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Alfuzosin in comparison to Placebo on the detrusor Leak Point Pressure (LPP) in children and adolescents 2-16 years of age with elevated detrusor LPP of neuropathic etiology and detrusor LPP 40 cm H2O.

 Secondary objectives were: - To investigate the safety and tolerability of two doses of Alfuzosin in comparison to Placebo in children and adolescents, - To evaluate the effects of the two doses of Alfuzosin in comparison to Placebo on: - Detrusor compliance, - Urinary tract infection, - To investigate the pharmacokinetics of Alfuzosin (population kinetics), - To evaluate the 12-month long-term safety of Alfuzosin 0.

1 mg/kg/day and 0.

2 mg/kg/day.

 The study consisted of 2 periods: - a 12-week double blind treatment period where patients were to receive either Alfuzosin 0.

1 mg/kg/day or Alfuzosin 0.

2 mg/kg/day or placebo then, - a 40-week open label extension treatment period where patients were to receive either Alfuzosin 0.

1 mg/kg/day or Alfuzosin 0.

2 mg/kg/day.
