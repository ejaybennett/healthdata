(secondQuint)Randomized Study Evaluating the Role of Surgeon-Performed Ultrasound in the Management of the Acute Abdomen.

 Surgeon-performed ultrasound bedside in the emergency department when a patient presents with abdominal pain is quite common in Continental Europe and USA.

 It is considered to be implemented at emergency departments all over Sweden.

 This is the first randomized study performed to evaluate the method.

 In our study we compare diagnostic accuracy and further management of patients admitted to the emergency department for abdominal pain, with or without examination with surgeon-performed ultrasound bedside.
