(thirdQuint)RCT on the Combined Modality Treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Esophagus.

 The choice of the most beneficial method of treatment in esophageal cancer remains controversial and is the subject of vigorous debate.

 Surgery is still regarded as the principle modality among treatment strategies, with longterm survival achieved mainly in less advanced cases.

 More advanced cases, diagnosed more frequently, are more problematic in selection of the optimal therapeutic method.

 One of the options for improving treatment outcome in patients with advanced esophageal cancer is combined modality treatment with chemo- and chemoradiotherapy.

 Currently available RCTs have tested preoperative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy separately in comparison to surgery alone.

 Moreover, we do not know from these trials what is the added value of irradiation in a combined modality therapy over a preoperative chemotherapy.

 Another drawback of available RCTs is combining 2 different biological cancer entities: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus as well as carcinoma of the esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction.

 That were the reasons for designing our trial testing 3 principal modes of esophageal cancer therapy: surgery vs.

 chemotherapy + surgery vs.

 chemoradiotherapy + surgery on homogenous population of esophageal cancer patients with single pathological type - squamous cell carcinoma affecting thoracic esophagus.

 RCT on the Combined Modality Treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Esophagus@highlight

The purpose of the study was to test a null hypothesis that a combined modality treatment of esophageal cancer with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is equivalent to surgery alone and what are the benefits from adding irradiation to chemotherapy in neoadjuvant treatment of esophageal cancer.
