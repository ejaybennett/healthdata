(firstQuint)Agreement Between Venous and Arterial Blood Gas Measurements in the Intensive Care Unit.

 Venous blood gas analysis may be an alternative to arterial blood gas analysis for acid-base status, reducing the need for frequent invasive arterial sampling.

 The objective of this study is to examine the agreement between ABG and VBG samples for all commonly used parameters (pH, pCO2 and bicarbonate) in a pathologically diverse ICU patient population, specifically analyzing multiple paired arterial and venous samples from each patient.
