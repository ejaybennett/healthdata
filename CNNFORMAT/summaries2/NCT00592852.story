(fifthQuint)Fluoxetine for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in Children and Adolescents With Bipolar Disorder.

 As no systemic data is available regarding the efficacy and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in the treatment of OCD+BPD children, it calls for a preliminary open pilot treatment study to explore these issues as a logical first step that could lead to systematic randomized controlled trials in the future.

 SSRI's are the first line and most commonly used anti-OCD agents.

 It remains unknown, which of the standard SSRIs is least activating for youth with BPD.

 Fluoxetine along with fluvoxamine and sertraline are FDA approved for the treatment of OCD in children.

 Fluoxetine remains the most extensively studied SSRI in children.

 We will test the safety and efficacy of fluoxetine in children and adolescents with BPD and OCD.

 The proposed study includes 1.

) the use of a 12-week design to document the response rate and 2.

) careful assessment of safety and tolerability.

This will be a 12-week open-label pilot treatment study for children and adolescents (ages 6-17) who meet DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder (BPD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who are adequately mood stabilized on a stable regimen based on standard clinical care.

 Specific hypotheses are as follows: Hypothesis 1: Children and adolescents with comorbid OCD and BPD who have achieved adequate mood stabilization using a naturalistic clinical practice approach, will benefit from an FDA-approved selective seratonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) on their OCD symptoms in a clinically meaningful way without exacerbation of bipolar symptoms.
