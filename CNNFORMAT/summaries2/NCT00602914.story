(firstQuint)A Pilot Study to Assess the Safety, PK and PD of Insulin Injected Via MicronJet or Conventional Needle.

 Administration of insulin to the skin has many potential advantages including improved kinetics and reduced pain.

 Today, insulin is injected to the SQ space, using, in most cases, various devices incorporating standard metal needles and usually causing considerable pain and discomfort to the patients.

 NanoPass has developed a microneedle based needle substitute for intradermal injections.

 This device requires minimal expertise and is expected to cause minimal or no pain during injections.

 The objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of insulin Novorapid(R) (Novo Nordisk) injected via the MicronJet device intradermally, to a conventional needle injected to the SQ space.
