(secondQuint)Canadian Active & Maintenance Modified Pentasa Study.

 A multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority trial comparing the efficacy and safety of a new modified oral extended release Pentasa(R) (mesalamine) 500 mg tablet to the currently marketed Pentasa(R) (mesalamine) 500 mg tablet in subjects with active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis treated with 4 g/day for 8 weeks and in maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in subjects treated with 2 g/day for 24 weeks.

 The study involves male or non-pregnant female subjects aged 18 to 75 years.

 Subjects were randomised on entry into the trial, and if they were in remission at the end of the 8-week Active Phase or the 4-week Run-in Phase, they were eligible for enrolment into the 24-week Maintenance Phase, remaining on the original randomised treatment.

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the new modified oral extended-release Pentasa(R) 500mg tablet is at least as efficacious as the currently marketed Pentasa(R) 500mg tablet in active mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and also in maintenance of quiescent disease.
