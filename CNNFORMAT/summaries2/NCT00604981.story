(fifthQuint)Multisystemic Therapy (MST) for Obesity in African American Youth.

 Despite the increase in pediatric obesity, controlled intervention trials among adolescents are rare and fail to address vital socio-ecological factors, particularly in minority youth.

 Modification of food and activity choices is the foundation of obesity treatment; however, adherence to these recommendations is a major barrier.

 We have adapted the home-based Multisystemic Therapy (MST) to successfully improve outcomes in urban adolescents with diabetes.

 The objective of the present study is to adapt MST to improve adherence to recommended food and activity choices and reduce BMI in obese (BMI>95th percentile) African American adolescents (ages 12-17).

 Additional aims are to determine if MST changes the individual, family, and environmental variables related to poor food choices (e.

g.

, parental monitoring).

 Families are recruited from the only university-affiliated medical center in Detroit, Michigan.

 Michigan's youth have higher rates of obesity, overweight, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol compared to the national average.

 Detroit has the highest percentage of African Americans of any major city in the US.

 The design is a randomized controlled trial with 49 obese African American adolescents, 24 of whom receive MST and 25 of whom receive Shapedown, a family-based behavioral group intervention.

 Families complete a baseline data collection, a 7-month post-test coinciding with treatment completion, and a 12-month post-test.

 If successful, this intervention will provide immediate assistance to a vulnerable population disproportionately affected by obesity and its long-term health complications.

 The project will also provide the foundation for a larger clinical trial as well as future interdisciplinary studies combining behavioral and medical interventions.

 Multisystemic Therapy (MST) for Obesity in African American Youth@highlight

Despite the dramatic increase in obesity and Type II Diabetes in adolescents, documented effective treatments for obesity and the consequential prevention of Type II Diabetes are scarce.

 Modification of food and activity choices is the foundation of obesity treatment; however, adolescents may find it difficult to follow recommended diet and exercise programs.

 This study uses a home-based treatment, Multisystemic Therapy (MST), to target change within the individual, family and environmental contexts.

 Participants are 49 obese (BMI>95th percentile) African American adolescents (ages 12-17).

 24 were randomized to receive the MST intervention and 25 were placed in Shapedown, a family group program.

 Families were recruited from the only university-affiliated medical center in Detroit, Michigan.

 Michigan's youth have higher rates of obesity, overweight, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol compared to the national average, and Detroit has the highest percentage of African Americans of any major city in the US.

 Families complete measurements at the start of the treatment, at the end of the treatment and one year after enrollment.

 We expect to find that youth in the MST group will show more weight loss and greater improvements in diet (e.

g.

, caloric intake and exercise behaviors than will youth in Shapedown.

 These changes in food choices, activity levels, and weight are expected to remain after the end of treatment.

 This intervention is intended to provide immediate assistance to a vulnerable population disproportionately affected by obesity and its long-term health complications.
