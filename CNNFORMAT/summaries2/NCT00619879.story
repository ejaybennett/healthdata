(firstQuint)Myeloablative Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Transplantation (HPCT) for Pediatric Malignancies.

 Myeloablative hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) remains the standard of care for patients requiring HPCT.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the morbidity and mortality of myeloablative HPCT at Children's Memorial Hospital.

 It will also look to determine the toxicity of a single conditioning regimen consisting of total body irradiation (TBI), etoposide (VP-16), and Cyclophosphamide for patients with transplant eligible lymphoid malignant conditions or with transplant eligible myeloid malignant conditions who are receiving cord blood units, or to determine the toxicity of a single conditioning regimen consisting of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide for patients with transplant eligible myeloid malignant conditions who are not receiving cord blood units.
