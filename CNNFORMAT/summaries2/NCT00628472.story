(secondQuint)Novel Technique for Botulinum Toxin Injection to Minimize Patient Discomfort.

 Objective: To investigate whether injection of botulinum toxin type A is less painful if performed through follicular openings versus traditional non-specific approach.

 Design: Prospective, randomized, single-blinded study.

 Setting: Academic dermatology department.

 Patients: A volunteer sample of twenty female patients aged 25-55 who had no prior history of botulinum toxin injection.

 Intervention: Each patient received six randomized injections of botulinum toxin type A (Botox(R) Allergan).

 Two injections into the procerus muscle and two into each corrugator muscle.

 Three of the injections were performed through follicular openings and three were performed traditionally.

 Main Outcome Measure: Patient discomfort on a 1-10 scale and direct comparison between the two injection techniques.
