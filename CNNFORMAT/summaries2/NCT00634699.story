(thirdQuint)The Treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Using Thumb Pressure Along the Median Nerve.

 The carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition which should treated by surgery only when conservative approaches has been tried.

In the present trial the authors intend to find the effectiveness of treating the triggers points located in the biceps muscle, the pronator teres muscle and the biceps aponeurosis on the symptoms normally associated with the carpal tunnel syndrome.

 The technique used in this trial will be ischemic compression(thumb tip pressure)on the trigger points located on the previous sites.
