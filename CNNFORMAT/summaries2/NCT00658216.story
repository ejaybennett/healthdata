(firstQuint)Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) Usefulness In Elderly Dyspneic Patients (BED).

 Measurement of BNP concentration is approved for use in the diagnosis of heart failure (HF) in elderly patients below 80 years of age.

 The value of plasma BNP assays as diagnostic tools has not been determined in very elderly populations because the plasma BNP increases with age.

 This large, multicenter, prospective, observational, study in 300 participants is aimed to prospectively test the usefulness of measuring plasma BNP for diagnosis of HF in dyspneic patients aged 80 and older.
