(fifthQuint)A Study of Bevacizumab in Combination With Chemotherapy for Treatment of Osteosarcoma.

 This is a comprehensive study that uses a novel agent that targets angiogenesis (bevacizumab) in combination with conventional chemotherapy for the treatment of osteosarcoma.

 Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been shown to stop the growth of new blood vessels of tumors, both in the laboratory and in patients with other types of cancers.

 Bevacizumab has improved the effect of chemotherapy in adult patients with different types of cancer by increasing tumor response and increasing the chances of survival.

 This study has two main goals: - To find out if bevacizumab can be combined safely with chemotherapy for osteosarcoma - To find out if adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy will be beneficial in treating osteosarcoma.

 The chemotherapy drugs used in this study are commonly used to treat osteosarcoma.

 Patients with non-metastatic and resectable tumors receive bevacizumab and chemotherapy comprised of cisplatin, doxorubicin and high-dose methotrexate.

 Patients with metastatic tumors or tumors that cannot be removed by surgery receive bevacizumab and chemotherapy comprised of cisplatin, doxorubicin and high-dose methotrexate, ifosfamide and etoposide.

 If the tumor can be removed by surgery, surgery will be performed after 10 weeks of chemotherapy and will be followed by additional chemotherapy.

 After completion of active therapy, patient's response to therapy will be followed for approximately 5 years.

 A Study of Bevacizumab in Combination With Chemotherapy for Treatment of Osteosarcoma@highlight

This study adopts a novel strategy for first-line treatment of osteosarcoma by combining chemotherapy with anti-angiogenic therapy using bevacizumab (Avastin(R)), a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

 Chemotherapy for localized disease comprises a 3-drug regimen (cisplatin, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate).

 Chemotherapy for metastatic or unresectable disease comprises a cisplatin-based regimen that includes high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and etoposide.
