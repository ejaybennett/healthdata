(thirdQuint)Study of Cancer Peptides Vaccine Plus GM-CSF as Adjuvant Treatment for High Risk (TXN2-3M0) or Metastatic Breast Cancer With No Evidence of Disease.

 The primary endpoint will be to determine the safety and feasibility of administering cancer peptides to patients with high risk (TxN2-3M0) or metastatic breast cancer with no evidence of disease following their completion of systemic therapy, with the secondary objectives of evaluating immune response disease relapse survival.

 Two cohorts of 9 patients each will be treated with different doses of the vaccine.

 They will receive the peptide vaccine subcutaneously on weeks 0,1,2,4,5, and 6 and then receive the immunizations every 1 month for 6 months or disease recurrence.

 Toxicity will be assessed at each dose level using CTCv3 toxicity criteria.

 Study of Cancer Peptides Vaccine Plus GM-CSF as Adjuvant Treatment for High Risk (TXN2-3M0) or Metastatic Breast Cancer With No Evidence of Disease@highlight

This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering a peptide vaccine consisting of twelve different tumor-rejection antigens to patients with high risk (TxN2-3M0) or metastatic breast cancer with no evidence of disease following their completion of systemic therapy.

 The vaccine is designed to elicit immune responses against twelve different pathways that are essential to tumor growth, survival and metastasis.
