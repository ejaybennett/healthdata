(thirdQuint)Evaluation of the Role of Nocturnal Non-Invasive Ventilation in Pulmonary Rehabilitation.

 Non invasive ventilation is known to allow improvements if applied during endurance training, but this is technically difficult.

 Nocturnal application of non invasive ventilation is known to unload the ventilatory pump, reset the control of breathing, and improve sleep quality.

 The protocol also aimed to evaluate the acceptance of non invasive ventilation in patients undergoing a four week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programme.

 Evaluation of the Role of Nocturnal Non-Invasive Ventilation in Pulmonary Rehabilitation@highlight

Hypothesis: Hospital based, comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation of patients with COPD in GOLD stage IV can be optimized by application of nocturnal non invasive ventilation.

 This hypotheses shall be tested by an observational trial, comparing rehabilitation effects of a prospectively observed group receiving non invasive ventilation, compared wiht a historical control group of patients who did received the same treatment without non invasive ventilation.
