(firstQuint)A Study of Sativex for Relief of Peripheral Neuropathic Pain Associated With Allodynia.

.

 This was a six week, multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy of Sativex(R).

 Subjects with peripheral neuropathic pain characterised by allodynia, were screened to determine eligibility and entered a seven day baseline period.

 Subjects then returned to the centre for randomisation and dose introduction, and received either placebo or Sativex in a double blind manner for five weeks, with a follow up visit 7 to 10 days after the end of the treatment period.

 The primary efficacy measure was the difference in pain severity at the end of treatment, measured using a peripheral neuropathic pain 0 to 10 numerical rating scale.
