(fifthQuint)The Pakistan Early Childhood Development Scale Up Trial.

 In Pakistan, the "National Program for Family Planning and Primary Healthcare" delivers maternal and child health and nutrition services in rural and remote areas of Pakistan through community-based Lady Health Workers.

 The strengths of the programme include provision of services at grassroots levels, reinforcement of health and basic nutrition messages and community acceptability.

 Given, the growing recognition that optimal early child development (ECD) also requires the integration of psychosocial care; the PEDS-Trial has been proposed to evaluate the benefits of the addition of 'stimulation and care for development' interventions and the feasibility of scaling up an ECD strategy within the community healthcare system of Pakistan.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the integration of an early child 'stimulation and care for development' intervention, either alone or in combination with an 'enhanced care for nutrition' intervention, delivered by Lady Health Workers to families with infants and young children aged 0-24 months living in rural Sindh in Pakistan, has beneficial outcomes on child development (cognitive, language, motor and social emotional development) and child growth.
