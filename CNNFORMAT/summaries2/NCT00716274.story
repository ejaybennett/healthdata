(secondQuint)Effects of Atomoxetine on Brain Activation During Attention & Reading Tasks in Participants With ADHD & Comorbid Dyslexia.

 This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single site study that uses an fMRI measurement to assess brain activation during attention and reading tasks and the effects of atomoxetine in reducing symptoms of ADHD in participants with ADHD and comorbid dyslexia.

 Similar assessments are performed in two additional groups of participants with ADHD only and dyslexia only to determine to what extent symptomatic change in the comorbid ADHD & dyslexia is achieved independently by atomoxetine effects on either condition.

 A healthy control group of non-ADHD, non-dyslexia subjects (20) will be included to monitor practice effects & effects of treatment that may be interpreted as normal maturation.

 The healthy control group will not be treated with any study medications.
