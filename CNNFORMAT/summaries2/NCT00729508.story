(thirdQuint)Effectiveness of Cat-PAD to Treat Cat Allergy in Cat Allergic Subjects.

 This study is designed as a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 4 treatment regimens in up to 120 cat allergic subjects.

 A total of 24 subjects will be randomised into each treatment group.

 Each subject will undergo screening up to 4 weeks before treatment.

 Baseline challenge will consist of exposure to cat allergen for 3 hours in an EEC on 4 visits on successive days a week before the first administration of Cat-PAD or placebo.

 Treatment will be administered as intradermal injections into the flexor surface of alternate forearms.

 There are 5 treatment regimens involving administration of Cat-PAD or placebo.

 Post-treatment challenge (PTC) will consist of exposure to cat allergen for 3 hours in an EEC on 4 visits on successive days 18 weeks after the first administration of study medication.

 Effectiveness of Cat-PAD to Treat Cat Allergy in Cat Allergic Subjects@highlight

Cat allergy is an increasingly prevalent condition, affecting 10-15% of patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma.

 Cat-PAD is a novel, synthetic, allergen-derived peptide desensitising vaccine, currently being developed for the treatment of cat allergy.

 This study will investigate the efficacy of 4 treatment regimens of Cat-PAD in cat allergic subjects following challenge to cat allergen in an environmental exposure chamber (EEC).
