(firstQuint)Association Study of Gene Polymorphisms With Cardiac Performance.

 G Protein pathways plays a pivotal role in mediating positive inotropy and cardiac hypertrophy by transducing signals of neurohormones in cardiomyocytes.

 Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the G protein subunits Galphas and Galphaq have been shown to result in altered protein expression.

 We now want to examine whether G Protein polymorphisms alter NYHA functional class, and hemodynamic variables in patients with coronary artery disease scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting .

 Association Study of Gene Polymorphisms With Cardiac Performance@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether polymorphisms in G protein subunits, namely Galphas and Galphaq, are associated with altered cardiac performance in heart failure patients.
