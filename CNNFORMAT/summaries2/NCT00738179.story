(fifthQuint)Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease.

 There is increasing evidence to indicate that OSA is an important modifiable risk factor for CV disease including stroke, MI, and heart failure.

 Increased nocturnal arterial blood pressure (BP), hypercoagulability, oxidative stress, inflammation, insulin resistance and cardiac arrhythmias are all associated with OSA.

 These effects are presumed to accelerate the progression of atheromatous disease, particularly within the coronary or cerebral vasculature.

 Moreover, OSA also appears to increase the risk of sudden death during sleep, which is different from the circadian pattern of sudden death in those without OSA, suggesting that episodes of apnea may have a direct triggering effect for cardiac arrhythmias or MI.

 CPAP is now standard therapy for symptomatic OSA, with adherence to treatment comparable to that of other therapies for common chronic diseases.

 CPAP can eliminate apneas and improve daytime sleepiness, mood and quality of life.

 Furthermore, short term (1-3 months) randomised controlled trials of CPAP have shown modest reductions in blood pressure (BP) and other markers of CV disease, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and coagulation.

 However, the epidemiological data is complicated by potential residual confounding factors and the randomised evidence is limited.

 Thus, a direct causal link between OSA and CV disease remains inconclusive.

 The management of OSA, therefore, remains principally directed towards symptom control rather than CV risk modification.

 The present trial aims to test whether long-term use of CPAP can reduce the incidence of CV events.

 If the trial shows that CPAP treatment of OSA reduces the incidence of CV events it will influence clinical practice toward the early detection and management of OSA, and add CPAP to the range of strategies available for the prevention of CV disease.

 Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease@highlight

Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a condition in which a person stops breathing for several seconds at a time due to relaxation of the throat muscles.

 This can occur many times during sleep.

 It is known to cause sleepiness and poor concentration during the day.

 Research indicates that OSA may be a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease due to its association with hypertension, stroke, heart attack and sudden death.

 The standard therapy for symptomatic OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

 CPAP has been shown to effectively reduce snoring, obstructive episodes and daytime sleepiness and to modestly reduce blood pressure and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

 The overall aim of SAVE is to determine if CPAP can reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke or heart failure for people with OSA.
