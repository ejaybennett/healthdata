(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Automatic Testing Feature in New ICDs and CRT-Ds.

 All patients enrolled in the study will have their device tested to determine if the device can automatically measure how much energy is needed to pace the patient's heart.

 If the test is successful, the patient's device will be programmed to turn that feature on.

 3 months after enrollment, the patient will return to the clinic to have their device re-tested using an automatic test method to measure the amount of energy needed to make the patient's heart beat.

 A manual test method will also be used to measure the amount of energy needed to make the patient's heart beat.

 The intent of the study is to show the automatic method works just as well as the manual method.

 Safety and Efficacy of Automatic Testing Feature in New ICDs and CRT-Ds@highlight

This study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center clinical trial that will assess the safety and effectiveness of investigational models of the Promote cent RF CRT-D and Current cent RF ICD devices.

 These new ICD and CRT-D devices have new features that allow the device to periodically check how much energy is needed to pace a patient's heart and to automatically adjust the amount of energy used to pace the heart.
