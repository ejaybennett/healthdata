(fifthQuint)Can Simple and Inexpensive Techniques Enhance Patient Comfort.

 The purpose of the study is to conduct a RCT study to determine the effectiveness of loading the sigmoid colon with warm water and warm water irrigation for dealing with colonic spasms in enhancing patient abdominal comfort during unsedated colonoscopy.

 The specific aim is to compare Study Treatment of warm water loading and irrigation when spasms occur with Control Treatment of no water loading and waiting for spasms to subside.

 The proportion of patients complaining of abdominal discomfort and their discomfort score are the primary outcome variables.

 The secondary outcome variables and co-variables described below will be recorded in a prospective manner to ensure completeness of data collection.

 In preliminary clinical observation at VA Sepulveda ACC, 25 to 30% of VA patients accept colonoscopy without sedation.

 The goal of this study is to find ways of further reducing discomfort associated with unsedated colonoscopy.

 Can Simple and Inexpensive Techniques Enhance Patient Comfort@highlight

This research study compares two methods of performing colonoscopy without sedation.

 The standard method is to insert the colonoscope without adding any water to the colon, and when colonic spasms occur during the examination, waiting for the spasms to subside before continuing with the insertion of the colonoscope.

 The study method involves putting 200 ml (7 oz) of warm water through the colonoscope into the colon at the beginning of the examination, and when colonic spasms occur during the examination, putting 30 ml (1 oz) of warm water into the spastic area(s) to relax the colonic spasms.
