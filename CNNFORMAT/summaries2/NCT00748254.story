(secondQuint)Laser-based Photoacoustic Tomography of Human Inflammatory Arthritis.

 The objective of this proposal is to adapt photoacoustic tomography (PAT), a novel, nonionizing, noninvasive, laser-based technology, for structural and functional imaging of human peripheral joints affected by inflammatory arthritis.

 Combining the advantages of both light and ultrasound scanning, PAT holds promise to present objective optical information in subsurface joint tissues with high sensitivity and high spatial resolution.

 This could be of considerable help in the early detection of inflammatory joint diseases.

 PAT may also prove useful in further understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders and assisting with therapeutic decisions, including assessment of new pharmacological therapies.
