(firstQuint)AMS Study: Inflammatory and Biomechanical Contributors to Arthritis Development Following Arthroscopic Meniscectomy.

 This study will test the hypothesis that knee trauma (as exemplified by the arthroscopy procedure) causes inflammation that alters muscle activation patterns locally and also disrupts the balance between parasympathetic-sympathetic reflexes.

 It is hypothesized that these factors contribute to development and progression of knee osteoarthritis.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between muscle activation and heart rate on joint generalized inflammation and arthritis development.
