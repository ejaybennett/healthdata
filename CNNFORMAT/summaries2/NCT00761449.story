(firstQuint)Lenalidomide in High-risk MDS and AML With Del(5q) or Monosomy 5.

 Previous studies have shown that the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide is effective in the treatment of low risk MDS with del(5q).

 Treatment of this subgroup of MDS patients resulted in 67% major erythroid responses and 45% complete cytogenetic responses.

 We therefore intend to test the efficacy of lenalidomide in a group of high-risk patients who are ineligible for conventional chemotherapy and who have a dismal prognosis.

 The patients must have a karyotype including del(5q) but patients with a karyotype including monosomy 5 are also eligible.

 We hypothesize that hight risk MDS or AML patients with other chromosomal aberrations than del(5q) can be affected by the lenalidomide effect.
