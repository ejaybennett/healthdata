(firstQuint)Validation of an Assay to Measure Cyclooxygenase-1 Activity.

 Aspirin has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in at-risk individuals, but some aspirin-treated patients fail to exhibit expected changes in bleeding time and platelet aggregation.

 Recent evidence has correlated aspirin "non-response" to poor cardiovascular outcomes.

 In order to study the mechanisms of aspirin resistance, an assay is needed to measure the catalytic activity of platelet cyclooxygenase (which should be inhibited by aspirin).

 A common assay in general use is the measurement of thromboxane B2 production in clotting whole blood.

 This measure, however, is influenced by genetic and environmental variations in the glass-activated coagulation pathway, albumin binding capacity, platelet activation pathways, arachidonic acid pools, and phospholipase activity.

 Our laboratory has developed a direct assay of platelet cyclooxygenase (COX-1) activity that is not influenced by these variations.

 This study will generate a reference range in normal volunteers taking a routine clinical dose of aspirin (81mg daily) for this assay.

 In addition, by using two aspirin formulations (enteric-coated and chewable), the study design additionally allows the secondary comparison of the effects of these two formulations on COX-1 inhibition.

The purpose of this study is to obtain a reference range for a newly developed assay of ex vivo platelet COX-1 activity in normal volunteers taking a routine clinical dose of aspirin.
