(firstQuint)Can Risedronate Prevent Periprosthetic Bone Loss After Total Hip Arthroplasty.

 Periprosthetic bone loss after total hip arthroplasty is the main factor in limiting the longevity of implants used for treatment of osteoarthritis.

 Bone loss leads to implant destabilization.

 Bisphosphonates, given for approximately 6 months after THA man prevent this bone loss and lead to longer implant fixation and lower incidence of aseptic prosthesis loosening.

 We perform a clinical trial with risedronate to investigate if we can influence periprosthetic bone loss around a uncemented femoral stem.
