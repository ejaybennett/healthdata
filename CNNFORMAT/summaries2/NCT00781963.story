(fifthQuint)Implementing Sleep Interventions for Older Veterans.

 Sleep disturbance is common among older people due to age-related changes in sleep, in addition to health conditions, psychosocial issues, medication effects and a variety of other factors that impact sleep.

 The evidence that insomnia has negative effects on health and quality of life in older adults is convincing.

 Prior research has demonstrated that insomnia symptoms are even more common among veterans compared to the general population.

 Our own work has demonstrated that sleep problems are associated with depressive symptoms and other impairments in quality of life in older people, and that nonpharmacological and behavioral interventions can improve sleep in a variety of settings.

 Objectives: We propose to test two methods of providing behavioral sleep interventions for treating insomnia in older veterans.

 The long-term objective of this work is to identify ways to improve access to behavioral sleep interventions for older veterans, in order to improve their well-being and quality of life.

 Methods: This project will be conducted in outpatient clinics of the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System.

 Community-dwelling older veterans (aged 60 years and older) with insomnia will be identified by a postal survey.

 Enrolled veterans with insomnia (N=150, 50 per group) will be randomized to one of three groups:Individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (Individual-CBTI), Group-CBTI, or group-based Sleep Education Control Condition (Control).

 The intervention involves a manual-based behavioral sleep intervention provided by health educators.

 Baseline data will include subjective and objective measures of sleep, and structured assessments of depression and quality of life.

 Post-treatment assessments will be performed after completion of the 6-week intervention, and follow-up assessments will be performed at 6-months and 12-months follow-up.

 Main outcome measures will include sleep/wake patterns (sleep questionnaires and wrist actigraphy), depression and self-reported quality of life.

 Data will be analyzed for all randomized participants in an intention to treat analysis.

 We hypothesize that the intervention will improve sleep (both objectively and subjectively) and will improve depressive symptoms and quality of life at six months follow-up.

 We also expect that these improvements will be maintained at 12-months follow-up.

 Implementing Sleep Interventions for Older Veterans@highlight

Sleep problems are common among older people, and research suggests that insomnia has negative effects on health and quality of life in older adults.

 Prior research suggests that insomnia symptoms are even more common among veterans compared to the general population.

 In addition, people with sleep problems also often have depression and other problems that seem to decrease their quality of life.

 In this study, we will test two methods of providing behavioral sleep interventions for treating insomnia in older veterans.

 The long-term objective of this work is to identify ways to improve access to these types of behavioral sleep interventions for older veterans, in order to improve their well-being and quality of life.

 This project will be conducted in outpatient clinics of the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System.

 Community-dwelling older veterans (aged 60 years and older) with insomnia will be identified by a postal survey.

 Enrolled veterans with insomnia (N=150 total, 50 per group) will be randomized to one of three groups: Individual-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (Individual-CBTI), Group-CBTI or a group-based Sleep Education Control Condition (Control).

 Measures of sleep, depression and quality of life will be performed at baseline (enrollment in the study), after the treatment is completed, and during assessments at 6-months and 12-months follow-up.

 Main outcome measures will include sleep/wake patterns (sleep questionnaires and wrist actigraphy, which is an objective estimate of sleep and wakefulness), depression and self-reported quality of life.

 We hypothesize that the intervention will improve sleep and will improve depressive symptoms and quality of life at six months follow-up.

 We also expect that these improvements will be maintained at 12-months follow-up.
