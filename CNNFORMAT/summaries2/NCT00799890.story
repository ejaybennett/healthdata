(fifthQuint)Sunphenon in Progressive Forms of Multiple Sclerosis.

 The hypotheses of our study are: Sunphenon EGCg has an antiinflammatoric effect due to its impact on the T-cell-proliferation and the inhibition of the activity of NF-Kb.

 Sunphenon EGCg has a neuroprotective effect due to its antioxidative potence as a radical scavenger.

 A 30 month treatment with Sunphenon EGCg is safe and well-tolerated.

The investigators hypothesize that an oral Sunphenon EGCg (Epigallocatechin-Gallat, EGCG) treatment is - due to its antiinflamatoric and neuroprotective potence - significantly more effective than an oral placebo treatment regarding following parameters: increase in brain atrophy, number of new T2-lesions in the cerebral magnetic resonance tomography, reduction of the NAA/Cr-ratio in MR-spectroscopy, progression of disability such as cognitive disorders in patients with MS.
