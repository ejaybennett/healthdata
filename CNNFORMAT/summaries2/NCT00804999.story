(firstQuint)Two Phase Clinical Study of the Impact of Contact Lenses and Solutions on Corneal Structure.

 Several types of solutions are used in contact lens wear.

 Each contact lens solution used to disinfect contacts have different ingredients even though they all disinfect the contacts.

 The objective of this study is to examine the layers of the cornea via HRT in order to assess the usefulness of this technology and to identify any potential consequences of contact lens wear and/or care solution used.
