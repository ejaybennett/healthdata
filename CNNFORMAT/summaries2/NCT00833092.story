(secondQuint)Magnesium Nutrition and Sleep Behavior in Older Adults.

 Insomnia affects approximately one-third of older Americans.

 More than half of all people aged 65 and older experience sleep problems.

 The prevalence of insomnia and other sleep disorders is not a natural part of aging but is high in older adults because of a variety of factors common in late life.

 One of those factors may be a deficient magnesium status.

 There is a close association between sleep architecture, especially slow wave sleep, and activity in the glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system.

 Because magnesium is a natural N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)antagonist and GABA agonist, magnesium apparently plays a key role in the regulation of sleep.

 Such a role is supported by supplementation, correlation, and animal studies showing that magnesium intake or status affects sleep organization.

 One of these factors may be a deficient magnesium status.

 This study will look at whether or not magnesium supplementation will improve sleep.
