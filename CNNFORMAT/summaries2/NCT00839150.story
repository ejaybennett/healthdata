(thirdQuint)Retinal Function in Diabetic Patients Without Retinopathy.

 Type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients with no diabetic retinopathy and no hypertension were compared with sex and age-matched control subjects.

 Color vision was tested with the desaturated LANTHONY 15-Hue test.

 Contrast sensitivity was assessed with the Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity test.

 Pattern-electroretinogram, Ganzfeld full-field electroretinogram and multifocal electroretinogram were recorded according to the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV).

 Flicker-induced vasodilatation in retinal arteries and veins was assessed using the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer.

The primary purpose was to assess, in diabetic patients without diabetic retinopathy and control subjects, color vision, contrast sensitivity, electroretinography, and flicker-induced vasodilatation using the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer, in order to specify the earliest impaired retinal cells in diabetes, and gain more insight into diabetic retinopathy pathogenesis.
