(firstQuint)Ghrelin Regulation and Structure: Effect of Thiazolidinedione Therapy on Ghrelin.

 Insulin resistance suppresses fasting ghrelin levels and impairs postprandial ghrelin suppression.

 Improved insulin sensitivity with a thiazolidinedione will raise ghrelin levels, enhance meal-related suppression, but not change the ratio of total to active ghrelin or result in an alteration of ghrelin structure.

 Ghrelin Regulation and Structure: Effect of Thiazolidinedione Therapy on Ghrelin@highlight

The purpose of this study is to learn more about how insulin resistance (inability to process glucose correctly resulting in mildly elevated glucose levels) affects the hormone ghrelin.
