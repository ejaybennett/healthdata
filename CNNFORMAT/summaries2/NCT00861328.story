(fifthQuint)Safety Study of ON 01910.

Na in Combination With Irinotecan or Oxaliplatin.

 This is an open-label, 2-arm, dose-escalation combination-therapy study in which patients with advanced malignancies will be assigned by the Investigator to dosing with either irinotecan plus ON 01910.

Na (Group A), or oxaliplatin plus ON 01910.

Na (Group B).

 The Investigator will make this assignment using clinical judgment, taking into consideration the patient's tumor type, UGT1A1 genotype when applicable (i.

e.

, patients considered for treatment in Group A will be tested for UGT1A1 genotype, if not already known, and patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele will be excluded from Group A), prior treatment, and current clinical condition.

 Patients will be enrolled in 1 of 8 Cohorts (4 sequential Cohorts in Group A and 4 in Group B) of 3 patients each.

 Up to 6 additional patients will be tested at the MTD.

 Groups A and B will enroll and proceed simultaneously.

Na in Combination With Irinotecan or Oxaliplatin@highlight

Treatment of cancer is often improved if two or more drugs are used in combination.

 In animal studies, the use of the combination of ON 01910.

Na (a new, unapproved drug) and irinotecan or oxaliplatin (two approved and extensively used anti-cancer drugs) gave better results against tumor cells than the use of any of the single drugs alone.

 In addition, the use of the combinations did not result in an increase of side effects.

 This clinical trial will determine what is the highest dose of ON 01910.

Na that can be given safely in combination with either irinotecan or oxaliplatin in human patients.
