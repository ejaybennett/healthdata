(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy of TRO19622 as add-on Therapy to Riluzole Versus Placebo in Treatment of Patients Suffering From Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

 A stand alone treatment with TRO19622 is not acceptable for ethical reasons.

 Riluzole is an approved and widely used ALS treatment in the European community, in Japan and in the USA.

 Therefore, in this study, TRO19622 will be assessed as add-on to riluzole in patients suffering from ALS.

 At the start of the study, patients will be randomized to one of two groups : TRO19622 (330 mg QD or placebo (once a day).

 Each treatment will be administered for 18 months under double-blind conditions.

 The product under evaluation will be administered to patients receiving the standard of care for ALS, including riluzole.

 Riluzole dosage (50 mg bid) must be stable and well tolerated for at least one month prior to inclusion into the study.

 After the double-blind period, open-label administration of TRO19622 will be allowed for safety and survival assessments and until efficacy results are available.

 A separate open-label protocol will be written 6 months after the randomization of the last patient into the study.
