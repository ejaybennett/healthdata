(secondQuint)Significance of Duration of Maintenance Therapy With Rituximab in Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas.

 Results from several randomised studies show a clinical benefit of a maintenance therapy with rituximab in follicular lymphomas.

 The advantage of a maintenance therapy in other indolent and mantle cell lymphomas is - due to the lower incidence of these diseases- not well investigated.

 This study tries to determine the significance of an extended maintenance therapy with rituximab in follicular lymphomas and the significance of a maintenance therapy other indolent and mantle cell lymphomas compared to observation.
