(secondQuint)Blood Glycan Biomarkers in Women With Stage IV Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - To profile serum glycan biomarkers in women with metastatic stage IV breast cancer, healthy controls, and patients with noncancer medical illness.

 - To determine whether serial serum glycan biomarkers correlate with response of metastatic disease to treatment.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Blood is collected from patients with metastatic breast cancer, patients with noncancerous illness, and healthy volunteers.

 Samples are analyzed for serum glycan biomarkers by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and Fourier transform ion-cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT ICR MS) methods.

 Blood samples are collected every 3 months for up to 18 months from patients with metastatic breast cancer.

 Patients without cancer have a single sample collected.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood glycan biomarkers in women with stage IV breast cancer.
