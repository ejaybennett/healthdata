(thirdQuint)Gene Expression in Tissue From Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.

 OBJECTIVES: - Identify genes involved in specific biologic processes or molecular functions that contribute to the mechanisms by which the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase induces a leukemic phenotype using RNA banked from patients with BCR/ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) enrolled on ECOG-2993.

 - Compare patterns of mRNA expression of BCR/ABL fusion protein in patients with B-lineage ALL vs patients with ALL and no cytogenetic abnormalities enrolled on ECOG-2993.

 - Determine both shared and differing expression patterns in patients with BCR/ABL-positive and cytogenetically negative ALL with respect to achievement of complete remission and duration of disease-free and overall survival.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Total RNA is isolated from stored tissue samples and integrity is verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

 cDNA libraries are created from total RNA and gene expression is analyzed via microarray analysis.

 Genes of interest are further analyzed by flow cytometry and RT-PCR.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 137 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at gene expression in tissue from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in clinical trial ECOG-2993.
