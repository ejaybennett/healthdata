(secondQuint)Prognosis of Lung Transplant Candidates.

 The significance of assessing patient reported measurements including health status, dyspnea and psychological status has not been well investigated in the lung transplant candidates.

 Therefore, in the present study, we aim to examine (1) contributive factors to their health status based on baseline data, (2) whether patient reported measurements would predict patients' prognosis and (3) how they would change for 5 years as compared to physiological measurements.
