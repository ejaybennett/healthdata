(thirdQuint)Dutasteride With Tolterodine ER or Placebo to Treat Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS).

 Men who are treated with an alpha blocker (AB) or 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) for benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) often have symptoms including urinary frequency and urgency.

 ABs and 5-ARIs may improve the obstructive voiding symptoms but not necessarily the storage symptoms.

 This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of dutasteride 0.

5 mg once daily for 6 months in an open label fashion.

 Those patients who continue to report storage urinary symptoms, will be randomized to receive dutasteride 0.

5 mg once daily for an additional one year together with double-blind tolterodine ER 4 mg or matched tolterodine ER placebo once daily.
