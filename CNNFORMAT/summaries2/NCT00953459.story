(secondQuint)Sunitinib Malate in Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess the therapeutic activity of sunitinib malate in patients with either chemonaive extensive stage or sensitive relapsed small cell lung cancer.

 Secondary - To characterize the safety of sunitinib malate in these patients.

 Tertiary - To determine the potential of FDG-PET-scan to serve as a surrogate marker of response for the antiangiogenic activity of the compound.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to disease stage (chemonaive extensive stage vs sensitive relapse at least 3 months after stopping chemotherapy).

 Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography of the chest at week 4.

 Blood samples and bronchial washings and brushings may be collected at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks after start of therapy for further analysis.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

 Sunitinib Malate in Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib malate works in treating patients with small cell lung cancer.
