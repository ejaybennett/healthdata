(thirdQuint)Novel Method of Surveillance in Barrett's Esophagus.

 During an endoscopy done for clinical surveillance of your Barrett's Esophagus participants are randomized to one of three brush devices by random chance like a flip of a coin.

 This is being done to see if one collects more cells than the others.

 A soft brush will be used to collect cells from the lining of the esophagus, this is known as brush cytology.

 With the endoscope positioned in your esophagus, samples (biopsies) of lining of the esophagus will then be taken to determine the nature of the Barrett's mucosa in the same manner as for any patient undergoing routine surveillance endoscopy for Barrett's esophagus.

 A part of the specimen will be used to store tissue samples that can later be used.

This study is being done to see how biomarkers (abnormalities in molecules of cells ) present in their Barrett's esophagus agree with results from surveillance biopsies; and to compare three different brush devices used to collect cells to see which of these 3 brush devices obtains a higher number of cells.
