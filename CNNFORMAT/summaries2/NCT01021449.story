(thirdQuint)Epigenetic Regulation of BDNF in Schizophrenia.

 A total 160 subjects (80 subjects every year, including 40 healthy controls and 40 schizophrenia patients) will be recruited during a 2-year period.

 The first year, the baseline data of BDNF and Trk B DNA methylation, protein and mRNA levels in all subjects will be collected and the following 1 months data will also be collected in schizophrenia with antipsychotic drug treatments.

 The second year, the baseline data of BDNF and Trk B histone modification in all subjects will be collected.

 Epigenetic Regulation of BDNF in Schizophrenia@highlight

In this proposal, we will (1) detect the associations between BDNF and Trk B gene DNA methylation, histone modification, psychotic symptoms, obesity, suicide and antipsychotic drug responses in Taiwanese patients (2) discuss the possible mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of BDNF and Trk B in schizophrenia patients.
