(fifthQuint)Comparison of Tesio and LifeCath Twin Permanent Dialysis Catheters.

 Complications relating to dialysis access make up to 30% of admissions in haemodialysis patients.

 Comparative studies of complications between dialysis lines can help physicians and patients choose the best CVC type.

 In addition determining a type of dialysis line that can deliver good blood flows from the outset can minimise length of hospital stay for access creation.

 This study aims to perform a head-to-head comparison of two very similar (twin catheter) dialysis lines and examine short and long-term function as well as complication rates at our centre.

 Comparison of Tesio and LifeCath Twin Permanent Dialysis Catheters@highlight

This study aims to compare two available types of central venous haemodialysis catheters (lines) - CVCs, and will examine how easy they are to insert, complications, blood flow on dialysis over time, line loss, line clotting and infective events.

 It will examine whether the LifeCath type of CVC can deliver high blood flow rates from first use after insertion and equivalent function and complication rate to the Tesio type of CVC that is in use in our centre already.

 Complications relating to dialysis access make up 30% of admissions for haemodialysis patients and so this is a study that could benefit patients and their care providers.
