(fifthQuint)Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy After High Dose BEAM With or Without Rituximab.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Lenalidomide given in the post transplant setting for a 12 month maintenance period.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To obtain preliminary estimates of the 1-year response rate, event-free and overall survival using this regimen.

 OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of lenalidomide followed by a phase II study.

 PRE-CONDITIONING (patients with CD20+ non-Hodgkin lymphoma): Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) per standard of care.

 PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive carmustine IV on day -6, etoposide IV twice daily (BID) and cytarabine IV BID on days -5 through -2, and melphalan IV on day -1.

 AUTOLOGOUS HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo stem cell infusion on day 0.

 MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning approximately 100 days post-transplant, patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

 Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy After High Dose BEAM With or Without Rituximab@highlight

This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given after combination chemotherapy with or without rituximab and stem cell transplant and to see how well it works in treating patients with persistent or recurrent non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is resistant to chemotherapy.

 Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways.

 Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.

 Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them.
