(firstQuint)Is Doppler Necessary in Haemorrhoidal Artery Ligation Operation?.

 HALO (haemorrhoidal artery ligation operation) has proved to be a popular and effective treatment for bleeding piles.

 Currently the HALO is a Doppler guided procedure though when the Doppler mechanism does not function it has been noted that the results are similar.

 This prompts the question does the Doppler guide the operation to tie off the important vessels to shrink he piles, or can the vessels that underlie the visible piles be treated without Doppler.

 Professor Phillips from St.

Marks has reviewed the protocol and agrees that it is well designed and worthwhile.

 Is Doppler Necessary in Haemorrhoidal Artery Ligation Operation?@highlight

Haemorrhoidal artery ligation operation (HALO) is an operation that ties off vessels to piles.

 This study examines whether the ultrasound (doppler) is necessary to guide this tying off or not.
