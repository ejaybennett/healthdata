(thirdQuint)An ACE Inhibitor (Perindopril) or an Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (Candesartan) as a Treatment for Methamphetamine Dependence.

 Our preliminary data indicate that the ACE inhibitor perindopril can attenuate MA-induced drug craving, suggesting that perindopril should be evaluated as a treatment for MA dependence.

 Candesartan works similarly to perindopril but should lack the U-shaped dose response.

 Like perindopril, candesartan is used for hypertension.

 Whereas perindopril reduces the synthesis of angiotensin II, candesartan blocks angiotensin II receptors.

The primary objective is to determine the dose dependent effects of treatment with perindopril on methamphetamine (MA)-induced craving and on the reinforcing effects of MA indexed by MA self-administration.

 We will also determine the effects of treatment with candesartan on MA-induced craving and on the reinforcing effects of MA indexed by MA self-administration.
