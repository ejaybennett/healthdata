(fifthQuint)Bortezomib, Liposomal Doxorubicin Hydrochloride, Dexamethasone, and Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma That Relapsed After Autologous Stem Cell Transplant.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the 1-year survival of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib, liposomal doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate response rates in patients treated with this regimen.

 II.

 To evaluate the median time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

 III.

 To evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive bortezomib 1.

3 mg/m2 subcutaneously on days 1, 8, and 15; liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 4; oral dexamethasone 20mg on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16; and cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV over 2 hours on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples may be collected for future research.

 Patients complete the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) neurotoxicity questionnaire periodically.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.

 Bortezomib, Liposomal Doxorubicin Hydrochloride, Dexamethasone, and Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma That Relapsed After Autologous Stem Cell Transplant@highlight

This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with multiple myeloma that relapsed after autologous stem cell transplant.

 Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving bortezomib together with liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide may kill more cancer cells.
