(secondQuint)Ureteroscopy With and Without Safety Guidewire.

 The use of SGW is generally recommended at any ureteroscopic procedure in order to facilitate the introduction of the endoscope and to secure placement of internal tubes for drainage of urine after the procedure.

 However, SGW may be an obstacle to efficient disintegration and retraction of calculi in the narrow ureter.

 The intention of this study is to compare the results of endoscopic stone treatment with and without the use of SGW.
