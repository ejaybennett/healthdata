(thirdQuint)Effect of Aerobic Exercise on Side Effects of Disease Modifying Therapy With Subcutaneous Interferon-b1b in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis.

 Patient compliance with disease modifying treatment largely depends on relatively common side effects of such treatments such as fatigue.

 Regular exercise can potentially improve these side effects.

 However, Safety and effects of exercise has not been studied in patients with multiple sclerosis.

 Our main aim is to study the safety, tolerability and effects of exercise on side effects of subcutaneous interferon-b1b in patients with Multiple Sclerosis.

 Effect of Aerobic Exercise on Side Effects of Disease Modifying Therapy With Subcutaneous Interferon-b1b in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects and tolerability of exercise on side effects of injectable disease modifying treatments in multiple sclerosis.

 The investigators main hypothesis is that controlled exercise is safe and can be well tolerated in patients with multiple sclerosis and it can improve disease modifying treatment related side effects such as fatigue.
