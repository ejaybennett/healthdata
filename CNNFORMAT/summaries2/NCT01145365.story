(firstQuint)Study to Look at Benefit of Surgical Drainage Before Beginning Medical Therapy for Crohns Perianal Fistulas.

 Currently the importance of surgically established drainage of Crohn's perianal fistulas prior to medical therapy is controversial.

 Several retrospective studies have suggested a benefit to this approach.

 (1, 2) However, there have been no prospective studies performed to answer this important question.

 This study aims to definitively answer this question.

 Our hypothesis is that by establishing surgical drainage of all perianal fistulas and abscesses prior to initiation of medical therapy, further abscess formation will be prevented and the rate of durable fistula healing will improve.
