(firstQuint)Activity at 25% Above the Ventilation Threshold on Appetite and Food Intake in Boys.

 The effect of exercise (EXR) on short-term food intake (FI) and subjective appetite was investigated in normal weight (NW), boys were randomized into 4 treatments.

 Each boy consumed either a non-caloric sweetened control (CON) or GLU drink after either exercise (EXR) or sedentary activity.

 Subjects exercised at 25% above their ventilation threshold (VeT).
