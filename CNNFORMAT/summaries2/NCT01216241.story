(firstQuint)Daptomycin Versus Placebo in Patients With Neutropenia and Fever.

 To determine whether the percentage of neutropenic subjects that become afebrile by five days after fever first develops is higher when daptomycin compared to placebo is added at the same time as anti gram-negative therapy.

 The five day time point is selected because it is at this point where it is recommended to add antifungal therapy to the treatment regimen if the patient is still febrile.
