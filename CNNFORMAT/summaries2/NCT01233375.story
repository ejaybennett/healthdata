(firstQuint)Study to Evaluate Efficacy of CO-1.

01 as Second Line Therapy for Gemcitabine-Refractory Stage IV Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.

 Pancreatic tumors with low hENT1 expression may show less benefit from gemcitabine compared with those with higher expression of this nucleoside transporter.

 Nonclinical studies indicate that CO-1.

01, a gemcitabine derivative, is effective independent of such transporters.

 Thus patients with low or no meaningful expression of hENT1 who failed to respond to gemcitabine might derive benefit from CO1.

01 before needing alternative (combination) chemotherapy.

 Furthermore, the PK profiles of CO-1.

01 and gemcitabine are dissimilar and this may confer additional clinical benefit on CO1.

 Study to Evaluate Efficacy of CO-1.

01 as Second Line Therapy for Gemcitabine-Refractory Stage IV Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether CO-1.

01 is safe and effective for treating metastatic pancreatic cancer that did not respond to gemcitabine.
