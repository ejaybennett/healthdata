(thirdQuint)Intubation of Morbidly Obese Patients.

 A Clinical Trial, Comparing Glide Scope  With Fastrach TM.

 The number of obese people rises.

 Thus 25.

2% of Danish 9th graders are obese.

 As a result, surgery and anesthesia in obese patients becomes more frequent.

 Several potential problems related to anesthesia in this patient group exists, including airway management and sufficient oxygenation.

 Anaesthesia of obese patients are more likely to require intubation.

 In light of the foregoing, it is therefore important to find the methods that provide the fewest complications related to intubation.

 Therefore this study compare two instruments (Fastrach TM and GlideScope (R)) to find out which of the methods that provides the best airway management, measured primarily in time and numbers of intubation attempts.

 Intubation of Morbidly Obese Patients.

 A Clinical Trial, Comparing Glide Scope  With Fastrach TM@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the GlideScope (R) and the Fastrach TM for intubation of morbidly obese.

 Mainly we will try to clarify which of the instruments that produce the shortest intubationtime and lowest number of intubationattempts.

 The hypothesis is that intubation would be 1) quicker and 2) with the lowest number of attempts, using the GlideScope(R).
