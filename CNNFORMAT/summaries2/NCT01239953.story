(secondQuint)RIBS V (Restenosis Intra-stent of Bare Metal Stents: Paclitaxel-eluting Balloon vs Everolimus-eluting Stent).

 Treatment of patients with bare metal stent restenosis remains a major clinical and technical challenge.

 Currently, drug-eluting stents are widely used in the management of these patients.

 Recently, the value of the paclitaxel-eluting balloon in this clinical setting has been suggested.

 However, there is only scarce observational data on the value of this new balloon in patients with bare metal stent restenosis.

 This prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial will compare two different interventional strategies (namely, paclitaxel-eluting balloon vs everolimus-eluting stent) in the treatment of patients with bare metal stent restenosis.

 RIBS V (Restenosis Intra-stent of Bare Metal Stents: Paclitaxel-eluting Balloon vs Everolimus-eluting Stent)@highlight

Treatment of patients with bare metal stent restenosis remains a challenge.

 This study will assess which interventional strategy (paclitaxel-eluting balloon vs everolimus-eluting stent) is superior in the treatment of patients suffering from bare metal stent restenosis.
