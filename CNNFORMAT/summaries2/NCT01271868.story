(secondQuint)Study of Recombinant Factor IX Product, IB1001, in Previously Treated Pediatric Subjects With Hemophilia B.

 Primary Objective(s): To evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety (acute effects associated with infusions, and inhibitor development) and efficacy (breakthrough bleeding and control of hemorrhaging during prophylaxis) of IB1001 in previously treated pediatric subjects with hemophilia B.

 Acute effects are defined as adverse events (AEs) which occur within the first 72 hours after the administration of a study product.

 Secondary Objectives: 1.

 To obtain tolerance and compliance information on pediatric subject response to an intravenously delivered recombinant factor IX product , IB1001 2.

 To evaluate the safety of IB1001 during the 50 exposure days treatment course Investigators/Study Centers: This international study will be conducted at clinical sites located in the United States (USA), Europe, Mexico and India Phase of Development: Phase 3/4 Planned Sample Size: Up to 22 pediatric subjects (<12 years of age) will be enrolled in order to have 20 subjects complete the study.

 Study Duration: The study duration will be approximately 6 months per subject to include a minimum of 50 exposures to IB1001.

 Study Design: The study is a non-randomized, open label design that includes an initial pharmacokinetics evaluation in all participants, followed by six months (50 exposure days) of treatment.
