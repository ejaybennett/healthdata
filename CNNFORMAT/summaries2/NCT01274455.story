(fifthQuint)Gene Therapy of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.

 This is a gene therapy open non randomized phase I trial for advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.

 The protocol is based on the administration of increasing doses of a plasmid DNA pre-complexed to PEI (polyethylenimine - non-viral vector) that encodes two genes (somatostatin receptor subtype 2 named sst2 and deoxycitidine kinase :: uridylmonophosphate kinase named dck::umk) which exhibit complementary therapeutic effects.

 Both transgenes induce an antitumor bystander effect and render gemcitabine treatment more efficient.

 Intratumor injections of the gene therapy product (CYL-02) will be performed by transgastric or transduodenal route under endoscopic ultrasound guidance.

 Each injection will be followed standard gemcitabine IV administration every week (1000 mg/m2).

 Two intratumor injections of a same dose of CYL-02 will be administered at one month interval.

 Four increasing doses (125 mu g, 250 mu g, 500 mu g and 1 mg) will be tested by group of 6 patients.

 The primary objectives are: evaluation of local pancreatic and general tolerance; the secondary objectives are: possible tumor volume regression, secondary respectability, evaluation of transgene biodistribution.

 Gene Therapy of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma@highlight

Near 85% of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma are diagnosed with a locally advanced and/or metastatic unresectable tumor.

 In these patients chemotherapy (such as gemcitabine) is given as a palliative therapy.

 Aim of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility, tolerance and antitumor effect of repeated intratumoral injection of a gene therapy product (with antitumor and chemo sensitizing effects) combined with gemcitabine in patients with unresectable pancreatic carcinoma.
