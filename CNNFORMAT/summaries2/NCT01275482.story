(firstQuint)Effectiveness of Transverse Friction Massage in Latent Myofascial Trigger Points in Anterior Deltoid Muscle.

 The investigators divide in two groups.

 The investigators apply the TFM in similar way in both, but the investigators cause local twitch response (isolated contraction of muscle fibers containing the latent trigger points)just in one group.

 So the investigators want to know whether the effectiveness of this technique is due to those local twitch responses, comparing both groups.

 The investigators asses Strength, range of motion, and overall, pressure pain thresholds to evaluate the pain sensitivity progress.

 Effectiveness of Transverse Friction Massage in Latent Myofascial Trigger Points in Anterior Deltoid Muscle@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether Transverse Friction Massage (TFM) in Latent Myofascial Trigger points (MTrP) is more effective making this technique in two different ways.
