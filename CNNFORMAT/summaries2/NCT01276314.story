(fifthQuint)Evaluation of TNF- Blockade Effect in Patients With Severe Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions.

 Severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions, including Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome(SJS), Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) is a life threatening disease.

 There is no gold standard in the therapy of SCAR.

 Treatment with high dose systemic corticosteroids is controversial.

 Although there have been recent reports of success with various therapies such as plasmapheresis and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins, their efficacy is not yet proven.

 Assessment of these therapies is difficult because of their non-specific immunosuppressant or immunomodulating modes of action.

 Recent studies have shown evidence of the pathogenetic importance of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, suggesting a new therapeutic approach in selective blockade of TNF-a using specific antibodies.

 We report successful treatment TEN using monoclonal IgG anti-TNF-antibodies.

 The aims of this project are (1) to compare the effect of treatment between systemic steroid and anti-TNF-.

 Including skin healing time, beginning of re-epithelialization time, internal organ recovery time, mortality rate, adverse events and (2) to investigate the molecular mechanism of severe cutaneous adverse reaction after anti-TNF- treatment.

 Evaluation of TNF- Blockade Effect in Patients With Severe Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions@highlight

Severe skin adverse drug reactions can result in death.

 Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) has the highest mortality (30-35%); Stevens-Johnson syndrome and transitional forms correspond to the same syndrome, but with less extensive skin detachment and a lower mortality (5-15%).

 Hypersensitivity syndrome, sometimes called Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), has a mortality rate evaluated at about 10%.

 The aims of this project are (1) to compare the effect of treatment between systemic steroid and anti-TNF-.

 Including skin healing time, beginning of re-epithelialization time, internal organ recovery time, mortality rate, adverse events and (2) to investigate the molecular mechanism of severe cutaneous adverse reaction after anti-TNF- treatment.
