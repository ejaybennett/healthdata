(thirdQuint)Acute Heart Health Benefits of Whole Grain Barley and Oats in Healthy Men and Women.

 Whole grains contain bioactive components that may contribute to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, and there may be significant differences among whole grain sources with respect to ability to alter biomarkers of cardiovascular disease.

 This acute study is designed to determine if whole grain barley improves postprandial lipid metabolism and improves endothelial function.

 Further, we will determine if acute consumption of whole grain barley versus acute consumption of whole grain oats results in differential response with respect to biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk.

The objectives of this study are the following: 1) to determine the acute effect of whole grain barley on risk factors of cardiovascular disease compared to a diet low in whole grain, and 2) to compare the effects of whole grain barley to those of whole grain oats to determine if the response to these two grains is similar.
