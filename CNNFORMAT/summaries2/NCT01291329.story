(secondQuint)Intracoronary Human Wharton's Jelly- Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (WJ-MSCs) Transfer in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).

 It has been demonstrated that MSCs have the potential to differentiate into cardiomyocytes both in vitro and in vivo.

 Several clinical trials have been performed using autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs, but the results of these trials have been unsatisfactory because of a low number of MSCs in older patients and in those with coronary heart disease.

 WJ-MSCs from the human umbilical cord matrix which are of epiblastic origin and contain both human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and human mesenchymal stem cell markers appear to have a number of important advantages: they do not raise ethical issues, are widely multipotent, are not tumorigenic, and are not immunogenetic.

 Because of a short population doubling time they can be rapidly scaled up in large numbers.

 We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, randomly assigning 160 patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to receive an intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs or placebo medium into the infarct artery 4-7 days after successful reperfusion therapy.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of intracoronary human umbilical Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell (WJ-MSC) transfer in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction.
