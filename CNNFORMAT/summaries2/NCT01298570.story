(secondQuint)Regorafenib+FOLFIRI Versus Placebo+FOLFIRI as 2nd Line Tx in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

 This randomized (2:1 ratio), multi-center, placebo-controlled, phase II efficacy study is designed to compare progression-free survival (PFS) between regorafenib + FOLFIRI (5-fluorouracil + leucovorin + irinotecan [ARM A] versus placebo + FOLFIRI [ARM B]) in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) previously treated with a FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil + leucovorin + oxaliplatin) regimen.

 Secondary objectives include objective response (OR) rates, disease control (DC) rates, and overall survival (OS).

 A pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of irinotecan will be conducted in a subset of patients at selected sites.

 This trial also incorporates a number of exploratory analyses designed to evaluate potential correlations between blood and tissue biomarkers and clinical benefit.
