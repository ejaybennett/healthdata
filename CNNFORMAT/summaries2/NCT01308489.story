 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Length of operation (operating room [OR] time).

 II.

 Estimated blood loss (EBL).

 III.

 Complication rate.

 IV.

 Neurological preservation.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Motor strength and sensory level (neurological outcome).

 II.

 Bladder and bowel function.

 III.

 Post-operative pain.

 IV.

 Hospital length of stay (recovery time).

 V.

 Arthrodesis.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Patients undergo posterior spinal tumor resection on day 0.

 ARM II: Patients undergo anterior and posterior spinal tumor resection on day 0.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.

 Minimally Invasive Surgery in Treating Patients With Spinal Tumors@highlight

This randomized clinical trial studies minimally invasive surgery in treating patients with spinal tumors.

 Posterior spinal tumor resection and anterior and posterior spinal tumor resection are less invasive types of surgery for spinal tumors and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery
