(firstQuint)The Effect of Human Adipose Tissue-derived MSCs in Romberg's Disease.

 Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs) represent an attractive and ethical cell source for stem cell therapy.

 With the recent demonstration of MSC homing properties, intramuscular aplications of MSCs to cell-damaged diseases have increased.

 In a human clinical trial, five patients who had suffered a progressive hemifacial atrophy( Romberg's disease) were intramuscular administered autologous hAdMSCs (1*10e7 cells/500ul) with autologous microlipoinjection one time.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous transplantation of adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in patient with progressive hemifacial atrophy.
