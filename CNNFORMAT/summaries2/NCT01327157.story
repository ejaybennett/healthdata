(fifthQuint)Study of a New Technique to Improve the Symptoms of Orofacial Discomfort in Patients With Peripheral Facial Paralysis.

 Purpose: To evaluate the effects of the Neuro-Rehabilitation occlusion in patients with chronic facial palsy by observing the decrease of the symptoms of masticatory dysfunction.

 Methods: a selection of sixty-five patients with facial palsy (PFP 65) and idiopathic chronic trauma of the Otorhinolaryngology sector facial nerve disorders at UNIFESP.

 Patients were of both genders, aged between 18 and 60.

 They were analyzed according to the criteria of inclusion and exclusion, resulting in forty-three patients.

 However, due to problems inherent in research, a group of fourteen patients were randomized (sub-divided) into two groups: control and treatment.

 The visual analog scale was used at the first consultation to patients in the control and treatment All patients underwent a dental cleaning in order to blind the study.

 Seven patients belonged to the control group for three months, the VAS was performed in both groups.

 The control group was later reunited with the treatment group after three months of control period, increasing the number of patients who were examined in extracts, with similar features in a prognostic factor.

 - Control group - First visit-visual analogue scale and tooth cleaning - Second consultation, after a month, a new visual analog scale.

 - Third-query-one months after a new visual analogue scale patient was a three visits with an interval of one month, performing a repeat procedure.

 - Treatment group, The researchers applied the technique of Rehabilitation and Neuro Occlusal gnatostaticos models that were made before and after treatment to count the dental contacts.

 - First-query-visual analogue scale and tooth cleaning, intervention and preparation of initial models gnatostaticos - Second-query-after a month, a new visual analogue and intervention.

 - Last-query - visual analogue scale and making models gnatostaticos finals.

 The treatment group had one month to see changes in oral functions.

 Upon completion of the study patients continued to receive care in the ambulatory clinic of the university, but the attendance for this research was terminated.

 Study of a New Technique to Improve the Symptoms of Orofacial Discomfort in Patients With Peripheral Facial Paralysis@highlight

- The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of Neuro Occlusal Rehabilitation (RNO) in patients with peripheral facial palsy (PFP) disease, noting the decrease in symptoms of masticatory dysfunction.

 - According to Carvalho (2009) patients with PFP have chronic unilateral masticatory preference.

 Santos et al.

 (2009) in the same year noted that these conditions can lead to problems with temporomandibular disorder.

 - Hypothesis- known that performing occlusal adjustment in these patients with chronic PFP, ensuring a maximum of dental contacts and a final stop of the masticatory cycle stable, providing a balanced occlusion.

 - dental cleaning was performed in two groups for the blind study - visual analog scale -To assess the quality of the oral functions of these patients, the investigators applied the visual analog scale(VAS) and statistically evaluated the degree of satisfaction regarding the functions of oro facial in relation to mastication and temporomandibular dysfunction.

 - gnathostats models were made in the treatment group in the first and last query - occlusal adjustment in treatment group.

In the group treated occlusal adjustment was made in the teeth and applied a new (VAS) before and after treatment.

 The RNO, is defined as a part of medicine that operates in stomatology occlusal plane as a guide to a harmonious development of the face, chewing facilitating bilateral and alternating.

 (Planas, 1997).

 It works through selective grinding on the occlusal platform, providing an increased number of dental contacts.
