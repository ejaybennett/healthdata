(firstQuint)Effects of IGF-I in HIV Metabolic Disease.

 The main objectives of this study are the following: 1.

 Determine the effect of recombinant human insulin like growth factor-I (rhIGF-I) (generic: mecasermin) on subcutaneous adiposity in patients with HIV lipodystrophy syndrome.

 2.

 Determine the effects of rhIGF-I on glucose homeostasis and lipids in patients with HIV lipodystrophy.

 3.

 Determine the effects of rhIGF-I on apoptosis, mitochondria, and inflammation, in adipose tissue obtained from patients with HIV lipodystrophy.
