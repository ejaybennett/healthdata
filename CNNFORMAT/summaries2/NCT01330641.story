(thirdQuint)Accuracy of Needle Placement Into The Subacromial Space of The Shoulder.

 Patients with a diagnosis of rotator cuff tendonitis, having failed other non-operative measures, are offered an injection of steroid and local anesthetic to relieve their pain.

 This is standard treatment.

 In this study, patients are prospectively randomized to receive their injection by one of the three commonly used routes: anterior, posterior, or lateral.

 Accuracy of the injection is determined by including a small amount of contrast dye in the injection which will make the injection visible on post-injection radiographs.

 Accuracy of Needle Placement Into The Subacromial Space of The Shoulder@highlight

This study attempts to determine the most accurate route for injection of the subacromial bursa in patients with rotator cuff tendonitis.

 Typically, in medical practice, one of the routes of injection is used.

 It has not been determined if one route is superior, or if all routes are equal in delivering medication into the subacromial bursa, which sits on top of the rotator cuff tendons.
