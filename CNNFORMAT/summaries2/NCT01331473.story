(secondQuint)PROximal Protection VErsus NON-Protection in Carotid Artery Stenting.

 Primary Objective: The purpose of this study is to compare the rate of new ischemic brain injury detectable on MRI after carotid artery stenting between patients treated with proximal cerebral protection (Gore Flow Reversal System) and without cerebral protection.

 Secondary Objective: Impact of MRI-morphology of atherosclerotic plaque to the rate of new hyperintense diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) lesion on the post-treatment scan and to the rate of ipsilateral stroke or death.
