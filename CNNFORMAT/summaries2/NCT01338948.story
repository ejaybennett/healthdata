(secondQuint)Image-guided Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery Using Preoperative CT Scan for Gastric Cancer Patients.

 To assess the feasibility of image-guided surgery in patients with early stage gastric cancer using Robotic Surgery with Tile-pro program.

 For the assessment of the feasibility, conversion to open or laparoscopic surgery due to disturbance of will indicate the failure.

 Diagnosis of early stage gastric cancer -> CT scanning & EUS for staging -> (Registration) -> Robotic surgery with image reconstruction -> Conversion rate, Tumor location & vascular anatomy correlation.
