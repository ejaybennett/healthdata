(firstQuint)Sweat Duct Imaging in Mother/Newborn Dyads.

 In this exploratory study, the investigators propose to evaluate sweat duct number on the plantar surface of newborn infants using a non-invasive confocal microscopy device (Lucid Vivascope(R)).

 This approach has the potential to be valuable in repeated sweat endpoint assessments, as the device was selected based on its ease of use, the low risk to patients of all ages, and its ability to generate quantitative data.
