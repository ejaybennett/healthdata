(thirdQuint)Macronutrients and Gut Hormone Secretion.

 In healthy volunteers and subjects with dietary regulated diabetes mellitus, glucose, protein mixture or fat emulsion will be served individually and on a separate occasions a mixed meal will be served.

 Samples will be taken during the following 300 min.

 Concentrations of the gut hormones glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1, insulin and glucagon will be determined.

 Macronutrients and Gut Hormone Secretion@highlight

Study hypothesis is to examine the relative contribution of macronutrients for gut hormone secretion after a mixed meal in healthy volunteers and in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

 Individual macronutrients or a mixed meal will therefore be served and gut hormones are measured during the following 300 min.
