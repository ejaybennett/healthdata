(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Multiple Doses of CK-2017357 in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

 In Part A, approximately 24 patients will be randomized to one of four different treatment groups.

 After a 7-day washout of riluzole, patients in each treatment group will receive daily oral doses of placebo, 125 mg, 250 mg, or 375 mg of CK-2017357 for 14 days.

 Patients will take daily doses of CK-2017357 or placebo (Day 1 through Day 14) and will return to the study site on Day 2, Day 8 and Day 15.

 All patients will return for a follow-up visit 7 days ( 2 days) after their last dose.

 In Part B, approximately 24 patients will be randomized to one of four different treatment groups as in Part A.

 Patients in Part B will be required to decrease their riluzole dose to 50 mg once a day (QD) for 7 days prior to randomization.

 After this 7 day period, patients will take riluzole at 50 mg QD concurrently with their morning dose of blinded study drug.
