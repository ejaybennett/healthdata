(fifthQuint)Brentuximab Vedotin (SGN-35) in Patients With Mycosis Fungoides With Variable CD30 Expression Level.

 This phase 2 exploratory study will evaluate the clinical response of brentuximab vedotin in MF and SS, where tumor cells express variable levels of CD30 target molecule.

 The primary objective is to explore the biologic activity of brentuximab vedotin in patients with MF and SS, the most common types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), where expression of CD30 is variable.

 Brentuximab vedotin has significant biologic activity in Hodgkin's disease (HD) where only a small numbers of CD30 positive tumor cells are present, as well as in lymphomas with large numbers of CD30-expressing tumor cells such as systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL).

 The subject grouping by CD30 expression levels (low, intermediate, high) is for accrual purposes only, to ensure that a wide range of CD30 expression is studied.

The purpose of this study is to learn the effects of brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35), an investigational medication, on patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), specifically mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sezary syndrome (SS).

 Despite a wide range of therapeutic options, the treatments are associated with short response duration, thus this condition is largely incurable.

 This investigational drug may offer less toxicity than standard treatments and have better tumor specific targeting.
