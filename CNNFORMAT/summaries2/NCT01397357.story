(firstQuint)Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Utilities in the Evaluation of Ischemic Heart Disease.

 Assessing the accuracy of Cardio-RM identifying ischemic territories and their correspondence to the presence of critical coronary lesions, comparing the presence, extent and regional inducible ischaemia in the Cardiac-MRI with the presence and characteristics of vascular lesions in coronary angiography.

 In particular, the study aims to evaluate the correlation between topography and function of the ischemic area revealed by the resonance and coronary artery disease documented coronary angiography.
