(thirdQuint)African-American Pharmacogenetics.

 The investigators propose a pharmacogenetic cohort study of 100 African-American versus 100 Caucasian patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome, receiving clopidogrel or prasugrel and undergoing PCI.

 The study will have four arms: African-American on clopidogrel; African-American on prasugrel; Caucasian on clopidogrel; and Caucasian on prasugrel.

 All patients will undergo genotyping and platelet reactivity testing with the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, at least 6 hours after receiving a thienopyridine loading dose, but before hospital discharge.

 All patients will be treated with aspirin 325 mg/day as well.

 Race determination will be based on a patient's self-report, but patients enrolled in the trial must also report that all four of their grandparents were of the same race as theirs.

 Other races (Asian, Native American, et al) will be excluded from this study.

 African-American Pharmacogenetics@highlight

This is a genetic and platelet reactivity study of African-American versus Caucasian patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and receiving clopidogrel or prasugrel.

 The investigators aim is twofold: to describe differences in allele frequencies between African-Americans and Caucasians, and to explore associations of platelet reactivity and genetic polymorphisms in these two groups.
