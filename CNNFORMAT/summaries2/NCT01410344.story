(fifthQuint)Allogeneic Transplant in HIV Patients (BMT CTN 0903).

 The study is designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of reduced-intensity and fully-ablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for patients with hematological malignancies or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who have HIV infection.

 The goal of the study is to assess the 100 day Non-relapse Mortality as well as immunological reconstitution in this patient population.

 Where feasible, an attempt will be made to identify human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-compatible hematopoietic stem cell donors who are homozygotes for the delta32 mutation of the chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5delta32).

 Patients will undergo a treatment plan review prior to registration on the trial.

 All patients will undergo allogeneic HCT from a matched sibling or unrelated donor.

The rationale for this trial is to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of allogeneic HCT for patients with chemotherapy-sensitive hematological malignancies and coincident HIV-infection.

 In particular, the trial will focus on the 100-day non-relapse mortality as an indicator of the safety of transplant in this patient population.

 Correlative assays will focus upon the incidence of infectious complications in this patient population, the evolution of HIV infection and immunological reconstitution.

 Where feasible (and when this can be accomplished without compromise of either the donor quality or the timeliness of transplantation), an attempt will be made to identify donors who are homozygotes for the delta32 mutation for CCR5.
