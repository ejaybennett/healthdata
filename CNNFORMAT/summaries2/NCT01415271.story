(fifthQuint)3-Month Trial Observation of A1c Change.

 Purpose: This project will investigate the benefits (as measured by change in the primary outcome measure hemoglobin A1c) of bi-weekly reporting of blood sugar values for patients with type 2 diabetes in long term care facilities.

 Hypothesis: Our hypothesis is bi-weekly reporting will result in a reduction in A1c after 3 months.

 Justification: Elevated A1c values increase risk of health complications for people with type 2 diabetes.

 Objectives: Improved type 2 diabetes management for patients in long term care facilities.

 Research Methods: Patients who meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria and are interested in participating in the study will self-identify to the research coordinator.

 Consent will be done in person with any questions answered.

 Strips and blood glucose meters will be provided.

 Blood glucose values and testing frequency will be recorded using the internet reporting system Heath-e-Connect.

 HbA1c, serum creatinine and demographic data will be collected at 0 and 3 months to determine effect of bi-weekly remote communication of blood glucose with an endocrinologist.

 Statistical Analysis: HbAlc values at 0 and 3 months will be compared using an unpaired t-test to measure the effect of the intervention.

 3-Month Trial Observation of A1c Change@highlight

The incidence of type 2 diabetes in long term care facilities has been approximated at 25% with barriers to treatment including untimely access to a specialist and improper/poor adherence to insulin regimes.

 This 3 month trial will investigate the efficacy of improving overall glycemic control by using an internet blood glucose reporting system to facilitate bi-weekly consultations between long term care facility patients with type 2 diabetes and an endocrinologist.
