(secondQuint)Intensive Blood Pressure and LDL Lowering in Diabetic Patients With Coronary Artery Disease.

 Prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Asia seems to be almost epidemic and establishment of preventive strategy against macrovascular as well as microvascular diseases are warranted because of higher cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients even without history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.

 Benefit of lowering low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol down to 70 mg/ml in Caucasian patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) has been well established but not in Asian patients with lower risk of myocardial infarction and higher stroke risk.

 Intensive lowering blood pressure for cardiovascular outcome in diabetic patients and patients with CAD has been recommended in several guidelines without firm evidence.

 Risk and benefit of intensive blood pressure and LDL control should be evaluated in Japanese diabetic CAD patients by pragmatic randomized controlled trial.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether intensive blood pressure and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering could improve survival and cardiovascular outcome in Japanese diabetic patients with coronary artery disease and history of acute coronary syndrome.
