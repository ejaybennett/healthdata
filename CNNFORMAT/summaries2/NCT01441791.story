(fifthQuint)PROVHILO:Protective Ventilation During General Anesthesia for Open Abdominal Surgery.

 Research questions 1.

 Does mechanical ventilation with the use of higher levels of PEEP(Positive End Expiratory Pressure) and intra-operative RMs (Recruitment maneuvers) protect against pulmonary complications in patients at high or intermediate risk for postoperative pulmonary complications scheduled for non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery? 2.

 Does mechanical ventilation with the use of higher levels of PEEP and intra-operative RMs protect against extra-pulmonary complications in patients at high or intermediate risk for postoperative pulmonary complications scheduled for non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery? 3.

 Does mechanical ventilation with the use of higher levels of PEEP and intra-operative RMs shorten length of hospital stay of patients at high or intermediate risk for postoperative pulmonary complications scheduled for non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery? 4.

 Does mechanical ventilation with the use of higher levels of PEEP and intra-operative RMs ameliorate post-operative wound healing in patients at high or intermediate risk for postoperative pulmonary complications scheduled for non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery? 5.

 Does mechanical ventilation with the use of higher levels of PEEP and intra-operative RMs attenuate post-operative unexpected need for ICU admission (i.

e.

, before surgery the patient is not scheduled for admission to the ICU, but eventually is admitted) or ICU readmission in patients at high or intermediate risk for postoperative pulmonary complications scheduled for non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery? 6.

 Does mechanical ventilation with the use of higher levels of PEEP and intra-operative RMs influence intra-operative complications related to the ventilator strategy (i.

e.

, de-saturation, hypotension during recruitment, need for vasopressors) or ICU readmission in patients at high or intermediate risk for postoperative pulmonary complications scheduled for non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery? Methods In this international randomized controlled trial all patients with high or intermediate risk for post-operative pulmonary complications following non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery with general anesthesia are eligible for participation.

 To identify such patients the ARISCAT risk score is used.

 Patients are randomly assigned to mechanical ventilation with levels of PEEP at 12 cmH2O with the use of recruitment maneuvers (the lung-protective strategy) or mechanical ventilation with levels of PEEP at maximum 2 cmH2O without recruitment maneuvers (the conventional strategy).

 Patients are ventilated with a volume-controlled mechanical ventilation strategy.

 Although it is left to the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist to use different fractions of inspired oxygen, it is advised to use at least 0.

4, with the lowest oxygen fraction to maintain oxygen saturation 92%.

 The I:E ratio is set at 1:2, and the respiratory rate is adjusted to reach normocapnia (etCO2 between 35 and 45 mmHg).

 Tidal volumes of 0.

022 for each interim analysis.

 Blinding The patient is blinded for the allocated treatment during the trial.

 In the participating centers at least 2 investigators are involved with the study.

 One researcher is involved with mechanical ventilation practice in the operation room, he/she will be blinded for the randomized intervention most closely to the time of tracheal intubation (depending on local situation) - the second investigator, blinded for randomization arm, will score the primary and secondary post-operative endpoints.

 Data collection Data will be collected at inclusion pre-operatively, intra-operatively and post-operatively on day 1, day 2, day 3, day 4, day 5, day of discharge and on day 90.

 Data collection will be performed by an investigator blinded for the randomization group at the bedside, except on day 90 if the patient is discharged.

 In that case follow-up will be performed by telephone.

 Data will be coded by a patient identification number (PIN) of which the code will be kept safe at the local sites.

 The data will be transcribed by local investigators onto an internet based electronic CRF.

 Sample size calculation The required sample size is calculated from an estimated effect size derived from data collected in the ARISCAT study and previous studies on the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications.

 A two group 2 test with a 0.

05 two-sided significance level will have 80% power to detect the difference (in post-operative pulmonary complications) between conventional mechanical ventilation (24%) and open lung mechanical ventilation (16.

5%) (Odds ratio of 0.

626) when the sample size in each group is 450.

 Statistical analysis Normally distributed variables will be expressed by their mean and standard deviation; not normally distributed variables will be expressed by their medians and interquartile ranges; categorical variables will be expressed as n (%).

 In test groups of continuous normally distributed variables, Student's t-test will be used.

 Likewise if continuous data are not normally distributed the Mann-Whitney U test will be used.

 Categorical variables will be compared with the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact tests or when appropriate as relative risks.

 Where appropriate statistical uncertainty will be expressed by 95% confidence levels.

 Primary outcome is the total occurrence of pulmonary complications within the first 5 post-operative days, presented as a percentage.

 The percentage will be analyzed as continuous data.

 If the data is normally distributed, Student's t-test will be used or when not normally distributed the Mann-Whitney U test will be used.

 As this is a randomized controlled trial, we expect that randomization in this large study population will sufficiently balance the baseline characteristics.

 Baseline balance is tested and imbalance compensated in all pre-operative variables and on ARISCAT scores.

 However if imbalance occurs, the confounding factor will be corrected using a multiple logistic regression model.

 For this we will treat the proportion as a binary response (complications occur during day one to day five post-operative).

 Time to event variables (primary and secondary outcomes) are analyzed using a proportional hazard model adjusted for possible imbalances of patients' baseline characteristics.

 Time course variables (e.

g.

 repeated measures of vital parameters, blood values, VAS-scores, actual mobility) are analyzed by a linear mixed model.

 The linear mixed models procedure expands the GLM so that the data are permitted to exhibit correlated and non-constant variability.

 The model includes two factors: 1) study group (fixed factor, intervention or control group), each level of the study group factor can have a different linear effect on the value of the dependent variable; 2) time as a covariate, time is considered to be a random sample from a larger population of values, the effect is not limited to the chosen times.

 Organization The study is conducted by the PROVHILO collaboration.

 National co-ordinators will lead the project within individual nations and identify participating hospitals, translate study paperwork, distribute study paperwork and ensure necessary regulatory approvals are in place.

 They provide assistance to the participating clinical sites in trial management, record keeping and data management.

 Local coordinators in each site will perform randomization and mechanical ventilation, supervise data collection and ensure adherence to Good Clinical Practice during the trial.

 Study Population Adult patients with high or intermediate risk for postoperative pulmonary complications undergoing open abdominal surgery with general anesthesia.

 PROVHILO:Protective Ventilation During General Anesthesia for Open Abdominal Surgery@highlight

The purpose of this international, multicentre, double-blinded randomized controlled trial is to determine if the "open lung approach" providing recruitment maneuvers and PEEP(Positive End Expiratory Pressure) during general anesthesia reduces atelectasis formation and improves respiratory function in the immediate post-operative period after major abdominal surgery.

 Participating centres throughout the world will include a total of 900 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia for open abdominal surgery with high or intermediate risk for post-operative pulmonary complications.

 Patients are randomized and intra-operatively ventilated with either a lung protective strategy (PEEP at 12 cmH2O with recruitment maneuvers) or a conventional strategy (PEEP at maximum 2 cmH2O without recruitment maneuvers).

 Patients will be assessed on the first 5 post-operative days, on day of discharge and on day 90 post-operative.

 Primary endpoint is any post-operative pulmonary complication (see below).

 Secondary endpoints are post-operative extra-pulmonary complications, intra-operative mechanical ventilation related complications, unscheduled ICU (Intensive Care Unit) (re-) admission, and length of hospital stay.
