(firstQuint)The Use of the Prevena Incision Management System on Post-Surgical Cesarean Section Incisions.

 This is a randomized, open-label, single-center, Phase IV, comparative interventional study looking at the effect of the Prevena cent Incision Management System (PIMS) on Cesarean section Subjects compared to a control arm treated with a standard-of-care surgical incision dressing.

 The prospective, post-marketing clinical study described in this protocol will assess the effectiveness and functional performance of PIMS on closed incisions.

 Clinical outcomes of interest for this study are defined as Surgical Site Occurrences (SSOs) that include unanticipated local inflammatory response, prolonged drainage, fluid collection, dehiscence, and surgical site infection (SSI).

 This investigation will compare these outcomes to a control group consisting of Subjects screened for the same inclusion and exclusion criteria but treated with a standard-of-care surgical incision dressing.
