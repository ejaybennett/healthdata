1 Hypothesis Our hypothesis is that the addition of a 24-week treatment with boceprevir to standard antiviral therapy with Peg IFN and ribavirin will increase the rate of sustained virological response (SVR) in patients difficult to treat, such as HCV-positive women in post-menopausal women with genotype 1, not only those who have never been treated, but also in those who have not responded to previous treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin (Riba) Objectives Retreatment Primary objective Verify whether the sustained virological response (SVR defined as HCV RNA undetectable at 24 weeks of follow-up) in menopausal women with HCV CAH genotype 1 who have not achieved a sustained virological response with a previous treatment with PEG IFN/ribavirin may increase by at least 20% after treatment with PEG IFN alfa 2b and boceprevir (1.

5 mcg / kg QW) + Ribavirin (800-1400 mg / day) The primary efficacy endpoint, achieving SVR, will be evaluated with descriptive statistics (n,%) for each treatment arm.

 Secondary objective It is represented by evaluation of the percent of patients with early virological response (undetectable HCV RNA at weeks 2, 4, 8 or 12) that reach SVR.

 Naive patients Primary objective Verify whether SVR, defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks of follow-up may increase by at least 25% after treatment with PEG IFN alfa 2b plus ribavirin and boceprevir vs.

 PEG IFN alfa 2b plus ribavirin alone, in postmenopausal women with CHC genotype 1 not previously treated The primary efficacy endpoint, achieving SVR, will be evaluated with descriptive statistics (n,%) for each treatment arm.

 Secondary objective It is represented by evaluation of the percent of patients with early virological response (undetectable HCV RNA at weeks 2, 4, 8 or 12) that reach SVR.

 Boceprevir/PegIFN -2b/Riba in HCV+ Gt1 Menopausal Women, Nonresponders to PegIFN/Riba or Treatment-naives (MEN_BOC)@highlight

The cohort of post-menopausal women represents a group of very-difficult-to-treat patients in whom a more powerful approach is required in order to improve the disappointing response rate.

 Thus the addition, in patients with previous failure to PEG/RBV treatment or in naive patients, of a powerful drug like Boceprevir could greatly improve SVR rate as suggested by the results of SPRINT_2 trial in whom Boceprevir addition determined a 30% improvement in SVR rate in difficult gt 1 patients of African descent versus standard PEG IFN/Ribavirin therapy or by those of RESPOND-2 that showed the same percent improvement of RGT-retreatment with Boc/P/R of previous failure of standard therapy.

 Goal of the study is to verify whether the addition of a 24-week treatment with boceprevir to standard antiviral therapy with Peg IFN and ribavirin will increase the rate of SVR in patients difficult to treat, such as HCV-positive women in post-menopausal women with genotype 1, not only those who have never been treated, but also in those who have not responded to previous treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin (Riba).
