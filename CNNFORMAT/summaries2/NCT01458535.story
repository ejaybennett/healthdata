(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate Paritaprevir With Ritonavir (ABT-450/r) When Given Together With Ombitasvir and With and Without Ribavirin (RBV) in Treatment-Nave Participants With Genotype 1, 2 or 3 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV).

 This was a 2 sequential arm, combination treatment study where each arm contained 3 cohorts: one each for HCV genotype 1, 2, and 3.

 The study consisted of 2 phases, a treatment phase and a post-treatment phase.

 The treatment phase was designed to explore the antiviral activity, safety and pharmacokinetics of ABT-450/r dosed in combination with ABT-267 with and without RBV for up to 12 weeks.

 The post-treatment phase was designed to monitor and evaluate Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) 12, SVR 24, and the evolution and persistence of viral resistance to ABT-267 and ABT-450 in HCV genotype 1-, 2-, and 3-infected participants who have been exposed to ABT-267 and ABT-450/r.

 Arms 1 and 2 were enrolled sequentially.
