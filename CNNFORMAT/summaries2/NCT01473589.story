(thirdQuint)Effect of Teriparatide on Hip Fracture Healing.

 This is a 12-month, Phase 3, prospective, randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multinational study to evaluate the effect of 6 months of treatment with teriparatide on fracture healing in participants who have sustained a recent low-trauma, unilateral, femoral neck fracture stabilized by internal fixation.

 The study has 3 periods: 1.

 A screening period that must be completed in 14 days after operative treatment of the femoral neck fracture 2.

 A 6-month double-blind treatment period [teriparatide 20 mu g or placebo given once daily by SC injection] 3.

 A 6-month observation period.

 The primary objective is to assess the effect of 6 months of treatment with teriparatide 20 mu g/day versus placebo on the proportion of men and postmenopausal women of at least 50 years of age with no revision surgery 12 months after internal fixation of a low-trauma femoral neck fracture.

 All participants will receive supplements of calcium and vitamin D beginning at screening and continuing for 12 months.

 Effect of Teriparatide on Hip Fracture Healing@highlight

The purpose of this study is to see whether teriparatide, given for 6 months versus placebo, will improve the healing of hip (femoral neck) fractures that are repaired during surgery using certain types of orthopedic screws.

 The study will enroll men and postmenopausal women at least 50 years of age with a recent hip (femoral neck) fracture caused by low-trauma (for example, fall from standing height or less).
