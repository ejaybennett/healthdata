(fifthQuint)Concurrent Nab-P/Carboplatin and Thoracic Radiotherapy in Squamous Cell Lung Cancer.

 This study was conducted to explore the efficacy and toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin and thoracic radiotherapy in unresectable local advanced squamous cell lung cancer.

 Patients will be given nab-paclitaxel weekly at a dose of 60mg/m2, in combination with carboplatin (AUC 2) weekly during concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

 Thoracic radiation was administered at a dose of 66 Gy/33 fractions, both 3 dimensional conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy are allowed.

 Two cycles of consolidation therapy with full dose nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m2 on day 1) and carboplatin (AUC 6 on day 1) every 21 day will be delivered.

 Concurrent Nab-P/Carboplatin and Thoracic Radiotherapy in Squamous Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

Nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin showed better treatment response compared with cremophor-based paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line therapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, especially for squamous cell cancer.

 The regimen of weekly nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin and concurrent radiotherapy was well tolerated in a phase I study.

 Given nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin and concurrent radiotherapy in patients with local advanced squamous cell lung cancer may have promising result.
