(secondQuint)Evaluation of Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) During Propofol/Remifentanil and Sevoflurane/Remifentanil Anesthesia.

 Monitoring Antinociception during general anesthesia is still a big challenge in the field and has not become clinical routine yet.

 Recently, for the Surgical Pleth Index SPI a benefit for the patient in terms of reduction of remifentanil use, less unwanted effects and shorter recovery from anesthesia was reported.

 However, there are new variables like the ANI that are developed to measure antinociception during anesthesia.

 In the present study the investigators want to evaluate, whether ANI detects a painful tetanic stimulus during general anesthesia using propofol or sevoflurane and different concentrations of remifentanil.

The aim of this prospective randomized study was to evaluate the ability of the new Analgesia Nociception Index ANI, derived by heart rate variability, to detect painful stimulation during either propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia and changing remifentanil concentrations.
