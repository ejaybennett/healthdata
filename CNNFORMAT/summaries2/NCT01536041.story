(fifthQuint)A Placebo and Active Controlled Study of ONO-6950 in Asthmatic Patients.

 The study will examine if ONO-6950 could alleviate EIB in asthmatic patients.

 Eligible patients will complete a randomized, double-blind, four-way crossover study.

 During each of four evaluation periods, patients will be administered a single dose of either 20 or 200 mg ONO-6950, 10 mg Montelukast, or placebo.

 Each evaluation period include various assessments following exercise challenge in an ambulatory setting.

 A Placebo and Active Controlled Study of ONO-6950 in Asthmatic Patients@highlight

The primary objectives of this study are: i.

 to determine the effect of single oral doses (20 and 200 mg) of ONO-6950 versus placebo on exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) as percent attenuation in the decrease of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) after exercise challenge ii.

 to determine the safety and tolerability of single dose administrations of 20 and 200 mg of ONO-6950 in asthmatic patients.

 The secondary objectives of this study are: i.

 to compare the effect of different (20 and 200 mg) single oral doses of ONO-6950 versus montelukast (10 mg) on EIB as percent attenuation in the decrease of FEV1 after exercise challenge ii.

 to determine the ratio of responders/non-responders in FEV1 for different (20 and 200 mg) single oral doses of ONO-6950 in comparison to montelukast (10 mg) and placebo.
