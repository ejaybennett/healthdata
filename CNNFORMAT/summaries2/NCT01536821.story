The PROGENI Family Study is part of a larger consortium that is studying a gene shown to be important in Parkinson's disease, called LRRK2.

 People who have a defect in the LRRK2 gene will often develop Parkinson's disease.

 Eligible participants will be asked to complete a single Study Visit at an affiliated research facility closest to their home.
