(secondQuint)Observatory: Search for Prognostic Factors of Pulmonary Hypertension Post-capillary in Heart Failure.

 Patients with heart failure (HF) frequently have a post-capillary pulmonary hypertension (HTPcap) which has two forms: passive and reactive.

 The prognosis, prevalence and pathophysiological mechanisms of cell and tissue involved in the onset and reversibility of these two forms of HTPcap remain poorly understood.

 The latest recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology and the European Respiratory Society identify two forms of HTPcap in the IC as a function of the extent of trans-pulmonary gradient (GTP) measured during right heart catheterization (GTP = mPAP-Pcap): passive (GTP 12mmHg) and reactive (GTP> 12mmHg).

 In the latter form, the increase in pulmonary pressure would be disproportionate to the increase in left ventricular pressures.

 This study will permit to identify hemodynamic prognostic markers of the the IC, and clinical, biological and hemodynamic determinants of the HTPcap in the IC.

 This will help to identify a population that could benefit from specific treatment to referred pulmonary artery.

This study will better understand the post-capillary pulmonary hypertension in heart failure, to determine its prognostic role and to consider specific treatment of different forms of pulmonary hypertension in post-capillary pulmonary heart failure.
