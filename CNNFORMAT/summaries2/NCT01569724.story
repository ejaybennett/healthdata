(thirdQuint)Carbohydrate Metabolism Disorder Frequency in Hypertriglyceridemia Induced by Bexarotene of Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma.

 Primary cutaneous lymphomas are the second group of extra nodal lymphomas after gastrointestinal lymphomas.

 Bexarotene is licensed for the treatment of epidermotropic cutaneous T cell lymphoma .

The most common side effect of bexarotene is hypertriglyceridemia (82%) associated with hypercholesterolemia (30 to 40%).

 Central hypothyroidism is also present in 40-80% of cases.

 These adverse effects are dose-dependent.

 The management of hyperlipidemia induced by bexarotene is difficult.

 The mechanism of lipid disorder induced by bexarotene is not well known.

 Associated carbohydrate metabolism disorder could be present and play a role in the bexarotene-induced hyperlipidemia.

 The main objective is to estimate the frequency of a carbohydrate disorder in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (TG> 1.

5 g / L) induced by bexarotene treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, previously free of diabetes, thyroid dysfunction and dyslipidemia.

 Carbohydrate Metabolism Disorder Frequency in Hypertriglyceridemia Induced by Bexarotene of Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma@highlight

Bexarotene is a RXR-selective retinoid, licensed for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma.

 The most frequent adverse effect is hypertriglyceridemia but its mechanism is not well known.

 The purpose of this study is to research a carbohydrate metabolism disorder associated in bexarotene-induced hypertriglyceridemia.
