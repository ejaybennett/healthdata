(fifthQuint)A Single Rising Dose Study of MK-8150 (MK-8150-001).

 Up to three planned panels (A, B and C) of either 8 healthy participants or 8 participants with mild to moderate hypertension will be enrolled.

 For Panel A and Panel B, dosing will occur in an alternating fashion between Panel A and Panel B with dosing commencing in Panel A.

 Participants will receive alternating single rising oral doses of MK-8150 or placebo in up to 5 treatment periods (Periods 1 through 5).

 Subsequent doses in any Panel will be administered only after careful evaluation of safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic effects of a given dose.

 For Panel C, participants will receive single rising oral doses of MK-8150 or placebo in up to 5 treatment periods (Periods 1 through 5).

 Depending on safety, tolerability and hemodynamic effects observed in the healthy participants, Panels A and/or B may be truncated and dosing may proceed in Panel C with hypertensive participants.

 In this case, dosing of hypertensive participants in Panel C will start with the second highest dose achieved in healthy participants.

 Amendment 1 of the protocol added Panel D (healthy males) based on the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety results from Panels A-C.

 Participants in Panel D will receive single rising oral doses of MK-8150 or placebo in up to 5 treatment periods (Periods 1 through 5) at a dose range of 50 mg to 500 mg of MK-8150.

 Each treatment period will be approximately 3-4 days apart.

 A Single Rising Dose Study of MK-8150 (MK-8150-001)@highlight

This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of MK-8150 and its effect on central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) and heart rate corrected augmentation index (AIx) when given as single oral doses in healthy males and in males with mild-to-moderate hypertension.

 A primary study hypothesis is that post dose mean change from baseline of time-weighted average across 24 hours (TWA0-24hrs) cSBP or AIx is reduced in participants administered MK-8150 compared to placebo in males with mild to moderate hypertension.

 A mean decrease from baseline compared to placebo of 5 mm Hg in TWA0-24hrs cSBP or of 5 percentage points in TWA0-24hrs AIx is considered clinically meaningful.
