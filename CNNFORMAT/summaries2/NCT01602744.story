(thirdQuint)The Use of STOPP/START Criteria for Medication Intervention Among Elderly Population Living in a Geriatric Hospital.

 Inappropriate prescribing is common in older people and is associated with adverse drug effects,hospitalization and falls.

 In this trial we want to check the efficacy of the screening tools STOPP/START which were developed and validated in order to reduce inappropriate prescribing.

 STOPP comprises of 65 indicators of drug-drug, drug-disease interactions and therapeutic duplication.

 START incorporates 22 evidence based indicators of common prescribing omissions.

 We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that screening the medications of older patients living permanently in a geriatric hospital will improve their quality of life.

 The compliance of the doctor working in the geriatric hospital to the recommendations of the screening tools will also be checked.
