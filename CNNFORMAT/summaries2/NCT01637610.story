(thirdQuint)Detection of PPROM With AmniSure PAMG-1 Rapid Immunoassay.

 Prior studies of AmniSure have included a heterogeneous population of women with preterm and term pregnancies.

10-12 No study to date has specifically addressed and been powered to detect the efficacy of AmniSure in pregnancies between 16+0 and 36+6 weeks.

 The objective of the proposed research is to evaluate the usefulness of AmniSure PAMG-1 rapid immunoassay in the evaluation of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) compared to standard detection of PPROM with a speculum examination for combination of pooling, nitrazine and ferning.

 Detection of PPROM With AmniSure PAMG-1 Rapid Immunoassay@highlight

The investigators will test the hypothesis that in a preterm population with a gestational age of 16+0 and 36+6 weeks AmniSure PAMG-1 rapid immunoassay will be more accurate than conventional methods (speculum examination for combination of pooling, nitrazine and ferning) for the detection of Preterm Prelabour Rupture of Membranes (PROM).
