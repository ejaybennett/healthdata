(thirdQuint)Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome in Myopes.

 A retrospective study of 5753 eyes of cataract surgery patients was conducted at investigators Clinic in a period of 2.

5 years.

 Pseudoexfoliation syndrome was found in 255 eyes.

 There were only 26 cataract myopic eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome.

 Refractive eye state was defined by preoperatively calculated emmetropization intraocular lens (IOL) value done by optical low coherence reflectometry biometer LENSTAR LS 900(R).

 Ocular optical components of the cataract myopic eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome measured by this biometer were put in comparison with matched cataract myopic eyes group without pseudoexfoliation syndrome that have emmetropization IOL value within the same range as the cataract myopic eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome.
