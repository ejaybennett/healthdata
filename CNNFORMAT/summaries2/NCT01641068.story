(fifthQuint)Memory and Thinking Skills Workshop to Improve Cognition in Gynecologic and Breast Cancer Survivors With Cognitive Symptoms.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To objectively assess changes in cognitive performance and quality of life (QOL) pre and post participation in a cognitive rehabilitation intervention in gynecologic and breast cancer survivors who have undergone chemotherapy.

 II.

 To measure changes in neural function as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal and corresponding behavioral responses while performing cognitive tasks.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM I (Skills workshop): Patients participate in a memory and thinking skills workshop once weekly for 7 weeks.

 Patients complete cognitive tests and questionnaires at pre-baseline (Visit 1), baseline (Visit 2), and 7 weeks (Visit 3).

 ARM II (Education workshop): Patients participate in education workshop for 7 weeks 1-hour duration group focusing on the brain and cognition.

 Patients complete cognitive tests and questionnaires at pre-baseline (Visit 1), baseline (Visit 2), and 7 weeks (Visit 3).

 Memory and Thinking Skills Workshop to Improve Cognition in Gynecologic and Breast Cancer Survivors With Cognitive Symptoms@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine thinking abilities, mood, and quality of life in cancer survivors before and after an 8-week group-based memory and thinking skills workshop.

 Research participants will include people treated for cancer in the past.

 Researchers would like to know if there is a relationship between baseline performance on timed attention and memory tasks before receiving memory and thinking skills workshop designed to improve cognition, and performance on such tasks after the workshop.
