(fifthQuint)"Phase II Study of PET Guided Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC) and Oncotype Guided Hormonal Therapy of Breast Cancer".

 Treatment propose of TEC-NAX for the triple negatives and for the Her2+ cases.

 For the Er+/Her2- cases, we propose to use the PET scan to guide therapy after the first course of TEC.

 Those who drop in SUV5%, will have their treatment modified by using the Oncotype test.

 Those Her2 negative patients whose response to the first 4 courses of induction TEC is less than a complete remission, will have their tretment changed to a second line regimen, Navelbine-Avastin-Xeloda(NAX), with the intention of capturing a better response prior to surgery.

 Those who are Her2+ will initially also receive TEC but subsequent therapy will include Trastuzumab(Herceptin) whether thet respond wellor not to TEC.

 "Phase II Study of PET Guided Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC) and Oncotype Guided Hormonal Therapy of Breast Cancer"@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel neoadjuvant regimen for invasive breast carcinoma by using the MD Anderson residual cancer burden score.

To prospectively evaluate the utility of the PET scan to guide the neoadjuvant treatment and the utility of the Oncotype test as a stratifier for treatment decisons in ER+/Her2- patients.

 To evaluate the clinical anti-tumor activity of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in ER+/Her2 negative patients.

 To evaluate the prognostic factors associated associated with pathological response as measured by the residual cancer burden tool.
