(fifthQuint)Cisplatin and Etoposide With or Without Veliparib in Treating Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer or Metastatic Large Cell Neuroendocrine Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of veliparib to use in combination with cisplatin and etoposide (CE).

 (Phase I) II.

 To determine whether the addition of ABT-888 (veliparib) to cisplatin etoposide (CE) results in improved progression free survival (PFS) over CE with placebo in the frontline therapy of newly diagnosed extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

 (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the overall survival (OS) associated with the combination of CE plus ABT-888.

 (Phase II) II.

 To assess the overall response rate (ORR) as well as complete response rate (CRR) associated with the combination of CE plus ABT-888.

 (Phase II) III.

 To determine the toxicity profile of the combination of ABT-888 and CE chemotherapy in this patient population.

 (Phase II) IV.

 To conduct exploratory correlative analysis of the impact of the select biomarkers.

 (Phase II) V.

 To compare the overall toxicity profile and specifically the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy with the addition of ABT-888 to CE.

 (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib followed by a phase II study.

 Phase I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7, etoposide intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Phase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM A: Patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-7, etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 ARM B: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-7, etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

 Cisplatin and Etoposide With or Without Veliparib in Treating Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer or Metastatic Large Cell Neuroendocrine Non-small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together with or without cisplatin and etoposide and to see how well they work in treating patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer or large cell neuroendocrine non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Giving cisplatin and etoposide with or without veliparib may work better in treating patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer or metastatic large cell neuroendocrine non-small cell lung cancer.
