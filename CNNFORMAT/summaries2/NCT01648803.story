(thirdQuint)Wearable Movement Sensors for Assessing Motor Impairments and Dyskinesias in Parkinson Disease.

 Patients with Parkinson disease and motor fluctuations will wear movement sensors during their regular clinic visit with the principal investigator.

 The visit will be videotaped and medication status (ON without dyskinesia, ON with dyskinesia, or OFF) will be independently rated from review of the video.

 Wearable Movement Sensors for Assessing Motor Impairments and Dyskinesias in Parkinson Disease@highlight

The purpose of this study is to measure motor fluctuations and dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease using movement sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) to determine if this is a feasible measure to use in addition to self report, and eventually the goal will be to replace self report with a more reliable measure such as movement sensors.
