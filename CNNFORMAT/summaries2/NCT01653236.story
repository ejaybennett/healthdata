(secondQuint)Boceprevir With Peginterferon Alfa-2b and Ribavirin in the Treatment-naive Patients Infected With Genotype 4 Chronic Hepatitis C Infection.

 Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Boceprevir 800 mg three times per day (TID) orally (PO) (hereafter called Boceprevir) in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b 1.

5 1/2g/kg once per week (QW) subcutaneously (SC) plus weight-based dosing (WBD) of ribavirin (800 to 1400 mg/day) compared to standard of care (SOC) (therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b (PEG)+ribavirin (RBV) WBD) in previously untreated adult subjects with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 4 infection.

 Primary Trial Objectives: - The primary efficacy objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Boceprevir in combination with PEG 1.

5 1/2g/kg QW SC plus WBD of RBV (800 to 1400 mg/day) compared to the efficacy of SOC (therapy with PEG+RBV WBD) in the Control Arm in previously untreated adult subjects with CHC genotype 4 infection.
