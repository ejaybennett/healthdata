 Diabetes Outcomes and Nurse Case Manager Study@highlight

This study will examine whether patients with diabetes who are either 1) newly discharged from hospital or 2) referred to an endocrinologist for management will have better diabetes outcomes when their care is managed primarily by a dedicated case manager (intervention) than by an endocrinologist (standard care) after 6 months of treatment.
