(fifthQuint)Bronchodilating and Bronchoprotective Effects of Deep Inspirations.

 Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by eosinophilic airway inflammation.

 Individuals with classic asthma experience paroxysmal symptoms including cough, wheeze, shortness of breath and chest tightness.

 Cough variant asthma (CVA) is asthma in which chronic cough (cough lasting eight weeks or more) is the sole or predominant symptom of asthma.

 The pathophysiologic mechanisms which differentiate asthma, CVA, and eosinophilic bronchitis without asthma are not fully understood.

 We have recently identified individuals with chronic cough who cough during methacholine but have normal airway sensitivity (ie.

 do not have asthma or CVA) and may or may not have eosinophilic bronchitis.

 The purpose of this research is to examine the pathophysiologic differences between three causes of chronic cough: asthma, cough variant asthma and methacholine-induced cough with normal airway sensitivity.

 The responses in healthy normal subjects are crucial to understand the clinical relevance of methacholine-induced cough with normal airway sensitivity.

 Bronchodilating and Bronchoprotective Effects of Deep Inspirations@highlight

The objectives of this research are to compare (i) the bronchodilating and (ii) the bronchoprotective effects of deep inspirations (DIs) in individuals with: (a) asthma, (b) CVA, (c) methacholine-induced cough but normal airway sensitivity and .

 (d) in healthy individuals (without asthma, chronic cough or asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness).

 Hypotheses: i.

 The bronchodilating effect of a DI will be: (a) absent or impaired in individuals with classic asthma; (b) impaired in individuals with CVA; (c) preserved in individuals with methacholine-induced cough but normal airway sensitivity; and (d) preserved in healthy individuals (without asthma, chronic cough or asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness).

 ii.

 The bronchoprotective effect of a DI will be: (a) absent in individuals with classic asthma; (b) impaired in individuals with CVA; (c) preserved in those with methacholine-induced cough but normal airway sensitivity; and (d) preserved in healthy individuals (without asthma, chronic cough or asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness).

 iii.

 Healthy individuals without asthma, chronic cough, or asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness, will not cough, or develop significant dyspnea, small airways obstruction or dynamic hyperinflation during high-dose methacholine bronchoprovocation.
