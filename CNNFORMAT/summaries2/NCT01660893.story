(firstQuint)Comparison of Intranasal Kovacaine Mist, Tetracaine Alone, and Placebo for Anesthetizing Maxillary Teeth.

 The study will employ a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups design to assess the safety and efficacy of Kovacaine Mist delivered intranasally for inducing pulpal anesthesia of maxillary teeth numbers 4 to 13 (maxillary right second premolar to maxillary left second premolar) sufficient to allow completion of the Study Dental Procedure.

 A total of 140 subjects, randomized 2:2:1 (Kovacaine Mist:Tetracaine alone:Placebo) will be enrolled to achieve 125 completed subjects; a total of 50 Kovacaine Mist subjects, 50 tetracaine alone subjects and 25 placebo subjects.

 Recruitment will be from diverse dental patient populations.

 At the two study sites, a balanced enrollment of 70 subjects each is planned to allow for a potential 10% drop-out rate.
