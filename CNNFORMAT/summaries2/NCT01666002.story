65 Millisecond Pulsed Nd:YAG 1064 nm Laser.

 Current antifungal treatments have low cure rates and numerous side effects.

 A new treatment method, pulsed laser, has been purported to have high rates of treatment in a much shorter time frame than other treatments.

 While the treatment method has become increasingly popular, studies of its efficacy are few.

 The investigators hope to learn the cure rate of a novel treatment that is being used by more and more patients.

 This knowledge will be essential to physicians as they consider employing this new technology in their treatment methods.

The investigators would like to test the treatment of onychomycosis using a 0.

65 millisecond pulsed 1064 nm laser fitted with a special onychomycosis handpiece.

 The investigators will compare the success rates of those receiving laser treatments with untreated patients.

 This study will provide a clinical basis for determining the relative effectiveness of an increasingly utilized treatment method.
