(secondQuint)Are There Protective Effects of Antioxidants, Calcium Channel Blocker and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Against Extracorporeal Shockwaves Lithotripsy Induced Renal Injury?.

 The protective effect will be evaluated via estimation of the changes in renal tubular enzyme (NGAL) and detection of albumen levels in urine.

 The mechanisms of protection will be investigated by estimation of renal perfusion and functional changes using dynamic MRI.

 Are There Protective Effects of Antioxidants, Calcium Channel Blocker and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Against Extracorporeal Shockwaves Lithotripsy Induced Renal Injury?@highlight

This study will be conducted to evaluate the protective effects and mechanisms of antioxidants (vitamins A, C, E and Selenium), calcium channel blocker (Verapamil) and angiotensin receptor blocker (Lozartan) against shock wave induced renal injuries.
