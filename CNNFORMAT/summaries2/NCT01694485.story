(fifthQuint)AMG 181 Phase 2 Study in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis.

 Title: A Randomized, Double blind, Multiple Dose Placebo Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of AMG 181 in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis Study Phase: 2 Indication: Ulcerative colitis (UC) Primary Endpoint: Remission at week 8 defined by a total Mayo Score , 2 points, with no individual subscore > 1 point Key Secondary Endpoints: cent Response at week 8 as defined by a decrease from baseline in the total Mayo Score of >3 points and >30%, with an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of >1 point or an absolute subscore for rectal bleeding of 0 or 1 cent Mucosal healing at week 8 as defined by an absolute subscore for rectosigmoidoscopy of 0 or 1 Safety Endpoints: cent Adverse events cent Serious adverse events cent Significant changes in laboratory values and vital signs cent Sample Size: 360 Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria: Subjects must have a diagnosis of UC > 3 months, with moderate to severe disease activity at time of enrolment based on a total Mayo Score of 6 to 12 and a minimum rectosigmoidoscopy subscore of >2.

 Subjects must have demonstrated an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to immunomodulators or anti-TNF agents, or to corticosteroids (non-US sites only).

.

 Subjects may continue on stable doses of protocol specified medications to treat UC.

 A maximum of approximately 50% of subjects with any prior anti-TNF agent use will be allowed in the study.

 Subjects must have a neurological exam free of clinically significant, unexplained signs and symptoms at screening and no clinically significant change prior to randomization.

 In addition, subjects must be free of concurrent medical conditions at study entry as described in the protocol.

 If applicable, female subjects must be willing to use two highly effective methods of birth control or one highly effective and one effective method of birth control during the study.

 Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration: Investigational Product will be administered subcutaneously.

 During the 24 week double blind placebo controlled period, subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo or a selected dose of AMG 181 per protocol using repeated injections until week 24.

 During the open label period, all subjects will receive AMG 181 per protocol using repeated injections.

 Control Group: The double blind period (the first 24 weeks) will be controlled.

 During this period, the control group will receive placebo.

 AMG 181 Phase 2 Study in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis@highlight

This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multiple dose study to evaluate the efficacy of AMG 181 compared with placebo as measured by the proportion of subjects in remission (total Mayo Score 1 point) at week 8.

 After completing all screening assessments and meeting all eligibility criteria, subjects will be randomized to receive placebo or AMG 181 at various doses per protocol.

 A maximum of approximately 50% of subjects with any prior anti-TNF agent use will be allowed in the study.

 At the end of the double blind period, subjects will enter an open label period during which all subjects will receive open label AMG 181 at a single dose level according to protocol.

 Subjects who failed to achieve a response at week 8 and also have an inadequate response at week 12 or after are eligible to enter the open label period of the study early.

 Subjects who achieved response and/or remission at week 8 and subsequently experience disease worsening are eligible to enter the open label period early ONLY if a confirmatory rectosigmoidoscopy confirms disease severity as defined by protocol.

 Subjects that complete the open label period or early terminate from the study will enter the 2 year safety follow up period.
