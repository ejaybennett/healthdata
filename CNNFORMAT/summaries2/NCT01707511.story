(fifthQuint)The Investigation of the EtCO- PaCO Relation During Laparoscopic Colon Surgery.

 Patient records from patients underwent colorectal surgery between 2010-2011 will be studied.

 It was planned to include patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery with a predetermined anaesthesia protocol.

 Patients will receive a standardized general anesthetic and thoracal epidural anaesthesia.

 Ventilatory parameters will be adjusted to maintain ETCO2 35 mmHg, Paw 25 cmH2O.

Patient age, gen-der, BMI, ASA classification, the duration of surgery, anesthesia, Trendelenburg position and pneumoperitoneum.

 Hemodynamic parameters, blood gas analyzes, ventilation parameters and EtCO values will be recorded.

 We determined 6 timelines to compare the difference between PaCO and EtCO.

 These timelines were the times where we could collect the most data regarding blood gas analyzes.

 Preoperative period: to, 10th minute after the first insuflation and trendelendburg position: t,the first hour after the first insuflation and trendelendburg position: t, 10th minute after desuflation and supine position: t, 10th minute after the second insuflation and trendelendburg position: t, and 10th minute after the second desuflation and supine position:t.

 Primary outcome measure is the difference between PaCO and EtCO a difference greater than 5 mmHg was assumed to be important.

 The Investigation of the EtCO- PaCO Relation During Laparoscopic Colon Surgery@highlight

Et-C02 is used to predict PaCO2 during surgery.

 There are controversies regarding the value of ETCO2 to predict PaCO2.

 The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between Et-CO and PaCO measurements in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

 Patient and surgical characteristics, mechanical ventilation adjustments, and intraabdominal pressure values and the corelation between these parameters and EtCO - PaCO difference were also investigated.
