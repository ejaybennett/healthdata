(fifthQuint)First-line Pomalidomide, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone For AL Amyloidosis or LCDD.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (PVD) to take forward in a subsequent phase 2 study.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Obtain a preliminary assessment of efficacy of PVD regimen as initial treatment of amyloid light-chain (AL) or light chain deposition disease (LCDD).

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pomalidomide and bortezomib.

 Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21; bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15; and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at least every 3 months.

 First-line Pomalidomide, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone For AL Amyloidosis or LCDD@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pomalidomide and bortezomib when given together with dexamethasone in treating patients with amyloid light-chain amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease.

 Biological therapies, such as pomalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop abnormal cells from growing.

 Bortezomib may stop the growth of abnormal cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Giving pomalidomide and bortezomib together with dexamethasone may be an effective treatment for amyloid light-chain amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease
