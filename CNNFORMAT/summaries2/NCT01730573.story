(secondQuint)Interscalene and Combined Supra Scapular and Axillary Nerve Blocks in Rotator Cuff Repair.

 Patients having elective arthroscopic rotator cuff repair will be randomized to one of the two groups.

 Group 1: This group will receive Interscalene block (ultrasound guided and nerve stimulator aided) followed by a general anesthesia.

 Group 2: This group will receive Suprascapular and Axillary nerve block (ultrasound guided and nerve stimulator aided) followed by a general anesthesia.

 Performance time, quality and efficacy as well as any side-effects of the blocks will be evaluated in terms of pain scores in recovery room, after 4- 6 hours and the next morning, opioid usage and patient satisfaction.

 Primary hypothesis: cent Combined Suprascapular and axillary nerve blocks provide similar postoperative analgesia as compared to interscalene block for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

 Secondary hypothesis cent Interscalene block is associated with more side effects and complications as compared to suprascapular nerve block and axillary nerve block.
