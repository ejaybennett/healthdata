(fifthQuint)Predictive Value of Neovascularization Within Asymptomatic Carotis Stenosis on CEUS.

 Background: Injection of ultrasound contrast agents, in conjunction with contrast specific imaging techniques, is increasingly accepted in clinical use for diagnostic ultrasound imaging.

 As microbubbles contrast agents appear to be ideal pure intravascular tracers to enhance the vascular lumen and more important to assess the dynamic spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the microvasculature, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) provides a unique opportunity for new application especially in vascular imaging.

 CEUS of the carotid artery has been introduced as a non-invasive technique to improve detection of carotid atherosclerosis and evaluate the presence of plaque vascularity (vasa vasorum).

 As the proliferation of intraplaque and adventitial vasa vasorum (neovascularization) are inherently linked with the atherosclerotic plaque development, plaque inflammation and vulnerability, direct visualization of intraplaque neovascularization by CEUS has emerged as a new marker for plaque instability.

 Aim: The aim of this study is to test the predictive value of the presence and degree of carotid artery atherosclerotic lesion neovascularization assessed with contrast enhanced carotid ultrasound in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis in regard to lesion progression and future cerebrovascular and coronary events.

 Methode: - Baseline characteristics: cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, lipids), history of myocardial infarction (MI), coronary or peripheral vascular revascularization, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), and medications (contemporaneous with the carotid duplex ultrasound examination) - Atherosclerosis on standard carotis duplex ultrasound: Carotid standard ultrasound will be performed using a Philips (Bothel, WA) iU22 ultrasound scanner equipped with a linear array L9-3 MHz probe.

 The examinations will be performed by a trained vascular specialist using a standard imaging protocol.

 Both left and right carotid arteries will be examined.

 The examination includes B-mode ultrasound imaging, color Doppler ultrasound and pulsed Doppler spectral analysis of the common carotid artery (CCA), the extracranial segments of the internal carotid artery (ICA), and the external carotid artery.

 The mean and maximal IMT value will be measured at the distal part of CCA (2 cm proximal of the tip of the flow divider) at the fare wall using an automated edge detection program (QLAB software, Philips; Bothel, WA).

 The degree of stenosis of the ICA at both sides will be graded according to current guidelines as 30-50%, 50-69%, or 70% stenosis based on spectral Doppler velocities.

 The lesion area [cm2] of each plaque will be calculated by drawing a region of interest along the lumen-intima interface and the media-adventitia interface of each plaque in a 2D longitudinal plan.

 Total lesion burden will be expressed as total plaque area and will be calculated by adding all plaques areas of both sides.

 Total lesion volume [cm3] of each carotid plaque will be measured using stacked contours measurements from 3D data using a General Imaging 3D Quantification program (QLAB software, Philips).

 Lesion echogenicity of each plaque will be classified according to well established criteria as uniformly echolucent (Class I), predominantly echolucent (Class II), predominantly echogenic (Class III), uniformly echogenic or extensively calcified (Class IV).

 - Carotid contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS): For CEUS imaging intravenous continuous infusion (VueJectTM, Bracco, Milan, Italy) of 4.

8ml of phospholipid-stabilized sulfur hexafluoride microspheres (SonoVueTM, Bracco) at a flow rate of 1ml/min preceded by a bolus inject of 1ml will be used.

 The examinations will be performed using a Philips (Bothel, WA) iU22 ultrasound scanner equipped with a linear array L9-3 MHz probe and with ultrasound contrast harmonic software (puls inversion / power modulation).

 Following setting for CEUS imaging will be implemented: mechanical index 0.

06, overall gain 80%, compression 36 will be provided as "pre sets".

 Imaging after start of contrast injection will be performed during 2 minutes at the right side followed by 2 minutes at the left side and will be standardized as follows: using a longitudinal view focusing on the carotid stenosis at the carotid bulb, or the proximal part of the ICA.

 The standard and CEUS studies will be stored digitally as DICOM format for further analysis and quantification.

 - Quantification of intraplaque neovascularization on CEUS imaging: Following the infusion of ultrasound contrast agent, the presence of blood flow "activity" will be identified based on the dynamic movement of the echogenic reflectors (microbubbles) observed within the intraplaque microvessels.

 Intraplaque neovascularization (contrast-agent enhancement) will be categorized with visual interpretation using a grading scale previously published: Grade 1 will be used to indicate no appearance of moving bubbles within the plaque or microspheres only confined to the adjacent adventitial layer, Grade 2 will be considered for moderate visible appearance of moving bubbles within the plaque at the adventitial side or plaque shoulder, and Grade 3 will be reserved for images with extensive intraplaque neovascularization with clear visible appearance of bubbles moving to the plaque core.

 The enhancement of the lesion after injection of contrast material will also be quantitatively analyzed by use of a time-signal intensity curve analysis software package that can display the signal intensity-versus-time curve in the region of interest during the process of enhancement.

 A region of interest with the size and shape fitted to the lesion will be drawn manually and positioned at the lesion.

 Another region of interest of the same size and shape will be positioned in the lumen of the carotid artery.

 The carotid lesion and lumen signal intensity-versus-time curves will be produced.

 The degree of enhancement of the lesion during constant flow of the contrast material (steady-state) will be measured by looking at the enhanced intensity in the plaque and the ratio of the enhanced intensity (dB) in the lesion to that in the lumen of the artery.

 - Clinical and ultrasound follow-up: A clinical follow up and a carotid ultrasound follow up including CEUS will be performed 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after inclusion in the study.

 - Sample size analysis: Sample size is estimated to demonstrate statistically significant difference in cardiovascular event rate up to 5 years after inclusion between patients with moderate or extensive intraplaque neovascularization (vulnerable lesions/patients) and no intraplaque neovascularization (stable lesion), assuming a 2-sided level of statistical significance of .

05, 80% power, and an event rate of 30% in the group with intraplaque neovascularization compared to 15% in the group without intraplaque neovascularization.

This results in a requirement of total 240 individuals in this study project.

 Hypothesis and potential clinical significance: The investigators hypothesize that in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the lesions with more intraplaque neovascularization will have more pronounced lesion progression over time, and these patients with more pronounced intraplaque neovascularization at baseline will have more vascular events during follow-up.

 These results would support the concept that intraplaque neovascularization is associated with plaque instability and vulnerability and therefore, the use of CEUS could provide an additional non-invasive, simple, safe, and reliable imaging modality to stratify individuals risks.

 The identification of vulnerable and more progressive carotid lesions that are at increased risk of rupture and thrombosis by identification of intraplaque neovascularization is expected to improve the prediction of future vascular events and thus allow for better treatment selection.

 It will help the clinician to further risk stratify carotid stenosis.

 Particularly, it will help to identify unstable 50-69% carotid stenosis that may already benefit from invasive therapy as carotid endarterectomy and stenting, and may refrain patients from invasive therapy with stable >70% stenosis.

 Predictive Value of Neovascularization Within Asymptomatic Carotis Stenosis on CEUS@highlight

Atherosclerosis is a chronic, systemic and progressive disease affecting different arterial blood vessels in the body.

 Atherosclerotic lesions silently progress from small plaques to severe stenosis and may remain asymptomatic for years.

 Unstable plaques and stenosis (also called vulnerable plaques), however, are prone to rupture leading to myocardial infarction, or stroke.

 The proliferation of the small arteries that are distributed to the outer and middle coats of the larger blood vessels (vasa vasorum) and within the atherosclerotic plaques (neovascularization) are inherently linked with the atherosclerotic plaque development, plaque inflammation and vulnerability.

 By injecting ultrasound contrast agents (microbubbles) into the blood stream, it is possible to detect this microcirculation of the vessel wall and the neovascularization within the atherosclerotic plaque using a contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging technique.

 Particularly, CEUS of the carotid artery has been introduced as a non-invasive technique to improve detection of carotid atherosclerosis and to evaluate the presence of carotid plaque neovascularization which has emerged as a new marker for plaque vulnerability.

 The project investigates the predictive value of the detection of carotid plaque neovascularization on CEUS imaging in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis regarding the progression of the carotid atherosclerotic lesion and future vascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke or vascular intervention.

 The investigators hypothesize that neovascularization within the carotid lesion will significantly be more pronounced in patients with progressive carotid lesions and in patients suffering future vascular events during.

 The project will support the concept that intraplaque neovascularization is associated with plaque instability and vulnerability and therefore, the use of CEUS may provide an additional non-invasive, simple, safe, and reliable imaging modality to risk stratify individuals.

 The identification of vulnerable that are at increased risk of rupture by identification of intraplaque neovascularization is expected to improve the prediction of future vascular events and thus allow for better treatment selection.

 It will help the clinician to further risk stratify carotid stenosis.

 Particularly, it will help to identify unstable carotid stenosis that may already benefit from invasive therapy as carotid thromboendarterectomy and stenting.
