(thirdQuint)Diagnostic Performance of Noninvasive Fractional Flow Reserve From Computed Tomography.

 Fractional Flow Reserve derived from computed tomography(FFRCT) is a novel method for determining the physiologic significance of coronary artery disease (CAD), which will help physicians in clinical decision-making and decrease the medical cost, but its ability to identify patients with ischemia has not been adequately examined to date.

 Available data from registered clinical trials has testified the diagnostic performance of FFRCT, but the diagnostic accuracy among them are not consistent.

 Thus, the investigators designed a collaborative individual patient-data pooled-analysis aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of FFRCT and find the possible cause for inconsistency.
