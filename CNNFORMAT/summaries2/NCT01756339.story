(firstQuint)Efficacy and Safety Study of Oral Solithromycin (CEM-101) Compared to Oral Moxifloxacin in Treatment of Patients With Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia.

 Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) is an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma with symptoms such as fever or hypothermia, chills, rigors, chest pain, and/or dyspnea.

 The widespread emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogens, including the macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, has resulted in a need for new and effective antibiotics that have activity against CABP pathogens.

 Solithromycin is a fourth generation macrolide antibiotic with excellent activity against resistant S.

 pneumoniae and other key typical and atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens.

 A completed Phase 2 study showed comparable efficacy to levofloxacin in adults with CABP.
