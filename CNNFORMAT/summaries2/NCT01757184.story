(fifthQuint)A Multicenter Study of SBC-102 (Sebelipase Alfa) in Patients With Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency/ ARISE (Acid Lipase Replacement Investigating Safety and Efficacy).

 Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency (LALD) is a genetic disease which is characterized by abnormal lipid accumulation in many parts of the body due to a marked decrease in activity of the enzyme lysosomal acid lipase (LAL).

 Although a single disease, LALD presents with two major forms: early onset and late onset.

 Early onset LALD, also known as Wolman Disease, is characterized by severe malabsorption, growth failure, and hepatic failure and is usually fatal within the first year of life.

 The late onset form of the disease, also known as Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease (CESD), occurs in both children and adults and is an under-appreciated cause of fatty liver with prominent microvesicular steatosis and cirrhosis.

 Although the natural history of the disease has not been well studied, serious liver complications are frequently described including early death and liver transplantation.

 Other complications includes premature atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries) associated with high levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often called the "bad" cholesterol.

 The levels of triglycerides can also be high and the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol) are typically low.

 Current treatments mainly focus on control of the lipid abnormalities through diet and the use of lipid lowering medications.

 New treatments are needed for patients with LALD as current treatments only address some aspects of the disease and disease progression to cirrhosis still occurs.

 In pre-clinical studies and studies in patients with LALD, treatment with SBC-102 (sebelipase alfa) has been shown to produce improvements in markers of liver damage and in the lipid abnormalities.

 The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of using SBC-102 to treat late onset LALD (CESD) through a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blinded study in both affected children and adults.

This Phase 3 study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 1 mg/kg IV infusions of SBC-102 (sebelipase alfa) administered every other week in patients with late onset lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency (cholesteryl ester storage disease).

 Late onset LAL Deficiency is an underappreciated cause of cirrhosis, liver failure and dyslipidemia.

 There is currently no standard treatment for LAL Deficiency other than supportive care.

 Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) may be a potential new treatment option for LAL Deficiency patients.
