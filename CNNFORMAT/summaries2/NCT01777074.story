(thirdQuint)Acceptability of Hepatitis B Vaccination in General Practitioners and Paediatricians.

 The aim of the study is to assess the acceptability of Hepatitis B immunization among general practitioners and open-care paediatricians.

 This is a national, repeated transversal epidemiological study with two data measurement time-points over a period of two years (T1 in 2009, T2 in 2011, two different samples of physicians) in order to assess immunization practices before introduction of the reimbursement of InfanrixHexa(R), during the transition period and then during the period following reimbursement of the vaccine.

 At each collection time-point, two patient age groups will be investigated: 12-15 months and 24-27 months, thus providing measurements before/after reimbursement.
