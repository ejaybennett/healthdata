(thirdQuint)Usefulness of C-reactive Protein Testing in Acute Cough.

 Eighteen general practitioners, from both urban and rural offices, were randomised into intervention and control groups.

 All registrations were made by general practitioners in their offices.

 The case report form was similar to that used in the GRACE study (Genomics to combat Resistance against Antibiotics in Community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in Europe (www.

grace-lrti.

org) describing symptoms, findings, and treatment in lower respiratory tract infections.

 - The clinical examination included a chest examination and the axillary temperature.

 - After the clinical examination, the general practitioners recorded their provisional diagnosis.

 - Chest radiography was accessible for all patients.

 The C-reactive protein test was performed in the intervention group at both the first and second consultations.

 The Afinion test system was used, which provides results within 5 minutes and before treatment was determined.

 This test is based on solid-phase sandwich immunometric analysis.

 General practitioners could prescribe any treatment, including antibiotics and other drugs for the cough and additional medication if deemed necessary.

 Usefulness of C-reactive Protein Testing in Acute Cough@highlight

The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness in Russian general practice of C-reactive protein testing in patients with acute cough or lower respiratory tract infections.

 In addition to studying the effect of C-reactive protein testing on the prescription of antibiotics, the purpose is to find out whether the frequency of referral to radiography could be reduced.
