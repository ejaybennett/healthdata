(firstQuint)Bioequivalence of Ethylenediamine Dihydrochloride Study.

 We propose an open, prospective, single-site study to evaluate the bioequivalence of ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in methylcellulose (MC)and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) formulations.

 Bioequivalence will be determined in 15 adult subjects, with a clinical history of contact dermatitis and a positive patch test (current or previous) to ethylenediamine ("sensitives").

The purpose of this study is to compare the allergen ethylenediamine dihydrochloride when prepared using methylcellulose versus preparation using polyvinylpyrrolidone.
