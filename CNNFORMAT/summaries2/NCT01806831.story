(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Biocellulose Sheet Containing Anti-hyperpigmentation Agent ("Biocellulose Mask", "Farhorm") in Patients Receiving Laser Treatment.

 Volar surface at upper arm (2X2 cm) on both sides were treated with semi ablative, 1,550 nm Erbium: glass fractional laser.

 Biocellulose sheet from coconut juice containing anti-hyperpigmentation agent ("biocellulose mask","Farhorm(R)")was applied for 20 min on one side and the other side was treated with vaseline ointment.

 The redness, skin hydration and skin pigmentation were evaluated at that area before laser, immediately after laser and after applying the treatment.

 These parameters were compared between treatment (area treated with Biocellulose sheet from coconut juice containing anti-hyperpigmentation agent, "biocellulose mask", "Farhorm(R)") and control (vaseline ointment).
