(firstQuint)An Investigation Into the Efficacy of Provodine Topical Cream as Compared to 10% Benzoyl Peroxide Wash for the Treatment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa.

 Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory disease of the skin.

 It typically manifests as nodules and abscesses that ultimately can progress to form deep sinus tracts, fistulas, and scarring.

 It affects areas of the body with apocrine gland bearing tissue, including the anogenital, axillary and inframammary regions.

 The lesions are often very painful and can chronically drain malodorous fluid, which can leave affected individuals uncomfortable and self-conscious, or even debilitated.

 The pathogenesis of this disease process is not fully understood, and the HS can be difficult to treat.

 Measures such as topical antibiotic and antiseptic washes are generally thought to be beneficial for the treatment of early stage HS.

 Although there have been no controlled trials for the treatment of HS, commonly used topical washes currently include benzoyl peroxide and chlorhexidine gluconate.

 Provodine cent topical cream was designed to actively kill microbes on the skin for up to 6 hours without resulting in the irritation often associated with repetitive use of antimicrobial products.

 A blinded controlled comparison of Provodine cent versus the current standard of benzoyl peroxide wash will not only allow for an alternative treatment for early stage HS but also provide an additional tool in the arsenal of treatments for this disease process.
