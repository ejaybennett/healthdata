(firstQuint)ASS-Nonresponse Following Cardiac Surgery as Assessed With Multiple Electrode Aggregometry.

 Up to now there are no data concerning the prevalence of ASS-Nonresponse following surgical coronary revascularization procedures as assessed with the Multiple Electrode Aggregometry.

 Results of the present observational study are needed to assess the prevalence of ASS-Nonresponse in order to perform a sample size analysis for a prospective interventional study in a second step.
