(thirdQuint)Abnormal Post-partum Glucose Metabolism After Gestational Diabetes Diagnosed Before or After 24 Weeks of Gestation.

 The secondary objectives of this study are to compare between the two groups: A.

 the rate of type 2 diabetes only, glucose intolerance only, impaired fasting glucose only, and patients requiring insulin at 4-12 weeks postpartum B.

 rates of maternal and obstetric complications C.

 risk factors (age, body mass index, personal history of gestational diabetes or macrosomia, first degree family history of diabetes).

 D.

 For fasting glucose done before 24SA, we will calculate the optimal threshold for predicting abnormal glucose metabolism in the immediate postpartum period among women with gestational diabetes.

 Abnormal Post-partum Glucose Metabolism After Gestational Diabetes Diagnosed Before or After 24 Weeks of Gestation@highlight

The main objective of the study is to estimate and compare the percentage of patients with abnormal glucose metabolism at 4-12 weeks postpartum between two groups: patients diagnosed with gestational diabetes before or after 24 weeks of pregnancy.

 Abnormal glucose metabolism is defined as type 2 diabetes, glucose intolerance or impaired fasting glucose.
