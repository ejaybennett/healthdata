(fifthQuint)A Pilot Study of Positive Affect Training.

 Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) and mindfulness meditation, in which PAT is rooted, are derived from Buddhist practices that have been empirically shown to have applications in improving mental health.

 Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, mindfulness based CBT was shown to decrease stress, negative affect, and chronic pain in both psychiatric and non-psychiatric subjects.

 Mindfulness-based therapy has since been shown to be effective for treating mood and anxiety disorders.

 Only recently has LKM been examined as an intervention for affective symptoms.

 This meditation practice seems to be particularly suited for reducing negative affect while also enhancing positive affect in individuals who show emotional dysregulation, such as people with dysthymic disorder.

 This notion is supported by experimental studies suggesting that LKM decreases anxiety and stress, positively influences emotional responses to neutral stimuli, and promotes positive emotions such as trust, love, hope, and compassion.

 Dr.

 Fredrickson, a prominent researcher and social psychologist who is the foremost expert in LKM will serve as an outside consultant for the development of the protocol.

 She is not listed as an official collaborator because she will not be in direct contact with the participant data that the investigators will collect.

 The intervention the investigators plan to develop, Positive Affect Training (PAT), combines mindfulness and LKM, with a strong emphasis on the latter.

 The investigators will adopt strategies that have been described in a previous LKM protocol for trauma victims.

 The investigators contacted Dr.

 Kearney who shared his manual with us.

 Given the impressive effect LKM seems to have on generating positive, and attenuating negative affect in experimental studies, the investigators plan to test PAT as a method of improving positive affect.

 The current study aims to test the initial efficacy of PAT in individuals who report experiencing a low mood.

 The investigators hypothesize significant improvement in subjects' self-reported ratings of negative and positive affect as a result of the intervention.

 A Pilot Study of Positive Affect Training@highlight

The primary objective of this study is a proof-of-concept study to test whether a novel mindfulness based intervention, Positive Affect Training (PAT), can enhance positive affect and compassion, and decrease negative affect and feelings of depression.

 PAT involves a combination of practicing mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation in groups.

 The goal of the research is to test the initial feasibility and efficacy in increasing positive affect and decreasing negative affect in individuals recruited from the general community who experience negative affect.

 If the training proves to be successful, we will test the intervention, in additional studies, on individuals with dysthymic disorder and other clinical disorders.

 PAT is a cost-effective, non-invasive intervention.

 Therefore if effective, it could be an alternative or supplemental intervention option to existing psychotherapy for dysthymic disorder.
