(firstQuint)Vapocoolant Spray Effectiveness On Arterial Puncture Pain: Randomized Double Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial.

 Previous studies of vapocoolant sprays for reducing pain were mainly on venopuncture with inconsistent results.

 There was only one prospective open labeled controlled study on arterial blood gas sampling with ethyl chloride which did not show effectiveness.

 This study will assess the efficacy and tolerability of a topical alkane vapocoolant spray for arterial puncture in adults in comparison to control spray.
