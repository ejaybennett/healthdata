(fifthQuint)Phase 1 Study in Subjects With OAB Assessing the Safety and Activity of hMaxi-K Gene Transfer.

 This is a Phase 1 double blind, placebo controlled study assessing safety and activity of 2 escalating doses of hMaxi-K gene transfer by direct injection into the bladder wall in female subjects with OAB (Overactive Bladder Syndrome and Detrusor Overactivity).

 There will be a total of 9 visits and a 1 and 3 day post dosing telephone contact with the patient to evaluate for any new complaints.

 Following screening visits(V1 and V1A) and study drug administration at week 0, eligible participants will be evaluated for safety post dosing with study drug at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24.

 At Screening, Baseline (prior to dosing) and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks post dosing participants will have a complete physical exam including urogenital examination.

 ECG will be performed at Screening, at Baseline, at one week post dosing and at the final visit.

 At Screening, Baseline (prior to dosing) and 1, 2, 4, 12 and 24 weeks post dosing, laboratory evaluations including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be performed.

 Urine cultures will be done throughout the study (including prior to catheterization and at discharge) to insure the absence of infection.

 Participants will be assessed for study drug effects on incontinence at Baseline (prior to dosing) and at weeks 4 and 24 post dosing by cystometry.

 At Screening (V1) and at 2, 8 and 24 weeks post dosing participants will have a bladder scan to evaluate for residual volume.

 Subjects will complete a daily diary at home for 7 days prior to the baseline (V2).

 Diaries will capture number of micturitions, volume of micturitions, number of urge incontinence episodes, and rating of episode, and the number of pads used every 24 hours.

 The participants will continue to complete this daily diary during the course of the trial and the diary will be evaluated at each follow-up visit.

 The participants will evaluate their perception of their bladder condition, QoL using Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ) and SF-12.

 International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF) will be completed throughout the study.

 Phase 1 Study in Subjects With OAB Assessing the Safety and Activity of hMaxi-K Gene Transfer@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of a single treatment of hMaxi-K compared to placebo (PBS-20% sucrose) administered by direct bladder wall injections.

 Two dose levels (16000 mu g and 24000 mu g -20 or 30 bladder wall injections, respectively) in females with moderate OAB/DO of six months duration will be evaluated.

 In each dose level, 6 participants will receive hMaxi-K and 3 will receive placebo.

 .

 In addition secondary efficacy parameters will be evaluated (change from baseline compared to placebo), including number of micturitions per day, volume of micturitions, incontinence episodes, pad weight, uninhibited contractions during cystoscopy, and quality of life assessments.
