(fifthQuint)Addressing Barriers to Physical Activity in Inner-City Schoolchildren With Asthma.

 Four schools have been recruited for pilot wait-listed cluster randomized clinical trial to determine feasibility for a large-scaled trial.

 Community-based participatory research approach was utilized to develop an intervention that will be delivered to two schools.

 Two control schools will receive intervention during year 2 of the study.

 Addressing Barriers to Physical Activity in Inner-City Schoolchildren With Asthma@highlight

This proposal will address the existent gaps in the literature by identifying barriers and facilitators to participation in physical activity in inner-city minority elementary schoolchildren with asthma, more that half of whom are also overweight; developing and refining a school-based intervention in partnership with the community to improve physical activity; and conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial of the intervention to determine feasibility and obtain preliminary data for a future large-scale trial.
