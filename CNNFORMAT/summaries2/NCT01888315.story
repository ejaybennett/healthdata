 Influence of Catheter-based Renal Denervation in Diseases With Increased Sympathetic Activity@highlight

The study is aiming to document the long-term safety and effectiveness of renal denervation in patients with hypertension and other diseases characterized by elevated sympathetic drive.

 Catheter-based renal denervation will be performed using CE marked, percutaneous, systems.
