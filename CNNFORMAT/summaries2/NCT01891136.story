(firstQuint)Oral Peanut Immunotherapy for Peanut Allergic Patients.

 The goal of this proposal is to develop peanut OIT for patients with peanut allergic reactions.

 This approach is designed to utilize our extensive knowledge of the allergens involved in peanut hypersensitivity to devise an immunotherapeutic approach that would lower the risk of anaphylactic reactions and would down regulate peanut-specific T cells in peanut-allergic patients.

 Previous attempts to utilize peanut-specific immunotherapy (IT) have been unsuccessful primarily because of the side effects of therapy.
