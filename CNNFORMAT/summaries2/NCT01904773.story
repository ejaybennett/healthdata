(fifthQuint)Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetic, and Efficacy Study of AZD5213 in Adolescents With Tourette's Disorder.

 This is a multicenter, randomized, two-part study of AZD5213 in adolescents (ages 12-17 years) with Tourette's Disorder.

 In Part 1 of the study, following an up to 21-day screening period, on Day 1, after baseline procedures are performed, eligible subjects will receive a single, low dose of AZD5213, in-clinic.

 After study drug dosing on Day 1, safety and tolerability will be assessed in-clinic, and blood samples will be taken for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis.

 On Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 subjects will take study drug, and will be contacted via telephone and adverse events and concomitant medications will be assessed.

 On Day 8, safety, tolerability, and blood sampling for PK analysis (predose and 2-4 hours post-dose) will be performed in-clinic.

 Part 2 of the study will consist of six consecutive crossover periods.

 In Part 2 of the study, each study drug will be administered in two 4-week periods (six treatment periods, total).

 Each study drug will be received in one of Periods 1-3, and again in one of Periods 4-6.

 Approximately 24 subjects will receive study drug in Part 1 of this study in order to complete approximately 18 subjects in Part 2.

 Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetic, and Efficacy Study of AZD5213 in Adolescents With Tourette's Disorder@highlight

This is a two-part, randomized, multi-center, blinded study in adolescents with Tourette's Disorder.

 There will be an up to 21-day screening period in which subject eligibility will be determined.

 In Part 1 of the study, the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AZD5213 will be assessed during a 1- week period.

 In Part 2 of the study, the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of two doses (depending on tolerability in Part 1 of the study) of AZD5213 and placebo will be assessed through six consecutive four-week crossover periods.

 Each subject will receive both AZD5213 and placebo.

 A follow-up vist will take place at 14 () 7 days following the last dose of study drug.
