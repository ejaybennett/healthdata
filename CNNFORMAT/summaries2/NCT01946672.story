(thirdQuint)Lower-Limb Drainage Mapping in Pelvic Lymphadenectomy for Gynaecological Cancer.

 Pelvic lymphadenectomy is associated with a significant risk of lower-limb lymphedema.

 In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of identifying the lower-limb drainage nodes (LLDNs) during pelvic lymphadenectomy for gynaecological cancers using an isotopic detection technique with a preoperative radiopharmaceutical injection into both feet Secondary objectives are to map lower-limb drainage, to assess the diagnostic value of our mapping technique, and to determine the incidence of lymphedema.

 LLDN mapping may allow the preservation of LLDNs, thereby decreasing the risk of lower-limb lymphedema and improving quality of life.

 Lower-Limb Drainage Mapping in Pelvic Lymphadenectomy for Gynaecological Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of an isotopic technique to identify, and to map the lower-limb drainage nodes during pelvic lymphadenectomy for gynaecological cancers.

 The diagnostic value of our mapping method will be assessed, and we will determine the incidence of lymhedema.
