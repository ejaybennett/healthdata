(secondQuint)Neratinib HER Mutation Basket Study (SUMMIT).

 This is an open-label, multicenter, multinational, Phase 2 study exploring the efficacy and safety of neratinib therapy in patients with solid tumors with activating HER2, HER3 or EGFR mutations or with EGFR gene amplification.

 The trial will consist of a screening period, a treatment period, and an end of treatment visit occurring when neratinib is discontinued for any reason, a safety follow-up visit occurring 28 to 42 days after the last dose of neratinib and a survival follow-up period lasting for a maximum of 12 months for each patient after their last dose of neratinib or until initiation of additional anti-cancer therapy.
