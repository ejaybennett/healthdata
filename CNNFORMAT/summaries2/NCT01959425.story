(secondQuint)Oral Anticoagulation Therapy Pilot Study.

 Patients undergoing successful cardiac ablation for atrial fibrillation who remain AF recurrence-free 3 months after successful ablation and continue to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be screened for enrollment in the trial.

 After fulfilling all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients who consent to participate in the study and remain AF recurrence-free will be randomized to one of two study arms: (1) OAT Withdrawal (Test) Group or (2) OAT (Control) Group and participate in the Evaluation Period (12 months).
