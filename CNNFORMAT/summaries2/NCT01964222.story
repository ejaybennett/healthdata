(fifthQuint)Health Literacy Intervention for Informed Consent of Cancer Patients Considering Clinical Trial Participation.

 A previously developed and pilot tested web-based decision aid (DA) based on best practices in health literacy that is well received by minority participants and significantly improved knowledge about cancer clinical trials and decision self-efficacy will be used.

 This study will expand the reach of the DA and test it in a larger study in a different geographic region and center (Siteman Cancer Center).

 An additional benefit of conducting this work at Siteman Cancer Center is that Siteman and the Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECaD) already institute structural changes at the system level to improve minority participation in trials.

 This study will activate and educate patients and will complement the system-level interventions.

 By random 1:1 assignment, 180 participants will either receive: *Targeted, web-based decision aid (DA) about participating in cancer clinical trials.

 or *Usual care/control-Access to the Siteman Cancer Center website about clinical trials.

 Outcomes from the DA group will be compared to outcomes in a usual care/control group.

 Health Literacy Intervention for Informed Consent of Cancer Patients Considering Clinical Trial Participation@highlight

This study will update an existing health literacy intervention (decision aid) for informed consent procedures and then conduct a randomized experiment implementing the health literacy intervention at Siteman Cancer Center and evaluate its effectiveness compared to usual care.

 Our hypothesis is that implementing the targeted, web-based decision aid (DA) in addition to usual care will increase knowledge about cancer clinical trials.

 Secondary outcomes include patients' ability to communicate with health care providers about trials, willingness to participate in trials, and enrollment rates for minority participants.
