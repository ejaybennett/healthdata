 Cryoablation of Small Breast Tumors in Early Stage Breast Cancer@highlight

This study examines the use of cryoablation as an alternative to surgery in the treatment of early stage invasive breast cancer.

 The hypothesis is that cryoablation will complete ablation and destroy the tumor in a selected population of women who may otherwise be adequately treated with surgery.
