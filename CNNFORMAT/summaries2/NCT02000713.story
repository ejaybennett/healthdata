(firstQuint)Cervical Spinal Cord Metabolism and Microstructure in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS).

 Currently there is no definitive diagnostic test for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

 The investigators' goal is to determine if magnetic resonance imaging can provide an accurate diagnosis of ALS by looking at chemical concentrations in the spinal cord at the neck level which show up in MRI imaging and compare these chemical concentrations to corresponding measures in healthy control subjects.
