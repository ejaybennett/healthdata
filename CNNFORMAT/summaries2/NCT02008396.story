(fifthQuint)MDMA-assisted Therapy for Social Anxiety in Autistic Adults.

 Studies suggest that autistic adults are at greater risk for social anxiety.

 Social anxiety is a condition characterized by fear of scrutiny and avoidance of social interactions.

 Social anxiety frequently compounds the considerable social challenges experienced by autistic adults.

 There are currently no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for autistic adults, although off-label prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are on the rise in this population.

 Based on the known effects of MDMA, as well as individual reports from autistic adults, this exploratory study will focus on enhancing functional skills in this underserved population, who tend to experience greater anxiety, depression and victimization than typically developing adults.

 The main objective of this study is to collect safety data to examine whether MDMA-assisted therapy will be tolerated and to estimate effect size of symptom reduction in social anxiety and other psychiatric symptoms that are common in the adult autistic population as evaluated by standard clinical measures.

 The primary outcome measure will be change in social anxiety levels as measured by the Lieberman Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS).

 Secondary measures include those of social anxiety, anxiety, depression, stress, self-esteem, emotion labeling and recognition, empathy, and quality of life, and blood levels of the hormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol.

 Each of the 12 subjects will participate in two blinded experimental sessions, assisted by either MDMA or placebo lasting seven hours within a brief course of non-drug therapy.

 The non-drug therapy includes three hour-long preparatory sessions at the start of the study and three hour-long integrative sessions during the month after each experimental session at two week intervals.

 This study is designed as a dose escalation study to assist with the exploration of safety and finding the most effective dose in this population.

 Subjects assigned to the MDMA group will receive two of three different doses, either 75mg, 100mg, or 125 mg MDMA.

 Overall, eight subjects (66.

7%) will be randomized to the MDMA group and four subjects (33.

3%) will be randomized to the placebo group.

 During the study, there will be a maximum of 24 experimental sessions with MDMA, with eight sessions in each dose group, and eight experimental sessions with placebo.

 Observations before, during, and after experimental sessions will be compared between these groups of equal size to explore the effects of MDMA-assisted therapy in the first double The Principal Investigator will evaluate all subjects to confirm autistic status.

 In addition, autistic status will be confirmed with the gold-standard diagnostic measure of autism in adults.

 Upon enrollment, subjects will meet with the study therapists for three 1-hour preparatory sessions scheduled within the month prior to the first experimental session to discuss what to expect during experimental sessions.

 In-person visits will occur in a private room at the research facility.

 All in-person sessions will be video recorded.

 Video recordings will be used for research and training purposes after the study.

 During experimental sessions, there will be periods of structured and unstructured interactions.

 The structured interactions will be selected based on elements of therapeutic interventions that are currently in use in this population for the treatment of social anxiety.

 An overnight stay at a hotel located close to the site will be offered to subjects, accompanied by their support partners, if they live further than 30 miles from the site on the night following the experimental session.

 Subjects will attend a 1-hour follow-up integrative therapy session on the day after the experimental session.

 Two additional integrative sessions will be conducted two weeks apart following each experimental session.

 During integrative sessions subjects will receive support in integrating their experiences and insights from the experimental session.

 The second experimental session will be scheduled approximately one month after the first experimental session, after outcome assessments have been completed.

 Biomarker levels will be analyzed to determine if MDMA-assisted therapy causes changes in these modulators of social behavior in this population as previously demonstrated in typically developing adults.

 Biomarker levels will be analyzed for persisting effects at one month and 6 months after treatment.

 Blood samples will be obtained from all subjects to measure plasma OT, AVP and CORT, which will be used to explore as potential surrogate endpoints at baseline, two hours after drug administration during the second experimental session, one month after the second experimental session, and at 6-month follow-up.

 Social anxiety will be measured by interview with a blinded Independent Rater.

 Questionnaires measuring anxiety, depression, self-esteem, emotion labeling, emotion recognition, stress, and self-esteem will be given at baseline and throughout treatment.

 Quality of life will be assessed by interview at baseline and 6-month follow.

 MDMA-assisted Therapy for Social Anxiety in Autistic Adults@highlight

This randomized, double-blind study is intended to test the safety and feasibility of using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy, compared with placebo, to treat social anxiety in autistic adults.

 Subjects will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive placebo or MDMA during two experimental sessions.

 The first six subjects in the study will be randomized to placebo (2) or 75 mg MDMA on the first session and 100 mg MDMA on the second session (4).

 The next six subjects will be randomized to placebo (2) or 100 mg MDMA on the first session and 125 mg MDMA on the second session (4).

 The study will explore whether two doses of MDMA, combined with selected therapeutic activities, can reduce social anxiety.

 The study takes place in Los Angeles, California and requires about 15 visits to the study location over several months.

 Study subjects will meet with the investigators three times to prepare for the MDMA sessions, and they will meet with them on three occasions and receive daily phone calls for safety monitoring for a week after each session.

 Blood samples will be collected at baseline, two hours after drug administration during the second experimental session, one month and six months after the second experimental session to measure amounts of the hormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol in plasma.

 Subjects will return six months after their second experimental session for measurements of and social anxiety and other symptoms and an interview.

 Subjects will learn what they received at this visit.

 Subjects who received placebo can go through treatment again to have two sessions with MDMA, the first with 75 mg and the second with 125mg MDMA.

 Social anxiety, anxiety, depression, stress, self-esteem, empathy, and quality of life will be measured before and after experimental sessions.
