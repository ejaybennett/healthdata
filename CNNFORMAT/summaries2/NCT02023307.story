(fifthQuint)Use of V-Loc Suture for Mid-face Lifting in Short-flap Rhytidectomy.

 A total of 25 patients who are already receiving a traditional Lifestyle Lift will be asked to participate.

 Once the consent form has been signed by the patient, the facelift will be performed as scheduled and the Vloc suture will be added to the mid-face area.

 Each patient will be added to a database and their progress will be tracked with photos taken before, at 6 weeks, and at 6 months following the procedure.

 All data stored will be locked into a hard drive that can only be accessed by the research staff and the doctor.

 The text data will be used by research staff for reports and articles.

 * you must already have purchased and scheduled a facelift procedure with Lifestyle Lift to participate in this trial.

 The addition of only the V-loc suture is at no cost.

 Use of V-Loc Suture for Mid-face Lifting in Short-flap Rhytidectomy@highlight

This study will evaluate and measure the Vloc suture's ability to elevate the mid-face when using a short flap, short incision technique in during a traditional face-lift.

 The objective of this study is to assess the suture's potential in elevating the mid-face when a traditional Lifestyle facelift is performed.

 We hypothesize that the Vloc suture will elevate the mid-face more effectively when using a short flap, short incision technique on a traditional facelift.
