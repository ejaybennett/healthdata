(fifthQuint)Phase 2 Study Assessing Efficacy and Safety of Crizotinib in Patients Harboring an Alteration on ALK, MET or ROS1.

 Twenty cohorts are identified, a cohort being defined as [one pathology, one target alteration] such as [gastric cancer with MET amplification (6%)].

 One cohort will be dedicated to miscellaneous, very rare pediatric diseases identified through INCa platforms or pan-genome programs (e.

g.

 MOSKIDO, IGR) and will recruit up to 10 patients.

 Two cohorts will be dedicated to a couple of diseases harbouring at least one specific alteration in one crizotinib target, same or different from those listed above, e.

g.

 in AXL gene, arising from pan-genome trials.

 Phase 2 Study Assessing Efficacy and Safety of Crizotinib in Patients Harboring an Alteration on ALK, MET or ROS1@highlight

This is a biology driven, trans-tumoral, multicentric phase II trial assessing the efficacy and the safety of the targeted agent crizotinib as a monotherapy in 23 cohorts of patients with identified activating molecular alterations in the crizotinib target genes.

 A cohort is defined by a pathology and a crizotinib-target alteration (eg gastric cancer with MET amplification).

 For each cohort a two-stage design will be implemented.

 In the situation where expected accrual allows for a sufficient number of patients to be accrued, the alpha and beta errors will be fixed at 10%.

 However, in very rare diseases, such as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), it is anticipated that the target number may not be achievable in a reasonable timeframe; for these cohorts, the alpha and beta errors will be fixed at 15%.

 Consequently three different statistical designs will be a priori considered according to the expected response rate and incidence.
