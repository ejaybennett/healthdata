(fifthQuint)Rural Lifestyle Eating and Activity Program (Rural LEAP).

 If you agree to participate, you will first have a number of tests performed on you to see if you are eligible to take part in the study.

 If you are eligible, these tests will be repeated after 4 months of treatment, and again after 22 months.

 You also will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires.

 If you are eligible, you will be asked to complete these questionnaires again after 4 months of treatment, and again after 10, 16, and 22 months.

 The different tests and measures are listed below.

 Questionnaires, Height, Weight, Waist Measurement, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Electrocardiogram, Blood Sample (2 tablespoons), Urine Sample, and a Urine Pregnancy test for females, 400 Meter Walking Test Randomization A member of the research team will contact you by telephone or by mail to tell you whether you are eligible to take part in the study.

 If you are eligible to participate, a computer will randomly assign you to one of three groups.

 Random assignment is like rolling dice to decide which group a person is assigned to.

 You will not get to choose which group you are assigned to, and the researchers will not get to choose which group you are assigned to.

 A computer will make your assignment.

 The three groups are described below: Group A: 4 months of weight loss treatment plus 12 months of follow-up contact by telephone.

 The follow-up telephone contacts in Group A will involve group discussion with a trained staff member and other participants.

 Group B: 4 months of weight loss treatment plus 12 months of follow-up contacts by telephone.

 The follow-up telephone contacts in Group B will involve individual, one-on-one discussion with a trained staff member.

 Group C: 4 months of weight loss treatment plus 12 months of follow-up contacts by mail and e-mail.

 Weight Loss Treatments The weight-loss treatments in this study will include two phases.

 Phase 1 will last 4 months.

 Phase 2 will last 12 more months.

 Everybody in Groups A, B, and C will have the same Phase 1 weight-loss treatment program for 4 months.

 However, the type of Phase 2 follow-up program that you receive will depend on whether you are assigned to Group A, B, or C.

 Phase 1 Treatment During this time, you will meet each week with a group leader and a group of about 10 other adults.

 The meetings will take place at the Cooperative Extension Office.

 The group leader will be a Family and Consumer Sciences Agent who has had special training in nutrition education or a staff member who has had special training in weight-management.

 The group meetings will last about 90 minutes per week.

 All group meeting will be audio recorded so that the researchers can determine if the treatment was delivered as planned.

 There are four major goals for the group sessions.

 1.

 You will learn about nutrition, physical activity, and safe methods to lose weight.

 To help accomplish this goal, you will be asked to keep a daily habit log on which you will record everything you eat and drink each day.

 You will also be given a pedometer.

 A pedometer is a small device about the size of a pager that keeps track of how many steps you take each day.

 You will be asked to wear the pedometer each day, and write down on your habit log each day the number of steps tracked by your pedometer.

 2.

 You will be taught how to eat a healthy diet while taking in fewer calories than you are currently eating.

 This will usually mean reducing your calorie intake by 500 to 1000 calories per day.

 You will participate in cooking demonstrations and will have a chance to sample healthy foods prepared during group meetings.

 3.

 You will be taught how to set up a regular routine of increased physical activity or exercise.

 This will usually involve a walking program of 30 minutes per day.

 4.

 You will be taught ways to increase your motivation to start and maintain changes in your eating and exercise habits.

 Phase 2 Treatments Phase 2 of the program will begin after the completion of Phase 1 and will last for 12 months.

 Phase 2 will involve follow-up programs to help group members continue their weight management efforts.

 During Phase 2 you will be encouraged to maintain improved, healthy patterns of exercise and dietary intake, and to continue to monitor and record your dietary intake and pedometer steps on a regular basis.

 The follow-up programs for all Groups will involve two contacts per month for the first 6 months and one contact per month for the next 6 months.

 However, the type of contact will be different for each Treatment Group.

 Group A: This group will have follow-up contact by phone.

 If you are assigned by the computer to Group A, you will receive two phone calls per month from your group leader for the first 6 months, and one phone call per month for the next 6 months.

 These calls will be group phone calls; other participants will be on the call with you.

 These group phone calls will be led by a trained group leader and will include discussions of progress and will focus on strategies to help you maintain lost weight.

 Group B: This group will have follow-up contact by phone.

 If you are assigned by the computer to Group B, you will receive two phone calls per month from your group leader for the first 6 months, and one phone call per month for the next 6 months.

 These calls will be individual phone calls with you and a trained staff member that will include discussions of progress and will focus on strategies to help you maintain lost weight.

 Group C: This group will have follow-up contact by mail.

 If you are assigned by the computer to Group C, you will receive a specially prepared newsletter two times per month.

 The newsletter will contain educational information about proper eating and physical activity.

 The newsletters will include low-fat and low-calorie recipes, along with tip sheets that describe strategies to help you maintain lost weight.

 If you are in Group A or B four of your phone call treatment sessions will be audio recorded so that the researchers can determine if the treatment was delivered as planned.

 Rural Lifestyle Eating and Activity Program (Rural LEAP)@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to learn about ways to help adults with obesity from rural areas manage their weight and increase their physical activity.

 An important goal of the study is to find out what type of follow-up program for weight management is necessary to help adults with obesity keep from regaining lost weight.

 The study will also look at the ways that long-term weight-loss treatments affect blood pressure, blood fats (lipids), blood sugar, and physical fitness.

 You are being asked to be in this research study because increased weight and obesity are major health problems in the United States.

 Your weight and height fall in the obese category.

 Adults with obesity have an increased risk of developing health problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease.

 The rates of being overweight and obese are higher in rural areas of the United States than in urban and suburban areas of the country.
