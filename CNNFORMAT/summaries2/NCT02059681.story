(secondQuint)Phase I Trial of Endocavitary Injection of Bone Marrow Derived CD133+ Cells in Ischemic Refractory Cardiomyopathy (RECARDIO Trial).

 This will be a Phase I study investigating the safety and preliminary efficacy of endocavitary injection of bone-marrow-derived CD133+ cells in 15 patients with ischemic heart failure (IHF) not eligible for conventional revascularization.

 Patients eligible will undergo bone-marrow aspiration.

 On the day following bone-marrow aspiration patients will undergo fluoroscopy-based endocavitary intramyocardial injections of the target areas previously identified by gated-SPECT/CMR.

 CD133+ cells suspended in physiological saline supplemented with 5% human albumin solution will be injected into the myocardium via the endocardial route.

 After discharge, efficacy follow-up will last 6-months safety follow-up (FU) will be extended up to 1 year.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether endocavitary intramyocardial injection of autologous bone-marrow-derived CD133+ cells is safe on the basis of number of adverse events, with follow-up assessments extending up to 1 year after enrolment.
