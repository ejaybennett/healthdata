 However until now, very few research was done during the diagnostic workup.

 This prospective study will describe and explore distress, quality of life and illness perception in lung cancer patients during the diagnostic period until first follow-up visit 4 weeks after start of therapy.

 Patient reported questionnaires will be used.
