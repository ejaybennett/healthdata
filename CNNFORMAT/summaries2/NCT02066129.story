(thirdQuint)Step-up Yellow Zone Inhaled Corticosteroids to Prevent Exacerbations.

 The study design is a double-blind, parallel-group trial, including a total of 250 participants, ages 5-11 years, with a diagnosis of asthma and a history of at least 1 asthma exacerbation treated with oral corticosteroids in the prior year.

 All participants will be treated for 48 weeks with open-label fluticasone 44 mcg 2 puffs twice daily.

 During the 48-week treatment period, participants will receive randomized blinded therapy for 7 days each time they enter the "yellow zone" (at the onset of symptoms previously associated with upper respiratory illnesses and subsequent asthma exacerbations).

 Yellow zone therapy will be fluticasone 44 or 220 mcg 2 puffs twice daily.

 Step-up Yellow Zone Inhaled Corticosteroids to Prevent Exacerbations@highlight

The objective of this study is to determine whether, in children receiving low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), quintupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids at the onset of symptoms previously associated with upper respiratory illnesses and subsequent asthma exacerbations reduces the rate of severe asthma exacerbations treated with oral corticosteroids.
