(secondQuint)Apolipoprotein CIII Reduction Via Colchicine.

 The aim of this proposal will be to show, in a translational fashion, a relationship between colchicine and reduction of factors affecting triglyceride metabolism, especially apoCIII and VLDL levels.

 We envision colchicine as playing a role in identifying and elucidating a new mechanism for lowering TG levels, which may have a great impact on targeting patients who have not met non-HDL goals according to Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII guidelines) or at risk for hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [11].

 We will accomplish this by conducting a prospective cohort clinical trial of low-dose colchicine in hypertriglyceridemic patients to assess percent (%) reduction of apoCIII, VLDL, and TG.

 Secondary endpoints will be to observe the effects of colchicine on apoA, apoB, HDL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and total cholesterol (TC).

The aim of this trial will be to determine an effect-size for the administration of chronic low-dose colchicine in the reduction of serum levels of triglycerides (TG), very-low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) in human subjects over a period of 4-6 weeks.
