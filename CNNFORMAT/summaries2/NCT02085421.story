(fifthQuint)Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Cognitive Remediation Therapy for Psychosis.

 The proposed pilot study is a randomized controlled study to assess effectiveness of tDCS to enhance cognitive remediation therapy in patients with psychotic disorders.

 All patients will participate in cognitive remediation therapy (CRT).

 After initial consent form has been signed, all participants will undergo Matrics Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) testing, Wechsler IQ (Intelligence Quotient) testing, and UPSA evaluation.

 Participants will then complete 3 CRT sessions per week, each lasting one hour, for a total of 12 weeks.

 The CRT will use a commercially available CRT software system such as Cogpack marker software as used by Haut et al, Lumosity or the PositScience software package.

 Each CRT session involves an in-session assessment of skill acquisition, as collected by commercially available CRT software.

 At the completion of each hour long CRT session, participants will also complete an n-back assessment.

 N-back testing will be run using software package E Prime (Psychology Software Tools).

 Patients will be randomized into two arms: active tDCS vs.

 sham tDCS.

 The tDCS will be applied at a current of 1-2mA via two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm x 4.

5 cm) each CRT session.

 The anode will be placed over left DLPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) at F3, according to the 10-20 international system for EEG electrode placement.

 The cathode will be placed over the contralateral supraorbital area.

 This placement is consistent with previous protocols targeting working memory.

 Both active and sham conditions will have identical electrode placement.

 After electrodes have been placed, the participants will be instructed to log into CRT software using a unique patient identifier.

 Once logged in to CRT software they will be instructed to begin the session.

 The tDCS will be applied at a current of 1-2mA via two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm x 4.

5 cm) for the first 15 minutes of each CRT session in the active condition.

 In the sham condition, tDCS will be ramped up to 1-2 mA via two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm x 4.

5 cm) over the first 30 seconds of each CRT session and then turned off.

 Participants will complete the hour long CRT session.

 The software program instruct patient when the end of the session has been reached.

 At the end of each CRT session, the patient will then be instructed to complete an N-back assessment, run by E Prime software.

 At the completion of the 12 weeks of CRT and active vs sham tDCS patients will repeat the UPSA and MCCB.

 Patients will also be asked to return for MCCB and UPSA testing at 3, 6 and 12 month follow up.

 The time commitment of each generally CRT + n-back testing session will be approximately 90 minute.

 Additionally MCCB and UPSA testing will comprise a total of 6.

5 hours.

 IQ testing will comprise approximately 1 hour of testing time.

 The total time commitment will consist of approximately 61.

5 hours.

 tDCS.

 Patients will be randomized into two arms: active tDCS vs.

 sham tDCS.

 The active tDCS will be applied at a current of 1-2 mA (milliamperes) via two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm x 4.

5 cm) applied to the side of the head.

 The investigators hypothesis is that the use of tDCS will enhance the improvement seen with cognitive remediation therapy.
