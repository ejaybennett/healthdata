(secondQuint)Comparison of Analgesic Consumption Between Perioperative v Dexamethasone and Added to Femoral Block.

 Total knee arthroplasty leads to severe postoperative pain.

 for postoperative pain control after total knee arthroplasty oral -intramuscular opioids ,patient controlled analgesia intravenous or epidural opioids, single -continuous femoral nerve block involving techniques are used.

 Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid of high potency and frequently used perioperative.

Dexamethasone to the local anaesthetic solution administered trough in femoral nerve blocks significantly prolonged the analgesic effect of the local anaesthetics used on this blocks.

If the analgesic efficacy of systemic treatment with dexamethasone is similar with the use of perineural wich is the safest way should be preferred for systemic use.

 Comparison of Analgesic Consumption Between Perioperative v Dexamethasone and Added to Femoral Block@highlight

the aim of this study was to investigate compare the effect of peroperative intravenous single dose dexamethasone and the addition of dexamethasone to femoral nerve block on postoperative analgesic consumption and patient comfort in unilateral total knee arthroplasty patients
