(fifthQuint)E-23596 - Use of NCPAP Cycling to Wean Preterm Infants.

 Randomized Controlled Trial to Study the Effect of Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) Cycling on Successful Weaning when Compared with Continuous Nasal Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) in Premature Infants of 25-28 weeks gestations Background: In Canada, preterm babies of 4 and 2) NCPAP pressures equal to 5 cm of water and 3) Supplemental oxygen requirement less than 40% and 4) potential of hydrogen (pH) >7.

25 and 5) Tolerating time off NCPAP well during nursing care.

 Failure Criteria: 1.

 ACoRN respiratory score 5 or increase from previous score by 2 points in a 12 hour period or 2.

 supplemental oxygen more than 50% or 3.

 acidosis with pH1/hour or 5.

 apneic episode requiring Positive Pressure Ventilation with Bag & Mask in a 12 hour period.

 Criteria to Reintubate at any point during the study include 1) Acidosis with pH 7.

2 or two consecutive pH7.

25 or 2) Fractional inspired oxygen more than 50% or Partial pressure of carbon dioxide 70 or 3) Severe recurrent apnea (2 apneas requiring intermittent positive-pressure ventilation).

 Oxygen concentration will be titrated by the clinical team to achieve a transcutaneous oxygen saturation of between 88 and 92% as per the policy in our neonatal intensive care unit.

 Data collection: Primary Outcome: Number of babies who came off the NCPAP at the end of 72 hours of the intervention and remained off NCPAP for 72 hours.

 Secondary Outcome: 1.

 Total duration of NCPAP after the intervention, 2.

 BPD at 36 weeks of post-conceptional age, 3.

 ROP stage 3 and more Additional data collection: gestational age, birth weight, RDS, antenatal steroids, surfactant treatment, sepsis, Intraventricular hemorrhage, Patent ductus arterioses, pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, Necrotizing enterocolitis.

 A data collection form will be used to gather information regarding the antenatal history, birth data, and details of ventilation, details of intervention, complications and outcome.

 Statistical considerations Sample size: Since this was a pilot study the investigators planned to enroll 20 premature infants in each group by randomization.

 The results of this study will help to plan a complete randomized controlled trial.

 For full study sample size estimation: The sample size estimates will be based on the results obtained from our pilot study.

 Data analysis: Data was analyzed using statistical package statistical analysis system (SAS) with the assistance of a biostatistician.

 A test for difference in proportions was performed and a 95% confidence interval for the difference provided.

 Student's t-test was used for continuous variables where the data is normally distributed and Chi square-test for categorical data.

 Ethical Considerations: The study was submitted to the research ethics board of University of Calgary.

 Confidentiality of patient data was enforced throughout the study.

 Study number identified each patient only.

 Written informed consent was obtained from parents prior to enrolment in the study.

 Participation in the study was voluntary and parents were allowed to withdraw their infants at any time during the study period.

 Feasibility of the study: In the year 2009, a total of 110 infants were born between 25 and 28 weeks gestation at Foothills Medical Centre.

 Therefore investigators planned to complete the study within two years.

 E-23596 - Use of NCPAP Cycling to Wean Preterm Infants@highlight

Objective: To compare the effectiveness of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) cycling to continuous NCPAP in successful weaning of preterm infants of 25-28 weeks gestation to nasal prongs.

 Methods: A total of 40 infants with a gestational age (GA) of 25-28 weeks ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and extubated to NCPAP are eligible for the study.

 They will be randomized to NCPAP cycling {Group A; cycling between NCPAP of 4 cm and 1litre per minute of nasal prongs} or to continuous CPAP at 4 cm of water (Group B).

 Primary outcome is the number of babies who came off NCPAP at the end of 72 hours of the intervention and remained off NCPAP for the next 72 hours.

 The duration of NCPAP, Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks post menstrual age and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) stage 3 will be the secondary outcomes.
