(fifthQuint)Cladribine Plus Idarubicin Plus Cytarabine (ARAC) in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (HR MDS) or Myeloid Blast Phase of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML).

 Study Drug Administration: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will receive treatment in 2 different parts: the Induction Cycle and the Consolidation Cycles.

 Participant will have 1 cycle of induction therapy first, followed by up to 5 cycles of consolidation therapy.

 Participant's doctor will tell participant how many cycles participant will have.

 This will be based on any response participant may have to the therapy.

 Each cycle is 28 days.

 During the Induction Cycle, on Days 1-5, participant will receive cladribine and cytarabine by vein over 1-2 hours.

 On Days 1-3, participant will receive idarubicin by vein over 30-60 minutes.

 During the Consolidation Cycles, on Days 1-3, participant will receive cladribine and cytarabine by vein over 1-2 hours.

 On Days 1-2, participant will receive idarubicin by vein over 30-60 minutes.

 If you have a certain type of AML, participant may take midostaurin by mouth 2 times a day on Days 6-20 of Induction and Consolidation.

 Participant's doctor will discuss this option with participant.

 Midostaurin should be taken with food.

 If the disease has not started to get better after the first cycle, participant may receive an additional induction cycle, followed by 4 consolidation cycles.

 If participant misses a dose of study drug and the doctor approves, participant may make it up within 7 days after the first dose.

 If participant misses a dose, it is very important participant tells the doctor as soon as possible.

 The doctor will tell participant if participant can "make up" the dose or if participant should wait and take your next dose as scheduled.

 Study Visits: At the beginning of every cycle, participant will have a physical exam.

 Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests at least 1 time a week.

 If the disease starts to get better, the blood draws will happen every 2-4 weeks while participant is taking the study drug.

 After participant's last dose of study drug, the blood draws will happen every 4-8 weeks as long as participant is on study.

 On Day 28 (+/- 7 days) of the first cycle participant will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate to check the status of the disease.

 Participant may have another bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate later in the study if participant's doctor thinks it is needed.

 During treatment, participant will come to the clinic at least 1 time each week for the first month and then at least 1 time a month after that until you stop treatment.

 If the study doctor thinks it is needed, participant may have additional clinic visits after participant stops treatment.

 Length of Treatment: Participant may continue taking the study drugs for up to 6 cycles.

 Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions.

 Participation on the study will be over when participant has completed follow-up.

 Follow-Up Visits: After participant's last dose of study drug, participant will be called every 6 -12 months by a member of the study staff to ask about any side effects participant may be having.

 The phone call should take about 5-10 minutes.

 Participant will continue to be called for as long as possible.

 Participant will continue to have blood (about 2 tablespoons) drawn for routine tests every 4-8 weeks while participant is on study.

 Participant may also need to have additional blood draws as part of participant's standard of care.

 Cladribine Plus Idarubicin Plus Cytarabine (ARAC) in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (HR MDS) or Myeloid Blast Phase of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of cladribine, idarubicin, and cytarabine can help to control AML, high risk MDS, and/or CML in blast phase.

 Midostaurin may also be added to the combination for patients with a specific type of AML and the affect on the disease will be studied.

 The safety of these drugs will also be studied.

 This is an investigational study.

 Cladribine, cytarabine, and idarubicin are all FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of different kinds of leukemia Midostaurin is FDA approved and commercially available to treat a specific type of AML in combination with chemotherapy.

 It is investigational to use these drugs in combination with each other.

 The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

 Up to 308 patients will take part in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
