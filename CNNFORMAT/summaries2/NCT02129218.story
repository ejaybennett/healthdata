(thirdQuint)Low Glycemic Load Diet in Patients With Stage I-III Colon Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the feasibility of following a low or medium glycemic load diet in patients with stage I-III (local-regional) colon cancer.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine patient-reported acceptability of diet.

 II.

 To determine nutritionist resources utilized.

 III.

 To evaluate the effect of lowering dietary glycemic load on body mass index (BMI), lipid metabolism and pro-oncogenic intermediaries of cellular metabolism.

 OUTLINE: Patients are sequentially enrolled in 1 of 4 possible cohorts as needed based on the feasibility of the prior cohort.

 COHORT 1: Patients follow a low glycemic load diet with standard dietary intervention (contact with nutritionist in person every 2 weeks with phone contact on the alternating weeks) for 12 weeks.

 COHORT 2: Patients follow a low glycemic load diet with intensified dietary intervention (contact with nutritionist in person every week) for 12 weeks.

 COHORT 3: Patients follow a medium glycemic load diet with standard dietary intervention for 12 weeks.

 COHORT 4: Patients follow a medium glycemic load diet with intensified dietary intervention for 12 weeks.

 Low Glycemic Load Diet in Patients With Stage I-III Colon Cancer@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies the feasibility of a low glycemic load diet in patients with stage I-III colon cancer.

 A low glycemic load diet includes foods that have low scores on the glycemic index.

 The glycemic index is a scale that measures how much a certain carbohydrate causes a person's blood sugar to rise.

 A low glycemic load diet may help decrease the chance of cancer coming back and improve the survival in patients with colon cancer.
