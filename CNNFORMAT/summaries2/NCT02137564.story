(thirdQuint)Gamma Secretase Inhibitor PF-03084014 in Treating Patients With AIDS-Associated Kaposi Sarcoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the tolerance and clinical response of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) tumors to PF-03084014 (gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014) with assessments of partial response (PR) and complete response (CR).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess the effect of PF-03084014 on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load in plasma and the effect of PF-03084014 on cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ cell number.

 II.

 Assess the effect of PF-030840414 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tumors on Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latent and lytic gene expression.

 III.

 Assess effects of PF-03084014 on activation of Notch target genes including tumor-associated endothelial-mesenchymal transition and cell proliferation markers.

 IV.

 Assess effects of trough PF-03084014 drug levels on clinical response and toxicity.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients with PR, CR, or stable disease (SD) at the end of 4 courses may receive an additional 4 courses of gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.

 Gamma Secretase Inhibitor PF-03084014 in Treating Patients With AIDS-Associated Kaposi Sarcoma@highlight

This phase II trial studies the effects, good and bad, of gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 and to see how well it works in treating patients with acquired immune deficiency virus (AIDS)-associated Kaposi sarcoma.

 Gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and may shrink the tumor.
