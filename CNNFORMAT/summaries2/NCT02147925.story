(secondQuint)Efficacy Study of Liraglutide vs.

Sitagliptin vs.

 Glargine on Liver Fat in T2DM Subjects.

 This is a 26-week, randomized, open-label, active controlled, parallel group, multi-centre trial.

To compare the change of intrahepatic lipids (IHL) as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy(MRS) or MRI estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) as measured by MRI IDEAL IQ (Iterative Decomposition of water andfat with Echo Asymmetryand Least-squares estimation) in type 2 diabetic patients with non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease after a 26-week treatment of liraglutide, sitagliptin or insulin glargine per day combined with metformin.

The primary endpoint will be defined by intrahepatic lipids (IHL) as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) or MRI-PDFF as measured by MRI IDEAL IQ.

 Glargine on Liver Fat in T2DM Subjects@highlight

The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of liraglutide combined with metformin in non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to sitagliptin and insulin glargine in combination with metformin.
