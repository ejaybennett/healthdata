(secondQuint)Treatment of Chronic Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS) With the EkoSonic Endovascular System.

 The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasound accelerated thrombolysis using the EkoSonic(R) Endovascular System with standard infusion of a thrombolytic drug for PTS and chronic DVT.

 Clinical effectiveness will be evaluated using a standard measure of severity of post-thrombotic syndrome over a year.
