(fifthQuint)Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application.

 The investigators developed and tested the feasibility of Habit, a weight loss mobile app that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems.

 In a pilot trial in 43 obese participants, investigators tested the feasibility of the Habit mobile application when paired with a shortened (8 week) behavioral weight loss intervention.

 Feasibility outcomes included frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention.

 The investigators also performed analyses on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8 and 16 weeks, which will inform a subsequent randomized controlled efficacy trial.

 Data will support an efficacy trial of a Habit-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone with 1 year follow-up.

 The investigators overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden reach.

 Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application@highlight

The purpose of this research was to develop and test the feasibility of Habit, a weight loss mobile application that was designed to coach patients through their weight loss challenges.

 In a pilot trial in 43 obese participants, investigators tested the feasibility of the Smart Coach mobile application when paired with a shortened online-delivered (8-week) behavioral weight loss intervention.

 Feasibility outcomes included frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention.

 Post-intervention focus groups discussed the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.

 The investigators also performed exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8 and 16 weeks, which will inform a subsequent randomized controlled efficacy trial.
