(thirdQuint)Use of Inhaled Nitric Oxide to Prevent Pulmonary Hypertension Associated to Stored Blood Transfusion.

 Patients will be randomized into one of the three groups: I.

 Blood transfusion stored for less than 10 days II.

 Blood transfusion stored for more than 30 days III.

 Blood transfusion stored for more than 30 days days plus inhalation of Nitric Oxide at 80 part per million for an hour during blood transfusion.

The objective of this study is to assess if prolonged storage time of a packed red blood cell unit may cause pulmonary vasoconstriction after transfusion, in a susceptible population such as cardiac surgery patients.

 The investigators will also evaluate the potential reversal effect of Inhaled Nitric Oxide on pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by stored blood transfusions.
