(thirdQuint)Treatment Protocol of Child SAA With the Injection of Mesenchymal Stem CellsUmbilical Cord Derived.

 1.

 Mesenchymal Stem Cells were prepared by in vitro separation, screening, and culture from healthy human umbilical cord tissue; The " injection of mesenchymal stem cells (umbilical) manufacturing and verification regulation " was also formulated.

 2.

 The starting dose of Umbilical Cord Derived MSC was 0.

5-1.

0 * 106 cells /kg, based on the previous human studies; And the maximum tolerated dose was 1 * 107 cells /kg 3.

 The response and complete remission rate, relapse rate of the injection of Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (or combined with ATG ) for Child with SAA were determined.

Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) is a non Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC) in adult bone marrow and takes part in the bone marrow microenvironment.

 The response rate of early treatment on Children's SAA application combined with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) (40-50 days after ATG treatment) is associated with long-term effect.

 The injection of Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells combined with ATG improves the efficacy of children with SAA.
