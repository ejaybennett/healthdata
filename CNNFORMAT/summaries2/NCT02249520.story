(fifthQuint)Calibration of PET-MR Imaging Protocols on Biograph mMR.

 PET-MR Protocol on the Biograph mMR: This protocol requires the use of a radioisotope.

 To avoid administering radioisotope solely for the purposes of this calibration, we will recruit 20 patients from the clinical population at the S.

 Mark Taper Foundation Imaging Center at CSMC who are already receiving an isotope dose for their standard-of-care examination and are willing to be scanned at the Research Imaging Core on the same day right after their clinical exam.

 Subjects who are having a PET-MR after receiving FDG will have the same body part scanned as they did for clinical testing.

 MR-only Protocol on the Biograph mMR:To set up MR-only protocols, we will enroll 20 volunteers for MR-only on the mMR scanner.

 This is a standard MR scan with no isotope involved.

 Those volunteers who are participating in the MR-only scan will have major body parts and organs scanned as needed for calibration.

 Calibration of PET-MR Imaging Protocols on Biograph mMR@highlight

This is an extended pilot protocol to facilitate on-site calibration of the technical aspects of the new Siemens Biograph mMR (molecular MR) Positron Emission Tomography-Magnetic Resonance (PET-MR) scanner at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) Biomedical Imaging Research Institute (BIRI) Research Imaging Core after scanner installation.

 The mMR is a FDA-approved standard clinical device (non-experimental) and will be used in accordance with clearance and approval from the FDA.
