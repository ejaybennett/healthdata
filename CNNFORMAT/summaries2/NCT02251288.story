(fifthQuint)A Phase I Study Priming With an Inactivated A/H7N9 Influenza Virus Vaccine With or Without MF59 Adjuvant Followed by Live Attenuated A/H7N9 Influenza Virus Vaccine.

 The study will be conducted as a Phase I prospective, randomized study in healthy adult subjects at a single center.

 Adult subjects age 18 to 47 years and meeting all enrollment criteria will choose to participate as subjects who receive unadjuvanted or adjuvanted H7H9 pIIV vaccine followed by a live vaccine boost at 4 weeks (Group 1, n=24), 12 weeks (Group 2, n=24), or 24 weeks (Group 3, n=24), or to be in an observational group (Group 4, n=16) which will not be scheduled for a booster dose but may serve as a roll-over group for subjects who withdraw prior to the second vaccination but agree to remain in follow-up.

 Within each group, subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of either unadjuvanted H7N9 pIIV at 15 mcg (Subgroup A), or the same vaccine adjuvanted with the oil-in-water emulsion, MF59, (Subgroup B) delivered intramuscularly.

 Finally, a fifth group (Group 5, n=12) will receive two intramuscular doses of adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV separated by four weeks.

 The total duration of study participation for all subjects will be approximately 13 months.

 Recruitment, enrollment and administration of study product will be suspended when one of the following occurs in the clinical or research laboratory at the clinical site: at least two respiratory cultures or PCR assays are determined to be positive for influenza or at least 10% diagnostic tests (rapid tests, respiratory cultures or PCR assays) performed for influenza as positive during two consecutive weeks in the clinical or research laboratory at the clinical site.

 Recruitment, enrollment and administration of study product may be resumed after 2 weeks without a signal that influenza is still circulating in the community, as defined by the same measures that indicate the start of influenza season (i.

e.

, less than 2 respiratory cultures or PCR assays are determined to positive for influenza or less than 10% of diagnostic tests performed or influenza with positive results).
