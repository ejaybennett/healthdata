(secondQuint)FSH Treatment for Non-obstructive Azoospermic Patients.

 Preliminary reports showed that hormonal treatment may improve the chance of retrieving viable testicular sperm from men with NOA, but no RCT are available in the field.

 This randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial sought to evaluate whether the testicular sperm retrieval rate could result higher in NOA patients treated with follicle-stimulating hormone compared to placebo-treated NOA subjects.
