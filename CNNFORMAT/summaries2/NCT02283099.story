(fifthQuint)Phase I Trial to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity of a Ebola Virus Vaccine (rVSVG-ZEBOV-GP).

 This study is being conducted to assess safety and immunogenicity of an experimental ebola vaccine.

 An outbreak due to the Ebola Zaire (ZEBOV) strain of unprecedented magnitude and scope and with a high mortality continues to spread across West Africa.

 No vaccine is currently licensed.

 The specific opportunity at hand with rVSVG-ZEBOV-GP (BPSC1001) is to achieve long-lasting protective immunity to ZEBOV on a time scale of weeks in humans upon a single-shot vaccination, offering a discrete benefit over prime-boost vaccination protocols.

 The current outbreak represents a global health emergency and the need for access to therapeutic intervention and vaccines is paramount.

 The vaccine investigated in this study might provide a critical tool to suppress future out-breaks of EVD in areas at risk.

 This study is 1 of 4 clinical trials currently conducted as part of the WHO-led VEBCON consortium, aiming to generate harmonized data for the rVSVG-ZEBOV-GP (BPSC1001) vaccine candidate to allow optimized rapid decisions on dose and safety.

The study is designed to establish safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of rVSVG-ZEBOV-GP (BPSC1001), an Ebola Virus Vaccine candidate (recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the envelope glycoprotein of Ebola Virus Zaire), investigated at three different dose levels in 30 healthy adults in Germany.

 This study is part of the WHO led VEBCON consortium that is aiming to generate harmonized data for the rVSVG-ZEBOV-GP (BPSC1001) vaccine candidate to allow optimized rapid decisions on dose and safety.
