(firstQuint)Acid Base Balance of ICU Patients With Severe Hypoalbuminemia, Before and After an Albumin Infusion, Using Stewart Approach.

 Prospective study, for ICU patient with severe hypoalbuminemia < 20g/L, determining biological parameters from Stewart approach for acid base disorders (pH, SIDe, SIDa, SIG, Atot, PaCO2) before, and at 1hour, 2hours and 24 hours after a 200mL 20% human albumin perfusion (the consensus conference ANAES of 1995 recommands to correct hypoalbuminemia below 20g/L).

 Clinical parameters (respiratory, haemodynamic, neurologic) were also collected at the same times.

The primary purpose was to describe the acid base balance of ICU patients with severe hypoalbuminemia using Stewart's approach for acid base disorders, before and after an human albumin perfusion.
