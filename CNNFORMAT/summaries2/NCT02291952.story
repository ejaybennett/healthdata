(firstQuint)Development of Countermeasures Against Adverse Metabolic Effects of Shift Work.

 Shift work is associated with circadian misalignment and an increased risk for the development diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.

 This research will determine whether changing the feeding schedule can prevent metabolic alterations that can lead to the abovementioned disorders.

 This research will provide mechanistic insight and may provide a novel therapeutic approach against the increased risk for diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease among shift workers.
