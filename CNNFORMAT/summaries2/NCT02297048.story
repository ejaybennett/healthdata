(thirdQuint)Monocentric STUDY, Randomised Double Blinded (Healthy Subjects, or Transversal (Patients With Gitelman Syndrome).

 The investigators will study the adaptation of steroidogenesis to potassium depletion in healthy volunteer, and the role of progesterone in renal adaptation to potassium depletion.

 Practically, healthy volunteers will be submitted twice to two periods of normal Na+/ high K+ diet (control period) followed by a normal Na+/ low K+ diet sustained by a pharmacological treatment with Kayexalate (K+-depleted condition).

 The subjects will be treated with either RU486 or a placebo, according to a randomization.

 The adrenal response will be evaluated after stimulation by Synacthen at baseline and at the end of each experimental period.

 A Synacthen test will be also done in 10 patients suffering of chronic hypokalemia linked to a hereditary tubulopathy inducing renal K+ leak called Gitelman syndrome and their plasma steroid profile will be established.

Progesterone is needed to permit adaptation of the kidney to limit potassium loss in the urines.

 The investigators wonder whether progesterone or other adrenal hormon play the same role.

 The investigators will investigate surrenal hormone production in healthy subjects under a 7-day potassium depleted diet and in patients chronically hypokalaemic due to a renal loss of potassium.
