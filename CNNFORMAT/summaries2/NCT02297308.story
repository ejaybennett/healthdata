(secondQuint)A Retrospective Study Evaluating the Use of the SoloPath Sheath in Reducing Vascular and Bleeding Complications.

 This study is intended to collect data on the rate of vascular complications in subjects having transfemoral TAVI when the SoloPath(R) Balloon Expandable TransFemoral Introducer is used as a guide for introduction and delivery of TAVI devices.

 The use of a small profile sheath could possibly reduce the incidence of post procedure vascular complications associated with TAVI and further enhance the safety of accessing the femoral delivery route.

 In addition, this study will examine the impact of arterial morphology and other subject risk factors as a predictor of clinical outcomes within 30 days following TAVI.
