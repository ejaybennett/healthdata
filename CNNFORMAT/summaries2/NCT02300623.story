(fifthQuint)Intermittent ART in Primary HIV Infection.

 The study design included two phases.

 The first phase consisted in four STI of 8 weeks each (off-ART), separated by 16 weeks of treatment -or the time necessary to reach again to PVL <20 copies/mL- (on-ART).

 At the end of the 4th off-ART cycle (week 0) an interim evaluation was performed and the second phase initiated.

 During the second phase, the first 6 patients received ART until they reach PVL<20 copies/mL, discontinuing thereafter (final stop).

 The last 6 patients received ART and low doses of IL-2.

 ARV therapy was stopped after reaching PVL<20 copies/mL (final stop) and IL-2 after 6 months of treatment.

 IL-2 was prescribed at a dose of 750.

000 UI/m2 daily and was self-administrated in all patients previous trained by a specialized nurse.

 ART was resumed in patient dropping CD4 cell count less than 350 cell/mm3 in two consecutive determinations or in patients who developed opportunistic infections.

 A long term follow up analysis was performed at 3, 6 and 9 years since the final stop.

 It included time to resume ART, clinical events, survival rate, CD4-CD8-CD4/CD8 ratio.

 Intermittent ART in Primary HIV Infection@highlight

Interventions during primary HIV infection (PHI) can modify the immune control and the clinical evolution during the chronic phase.

 Although several studies suggest the benefit of antiretroviral treatment (ART) during PHI, indication of ART is still not universally recommended.

 The investigators randomized patients with PHI, with a favourable immunological profile and well controlled on ART, to undergone structured treatment interruptions alone or with low doses of IL-2, stopping ART thereafter.

 The endpoints were immune control of HIV replication and time to resume ART.

 Immunological profile, specific CD4 and CD8 responses and clinical data were analysed for both groups up to 48 weeks, and during a long follow-up, up to nine years since final ART stop.
