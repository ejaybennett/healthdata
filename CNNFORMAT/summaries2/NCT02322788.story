5 mg Dose Levels, to Allow for a Switch From Bricanyl Turbuhaler M2 to Bricanyl Turbuhaler M3.

 The study will include female and male patients, between 18 and 65 years old, with stable, mild to moderate asthma who are on short acting 2-agonist (SABA) alone, on low dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (200-400 mu g budesonide or corresponding) or on a combination of low dose ICS and long acting 2-agonists (LABA).

 Approximately 60 patients will be randomised in order to have 49 completed.

 The primary objective is to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence between Bricanyl Turbuhaler M3 and Bricanyl Turbuhaler M2 using bronchoprotective effect.

 Outcome measure: PC20 (Methacholine provocative concentration causing a 20% drop in FEV1).

 The safety objective is to compare safety of Bricanyl Turbuhaler M2 and Bricanyl Turbuhaler M3.

 Outcome measure Adverse Events/Serious.

 Study period Q1 2015 - Q1 2016.
