(firstQuint)Incorporation of Patient Reported Outcomes Data in the Care of US Veterans With Rheumatoid Arthritis.

 This is a randomized, controlled, single-blinded study that compares outcome data in patients for whom PRO data either is or is not made available to the treating physician.

 The question addressed by this proposal is whether patient reported outcome (PRO) data change patient's outcomes.

 The hypothesis is that the availability of these data in the form of the patient-completed MDHAQ/RAPID3 questionnaire will change patient-centric outcomes such as patient reported well-being, patient satisfaction and medication compliance.
