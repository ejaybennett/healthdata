(fifthQuint)Investigation of the Effect of 8-week Controlled High Intense Interval Training in Type 2 Diabetic Patients.

 Type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be defined as a bihormonal metabolic disorder characterised by insufficient insulin secretion and abnormal glucagon secretion.

 It is however well established that physical activity per se improves glucose and may postpone or even slow down in the diabetic population.

 Glycaemic control may be improved more by high intensity interval training than by intensities from existing recommended guidelines.

 Additionally, there seems to be accumulating evidence that high intensity interval training induces increased overall fat and abdominal fat mass loss as opposed to traditional continuous endurance training Therefore we hypothesise that 3 weekly sessions of high intensity interval training (10*60 sec.

 at an intensity inducing 90% of maximal heart frequency with a recovery of 60 sec.

 between each bout) over 8 weeks improves overall glycaemic control (glucose, insulin and glucagon), inflammatory status (interleukins, cytokines, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules) and blood flow (NO and PGI2 vasodilatory capabilities).

The overall objective of this study is to examine the blood flow in the thigh muscles and sugar metabolism before and after 8 weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) on a bicycle ergometer in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and matched controls.

 The following parameters are included in the assessment: - Sugar Metabolism - Muscle and fat mass - The blood flow at rest around the thigh muscles - Oxygen uptake test on a bicycle ergometer and 5 km time trial
