(secondQuint)Triple Combination Therapy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Who Had Inadequate Glycemic Control With Combination Therapy.

 Dual combination therapy with metformin and sulphonylurea is the most commonly used combination regimen to treat patients with type 2 diabetes.

 But, treatment with the dual combination therapy is often unsuccessful at achieving glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

 Recently, various oral hypoglycemic agents were developed including dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV inhibitor, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor and new peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) agonists.

 But, there have been few studies about the glucose lowering effect of these drugs in Type 2 diabetes patients on the dual combination therapy with a sulfonylurea agent and metformin.

 Hence, the researchers plan to investigate the efficacy and safety of these drugs in combination with a sulfonylurea agent and metformin in type 2 diabetic patients.
