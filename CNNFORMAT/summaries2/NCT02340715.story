(secondQuint)Advanced MRI Sequences for Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning.

 The results of this research project will be used to establish a standard MRI protocol specific to each tumor or disease site.

 An MRI protocol is a list of MR image types that are acquired for each disease site.

 These images are used to generate the patient's treatment plan.
