(secondQuint)Activity for Diabetic Polyneuropathy.

 Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects over 8% of Americans, and half will develop peripheral neuropathy, a progressive injury to the very longest nerves of the body.

 Our previous research has found that neuropathy can be detected early in its course and followed by examining nerves that reach to the skin using a small punch biopsy.

 These cutaneous nerves can be injured by high blood glucose, obesity and high triglycerides, but have the potential to regrow in response to treatments that improve these metabolic conditions.

 The proposed study will randomize participants with mild to moderate diabetic peripheral neuropathy to receive either generic annual counseling or an integrated program of moderate supervised exercise and actigraphy based anti sedentariness counseling.

The proposed study will randomize participants with diabetic peripheral neuropathy into two groups.

 One group of participants will receive standard-of-care counseling while the other group will undergo supervised exercise and counseling to increase physical activity.
