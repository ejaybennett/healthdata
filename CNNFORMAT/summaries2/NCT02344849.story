(firstQuint)Safety of Autologous Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Erectile Dysfunction.

 Cellgram-ED is autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells ex vivo expanded for approximately 30 days.

 Ten patients (Diabetes -associated ED; 5 patients, Postprostatectomy; 5patients) will be injected Cellgram-ED directly into the intracavernous.

 Patient will be evaluated the safety and potential efficacy of MSC.
