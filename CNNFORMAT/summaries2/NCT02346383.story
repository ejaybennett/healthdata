(firstQuint)Optimal Stimulation Programming for Spinal Peripheral Neuromodulation.

 Prospective double-blinded trial of patients already implanted with SCS to determine which programming model best controls their back and or leg pain.

 Baseline visit is 2 weeks after implant.

 Baseline study data is collected, program #1 is started.

 The visit @ week 4 collects NRS and stimulator data, changes to program #2.

 The visit @ week 6 collect NRS and stimulator data, and starts program #3.

 The visit @ week 8 collects NRS and stimulator data.

 Subject chooses their preferred program from the previous 3 and uses that for the next 12 weeks.

 The visit @ week 20 collects NRS and stimulator data and final study visit information.
