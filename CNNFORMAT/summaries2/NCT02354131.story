(fifthQuint)Niraparib Versus Niraparib-bevacizumab Combination in Women With Platinum-sensitive Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.

 Part 1: This is a single-centre, phase 1a, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab-niraparib combination and determine the RP2D in patients with platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

 The standard 3+3 design will be used.

 Part 2: (n=94) This multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized phase 2 study is evaluating the efficacy of niraparib against niraparib-bevacizumab combination in Women with platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

 Stratification: Patients are stratified according to: 1.

 HRD status (positive/negative) 2.

 Treatment-Free interval to prior therapy (6-12 months > 12 months) Randomization: 1:1 randomization Study arms: Patients are randomized to one of the two treatment arms: Arm 1: Niraparib monotherapy until progression.

 Arm 2: Niraparib-bevacizumab combination therapy until progression.

 Niraparib Versus Niraparib-bevacizumab Combination in Women With Platinum-sensitive Epithelial Ovarian Cancer@highlight

Part 1 (Phase 1): safety and tolerability of bevacizumab-Niraparib combination Part 2 (Randomized Phase 2): to compare Progression-Free Survival (PFS) PARP inhibitors are active as monotherapy to treat patients with recurrent ovarian cancer; the strongest activity being observed in the platinum sensitive, gBRCAmut subgroup as well as in gBRCAwt, HRD population but also in HRD negative disease.

 In the same population there is level one evidence that bevacizumab is beneficial.

 And a phase two randomized study has indicated that combination of a PARP inhibitor with anti-angiogenic drug is superior to PARP inhibitor alone.

 The question is: Is niraparib combined with bevacizumab superior to niraparib? The comparison of tolerability and efficacy of niraparib-bevacizumab combination against niraparib.
