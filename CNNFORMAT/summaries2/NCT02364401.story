(fifthQuint)Impedance vs.

 Contact Force Guided Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Using Automated Annotation System.

 During atrial fibrillation ablation, the location where ablation is conducted is displayed through annotation tags using 3D system to recognize energy delivery is done at the area.

 However this annotation method was unable to identify how effectively the ablation is done.

 To remedy this disadvantage, automated annotation system (VisiTag cent module, Biosense Webster, Inc.

, Diamond Bar, CA) was recently developed to make an automatic annotation when all pre-defined criteria are satisfied.

 But study on the clinical effects of this system is insufficient.

 The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation between contact force-guided and impedance-guided annotation using automated annotation system.

 Contact Force Guided Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Using Automated Annotation System@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation between contact force-guided and impedance-guided annotation using automated annotation system (Visitag cent ).

 Patients who receive atrial fibrillation ablation are randomly assigned in the same number to two groups with impedance guided ablation and contact force guided ablation using contact force sensing catheter (THERMOCOOL(R) SMARTTOUCH cent catheter, Biosense Webster, Inc.

, Diamond Bar, CA).
