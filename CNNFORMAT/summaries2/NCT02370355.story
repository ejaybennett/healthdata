(fifthQuint)Molecular Characterization of CTCs and ctDNA in Blood and Plasma Samples From Patients With Metastatic and/or Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Perform molecular analysis of plasma samples from 25 patients with metastatic prostate cancer collected before and during treatment of the disease with abiraterone acetate (Zytiga) or enzalutamide (Xtandi).

 II.

 Perform molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and plasma collected from 75 patients with progressing advanced metastatic prostate cancer.

 OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on the timing of specimen collection.

 GROUP I: Previously collected plasma samples are analyzed for ctDNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next generation sequencing (NSG).

 GROUP II: Patients undergo collection of blood samples before and following systemic therapy for analysis of CTC enumeration, ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression, and ctDNA via PCR and NSG.

 Molecular Characterization of CTCs and ctDNA in Blood and Plasma Samples From Patients With Metastatic and/or Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer@highlight

This research trial studies molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor (ct) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in blood and plasma samples from patients with prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body and/or has not responded to previous treatment with hormones.

 Studying samples of blood and plasma collected from patients with prostate cancer before, during, and/or after treatment in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify the development of drug resistance.
