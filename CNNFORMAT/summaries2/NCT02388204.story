(fifthQuint)Spinal Cord Stimulation for the Treatment of Motor and Nonmotor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease.

 Background: Currently there are no available Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy can really stop disease progression.

 Although Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) improves patient's quality of life by addressing the cardinal symptoms and reducing Levodopa motor complications, non motor symptoms still increasing over time.

 Gait problems as falls and freezing are important cause of disability and incapacity.

 Novel therapeutics approaches are needed to restore quality of life.

 Data from animal PD model suggest that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) can enhance locomotion in mice.

 Although clinical results, mostly from case reports, in PD patients are still conflicting, a few patients benefited from SCS in thoracic levels.

 Aim: Evaluated Spinal cord stimulation effects in locomotion, gait, freezing and falls in PD patient's.

 Method: 20 PD patients will undergo thoracic spinal cord stimulation with high frequency in a prospective study for six months.

 Gait and freezing evaluation will consists in: timed up and go test, timed up and go test with dual task, 20 m walk test, 20 m walk test with obstacle, freezing of gait scale and falls scale.

 PDQ 39 and Schwab and England scales will be used to measure quality of life.

 Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale for motor symptoms and general evaluation.

 All tests will be done before surgery, after one week, one, three, six months.

 All patients will be stimulated with the same parameters: High frequencies and 90 mcs pulse width and the sensory threshold will be measured.

 At the third month the parameters of SCS will be changed and comparative tested for low frequency in a double blind trail.

 Spinal Cord Stimulation for the Treatment of Motor and Nonmotor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease@highlight

Although DBS improves patient's quality of life advanced Parkinson's patients (PD) by addressing the cardinal symptoms and reducing levodopa motor complications, symptoms still worsen over time.

 Postural problems, frequent falls, freezing of gait impairment and other locomotion difficulties still remain as important causes of disability and incapacity.

 Novel therapeutics approaches are needed to restore quality of life (QoL).

 This study aims to explore the effects of spinal cord stimulation in locomotion, falls and freezing of gait in advanced PD patients.

 Twenty PD patients will undergo thoracic spinal cord stimulation at high frequencies in a prospective study for six months.

 Changes in locomotion capacity and freezing of gait rating will be the primary out come.

 Secondary outcomes will be: QoL and common motor outcome measures in PD patients.

 Always comparing the status before, one, three and six months after stimulation was initiated.

 A double blind trial will be performed within three months of follow up (high X low frequency stimulation).
