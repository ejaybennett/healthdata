(thirdQuint)Elucidating the Influence of Lactulose Intake on the Gut Microbiota Composition.

 This is a clinical study for investigating the influence of lactulose on the composition and metabolic activities of the intestinal microbiota.

 We will recruit 40 healthy volunteers.

 Subjects will be randomized and receive either 50g lactose (intervention group) or 50g sucrose (control group).

 Subjects will donate fecal samples 24h before and after (1-2d, 14d) lactulose ingestion.

 After ingestion H2-in expiratory air and symptoms will be followed for 3 hours.

 Frozen samples will be analyzed for their microbiota composition and key metabolites.

 Elucidating the Influence of Lactulose Intake on the Gut Microbiota Composition@highlight

This study will test the influence of lactulose of the human gut microbiota.

 Healthy volunteers will ingest 50g of lactulose and donate stool samples 1 day before as well as 1-2 days and 14 days after the test.

 Using sequencing and metabolomics techniques the investigators will identify changes in microbiota composition upon lactulose exposure.
