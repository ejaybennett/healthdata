(firstQuint)PREA, PK And Safety PASS Study Of IV Pantoprazole In Pediatric Subjects.

 In hospitalized pediatric subjects, age 1 to 16 years who in the judgment of the investigator are candidates for acid suppression therapy, the following are the objectives of this trial: Primary Objectives To characterize the PK profile of single and repeated IV doses of pantoprazole in pediatric subjects aged 1 < to less than 2 years old.

 To characterize the PK profile of single and repeated IV doses of pantoprazole in pediatric subjects aged 2 to 16 years old.

 Secondary Objectives To determine the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of IV pantoprazole in each of the independent age cohorts over 7 days.

 To assess the CYP2C19 genotype in pediatric subjects receiving IV pantoprazole, to determine the presence of the gene for the major enzyme responsible for metabolism of pantoprazole.
