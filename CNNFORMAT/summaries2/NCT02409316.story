(secondQuint)[18F]FES PET/CT in Endocrine Refractory Breast Cancer.

 This study will evaluate [18F]FES PET/CT uptake as a predictor of progression free survival in endocrine refractory recurrent or metastatic breast cancer patients starting a new therapy regimen including endocrine targeted therapy.

 Imaging will occur prior to starting new therapy.

 Some patients may also undergo a second FES PET/CT scan at the time of suspected progression of disease to compare for changes in FES uptake measures.

 This is an observational study in that [18F]FES PET/CT will not be used to direct therapy decisions.

 [18F]FES PET/CT in Endocrine Refractory Breast Cancer@highlight

In this study, positron emission tomography (PET/CT) imaging will be used to evaluate estrogen receptor (ER) activity in sites of metastatic disease using the investigational radiotracer [18F]fluoroestradiol (FES).
