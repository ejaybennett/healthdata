(thirdQuint)Mechanisms of Mindfulness and Stress Resilience: A Mobile App Mindfulness Training Study.

 Mindfulness meditation practices are widely used among the general public, with people seeking to reduce stress, pain, inflammation, depression, and disease symptoms.

 Moreover, randomized controlled trials have shown mindfulness training programs to be effective in improving a broad range of psychological and physical health outcomes, particularly among populations with high stress burdens.

 Still, little is known about the mechanisms underlying mindfulness training that drive these effects.

 This study tests the active components of mindfulness that impact stress responding and health biomarkers.

 The study separates attention and acceptance mindfulness instructions into three 14-day training programs delivered to a stressed adult population: (1) attention and acceptance instructions, (2) attentional monitoring instructions only, or (3) analytic thinking with no mindfulness instruction.

 Intervention programs are delivered on participants' own smartphones, providing a platform for maximal experimental control in testing the active ingredients of mindfulness training.

 Participants are recruited from the Pittsburgh community.

 At a baseline laboratory session, they complete psychosocial questionnaires and tasks and provide a dried blood spot sample.

 On their own, they complete pre- and post-intervention Ecological Momentary Assessment measures of stress, attention, and acceptance in daily life.

 Between these assessments, participants have 14 days to complete their randomly assigned 14-lesson intervention program.

 Participants return to the lab for post-intervention assessments (questionnaires, tasks, dried blood sample), listen to a final training session from their intervention program, and complete the Trier Social Stress Test.

 Participants are compensated.

 Mechanisms of Mindfulness and Stress Resilience: A Mobile App Mindfulness Training Study@highlight

The purpose of this study is to test the active components of mindfulness meditation for reducing psychological stress and improving biomarkers of health.

 This study compares the effects of three brief trainings: (1) training in both present-moment attention and mindful acceptance, (2) training in present-focused attention, and (3) an active psychological training with no mindfulness content.
