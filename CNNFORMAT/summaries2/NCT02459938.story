(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy of ZP-Glucagon to Injectable Glucagon for Hypoglycemia.

 The purpose of this study is to compare ZP-Glucagon transdermal patch system at doses of 0.

5 mg and 1 mg to glucagon by injection at doses of 0.

5 mg and 1 mg by means of a 4 way crossover open label design.

 Eligible subjects giving informed consent will be randomised to a treatment sequence of each of the four treatments in one week intervals.

 At each treatment visit, subjects will undergo an insulin induction procedure designed to safely induce hypoglycemia, and then have a treatment applied, either by injection or by patch, and then monitored for return to normoglycemia.
