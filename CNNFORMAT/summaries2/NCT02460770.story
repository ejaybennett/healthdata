 Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) Administration in Weaning From Left Ventricular Assist Device@highlight

Left Ventricular Assist Devices are commonly used to assist failing hearts as a bridge to transplantation or for long-term support.

 The purpose of the MESenchymal stem cell therapy and Left Ventricular Assist Device program is to improve heart function with stem cell therapy and attempt to wean patients from HeartMate Left Ventricular Assist Device.
