(fifthQuint)Cervical Pessary vs Vaginal Progesterone in Preventing Preterm Birth Among Women Presenting With Short Cervix: An Open-label Randomized Controlled Trial.

 Preterm birth represents a major challenge to obstetricians as well as healthcare policy makers.

 It is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality among singleton and multiple pregnancies.

 In the USA, the frequency of of preterm births (25mm) between 18-22 weeks, the use of cervical pessary significantly prolonged pregnancy and reduced the rate of poor neonatal outcome compared with control, untreated patients.

 A second, and smaller, RCT failed to corroborate the findings previously described.

 In this study, the mean gestational age at delivery was 38.

1 weeks in the pessary group compared to 37.

8 weeks in the expectant management group, with no significant differences in the rates of delivery before 28, 34 or 37 weeks of gestation.

 Currently, no published RCT compared the efficacy of the cervical pessary with that of cerclage or progestogens for short cervix in singletons or twins.

 A retrospective comparison between the methods has shown no significant differences in the rates of perinatal loss, neonatal morbidity or PTB for singleton pregnancies (apart from higher rate of PTB at <34 weeks' gestation in the vaginal progesterone vs the pessary group).

 In 2003, the first case control study in twin pregnancies and cervical pessary was conducted.

 Twenty-three women with short cervical length (<25 mm) prior to 24 weeks of gestation were treated with pessary and matched with 23 controls.

 The mean gestational age at delivery was 35+6 weeks in the pessary group and 33+2 weeks in the control group (p value=0.

02).

 A large RCT published in 2013 included 403 women with twin pregnancies who were randomized to either prophylactic pessary or expectant management.

 Women with all cervical length were included.

 The authors concluded that prophylactic use of pessary in unselected twin pregnancies did not prolong pregnancy or reduce poor perinatal outcome.

 However, in a sub group analysis of women with a cervical length less than 38 mm (<25th percentile), a significantly lower incidence of poor neonatal outcomes, delivery before 32 weeks, and neonatal mortality was found in the pessary group.

 Cervical Pessary vs Vaginal Progesterone in Preventing Preterm Birth Among Women Presenting With Short Cervix: An Open-label Randomized Controlled Trial@highlight

The purpose of this randomized control trial is to determine whether cervical pessary plus vaginal progesterone is superior to vaginal progesterone alone in decreasing preterm delivery rate, and improving perinatal outcome, among women presenting with an asymptomatic mid-pregnancy short cervix, in singleton and twin gestations.

 All women with singleton or twin pregnancies undergoing routine ultrasonography up to 24 completed weeks of gestation (for examination of fetal anatomy and growth) and diagnosed with cervical length of 25 mm in singleton, or 38 mm in twins, will be invited to participate in the clinical trial.

 Women who meet eligible criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical trial.

 Women will be randomly assigned into one of the following groups: group A (vaginal progesterone) or group B (vaginal progesterone + pessary).

 Follow-up visits for ultrasound assessment of fetal growth and cervical length will be carried out every two weeks until 37 weeks of gestation.
