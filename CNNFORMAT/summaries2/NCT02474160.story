(secondQuint)Collection and Storage of Tissue and Blood Samples From Patients With Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To procure biologic tissues and materials to generate preclinical models of cancer.

 OUTLINE: Tumor tissue and blood samples are procured during procedures that are required for the patients? clinical management and will be stored via xenograft (transplant to another species) models or in vitro cell culture for future analysis.

 Collection and Storage of Tissue and Blood Samples From Patients With Cancer@highlight

This research trial collects and stores tissue and blood samples from patients with cancer.

 Collecting and storing samples of tissue and blood from patients with cancer to study in the laboratory may help scientists create new and better models to learn about cancer and to test new cancer drugs.
