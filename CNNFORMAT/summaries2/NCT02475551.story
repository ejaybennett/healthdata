 Patients with DSAs will be treated with IdeS prior to transplantation.

 Each patient will receive one dose of IdeS.

 If the crossmatch test is negative after IdeS treatment, the patient will be transplanted with a kidney from a deceased or living donor.

 Two to four dose groups are planned.

 Each group will contain 2 patients with the possibility to extend the group to up to 4 patients per group if required for safety and/or efficacy evaluation.

 The starting dose will be 0.
