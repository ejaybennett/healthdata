(secondQuint)A Study to Assess the Tolerability of a Single Dose of Gefapixant (AF-219/MK-7264) in Subjects With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).

 This study assesses the tolerability of a single dose of gefapixant in participants with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

 This will be the first experience of administering gefapixant in patients with IPF.

 P2X3 receptors are found on the chemosensory afferents of the carotid body and can influence sympathetic autonomic discharge, especially in sensitized subjects; accordingly, by blocking these P2X3 receptors, gefapixant may have an effect of reducing sympathetic activity.

 Therefore in order to determine whether P2X3 antagonism would have an effect on the hemodynamic measures such as blood pressure in patients with IPF, study AF219-019 is being performed.

 These patients will be closely monitored in order to determine any such effect.

This study assesses the tolerability of a single dose of gefapixant (AF-219) in participants with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

 Six eligible participants will receive a single 150 mg dose of gefapixant and undergo tolerability and PK assessments.
