(thirdQuint)Early Access Treatment With Daratumumab for (Relapsed or Refractory) Multiple Myeloma.

 This is a multicenter, open-label, early access treatment protocol of single-agent daratumumab in subjects with multiple myeloma who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a PI and an IMiD or whose disease is double refractory to both a PI and an IMiD, who reside in areas where daratumumab is not commercially available or available through another protocol, who have not been enrolled in another daratumumab study, and who are not eligible for or who do not have access to enrollment in another ongoing clinical study of daratumumab.

 The study will have three phases: Screening phase (30 days prior to first dose of study drug), treatment phase (until documented progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end), End of Treatment (30 days after last dose of study drug).

 Participants will receive daratumumab (16 milligram per kilogram [mg/kg]) as intravenous infusion.

 Participants will primarily be assessed for overall response rate.

 Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

 Early Access Treatment With Daratumumab for (Relapsed or Refractory) Multiple Myeloma@highlight

The objective of this study is to provide early access to daratumumab treatment and collect additional safety data while the medication is not commercially available or available through another protocol for subjects with multiple myeloma who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) or whose disease is double refractory to both a PI and an IMiD.
