(fifthQuint)RejuvenAir Lobectomy for Safety and Histology.

 The study is a prospective, open label, single arm, single center study.

 The objective is to study the safety of the RejuvenAir System in a population of subjects who are scheduled to undergo a planned lobectomy.

 A secondary objective is to determine the histological effects of RejuvenAir System treatment in the airways.

 The Primary Endpoint is Safety as measured by occurrence of serious adverse events related to metered dose radial spray cryotherapy treatment performed prior to scheduled lobectomy surgery.

 The patient population intended to participate in this study are subjects scheduled to undergo lobectomy for peripheral lung lesions suspicious for or known to be cancer.

 Secondarily, this will enable an understanding of the histological characteristics and healing outcomes post-treatment in the airways, which will be resected.

 CSA Medical has conducted bench and animal studies that support the use of the RejuvenAir System as sufficiently safe and effective to warrant advancing the product into this primary safety study in patients presenting for consideration of lobectomy.

 Such patients provide a safe population to further the clinical evaluation of the system in that these subjects will receive their lobectomy or procedure 2 to 14 days following delivery of their metered liquid nitrogen treatment.

 At the time of their metered liquid nitrogen treatment they will be in an operating room setting with their thoracic surgeon in attendance.

 It is anticipated that subjects who agree to participate in this study will have the metered liquid nitrogen treatment at the time of evaluation of their lung lesion.

 This evaluation will include bronchoscopy with ultrasound for evaluation of their lymph nodes prior to the planned surgical resection of their lung abnormality.

 RejuvenAir Lobectomy for Safety and Histology@highlight

RejuvenAir System treatment will be performed during preoperative bronchoscopy 2 to 90 days prior to prescheduled lung resection in Subjects requiring lobectomy for removal of peripheral tumors.

 Treatment will be limited to areas of the bronchi within the lobe that will be removed, distal to the anticipated margin of resection.

 Treatment should be at least 1 cm from the bronchial resection margins and away from the tumor bed.

 Treated airways will be inspected via bronchoscopy at the time of thoracotomy, and examined histologically following surgical resection.

 Subject participation will be from 1 to 90 days and enrollment is anticipated to take 3 months.

 Subject having a RejuvenAir procedure and not going on to a resection for any reason will be followed for a maximum of 90 days for safety and undergo bronchoscopic evaluation of the treated airways at 90 days (+/- 4 Days)) post treatment.
