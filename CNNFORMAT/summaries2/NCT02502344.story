(secondQuint)Effect of Medical Interventions in Insulin Resistance on Prevalence of Abnormal Glucose Tolerance.

 The situation of type 2 DM prevention in China is serious.

 The commonly accepted natural course of type 2 DM is as follows: obesity, insulin resistance(hyperinsulemia), abnormal glucose tolerance, DM and complications of DM; correspondently, the function status of pancreas islet cells are: normal, compensatory, decompensatory, impaired and failure.

 Post researches have proved that using medical interventions after the period of insulin resistance when the function status of cells were compensatory, the course could not be reversed.

 There were few clinical researches about effects of medical interventions in the period of insulin resistance .

 This research would take medical interventions in subjects of insulin resistance without abnormal glucose tolerance, to see if there were different prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance in different groups.
