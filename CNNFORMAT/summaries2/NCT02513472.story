(thirdQuint)Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Eribulin Mesylate in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Participants With Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (mTNBC).

 The Phase 1b part will evaluate the safety and tolerability of eribulin mesylate in combination with pembrolizumab.

 Approximately 6 participants may be enrolled in the Phase 1b part of the study.

 The Phase 2 part will evaluate the tumor objective response rate (ORR) when treated with eribulin mesylate in combination with pembrolizumab in all participants and will also evaluate ORR in stratum 2 participants and compare with the historical response rate of pembrolizumab monotherapy 10 percent (%) in participants with mTNBC previously treated with 0 (stratum 1) or 1 to 2 (stratum 2) lines of systemic anticancer therapy (cytotoxic or targeted anticancer agents) in the metastatic setting.

 Approximately 170 mTNBC participants (including participants in Phase 1b who are on RP2D level) will be enrolled in Phase 2.
