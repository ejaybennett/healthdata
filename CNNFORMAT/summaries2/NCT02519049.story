(firstQuint)11C-Methionine PET/CT Imaging in Patients Affected by Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM).

 This is a single-center, open-label study, lasting 36 months including an estimated period of 24 months for the enrollment and max 12 months of follow-up.

 All patients affected by MPM and referred to our Institution eligible for therapeutic pleurodesis and subsequent platinum- and pemetrexed-based chemotherapy will be enrolled.

 In all cases patients will be investigated with 11C-Methionine PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT before talc pleurodesis, one week after and at the end of three cycles of chemotherapy.

 A minimum number of 20 patients will be considered for the analysis.
