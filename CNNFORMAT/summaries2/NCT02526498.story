(fifthQuint)Accelerated Partial Breast Radiation Therapy Using High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy in Treating Patients With Early Stage Breast Cancer After Surgery.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the toxicity rate with shorter courses of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivered with a breast brachytherapy applicator.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the 3-year actuarial local control rate with abbreviated accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI).

 II.

 To assess the rate of excellent or good cosmesis at 2-years after shorter courses of APBI and to identify co-variants associated with and predictive of poor cosmetic outcome in women treated with an overnight treatment course of APBI.

 OUTLINE: Within 1-5 days after balloon placement, patients undergo accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy over 15-60 minutes for 2-3 days.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-8 weeks and then at least annually for 2 years.

 Accelerated Partial Breast Radiation Therapy Using High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy in Treating Patients With Early Stage Breast Cancer After Surgery@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy works in treating patients with breast cancer that has not spread beyond the breast or the axillary lymph nodes (early-stage) after surgery.

 Radiation therapy uses a type of energy to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.

 Brachytherapy is a type of internal radiation therapy that provides radiation inside the breast to any remaining tumor cells next to the space where the tumor was removed, and is given over a shorter amount of time than standard radiation therapy.

 Giving accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy may reduce the overall time that radiation is delivered to the tumor cells.
