(secondQuint)Nintedanib (Vargatef) Plus Docetaxel in Second Line of Treatment in Patients With Lung Cancer.

 59 Patients with histologically documented stage IV NSCLC no squamous, after failure of first line chemotherapy and refractory (progressive disease during first line chemotherapy), will be enroled to receive docetaxel :75 mg/m IV day 1 every 3 weeks with nintedanib (vargatef(R)):200 mg X 2/day per os day2-day21.

 Tumor response (according to RECIST) will be assessed via computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan every 6 weeks (evaluation of PFS) following completion of chemotherapy.

 Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 4.

0 Quality of life(EQ5-D ) will be assessed every 6 weeks during chemotherapy.

 Tolerability will be assessed at each visit based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), v4.
