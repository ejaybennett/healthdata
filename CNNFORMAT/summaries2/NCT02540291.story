(secondQuint)Study of E7046 in Subjects With Selected Advanced Malignancies.

 The study will be conducted in 2 parts: a dose escalation part to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of E7046, and a cohort expansion part with 6 to 16 participants to better characterize safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) at the RP2D.

 In the dose escalation part, increasing doses of E7046 will be administered to cohorts of 6 participants, at dose levels ranging from 125 mg to 750 mg.
