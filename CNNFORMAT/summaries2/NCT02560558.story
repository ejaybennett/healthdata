(thirdQuint)Bela 8 Week Dosing.

 The current dosing protocol for patients who have undergone a kidney transplant requires that Belacept be given as an infusion every 4 weeks.

 The investigator wants to assess if the patients who have been stable for one year after transplant can be safely transitioned to an 8-week Belatacept infusion schedule.

 Renal function and any episodes of acute rejection will be closely monitored.

 Bela 8 Week Dosing@highlight

The purpose of this study is to transition patients who have been stable on Belatacept for one year after kidney transplant from standard 4-week to an investigational 8-week belatacept dosing schedule.

 The investigators hypothesize that renal function and acute rejection rates will be non-inferior with 8-week belatacept dosing.
