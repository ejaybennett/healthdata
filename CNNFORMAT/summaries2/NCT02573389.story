(fifthQuint)Pancreatic Duct Stenting to Prevent Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula (POPF) After Distal Pancreatectomy.

 Prophylactic pancreatic duct stenting is to be offered to all patients deemed a candidate for a distal pancreatectomy.

 This is a nonrandomized cohort study with a retrospective and prospective control group (Jan 2008 - Dec 2017 or sample size obtained) and a prospective endoscopic intervention group (September 2015 - Dec 2017 or until sample size obtained).

 We will then compare the rate of development of a postoperative pancreatic fistula between those patients who have preoperative stenting and those who do not.

 POPF will be defined as the amylase level of drain contents equaling three times or more the serum amylase on postoperative day 3, as defined by the International Study Group for Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) or an ICD-9 diagnosis of 577.

8.

 The patient will have a pre-operative visit for stent placement and a post-operative visit for stent removal if still in place 4-6 weeks after distal pancreatectomy.

 Pancreatic Duct Stenting to Prevent Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula (POPF) After Distal Pancreatectomy@highlight

To determine whether pre-operative pancreatic stenting for distal pancreatectomy will impact the incidence of a post-operative pancreatic fistula, as defined by postoperative.

 If pre-operative pancreatic stenting appears to reduce the formation of Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula (POPF) in this pilot study, this will form the basis of a larger randomized trial in the future.

 The hypothesis is that pre-operative pancreatic duct stenting can significantly decrease the rate of development of a post-operative pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy.
