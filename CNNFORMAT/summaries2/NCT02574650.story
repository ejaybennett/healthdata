@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess the early safety and performance of the Mitralign Percutaneous Tricuspid Valve Annuloplasty System (PTVAS) for the treatment of symptomatic chronic functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR).

 The procedure will be performed with the PTVAS device using a non-surgical percutaneous approach to tricuspid valve repair in patients who have FTR with a minimum of moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
