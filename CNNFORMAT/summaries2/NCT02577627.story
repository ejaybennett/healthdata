(thirdQuint)Multi-Indication, Retrospective Oncological Study to Validate the Accuracy in Predicting TTP by PrediCare in Patients Under SOC.

 The goals of this study are assessing and validating the accuracy of the PrediCare predictions by comparing them to the actual patients outcome.

 Study population will be composed of patients diagnosed with advanced stage disease, and divided according to the indications and treatment protocols.

 Retrospective data collected from patients' files will enable Optimata to compare the PrediCare Technology predictions of the pattern of metastatic and primary tumor growth and dynamics of oncological markers over time with the actual outcomes in each individual patient.
