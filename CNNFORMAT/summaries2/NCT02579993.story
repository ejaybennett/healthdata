(secondQuint)ABCB5 as a Prognostic Marker in Survival of Cultivated Limbal Stem Cell Transplantation.

 There are several diseases that cause the cornea to lose its clarity and directly affects the vision of the individual, therefore, the use of limbal stem cells has been having increasing acceptance in the field of medical therapy.

 An open clinical study is running with patients with limbal stem cell deficiency, performing a limbal stem cell transplantation expanded in vitro on amniotic membrane and the value of ABCB5 as a prognostic factor in the survival of transplant will be determined.

 The corneal surface status will be the primary endpoint.
