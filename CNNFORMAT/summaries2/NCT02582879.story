(thirdQuint)informCLL: A Disease Registry for Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.

 InformCLL is a multicenter, prospective, observational registry of CLL patients designed to characterize and describe treatment patterns for those initiating treatment with approved oral kinase inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors and other approved anti-CLL therapies/regimens.

 The registry will provide information on regimens used to treat first-line and later lines of CLL/SLL as well as the sequencing of treatment regimens.

 The registry will also evaluate the association of these treatment patterns with patient characteristics, healthcare resource utilization, and functional outcomes including patient-reported HRQoL.

 These data will provide information to physicians that may help guide clinical practice and appropriate use of therapies, and will also provide information on HRQoL and healthcare resource utilization that will be of interest to healthcare decision makers.
