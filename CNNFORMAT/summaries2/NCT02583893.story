(fifthQuint)Biomarkers in Predicting Treatment Response to Sirolimus and Chemotherapy in Patients With High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To test the association between biochemical response and clinical response.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To estimate complete response rate of sirolimus MEC in patients with high risk AML.

 II.

 To estimate progression free survival in this patient population.

 III.

 To collect further information on the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of sirolimus in combination with MEC in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloid malignancies.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo collection of bone marrow samples prior to sirolimus dosing on day 4 and within 1 week and no later than day 45 of hematologic recovery.

 Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) on days 2-9 (loading dose on day 1 only), and standard MEC chemotherapy comprising mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes, etoposide IV over 1 hour, and cytarabine IV over 1 hour every 24 hours on day 4-8.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.

 Biomarkers in Predicting Treatment Response to Sirolimus and Chemotherapy in Patients With High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia@highlight

This pilot phase II trial studies whether biomarkers (biological molecules) in bone marrow samples can predict treatment response to sirolimus and chemotherapy (mitoxantrone hydrochloride, etoposide, and cytarabine [MEC]) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that is likely to come back or spread (high-risk).

 Sirolimus inhibits or blocks the pathway that causes cancer cells to grow.

 Adding sirolimus to standard chemotherapy may help improve patient response.

 Studying samples of bone marrow from patients treated with sirolimus in the laboratory may help doctors learn whether sirolimus reverses or turns off that pathway and whether changes in biomarker levels can predict how well patients will respond to treatment.
