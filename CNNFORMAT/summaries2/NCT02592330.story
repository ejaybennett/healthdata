(firstQuint)Safety and Feasibility of CALEC for LSCD.

 This is an open label, single center study to assess safety, feasibility, and efficacy of Cultivated Autologous Limbal Epithelial Cell (CALEC) grafts in 24 patients with unilateral limbal stem cell deficiency.

 The first 3 participants enrolled will receive the study treatment, CALEC, to assess for safety and feasibility.

 Subjects 4-24 will be randomized to either the study treatment, CALEC, or to the standard treatment for LSCD, which is conjunctival limbal autograft (CLAU) in a 2:1 ratio.

 Participants receiving the study intervention will have a corneal biopsy in their non-diseased eye, which will provide cells for the creation of the CALEC graft.

 The CALEC will be made at the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Laboratory, Dana Farber Cancer Institute and transported to Mass.

 Eye and Ear Infirmary for application to the participant's diseased eye during their standard corneal reconstruction procedure.

 Subjects randomized to the standard treatment arm will undergo CLAU surgery, with the biopsy performed at the time of surgery.

 Investigators, study personnel, and subjects will be aware of the study assignment, given the different procedures required for each, during and after surgery.

 Subjects will be monitored up to month 24 to assess for any delayed adverse events of the product (CALEC) or procedure as well as assessment of the durability of the transplant.
