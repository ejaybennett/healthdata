(thirdQuint)Endodrill vs.

 Conventional Biopsy.

 Evaluation of Diagnostic Capacity in Diffuse Gastric Cancer.

 Endodrill is a newly constructed biopsy tool for flexible endoscopic use.

 It uses a drilling motion within a casing to harvest solid biopsies from tissue through the biopsy channel of a conventional flexible endoscope.

 It was originally designed for sampling of tissue from submucosal lesions.

 The investigators first study of the instrument is now finished.

 Endodrill is safe to use and generates more submucosal tissue compared to biopsies with a conventional biopsy forceps.

 In this study, the investigators want to compare the Endodrill instruments ability to obtain representative tissue samples from a group of patients diagnosed with or suspected diffuse gastric cancer.

 20 patients will be enrolled for this study.

 For each patient the investigators will collect 8 biopsies, 4 biopsies each with conventional biopsy and the Endodrill instrument respectively.

 The order will be randomized for each patient.

 For each specific biopsy the investigator will choose a particular site on the suspected tumor tissue without knowing which instrument that will be used for the biopsy.

 This procedure will be repeated for all 8 biopsies.

 Evaluation of Diagnostic Capacity in Diffuse Gastric Cancer@highlight

Endodrill is a new instrument for biopsy sampling in the GI-channel.

 The purpose of this study is as follows: - Compare the Endodrill instrument with conventional biopsy forceps in terms of ability to establish the correct diagnosis of diffuse gastric cancer based on collected biopsies from tumor tissue.
