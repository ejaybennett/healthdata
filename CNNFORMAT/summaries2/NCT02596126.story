(fifthQuint)Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in the Elderly Trial.

 A total number of 3206 patients will be randomized (1:1) to treatment arms.

 Patients will be recruited across seven countries in Europe (Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Hungary, Poland, and Czech Republic).

 Patients will be 65 years old and diagnosed with a type 1 myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study enrolment.

 Once the inclusion and exclusion criteria are confirmed, patients will be included in the study after signing informed consent.

 Randomization will take place within 6 months of the index event (AMI type I) in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two arms: - Cardiovascular Polypill (containing Aspirin, Ramipril, and Atorvastatin) - Usual care Patients will be followed up for a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 4 years.

 There will be 3 follow up visits at month 6, 12 and 24 and telephone follow up calls at month 18, 36 and 48.

 Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in the Elderly Trial@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a polypill strategy containing aspirin (100 mg), ramipril (2.

5, 5 or 10 mgs), and atorvastatin (40 mgs) compared with the standard of care (usual care according to the local clinical practices at each participating country) in secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal ischemic stroke, and urgent revascularization) in elderly patients with a recent myocardial infarction.
