(secondQuint)Reduction of Infection in Neonatal Intensive Care Units Using the Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality.

 Following randomization into two groups, the intervention NICUs (n = 12) will receive training in the EPIQ method and then develop, implement, and document evidence-based practice changes to reduce hospital-acquired infection.

 Compliance with practice changes and neonatal outcomes will be monitored.

 NICUs will receive quarterly feedback on their progress, as well as access to implementation support.

 Control NICUs (n = 12) will collect neonatal data and continue to provide standard care.

 Study subjects will be all preterm infants born at <34 weeks' gestation and admitted to participating NICUs during the trial (estimated n = 5,200 per year).

 Data analysis will be conducted to compare neonatal outcomes and health-care resources used between the intervention and control groups.
