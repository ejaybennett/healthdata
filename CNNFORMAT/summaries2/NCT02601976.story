(fifthQuint)Evaluation of Unipeg for Response and Ongoing Safety in Pakistani Population.

 A multicenter, phase IV, open labeled, single arm study was conducted.

 Total 110 patients were screened for recruitment.

 Out of which 67 subjects met the inclusion criteria, 3 failed to give the informed consent and were excluded.

 The final sample size of the study was 64 patients.

 The duration of study was August 2010 to September 2013.

 Peginterferon alfa-2a 180 mu g 20kDa (Unipeg(R)) solution for injection was administered as single dose sub-cutaneous once weekly for 24 weeks to patients with genotype 3 and 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1 at the site of recruitment.

 Ribavirin (Ribazole) orally were given in divided daily dose according to body weight-based dosing recommendations ( 75 kg = 1200 mg).

 Quality of life related Physical Component Score (PCS) & Mental Component Score (MCS) were measured through Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Questionnaire (SF-36).

 The SF-36 questionnaire was completed for all patients during their evaluations before treatment, at 4 weeks, at the end of treatment and at 24 weeks after completion of treatment.

 Evaluation of Unipeg for Response and Ongoing Safety in Pakistani Population@highlight

Hepatitis C is a global problem, prevalent in developed as well as in the developing countries.

 New treatment regimens using PegInterferon in combination with ribavirin has led to improved sustained viral response rates for some genotypes.

 A single arm, open labeled, multicentre trial was conducted to evaluate the response rate and safety of PegInterferon alfa-2a (Unipeg(R)) plus ribavirin (Ribazole(R)) for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.

 RVR at 4 weeks, ETR at 24 weeks for genotype 3 and at 48 weeks for genotype 1 patients and SVR was determined at 24 weeks after completion of treatment.

 Quality of life at baseline and at follow-up visits were determined using SF-36.
