(fifthQuint)Examining Benefits of Modified Cogmed Training With ADHD at Cambridge Memorial Hospital(CMH).

 The Cogmed working memory training program consists of 5 daily 50-min sessions for 5 weeks.

 This program has been identified as a promising intervention for youth with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who have deficits in aspects of executive functioning (EF), such as working memory (WM) and attention (ATT), as well as social-emotional behavior (SEB).

 Findings regarding the efficacy and generalization of transfer effects associated with Cogmed have been mixed, possibly due to methodological limitations of the standard program.

 In our study, these limitations will be addressed with ADHD youth (8-16 years) in a randomized controlled trial using a modified version of the Cogmed program (MCT) that is suitable for use in a hospital setting (duration = 3 daily 35-min sessions for 10 weeks).

 The main objective is to determine whether there is improvement in WM and ATT, a reduction in concerns related to ADHD and SEB, and transfer effects for reading and math following participation in our MCT.
