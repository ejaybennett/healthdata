 A Sleep Intervention to Improve Outcomes Among Women at High Risk of Breast Cancer@highlight

Participants are asked to participate in a research study of the effect of a sleep intervention on improving sleep habits and reducing their risk of breast cancer.

 Participants are asked to participate in this research study because they have been identified as being at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer.

 The purpose of this study is to compare women who get a sleep intervention to women who do not get a sleep intervention.

 This study team will compare these two groups of women to see if the sleep intervention improves their sleep and if it lowers markers of inflammation that have been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
