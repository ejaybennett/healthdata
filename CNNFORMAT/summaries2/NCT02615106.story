(firstQuint)Anti-angiogenetic Therapy With Radiotherapy for Pediatric Neuroblastoma.

 Clinical data proved that Endostar was a wild spectrum and safe antiangiogenesis factor which could suppress almost 65 kinds of tumor mass in animal models and affect about 12 percent human genome.

 So investigators design Radiotherapy plus Endostar to treat Pediatric Neuroblastoma to research the RR and safety.

 Investigators believe this treatment regimen may be a new approach to the pediatric neuroblastoma patients.
