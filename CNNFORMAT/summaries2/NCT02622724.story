(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Safety of FP-1201-lyo (Interferon Beta-1a) in Patients Having Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

 This is a Phase III clinical study to investigate the efficacy and safety of FP-1201-lyo (recombinant human interferon [IFN] beta-1a) compared to placebo in patients diagnosed with moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

 Primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of FP-1201-lyo in improving the clinical course and outcome based on survival and need for mechanical ventilation.

 Currently there are no approved drugs for treating moderate or severe ARDS patients.

 FP-1201-lyo is a lyophilised powder form of recombinant human IFN beta-1a reconstituted in water for injection and is administered intravenously.

 Recombinant human IFN beta-1a is an approved treatment for patients for other indication and its safety profile in such patients is well characterised.

 Efficacy and Safety of FP-1201-lyo (Interferon Beta-1a) in Patients Having Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)@highlight

In this study effectiveness and safety of a new drug FP-1201-lyo (recombinant human interferon beta-1a) is compared to placebo.

 Investigation is conducted with patients who have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

 The new drug is expected to reduce the time which a patient need to be on the ventilator and improve patient's chances of survival.

 Currently there are no approved drugs for treating moderate or severe ARDS patients.
