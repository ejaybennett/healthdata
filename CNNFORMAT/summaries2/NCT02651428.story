(secondQuint)Study Assessing Safety & Effectiveness of a Catheter Lock Solution in Dialysis Patients to Prevent Bloodstream Infection.

 The objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Neutrolin(R) as a catheter lock solution (CLS) on prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), and the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events in subjects receiving hemodialysis (HD) for the treatment of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) when compared with heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL).

 This is a randomized, double-blind, active control, parallel-arm, multicenter study.

 Six hundred and thirty two subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Neutrolin(R) or the active control heparin (Heparin sodium USP 1,000 units/mL, Benzyl alcohol 9.

45 mg/mL and Sodium chloride 9.

0 mg/mL) as a CLS.

 Approximately 632 randomized subjects are planned for this trial.

 In this study, one-half of the subjects (316 subjects) will receive Neutrolin as a study drug and the other half will receive heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL) with benzyl alcohol preservative as a comparator.

 Subjects will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks without additional stratification for both groups.

 The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Neutrolin(R) as a CLS in ESRD subjects undergoing HD treatment using a permanent, cuffed, tunneled silicone or polyurethane HD catheter.

 The study will evaluate whether Neutrolin(R) is superior to the active control heparin by documenting the time to CRBSI and consequently delaying the time until the occurrence of CRBSI.
