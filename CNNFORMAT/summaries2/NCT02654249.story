(secondQuint)Prospective Randomized Trial About THD Versus Ligasure Hemorrhoidectomy for Grade III and IV Hemorrhoids.

 Transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (THD) uses a specially developed anoscope combined with a Doppler transducer to identify the hemorrhoidal arteries.

 A suture ligation is performed to effectively decrease the blood flow to the hemorrhoidal plexus.

 In case of redundant prolapse, the prolapsed mucosa is lifted (mucopexy).

 THD procedure is performed without any incisions or removal of the hemorrhoidal tissue and moreover the suture line is above the dentate line, so post-operative pain and morbidities seem to be minimized in these patients.

 This technique differs from Ligasure hemorrhoidectomy, which focuses on excising the hemorrhoidal tissue.

 This prospective, randomized, multicenter and controlled trial compares post-operative pain, morbidities, quality of life, fecal incontinence and recurrence rate in patients treated for grade III and IV hemorrhoids with THD with mucopexy versus Ligasure hemorrhoidectomy.

The study evaluates postoperative pain, morbidity, recurrence and quality of life, comparing two different strategies in the treatment of grade III and IV hemorrhoids: transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization with mucopexy (THD) versus hemorrhoidectomy by Ligasure cent .
