(thirdQuint)A First-in-Man Study of the Firesorb BVS (FUTURE-I).

 This study is a prospective, single-center clinical trial.

 The investigator design to recruit 45 subjects.

 After implanting the Sirolimus Target Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (Firesorb) successfully, all the subjects will be randomly assigned to queue 1 (n=30) and queue 2 (n=15).

 The clinical follow-up will be performed in all subjects at 1 month,6 months,1 year,2 years,3 years,4 years and 5 years after scaffold implantation.

 Angiographic,IVUS and OCT follow-up will be performed at 6 months and 2 years after scaffold implantation in queue 1; angiographic,IVUS and OCT follow-up will be performed at 1 year and 3 years after scaffold implantation in queue 2.

 The primary endpoint of the study is target lesion failure (TLF) at 30 days after scaffold implantation, the secondary endpoints are series of imaging outcomes, for evaluation of feasibility and preliminary safety and efficacy of the product.

 A First-in-Man Study of the Firesorb BVS (FUTURE-I)@highlight

This study is a small scale pilot trial for Sirolimus Target Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (Firesorb) in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease for the first time.

 The goal is to access the preliminary safety and efficacy of Firesorb implantation in the human body, and to provide evidence for subsequent large-scale, multi-center, randomized controlled clinical trials.

 Then provide the basis for the formal application of the product in China.
