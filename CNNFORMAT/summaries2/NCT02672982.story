(secondQuint)Follow Up of Severely Malnourished Children (FUSAM).

 In Nepal, the majority of SAM children are treated with therapeutic food in community/home-based care, and little is known about the long-term sustainability of the nutritional and health benefits of treatment after rehabilitation.

 The two treatments will be compared in terms of costs of treatment and convened health benefits (child nutritional status and development, cured rate and relapse, maternal mental health, and family care practices) at both short and long-term periods after admission.

 The proposed complementary psychosocial intervention focuses directly on the key underlying determinants of acute malnutrition within children's early years, such as child care practices and stimulation, parent-child relationships and maternal mental health.

 It includes the mother/caregiver as patient of psychosocial support, but also empowers her as the key ally in the treatment of the undernourished child.

 Adding a brief psychosocial component to the standard medico-nutritional treatment is expected to pay off in terms of sustainable recovery, health, and development outcomes of children.

The overall objective of the research is to assess the long-term and cost-effectiveness of a combined nutrition psychosocial intervention to a stand-alone nutritional treatment of children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) aged 6 to 24 months in the Saptari District of Nepal.
