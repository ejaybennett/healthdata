(firstQuint)VLU Non-inferiority Study Comparing a Dual Action Pneumatic Compression Device to Multi-layer Bandaging.

 Participants with a chronic venous leg ulcer will participate in a 2 week run in phase using standard of care multi-layer bandaging before being randomly assigned to either treatment using a dual action pneumatic compression device or multi-layer bandaging for up to 16 weeks.

 Participants will be seen in clinic for treatment, evaluation, complete symptom and quality of life questionnaires.
