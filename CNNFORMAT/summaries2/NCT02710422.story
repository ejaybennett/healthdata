(secondQuint)Miami Membrane for Potency (MMEP) Trial.

 This is a phase 2 prospective randomized trial investigating the impact of amniotic membrane placement over the neurovascular bundles after bilateral nerve sparing robot assisted radical prostatectomy on potency.

 The study will have a control arm that will follow standard of care surgery, without placement of any membranes.

 70 men will be allocated to each arm.

 The research study will involve follow up every 3 months for the first 12 months.

 After this the investigators will follow patients annually with PSA measurements and an assessment of any secondary therapies for 5 years post-surgery.

 Randomization of study patients will be done in equal proportion to Arm I (membrane placement) and Arm II (no membrane placement, standard of care surgery) using a permuted block design stratified by baseline SHIM score (=17), and use of ANY erectile aids (Yes vs.

 No) in the last 3 months.

The use of dehydrated human amnionic membrane allograft improves erectile function recovery (as measured by (Sexual History Inventory for Men (SHIM) score) at 12 months after robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) compared to a control group with no allograft.
