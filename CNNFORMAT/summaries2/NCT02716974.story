(fifthQuint)A Study of Definitive Therapy to Treat Prostate Cancer.

 Neoadjuvant treatment (month 1 through ~6): All patients will be treated with up to 6 months of androgen deprivation, plus up to 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy.

 Following docetaxel therapy, patients with a PSA response of at least a 50% decrease from baseline, will proceed to maximum consolidative therapy.

 Local consolidation (month 7 though ~11): After completion of neoadjuvant therapy, the men will be treated with definitive local therapy with radical prostatectomy (RP) +/- adjuvant radiation therapy (RT).

 After definitive local therapy, patients will be treated with consolidative stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the metastatic sites.

 Systemic consolidation: Patients will continue on androgen deprivation for a total of 1 year.

 They will be followed clinically and monitored with serum testosterone and PSA until 2-years after completion of systemic consolidation.

 Androgen blockade will be the same throughout the course of treatment.

 A Study of Definitive Therapy to Treat Prostate Cancer@highlight

To assess the safety of treating men with oligometastatic prostate cancer with the following therapy: (1st) Systemic chemo-hormonal therapy with up to 6-months (~24 weeks) of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy, (2nd) definitive local tumor control with prostatectomy +/- adjuvant radiation therapy, and (3rd) consolidative stereotactic radiation to oligometastatic lesions.

 The men will receive a total of 1 year of androgen deprivation.

 Androgen blockade will be the same throughout the course of treatment.
