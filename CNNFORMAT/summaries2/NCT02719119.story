(thirdQuint)Trial of Monthly Versus Bi-weekly Endoscopic Variceal Ligation for the Prevention of Esophageal Variceal Rebleeding.

 Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is a safe and simple procedure now being used on a widening scale.

 A lot of patients who undergo endoscopic treatment for esophageal varices eventually require additional treatment for recurrent varices.

 Many physicians suggest repeating EVL every 1-2 weeks until esophageal varices are obliterated to prevent variceal rebleeding, however, the evidences supporting the efficacy of EVL intervals of 1-2 weeks are insufficient.

This randomized controlled study was conducted in order to compare the long-term results of EVL when performed at two different results from monthly and bi-weekly treatments.
