(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of Injectable Cabotegravir Compared to Daily Oral Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate/Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), For Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis in HIV-Uninfected Cisgender Men and Transgender Women Who Have Sex With Men.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the injectable drug cabotegravir (CAB LA), for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in HIV-uninfected cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men (MSM and TGW).

 This study will enroll HIV-uninfected MSM and TGW at risk for acquiring HIV infection.

 Participants will remain in the study between 1.

5 years to 4.

5 years, depending on when they enroll in the study.

 This study will take place in three steps.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two arms: Arm A: Step 1: Participants will receive daily oral CAB tablets and daily oral TDF/FTC placebo tablets for 5 weeks.

 Step 2: Participants will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection of CAB LA at two time points 4 weeks apart and every 8 weeks thereafter and daily oral TDF/FTC placebo tablets.

 Arm B: Step 1: Participants will receive daily oral TDF/FTC tablets and daily oral CAB placebo tablets for 5 weeks.

 Step 2: Participants will receive daily oral TDF/FTC tablets and an IM injection of placebo at two time points 4 weeks apart and every 8 weeks thereafter.

 In Step 3, all participants (Arms A and B) will receive daily oral TDF/FTC tablets no later than 8 weeks after the last injection, for up to 48 weeks.

 Participants will attend up to 57 study visits throughout the study.

 Visits may include physical examinations, blood collection, urine collection, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and rectal swab collection.

 Some participants may have a bone mineral density-energy x-ray absorptimetry (DXA) scan at select visits.

 All participants will be transitioned to locally available HIV prevention services, including services for PrEP, if available, at the end of their participation in the study.
