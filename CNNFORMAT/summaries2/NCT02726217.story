(thirdQuint)NYULMC CareSmarts Pilot.

 CareSmarts is a mobile diabetes program that provides self-management support and team-based care management for people with diabetes through automated SMS messages.

 The program is a theory-driven behavioral intervention designed to improve self-care through multiple mediators, including cuing, education, self-efficacy, social support, and health beliefs.

 Participants in the program receive educational and motivational text messages about diabetes self-care, some prompts to engage in a particular action (for example, "Time to check your blood sugar"), and some self-assessment questions (such as, "Do you need refills of any of your medications?") to which the patient responds by texting.

 Participants' responses to self-assessment questions are used to facilitate remote monitoring and care management by the health care team.

 A response that is outside established parameters triggers an alert.

 Using protocols, nurses respond to each alert by the next business day.
