(secondQuint)H2O VR for Burns 2015.

 This study will employ a randomized within-subjects design.

 There are three different conditions in this study.

 By randomization, the participants will experience at least two of the conditions and likely all three, depending on the number of their wound care sessions.

 All subjects will always receive all their usual pain medications for all treatment conditions.

 The three conditions are: High Tech Virtual Reality (VRD), Low Tech Virtual Reality (Nature Slides), and standard wound care (no VR).

 The subjects will be randomly assigned to receive some portions of their wound care sessions during High Tech Virtual Reality (VRD), some portions during Low Tech Virtual Reality (Nature Slides), and some portions with standard wound care, no virtual reality.

 The treatment orders will be randomized.

 After each treatment condition the investigators will ask subjects one pain question about their pain intensity during the most recent treatment condition.
