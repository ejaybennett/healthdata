 Take the Fight in Supporting and Empowering Patients With Cancer@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies Take the Fight in supporting and empowering patients with cancer through their treatment process.

 Patients with cancer are faced with many obstacles created by the current state of the healthcare system.

 The purpose of Take the Fight is to train college students, also called patients' navigators or strategists, to assist and support patients to navigate into the healthcare system and receive the care they need.

 The strategists are matched with patients and attend/coordinate most patients' medical appointments.

 The strategists also advance communications between the patient and the medical staff to facilitate both the exchange of medical information as well as increase the patient's compliance with treatment.

 Take the Fight may improve the health and quality of life outcomes of cancer patients during critical treatment periods by increasing treatment compliance, eliminating barriers to better care, and increasing clinical trial participation.
