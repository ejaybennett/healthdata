(thirdQuint)(1,3)--D-glucan Based Diagnosis of Invasive Candida Infection in Sepsis.

 (1,3)--D-glucan is a component of the cell wall of many fungi including candida spp.

 and is present in the blood of patients with invasive candida infection (ICI).

 Several studies showed a good diagnostic accuracy (1,3)--D-glucan in predicting ICI.

 However, others have challenged (1,3)--D-glucan as a diagnostic tool in critically ill patients as many substances used in the intensive care unit might affect the results of the assay.

 The goal of this study is to investigate whether (1,3)--D-glucan can early identify sepsis patients in need of antifungal therapy.

 Patients randomized to the standard of care group receive antifungals depending on microbiological results according to current guidelines.

 Patients randomized to the BDG group receive antifungals depending on the (1,3)--D-glucan plasma concentration on day 1 and day after diagnosing sepsis.

 Therapy may be modified according to microbiological results.

This prospective randomized multicenter study evaluates whether the decision to prescribe antifungals guided by (1,3)--D-glucan in comparison to standard of care shortens time to antifungal therapy and reduces mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and a high risk of invasive candida infection.
