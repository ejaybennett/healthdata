(secondQuint)Study of TAK-071 in Healthy Participants and Participants With Mild Cognitive Impairment/Mild Alzheimer Disease and Relative Bioavailability (BA) and Food Effect of TAK-071 in Healthy Participants.

 TAK-071 is being tested to find a safe and well-tolerated dose in healthy participants (non-Japanese and Japanese) and participants with MCI or mild AD (non-Japanese).

 The study will enroll approximately 186 participants.

 The study consists of 4 parts: Single-rising dose (SRD) part (Cohorts 1-6, and 18-22), multiple-rising dose (MRD) part (Cohorts 7-15), Cohort 16 with 2-arm parallel design, and Cohort 17 relative bioavailability and food effect 3 period crossover design.

 Cohorts 1-12 and 18-19, will have 8 randomized participants, with 6 receiving TAK-071, and 2 receiving matching placebo.

 Cohorts 20-22 will have 12 randomized participants with 3 receiving TAK-071 placebo+donepezil placebo, 3 receiving TAK-071 placebo+donepezil, and 6 receiving TAK-071+donepezil.

 Cohorts 13-15, will have 6 randomized participants, with 5 receiving TAK-071, and 1 receiving matching placebo.

 Selected cohorts (Cohorts 10 to 12) will be pretreated for 3 weeks with daily oral doses of donepezil (5 mg QD), followed by continued daily oral donepezil dosing during the TAK-071 treatment period.

 The planned initial dose of TAK-071 for Cohort 1 is 1 mg and subsequent dose levels to be determined by emerging safety, tolerability, and PK data in preceding cohorts.

 Participants in each cohort will be randomized to receive treatment with TAK-071 or matching placebo using drug-in-capsule (DIC) in the morning following a minimum fast of 8 hours.

 In Cohort 16, participants will be assigned to 1 of 2 possible treatments, TAK-071 or matching placebo.

 In Cohort 17, 12 participants will be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment sequences (ABC, BCA, or CAB) with treatment A being Fasted State and Capsule Formulation, Treatment B being Fasted State and Tablet Formulation, and Treatment being C Fed State and Tablet Formulation (10 mg tablet formulation).

 In Cohorts 20-22, participants will be administered as a single dose of TAK-071 or placebo on Day 1, and a single dose of donepezil or placebo approximately 24 hours later on Day 2.

 Study of TAK-071 in Healthy Participants and Participants With Mild Cognitive Impairment/Mild Alzheimer Disease and Relative Bioavailability (BA) and Food Effect of TAK-071 in Healthy Participants@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) of TAK-071 when administered as single rising dose (SRD) and multiple rising dose (MRD) orally in healthy participants and participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer disease (AD).
