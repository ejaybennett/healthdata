(firstQuint)Increasing Physical Activity Among Breast Cancer Survivors With Depression.

 The research project is a pilot study to assess the effects of a multi-component intervention in increasing physical activity among breast cancer survivors with depression.

 Individuals meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the 12-week intervention with a 6 month follow up.

 Intervention components will include print-based education, self-monitoring, Active Living counseling, and facility access.

 Blood samples will be collected at baseline.

 Assessments (anxiety, stress, sleep) and sample collection will also occur at 3 time points during the intervention (Weeks 7, 13, and 25).

 Changes in physical activity will be assessed using Fitbits to measure weekly minutes of moderate/vigorous activity.
