(firstQuint)Virtual Reality for Phantom Limb Pain.

 The VA system performs more than 10% of all amputations in the U.

S.

, a percentage translating into more than 50,000 upper and lower extremity amputations in the past decade.

 Among Veterans with amputations, research suggests that upwards of 70% experience phantom limb pain (PLP), an often chronic and debilitating condition with adverse effects on quality of life and poor responsiveness to conventional pain treatments.

 The use of virtual reality technology for chronic pain management is a novel and rapidly advancing area of study, with existing research suggesting that virtual reality treatments are effective for acute pain management, promising for chronic pain management, and as yet untested for PLP.

 In the current study, the investigators will develop a virtual reality environment that simulates mirror therapy - the gold standard behavioral treatment for PLP - comparing the efficacy of this modality in a population of Veterans with PLP against a standard mirror therapy treatment validated by this research team in a previously supported clinical trial.

 Virtual Reality for Phantom Limb Pain@highlight

This study will develop a virtual reality-based treatment for phantom limb pain among Veterans and test it against the most established behavioral therapy for phantom limb pain, mirror therapy.
