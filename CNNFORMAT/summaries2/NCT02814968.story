(fifthQuint)18F-FDG PET/CT and Whole Body MRI for Staging and Response Prediction in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Enzalutamide.

 Castration-resistant prostate cancer patients eligible for 2nd line hormonal treatment will undergo treatment with Enzalutamide (XTANDI).

 Subjects will receive 1dd 160 mg Enzalutamide orally continuously until progressive disease occurs.

 All subjects will undergo 18F-FDG PET/CT scans at baseline, 2 weeks, 2 and 6, 9 and 12 months after starting androgen receptor-directed treatment.

 All subjects will undergo Whole Body MRI at baseline, 6, 9 and 12 months.

 Bone scans will be performed at baseline, 3 months, 6 and 12 months.

 PSA will be measured at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter until at 12 months.

 CTC counts and characteristics will be measured at baseline and during Enzalutamide treatment.

The aim of the study is to assess the clinical utility of 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) and Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) versus conventional bone scan and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements in response prediction to treatment with Enzalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.

 The study will assess how these 2 imaging modalities perform compared to traditional serial PSA measurements and bone scan in assessing metastatic tumour load, progressive disease and response to treatment with Enzalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.

 In addition measurements of serially collected circulating tumour cell (CTC) samples, cell-free tumour DNA and RNA will be performed in order to evaluate their predictive value in terms of response measurement.
