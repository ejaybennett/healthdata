(fifthQuint)Selinexor With Induction, Consolidation, and Maintenance Therapy in Treating Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess the feasibility of adding selinexor to induction, consolidation and maintenance therapy of elderly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the safety of administering selinexor under the proposed study regimen.

 II.

 To assess response and survival endpoints of patients receiving the proposed study regimen.

 III.

 To assess the rate of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

 OUTLINE: INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) on days 1-7, daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1-3, and selinexor orally (PO) twice weekly from day 1.

 Treatment continues for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 RE-INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients whose disease has not responded receive cytarabine IV on days 1-5, daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1-2, and selinexor PO twice weekly.

 Treatment continues for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients in remission receive cytarabine IV every 12 hours on days 1, 3 and 6, and selinexor PO twice weekly from day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients who have had a response and have not gone on to transplant receive selinexor PO twice weekly.

 Treatment continues for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 14 days and then every 3 months for up to 1 year.

 Selinexor With Induction, Consolidation, and Maintenance Therapy in Treating Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia@highlight

This pilot phase II trial studies how well selinexor works when given together with induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy in treating older patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

 Selinexor may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and daunorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Selinexor with induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy may kill more cancer cells in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
