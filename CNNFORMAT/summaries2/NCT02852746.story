(thirdQuint)Physical/Self-perceived Performance and 3D Shoulder Kinematics of Volleyball Attackers With/Without Shoulder Complaints and Scapular Dyskinesis.

 Volleyball attackers with clinically identified scapular dyskinesis and with/without shoulder symptoms will be compared with respect to performance outcomes and scapular kinematics.

 Performance will be assessed by means of the unilateral seated shot put test (USSPT), the upper quarter Y balance test (UQYBT), and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand, sports module (DASH).

 Pain measurements after completing physical performance measures will be assessed and rated.

 Relationships between physical (USSPT, UQYBT) and self-perceived (DASH) measures of performance, and with impairment-based measures (clinical measures and 3D shoulder kinematics) will be assessed.

 Physical/Self-perceived Performance and 3D Shoulder Kinematics of Volleyball Attackers With/Without Shoulder Complaints and Scapular Dyskinesis@highlight

The study aims to compare the performance and the 3D shoulder kinematics of volleyball attackers with and without scapular dyskinesis and shoulder symptoms in two physical performance measures of the upper extremity, and correlate their outcomes with a self-reported measure of function of the upper extremity.
