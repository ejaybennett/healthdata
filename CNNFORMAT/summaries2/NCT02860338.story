(fifthQuint)COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF MCI and DEMENTIA TREATMENTS IN A COMMUNITY-BASED DEMENTIA PRACTICE.

 From 2008-2013 more than 5,000 patients have been seen by a community-based internist/psychiatrist specializing in treating cognitively impaired adults suffering from MCI or dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease, vascular dementia, combined DAT/VAD, FTD, PD, LBD, as well as dementia due to traumatic brain injury (TBI), alcoholism and autoimmune diseases.

 Cohort 1 includes patients from this specialist practice who were extensively evaluated with a standardized protocol assessment aimed at identifying all reversible and treatable conditions adversely affecting cognition, and achieving maximum diagnostic accuracy with respect to the underlying dementia pathology.

 The protocol included physical and mental status examinations, neuroimaging (PET scans and/or MRI's with volumetrics), lab tests, overnight pulse oximetry, in-lab and ambulatory polysomnography, and gold standard neuropsychological testing as well as rapid, in-office cognitive testing.

 The comprehensive treatment protocol attempted correction of all modifiable and metabolic derangements, and utilized maximally tolerated FDA approved medications and devices.

 Cohort 2 includes patients who were referred by their primary care clinicians or other non-dementia specialists to a neuropsychology practice for a standardized cognitive evaluation as part of usual care, but were not treated by a dementia specialist.

 This in-depth retrospective analysis is the first attempt to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of dementia drugs and other treatment interventions in a cognitively impaired patient group whose baseline metabolic abnormalities were identified, treated and maintained optimally throughout the course of care versus a patient group not so intensively assessed or managed.

 Outcome measures include objective cognitive testing and functional and behavioral assessments correlated with prescribed standard dementia medications, reductions in benzodiazepine, narcotic and antipsychotic use, as well as with baseline and interval measures of oxygenation adequacy, BNP, CRP, IGF-1, homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, iron status, Vitamin D 25-OH, and utilization of oxygen and positive airway pressure treatment.

This retrospective study is a more extensive, confirmatory analysis of the cognitive and functional outcomes initially seen in 2 groups of MCI/dementia patients in Springfield, MA and compares specialized dementia care and a comprehensive treatment approach versus usual care delivered in a non-specialist setting.

 The first group of patients (n= 328) was seen by a dementia specialist, who utilized a standardized assessment and treatment protocol (CNS).

 This included comprehensive identification and treatment of hypoxia, sleep-disorders, and other cognitively-impairing metabolic conditions as well as maximally- dosed FDA-approved medications for dementia, depression, and PBA.

 The second group of patients (n= 280) was seen by non-dementia specialists in the community and received usual care which did not include comprehensive assessment or treatment of underlying metabolic derangements or maximal utilization of currently available medications.

 This study, evaluating date from a larger cohort (n>800) of specialist-treated cognitively-impaired patients, will further examine the hypothesis that a comprehensive dementia treatment protocol yields cognitive stabilization and/or improvement using already available dementia drugs when compared with usual community care.
