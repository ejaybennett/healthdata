(secondQuint)Comparing the Efficacy of Intrauterine Balloon and Intrauterine Contraceptive Device for the Therapy of Uterine Adhesion.

 Intrauterine balloon and IUD are both effective in the therapy for intrauterine adhesion.

 The IUD is usually inserted into the uterine after a hysteroscopic adhesiolysis and removed after two or three month later.

 Several investigators demonstrated its favorable effect in the recurrence of adhesion after the treatment of intrauterine adhesion.

 The heart-shaped intrauterine balloon is specially designed to fit into the cavity of the uterus, and usually removed on the 7th day after surgery.
