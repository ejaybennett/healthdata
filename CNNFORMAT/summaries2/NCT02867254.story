(fifthQuint)Candida Albicans in Periodontal and Endodontic Lesions in Diabetic and Normoglycemic Patients.

 This case-control study was conducted on thirty patients (15 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 15 normoglycemics) with clinical and radiographic diagnosis of a periodontal endodontic lesion.

 To assess the glycemic control of the patients were measured the plasma glucose level and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations (HbA1c).

 All patients were initially submitted to examination to verify the clinical periodontal parameters (plaque index, probing bleeding, probing depth, clinical attachment level and gingival recession) and pulp sensitivity testing.

 The study included patients who presented periodontal pockets involving the apical region of the tooth and pulp necrosis (periodontal endodontic lesion).

 Exclusion criteria were: use of antibiotics in the last six months, pregnancy, smoking, other systemic diseases, clinical signs of oral candidiasis, and patients who did not sign a free and clarified consent term.

 Sample collection Collection from the root canal was performed after access, rubber dam isolation, disinfection of the surgical field with 5.

25% sodium hypochlorite, and neutralization with 5% sodium thiosulfato, with 3 sterile paper points remaining in the root canal for one minute.

 Sampling of the periodontal pocket was made at the deepest site through 3 sterile paper points, inserted one by one for one minute.

 The material collected from the periodontal pocket and the root canal was inoculated in Eppendorf tubes containing 1 ml of reduced transport fluid (RTF).

 Next, samples from each site were diluted and plated on the medium Saboraund Dextrose Agar plus Chloramphenicol and chromogenic medium (CHROMagar Candida (R), BioMerieux, Paris, France) and incubated at 37 C for 48h in a reduced oxygen atmosphere (10% CO2 and 90% air).

 The green colonies that grew on CHROMagar plates were chosen at random and stored in glycerol at 20 C for later identification by PCR.

 Candida Albicans in Periodontal and Endodontic Lesions in Diabetic and Normoglycemic Patients@highlight

Pulpal and periodontal tissues are closely related and have similar microbiota that cross-contamination between the pulp and periodontal tissues.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of isolated Candida albicans from periodontal endodontic lesions in diabetic and normoglycemic patients and their virulence in different atmospheric conditions.

 A case-control study was conducted on 15 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (G1) and 15 non-diabetics (G2), with periodontal endodontic lesions.

 Samples of root canals and periodontal pockets were plated on CHROMagar for later identification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and virulence test.
