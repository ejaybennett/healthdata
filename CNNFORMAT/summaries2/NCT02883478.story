(secondQuint)Clinical and Structural Outcome of Conventional Versus Accelerated Corneal Collagen Cross-linking (CXL).

.

 40 patients with signs of progressive keratoconus are randomized to either corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) with conventional ultraviolet-A (UVA) irradiation at 3 milliwatt/cm (mW/ cm) or accelerated ultraviolet-A (UVA) irradiation at 9 mW/ cm.

 In both groups riboflavin with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose was used.

 The objectives of this study are to evaluate and compare different corneal parameters (maximum corneal curvature, depth of collagen cross-linking, endothelial cell density) and clinical outcomes of uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA)) after CXL with conventional and accelerated UVA irradiation.
