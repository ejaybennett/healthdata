(fifthQuint)The New Intubating Laryngeal Tube Suction-Disposable.

 The intubating Laryngeal Tube Suction-Disposable (iLTS-D) (VBM Medizintechnik, Sulz, Germany) is a new updated version of the Laryngeal Tube-Suction Disposable (LTS-D).

 It has a ventilator channel with a 13.

5mm internal diameter, which enables the passage of an Endotracheal Tube (ETT) either blindly or with fibreoptic guidance.

 Similarly to the LTS-D, the iLTS-D also has a separate channel for gastric tubes placement up to a size of 18 Fr.

 The current randomized study was designed to assess the success rate of blind and fibreoptic endotracheal intubation using iLTS-D, in comparison with the Ambu(R) AuraGain cent in adult patients under general anesthesia.

The study compares the intubating Laryngeal Tube Suction (iLTS-D) with the Ambu(R)AuraGain cent in blind and fibreoptic endotracheal intubation.

 The current randomized study is designed to assess the success rate of blind and fibreoptic endotracheal intubation using i-LTS-D, in comparison with the Air-Q, i-gel(R) and Ambu(R)AuraGain cent in an airway simulator.

 The investigators hypothesize that the iLTS-D and the Supreme Laryngeal Mask Airway will similarly perform during spontaneous ventilation despite differences in their structural design.
