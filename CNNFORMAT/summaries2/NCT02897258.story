(fifthQuint)Thrombosis and Haemorrhage in Chronic Hemodialysis Patients.

 All adult patients aged 18 and over who started a new hemodialysis replacement therapy in Lorraine between 01/01/2009 and 31/12/2010 are identified from the registry REIN (Epidemiology and Information Network in nephrology).

 The latter are included in the study T2HD to the initiation of dialysis and followed until the date point 30/06/2013.

 The outcome was survival without major clinical event.

 Are considered major clinical events: acute coronary syndrome, acute limb ischemia, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, thrombosis First, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, the digestive hemorrhage, and severe bleeding.

 Statistical analysis will compare event-free survival of patients in 4 groups.

 Patients will be censored at the time of the occurrence of a kidney transplant, a dialysis method of change, a dialysis withdrawal, a move outside Lorraine, or date point if they are still alive .

 To minimize bias maximum indication, patients of different groups will be matched on propensity score (probability for a given patient to be treated by antiplatelet and / or anticoagulant).
