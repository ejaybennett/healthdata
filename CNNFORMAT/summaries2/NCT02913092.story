(firstQuint)Electronic Monitoring of Medication Adherence in Moderate to Severe Asthma Patients.

 This study will assess the feasibility of using electronic sensors for asthma inhalers in a population of urban minority adults and children with moderate-severe asthma in the Bronx.

 Investigators will also assess differences in asthma outcomes (specifically asthma control as a primary outcome measure) and treatment adherence in a group of participants with moderate-severe asthma who use inhalers with electronic sensors and real-time remote outreach worker monitoring/feedback compared to a group of participants who use inhalers with electronic sensors but without real-time monitoring/feedback.
