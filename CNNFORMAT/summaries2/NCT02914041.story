 Kyphotic Measure Using Distance From the Wall@highlight

Are the KypDisT and conventional C7WD are practical, valid, reliable, and effectiveness of the tools to discriminate the functional ability impairments relating to kyphosis when compare with gold standard (Cobb's method), and compare among physical therapy, VHS and caregiver?
