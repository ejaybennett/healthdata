(thirdQuint)Recording Facial Expressions to Assess Taste in Children and Teenagers.

 Participants will taste three different substances in random order: 1.

 Prednisone liquid (a commonly used medicine to treat swelling which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration) for use in children; 2.

 A solution of table sugar in water (simple syrup); and 3.

 Ora-Plus, which is a solution that can be added to medicines.

 Ora-Plus is considered safe for use in children's formulas and all of the ingredients of Ora-Plus are on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) list.

 About 1 ml of each substance will be placed directly onto the tongue.

 Each substance will be tasted for 5-10 seconds and then, expectorated.

 Participants and investigators recording responses will be blinded with regard to the identity of test substances.

 Facial expression will be recorded prior to administration of the taste substances and for approximately 2 minutes thereafter.

 An audio recording of the participant's voice will also be made during this time.

 At about 5 and 10 minutes after a given taste substance is administered, participants will be asked to identify a face on a 5-point facial hedonic scale which shows the participant's taste perception.

 Participants will also be asked to describe the taste sensation experienced as sweet, bitter or neutral (no apparent taste).

 Participants will have a 30-minute rest period after administration of each taste substance which will include the administration of water and a neutral food to enable cleansing of the palate.

 The procedure above will be repeated in the same way for each of the 3 test substances.

 Recording Facial Expressions to Assess Taste in Children and Teenagers@highlight

The study is designed to see if, after tasting specific things, whether a child's facial pattern and voice pattern can determine the difference in something that has a sweet taste, no taste, and a bitter taste.

 The investigators will do this by comparing video recordings of a child's facial expression and voice to the child's response to follow-up questions after tasting three (3) different substances.
