(firstQuint)Does McGRATH MAC Videolaryngoscope Decrease the Number of People Required to Perform Intubation During Anesthesia ?.

 Videolaryngoscopes, such as McGRATH(R) MAC videolaryngoscope, are used to facilitate tracheal intubations.

 This study is designed to evaluate the proportion of cases requiring more than one member of the anesthesiology team when the video feature of McGRATH(R) MAC is available during laryngoscopy in a population of patients without a predicted difficult intubation (Arne's score <11).

 General anesthesia from induction until tracheal intubation is recorded on a video for further analysis.

 Analysis includes characteristics of intubation, patient's monitoring and cooperation between anesthesiologists in two groups.

 In the control group, the screen of the McGRATH(R) MAC videolaryngoscope is hidden.

 In the experimental group, the McGRATH(R) MAC videolaryngoscope is used with its video feature.
