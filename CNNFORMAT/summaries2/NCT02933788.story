(secondQuint)Effect of aSpirin Versus CilOstazol for Inhibition of Antiplatelet aggRegaTion in Type 2 DM Patients.

 Diabetes is a dangerous disease with high risk of vascular complications.

 Thus, to prevent these vascular complication, antithrombotic drug may be administered.

 Representative antithrombotic agents are aspirin and cilostazol.

 However, recent studies suggested that aspirin did not have sufficient effect to prevent vascular complications of diabetes.

 For that reason, it have been reported that antithrombotic effects of aspirin were falling in diabetes patients, so-called 'aspirin resistance.

 On the other hand, cilostazol used as the control drug inhibits atherosclerosis in diabetes patients in the studies of Asia including Korea, and it is effective to inhibit the risk of various cardiovascular disease.

 Therefore, cilostazol is likely to use drugs as substitute for aspirin therapy.

 Effect of aSpirin Versus CilOstazol for Inhibition of Antiplatelet aggRegaTion in Type 2 DM Patients@highlight

This study evaluates the more suitable treatment for the prevention of vascular complications in diabetes patents who were at high cardiovascular risk group by comparing the platelet aggregation inhibitory effect of aspirin and cilostazol.
