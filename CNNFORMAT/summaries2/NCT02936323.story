(secondQuint)PEN-221 in Somatostatin Receptor 2 Expressing Advanced Cancers Including Neuroendocrine and Small Cell Lung Cancers.

 Protocol PEN-221-001 will first enroll patients into a dose escalation phase, where a Bayesian logistic regression model, guided by the escalation with overdose control principle and overseen by a safety review committee, will be used to make dose recommendations and estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

 Once the MTD has been confirmed, remaining patients will be enrolled into a full expansion phase to assess PEN-221 efficacy in patients with gastrointestinal mid-gut neuroendocrine tumors or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or small cell lung cancer.
