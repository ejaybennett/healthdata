(thirdQuint)Diet, Insulin Sensitivity, and Postprandial Metabolism.

 In a 16-week trial, overweight adults will be randomly assigned to two groups.

 Changes in beta-cell function will be the primary outcome.

 Changes in insulin sensitivity will be the secondary outcome.

 Changes in postprandial metabolism, and body weight will be the tertiary outcomes.

 The Diet Group will be asked to follow a low-fat, vegan diet and will receive weekly classes and support.

 The Control Group will be asked to follow a conventional control diet.

 This study conducts a pilot substudy to test the hypothesis that changes in insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function observed in response to a diet intervention correlate with changes in intramyocellular and/or intrahepatocellular lipid.

 Another sub-study assesses the association between metabolic outcomes and gut microbiome.

 One additional sub-study is looking for associations between metabolic outcomes and endothelial function.

 Diet, Insulin Sensitivity, and Postprandial Metabolism@highlight

This randomized, controlled trial aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which a plant-based dietary intervention causes weight loss.

 Using a low-fat, plant-based diet for 16 weeks, along with an untreated control for comparison, the study will measure changes in insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, postprandial metabolism, and intracellular lipid, and assess their associations with changes in body weight.
