(secondQuint)Asthma L-Citrulline Pilot Study.

 Research has shown that some obese asthmatics have a metabolic imbalance in which L-arginine levels are reduced.

 L-arginine is an amino acid that is used to make NO, a gas that is normally made in the bronchi and ensures that the lungs function properly.

 In this pilot study subjects with asthma that have an increased body mass index compatible with being obese, will be invited to participate in a short open-label treatment with 15g/day of L-citrulline for two weeks.

 Study participants will be asked to do lung function testing and donate blood before and after taking the supplement.

 L-citrulline is safe and well tolerated and has been used at much higher doses without significant side effects.

This study will evaluate whether treatment with L-citrulline, which is an amino acid found in some foods, can increase levels of L-arginine and thereby restore the concentration of nitric oxide (NO) in the airways.
