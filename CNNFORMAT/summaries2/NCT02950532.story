(secondQuint)Posterior Ligament Complex Assessment Without Magnetic Resonance Image in Thoracolumbar Fractures.

 Integrity of posterior ligament complex (PLC) has an important bearing on the treatment strategies for thoracolumbar (TL) fractures.

 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold standard to confirm PLC injury.

 The routine use of MRI has its limitations especially since in most trauma centers MRI is not the primary assessment for TL fractures due to reduced availability, increased cost and its adverse applicability in trauma setting and in case of a polytrauma.

 In contrast computed tomography (CT) scans are an integral part of trauma evaluation protocols, are accurate in spine fracture diagnosis and are performed in less time, making them suitable to assess polytrauma scenarios.

 In a recent pilot study, a number of radiological parameters based on CT scans have shown to reliably detect PLC injury when compared to MRI.

 The aim of the study is to reconfirm and validate these CT based parameters to assess PLC injury compared to MRI.

The objective of this investigation is to confirm the results obtained in a pilot study showing that certain radiological parameters based on computed tomography (CT) scans seem to reliably detect posterior ligament complex (PLC) injury without the need for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
