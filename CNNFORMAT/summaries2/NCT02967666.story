(thirdQuint)Evaluation of PET/MRI Using a Somatostatin Analog Tracer as a Novel Approach to Detecting Pathology in High Risk TB-exposed Contacts.

 Granulomas, the hallmark of TB infection, have an increased density of somatostatin receptors.

 Somatostatin analog PET tracers, such as 68Ga-DOTANOC, bind to somatostatin receptors and are able to detect pulmonary TB lesions using PET/MRI.

 This study aims to better understand the pathology of the spectrum of latent TB using 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/MRI imaging, identifying individuals with subclinical pulmonary TB who may be at risk of progressing to active TB.

 Currently, biomarkers to identify those who are at risk of developing active TB are limited.

 Non-invasive biomarkers for pulmonary lesions are sorely needed and imaging with 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/MRI provides an opportunity to detect subclinical pulmonary disease in those who have been in close contact with smear-positive pulmonary TB.

PET/MRI (positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging) with somatostatin analog tracers has the potential to provide an imaging technique targeting subclinical granulomatous disease in those with latent tuberculosis (TB), allowing identification of individuals who may be at risk of progression to active TB.
