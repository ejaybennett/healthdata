(thirdQuint)Dual Inhibition of EGFR With Afatinib and Cetuximab in the Treatment of Advanced Squamous Cell Cancers of the Head and Neck.

 Patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who are previously treated with a platinum based regimen or with an immune checkpoint inhibitor will be eligible for participation on the study.

 After a baseline evaluation and biopsy, they will be treated with weekly IV cetuximab and daily oral afatinib.

 Biopsy will be repeated where feasible after 4 weeks on therapy and again at disease progression or end of treatment.

 Treatment will continue until disease progression or development of grade 3 or higher drug related toxicities that fail to resolve to Grade 1 despite appropriate supportive care.
