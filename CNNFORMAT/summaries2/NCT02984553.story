(firstQuint)Objective Physical Activity Assesment in Postmenopausal Women.

 This observational study aims to accurately assess weekly physical activity levels of postmenopausal women using lactate thresholds to individualize the accelerometer cut-points.

 Postmenopausal women will be recruited from local advertisements in public health centers.

 Each woman will perfom on different days a progressive discontinuous submaximal walking-running test and several constant speed tests wearing an accelerometer to identify the individual lactate threshold (LT), the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) and the corresponding accelerometer activity counts/min (cpm).

 Participants then will wear an actigraph accelerometer (wGT3X-BT) for seven days.

 Linear regression equations will be developed for each participant to determine accelerometer activity counts for each intensity level: 1) sedentary behaviour (MLSS).

 Physical activity levels will be measured using both, individualized approach and Sasaki, Jonh and Freedsons (2011) absolute cut-points obtained through walking and running activities eliciting 3-6 MET intensities (2689-6166 cpm), considering it a "moderate" effort.
