(thirdQuint)Fast Track Hip Fracture - an Optimized Pathway for Hip Fracture Patients.

 The Norwegian hip fracture register prospectively collects data on all hip fracture patients including, among others, time to surgery, type of fracture, type of surgery and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score.

 The register also collects quality of life data 4 and 12 months after surgery.

 Using the unique Norwegian personal identification number the data from the Norwegian hip fracture register will be connected with data from the electronic patient record at Akershus University hospital (AHUS).

 Fast track surgery for hip fracture patients was introduced at the end of 2013.

 Mortality and quality of life data will be compared for all hip fracture patients operated at AHUS two years before and two years after this change in standard care.

 The combined data from the register and the electronic patient records will be used for regression analysis.

 Fast Track Hip Fracture - an Optimized Pathway for Hip Fracture Patients@highlight

The study examines if the introduction of a fast track pathway for hip fracture patients had an influence on mortality and quality of life by comparing these outcomes between all hip fracture patients operated at Akershus University Hospital two years before and two years after this change in standard care.
