(fifthQuint)The Benefit/Risk Profile of AOP2014 in Low-risk Patients With PV.

 It is an independent, investigator-generated, pragmatic trial including adult PV patients (aged 18-60) diagnosed according to World Health Organization 2008 criteria within the last 3 years before inclusion, without history of thrombosis and younger than 60 years ('low risk' patients).

 Eligible patients are randomized to be treated with the best available therapy (recommended for this risk class, standard arm) based on phlebotomy including administration of low-dose (100 mg/daily) of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, when there are not contraindications) OR Pegylated Proline-Interferon alpha-2b (AOP2014) every 2 weeks in addition to the recommended available regimen (experimental arm), for up to 12 months.

 The allocation of patients to study arms is 1:1 and stratification at randomization will be performed according to age category ( 50 years old) and time from diagnosis (nave or non-nave).

 Naive patients are defined as new cases coming to observation, diagnosed for the first time just before study entry and never treated; non-naive patients are old cases (diagnosis not older than 3 years before study entry) undergoing therapy with phlebotomy and/or low doses of ASA.

 Primary endpoint (PEp) is defined by the proportion (%) of patients who maintain the median value of hematocrit (HCT) below 45% during 12 months of treatment in each arm, without progression of disease and no need of any extra-protocol cytoreductive drug (responder patients).

 Secondary endpoints include evaluation of hematological and molecular response, histological remission and safety profile of the protocol therapy.

 Before randomization all patients undergo phlebotomies in order to reach an HCT below 45%.

 After randomization, according to current common clinical practice the regimen of phlebotomies must be selected accordingly to maintain the recommended level of HCT mu g of Pegylated Proline-Interferon alpha-2b (AOP2014) once every 14 days.

 Patient visits are scheduled every month (4 weeks) for 12 months to assess and perform a reliable calculation of the primary end-point (% of patients with median HCT levels <45%).

 At each monthly visit a pre-filled auto-injection pen is delivered to the patients who have been randomized in the experimental arm.

 Assuming an expected drop-out rate of 12%, a total sample size of 150 patients (75 randomized in each group) will be randomized to reject the null hypothesis that the proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint is 50% in favor of the alternative hypothesis that this proportion is 75% when AOP2014 is added to the phlebotomy based- therapy, with a power of 80% and an alpha error of 0.

05 (two-tailed).

 The primary endpoint assessment is performed after the completion of the first 12 months of therapy for all subjects enrolled ('core study').

 A period of 12 months is expected for completion of the enrolment / randomization phase.

 The 'core study' itself will take 12 months of treatment per patient.

 Based on results from the 'core study' the extension phase will continue as follows: 1.

 After 12 month patients who meet the primary endpoint following either conventional or experimental therapy will enter the extension phase and remain on their current regimen.

 2.

 non-responders, not meeting the primary endpoint after 12 months of conventional therapy will be switched to the experimental treatment.

 3.

 non-responder, not meeting the primary endpoint after 12 months of experimental therapy will be switched to conventional treatment.

 This extension phase will last for another 12 months from the Last Visit Last Patient included (LVLP) into the core study (matching cases 1 and 2 as defined above).

 Based on this, the overall length of the study is expected to cover a period of 36 months from the First Patient Included (FPI).

 The Benefit/Risk Profile of AOP2014 in Low-risk Patients With PV@highlight

The Low-PV study is a multicenter, phase II, randomized trial aimed to assess whether the addition of Pegylated Proline-interferon-alpha-2b to the best therapeutic current strategy available based on phlebotomies and low dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) could improve the efficacy of treatment of patients with PV at low risk of thrombosis (younger than 60 years and without prior vascular events), in term of control of recommended level of hematocrit < 45%, over a period of 12 months.
