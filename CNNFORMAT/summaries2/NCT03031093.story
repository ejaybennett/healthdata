(secondQuint)Aerosol Therapy in Obese COPD Patients.

.

 This study has the objective to clarify the factors that directly influence the effectiveness of inhaled drug deposition in obese patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and then formulate specific strategies to control the evolution of this disease.

 The suggested strategy in order to implement the aerosol therapy is the use of High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) during these patients inhalation therapy.

 It will consist in a cross-over clinical trial.

 The population will be composed by volunteers of both genders, aged between 45-70 years old.

 Four distinct groups will be formed: obese participants without copd; obese participants with copd; non obese participants without copd; non-obese participants with copd.
