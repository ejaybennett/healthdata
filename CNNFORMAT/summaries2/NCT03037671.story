(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Malglycemia Via Continuous Glucose Monitoring in the Pediatric HSCT Population.

 This study is a prospective observational cohort analysis examining the rate of malglycemia in the pediatric HSCT population and the effect of malglycemia on important post-HSCT outcomes.

 In addition to usual care during the peri-HSCT period, participants in this trial will be asked to wear a continuous glucose monitor for the duration of their initial hospital admission.

 Participants will wear this monitor while admitted to the hospital for up to one week prior to transplant, and up to 60 days after transplant.

 Evaluation of Malglycemia Via Continuous Glucose Monitoring in the Pediatric HSCT Population@highlight

This study is designed to determine feasibility of using a continuous glucose monitor in pediatric, adolescent and young adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, and to identify the incidence and risk factors for malglycemia in primary admission for pediatric, adolescent and young adult HSCT patients as well as to characterize the relationship between outcomes and malglycemia in this population.
