(fifthQuint)Determination of the Optimal "Next Bolus" Interval for Programmed Intermittent Bolus Epidural Analgesia.

 Background Enhanced epidural pump technology now supports the use of automated or programmed intermittent bolus (PIB) administration.

 Anesthesiologists can now program pumps to deliver small, regularly timed intermittent boluses for maintenance of labour analgesia and specify "lockout" intervals to ensure patient safety.

 Several studies suggest that administration of PIB may result in a more extensive spread of local anesthetic in the epidural space and provide superior labour analgesia compared to CEI.

 In a recently published systematic review by George et al.

 (1), PIB was associated with lower anesthetic consumption, a shorter second stage of labour and greater patient satisfaction compared to CEI (1).

 The optimal PIB volume and dosing interval for programmed intermittent bolus has not been determined.

 A small volume with a short bolus interval may be associated with similar drawbacks as continuous infusion, while a large volume bolus interval may be associated with increased breakthrough pain and reduced patient satisfaction.

 Wong et al.

 showed that extending the PIB interval from 15 min to 60 min with a larger PIB volume (10 mL vs.

 2.

5 mL) results in decreased anesthetic consumption without affecting patient satisfaction (3).

 Until recently, there was not a pump that could provide PIB along with PCEA.

 Smith Medical now produces the CADD pump with this feature.

 It ensures that that there are specific limits set to not allow "stacking" of boluses and potentially unsafe administration of local anesthetics.

 This pump now has more variables to program and determine the quality of labour analgesia.

 A variable that has not received any research attention is the "Next Bolus" (Figure 5).

 "Next Bolus" (NB) determines when the first PIB bolus is given after the initiation of the epidural and starting of the pump.

 Currently we set this to be 15-45 minutes depending on the clinician.

 Determining the optimal timing of the NB is important because if the bolus is given too late there may be increased pain and less patient satisfaction.

 This could lead to earlier initiation of PCEA, more frequent PCEA attempts and possibly the need for physician intervention for a manual bolus.

 As more local anesthetic is delivered, the patient may have a decrease in blood pressure or greater motor blockade (i.

e.

 leg weakness) than desired.

 Design & Procedure Potential participants will be identified by research personnel by communicating with the attending anesthesiologist on the Birth Unit and the Clinical Leader of Operations for the Birth Unit at the IWK Health Centre.

 Birth Unit nurses will receive an educational session and training provided by the research coordinator prior to study commencement.

 Birth unit nurses will be notified by the Clinical Leader of Operations if their patient meets study inclusion criteria.

 The patient's nurse will review options for labour pain relief with the patient.

 These options include non-pharmacological measures (baths, massage, hypnosis etc.

), inhaled nitrous oxide, opioid injections, or an epidural.

 When labour pain management options are introduced, the nurse will provide the patient with a brochure that includes basic study information.

 If an epidural is requested for labour analgesia, nurses who have received education regarding the study, will ask the patient if they would be willing to speak with research staff.

 With their consent, participants will be approached by study personnel and informed, written consent will be obtained.

 As standard care in the birth unit, upon request of labour analgesia, the cervix will be measured and a baseline pain score and blood pressure will be determined.

 A staff anesthesiologist will use a combined spinal-epidural (CSE) technique to initiate labour analgesia.

 As per standard practice at the IWK, an IV catheter will be in place before initiation of the technique.

 With the patient in the sitting position, the epidural space will be identified at the L3-4 or L2-3 interspace with a 17G, 9 cm Tuohy epidural needle using a loss of resistance to air or saline (2 test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate.

 The investigators will perform the statistical analysis, with the assistance of collaborating statistician.

 An interim analysis will not be conducted and set at 0.

05 for significance.

 A sample size of 26 per group will have an 80 % power to detect a reduction in the time to first PCEA request by 20 minutes at alpha=0.

05.

 To account for any dropouts, we will aim to recruit 35 patients per group.

 Determination of the Optimal "Next Bolus" Interval for Programmed Intermittent Bolus Epidural Analgesia@highlight

The current standard of practice for the maintenance of epidural analgesia is through use of a continuous infusion pump.

 Enhanced technology now supports the use of programmed intermittent bolus (PIEB) administration.

 This novel drug delivery system provides small boluses of local anesthetic and opioid at programmed intervals.

 Several studies suggest that administration of PIEB allows a more extensive spread of local anesthetic in the epidural space and provides superior labour analgesia compared to traditional continuous epidural infusions.

 PIEB is associated with lower anesthetic consumption, a shorter second stage of labour and greater patient satisfaction.

 The authors are focusing on a PIEB setting known as the "Next Bolus".

 "Next Bolus" (NB) determines when the first PIEB bolus is given after the initiation of the epidural and starting the PIEB pump.

 Currently we set this to be 15-45 minutes.

 In an attempt to optimize resources, authors hope to determine the optimal NB interval that will provide adequate analgesia but limit overall drug consumption.

 An optimally timed next bolus should minimize drug costs and limit nurse and physician intervention by decreasing the need for manual boluses.

Increased local anesthetic consumption can cause undesirable side effects such as itchiness, decreased blood pressure and motor blockade.

 By assigning patients to receive the NB at 15, 30 or 45 minutes the authors hope to find the interval that provides analgesia while minimizing side effects, improving patient safety.

 If the bolus is given too late then there may be increased pain, less patient satisfaction, and the need for more analgesia in the form of Patient Controlled Epidural Anesthesia or a manual bolus.

The authors hope that determining the NB will result in an institutional change to improve patient outcomes and facilitate knowledge transfer.

 This information will be the first available research to help guide other obstetrical centres using PIEB technology in determining the optimal NB interval.
