 Evaluation of the Effect the Medical Team in the Delivery Room Has on Pain Management During Labor.

@highlight

In the current study the investigators wish to evaluate the effect the doctors and midwives in the delivery room have on the timing and modality of analgesia chosen by the participants.

 The participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups.

 Both groups will be advised of the different modalities of analgesia available during labor.

 One group will be managed in the delivery room the same as if not part of the study, meaning the doctors and midwives will treat the participants the way they usually do regarding analgesia.

 The second group of participants will not be asked by the doctors and midwives about analgesia at all but will be able to receive analgesia by a modality of choice at the timing of choice.
