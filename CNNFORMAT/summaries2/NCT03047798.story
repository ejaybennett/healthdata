 The subjects are randomly allocated to one of the three experimental groups: 1) the control; 2) ASM group for aqueous single-phase mouthrinse; 3) OTM group for oil-water two-phase mouthrinse.

 The experimental mouthrinses all contain sodium fluoride and the ASM and OTM contain additional ingredients of bamboo salt, magnolia bark and centella asiatica extracts.

 For the OTM, 50% essential oil is added to create an oil-water two-phase mouthrinse.

 The completion of each experiment regimen is followed by a 2-week washout period, after which the subjects of each group were permutated to the next mouthrinse trial until all three groups underwent the three mouthrinse trial regimen.
