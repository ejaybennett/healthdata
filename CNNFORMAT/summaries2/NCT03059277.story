(secondQuint)Intravitreal Alfibercept for Center Involved DME Previously Managed With Intravitreal Ranibizumab.

 This is a phase 4 prospective, nonrandomized, open label, interventional clinical trial to determine the efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept (IAI) administered in a treat and extend fashion in eyes that have persistent centered involved diabetic macular edema despite at least 4 intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 0.

3mg over 24 weeks prior to enrollment.

 Patients will receive intravitreal injections of aflibercept (2mg/0.

05cc) at baseline and monthly until an eye has reached stability defined as: 10 % from its lowest level in the previous 2 consecutive visits, or CRT increases by 5 letters from baseline then the eye will receive IAI and the treatment interval will be decreased by 1 week.

 If the eye has not improved or worsened for at least 2 consecutive visits and the SD OCT central subfield thickness is 300 microns or visual acuity is worse than 20/20, the following will be done: Prior to the 24-week visit, an injection will be given.

 At and after the 24-week visit, an injection will be given and modified grid laser can be given at the discretion of the investigator within 7 days of IAI based on rescue criteria.
