(secondQuint)Mindful Walking Intervention for Knee Osteoarthritis.

 People with knee osteoarthritis have low levels of physical activity, especially walking activity.

 They also walk with abnormal walking biomechanics that are associated with greater knee loading.

 Therefore, it is important to increase the levels of walking activity in people with knee osteoarthritis, but also change their walking patterns to reduce knee loading.

 This study will last 12 months and participants will be randomized into 2 groups.

 For the first 6-months, half of the participants will attend sessions at a community location that include training in mindful walking technique.

 The other half will meet for the same frequency and duration at a community location for education on osteoarthritis and its management (focusing on symptom management, importance of physical activity, weight management, etc.

).

 Both groups will also receive a wrist-worn activity monitor and a smartphone application that they will use throughout the study.

 After 6-months all participants will be allowed to practice on their own.

 All participants will complete gait analysis, questionnaires, physical function assessment at baseline and at 6-months.

 All participants will also complete questionnaires at 3,9, and 12 months.

 Daily physical activity and knee pain data will be collected using the smartphone application daily for 12- months.

 Mindful Walking Intervention for Knee Osteoarthritis@highlight

This study evaluates the feasibility of a mindful walking intervention for management of knee osteoarthritis.

 Half of the participants will receive the mindful walking intervention while the other half will receive education on osteoarthritis management.
