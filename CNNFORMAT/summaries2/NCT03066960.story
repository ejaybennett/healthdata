(fifthQuint)Radiofrequency Neurotomy for Chronic Facet Joint Related Neck Pain.

 Chronic neck pain represents a common health problem.

 The mechanisms appear to be multifactorial.

 Researchers have suggested a disturbed interplay between the neck muscles and the facet joints.

 In Europe and the US radiofrequency neurotomy (RFN) has become a common treatment.

 The evidence base, however, is still insufficient.

 Thus, a double blind, sham-controlled, randomized, two-center trial will be carried out including 44 participants.

 To simplify the data collection a digital internet based program will be used.

 Patients with chronic neck pain, referred to Oslo University Hospital or St Olavs University Hospital and not responding to non-interventional treatment, will be screened.

 Those who are found eligible and achieve >75% pain relief to predictive test blocks, can be included.

 Demographic and clinical data will be recorded at baseline and the primary and secondary outcome measurements are recollected after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

 Primary outcome measurements include self reported neck function (NDI) and pain relief.

 Regression analyses will be used to identify how 75% pain relief of two test blocks and pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale = PCS) predict response to RF neurotomy .

 If RF neurotomy is found superior to sham treatment, this may be implemented in the national treatment program for selected patients with chronic neck pain.

The researchers are planning a two-center double blind, sham-controlled randomized trial (N: 44) to assess the long term efficacy of RF neurotomy of cervical medial branches.

 Patients with chronic neck pain who are found eligible and achieve >75% pain relief to predictive test blocks, can be included.

 Demographic and clinical data will be recorded at baseline while primary and secondary outcome measurements are recollected after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

 Primary outcome measurements include self reported neck function (NDI) and pain relief.

 Regression analyses will be used to identify how >75% pain relief of a two blocks predicts response to RF neurotomy.
