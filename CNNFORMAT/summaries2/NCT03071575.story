(fifthQuint)Measles-Rubella Vaccine Immunogenicity at 6 and 9 Months of Age.

 In countries with low levels of circulating measles virus, and lower risk for measles infection, measles containing vaccine first dose (MCV1) is recommended at 12 months of age.

 In countries with high risk for measles, MCV1 is recommended at 9 months.

 In the past decade, many countries have been experiencing measles outbreaks with a high proportion of cases among infants 200,000 population.

 From 2007 to 2010, icddr,b, the Ministry of Health (MOH) in collaboration with other international organizations conducted several randomized vaccine effectiveness studies.

 This study will be an open-label, randomized, 2-arm clinical trial.

 620 children will be enrolled and randomized at 6 months of age to one of two study arms.

 The primary objectives of this study are to assess the immunogenicity of MR vaccine at 6 months, and assess equality of MR vaccine seroconversion administered at 9 months following administration of an earlier MR vaccine dose at 6 months of age compared with MR vaccine dose administered at 9 months only without previous MR vaccination.

 The study will enrol generally healthy 6 month old infants living in Matlab and who have never received an MR vaccine dose and have no history of measles or rubella.

 Participants will be followed to 11 months of age.

 Infants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of two arms.

 Infants in Study Arm A will receive MR vaccine at 6 months of age (at enrolment) and at 9 months.

 Infants in Study arm B will receive MR vaccine only at 9 months.

 Blood specimens will be collected from all infants at 6, 9 and 11 months of age.

 The 6 month sample is a pre-vaccination sample and mainly will be used to determine maternal antibody levels.

 For arm A, the sample collected at 9 months before the second MR dose will be used to assess antibody levels after the first MR dose at 6 months of age.

 For study Arm B, the 9 month sample will be used to assess measles and rubella antibody decay rate.

 The sample collected at 11 months will be used to assess immune response to either a two dose or a one dose schedule (arms A and B, respectively).

 Measles-Rubella Vaccine Immunogenicity at 6 and 9 Months of Age@highlight

This is an open-label, randomized, 2-arm clinical trial in healthy infants in Bangladesh.

 The primary purpose of the study is to assess the immunogenicity of measles-rubella (MR) vaccine when delivered at 6 months.

 In addition, the study will establish the equality of MR vaccine seroconversion administered at 9 months following administration of an earlier MR vaccine dose at 6 months of age compared to MR vaccine dose administered at 9 months without previous MR vaccination.

 This study will also provide additional data on safety and tolerance of MR vaccine given at 6 months, and impact of maternal antibodies on immunogenicity of MR vaccine at 6 months.

 - Primary objectives: 1.

 To assess immunogenicity of MR vaccine at 6 months of age 2.

 To assess immunogenicity of MR vaccine at 9 months of age among children without prior measles and rubella vaccination, compared with MR vaccine immunogenicity among those who had a prior MR vaccination at 6 months of age - Secondary objectives 1.

 To assess the frequency of adverse reactions following administration of MR vaccine at 6 months 2.

 To compare the immunogenicity of the MR vaccine first dose administered at 6 months vs at 9 months.

 3.

 To assess the proportion of mothers with undetectable, detectable and protective levels of measles and rubella antibodies 4.

 To determine the extent of variation in measles antibodies in women of child bearing age in a population with a long standing measles vaccination program 5.

 To determine the extent of variation in rubella antibodies in women of child bearing age in a population where rubella vaccine have been recently introduced 6.

 To determine if variation in antibody levels in infants at 6 months is predominately explained by variation in starting antibody levels in the mother in this population 7.

 To estimate the half-life of decay of measles and rubella antibodies in infants
