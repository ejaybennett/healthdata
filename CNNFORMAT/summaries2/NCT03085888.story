(secondQuint)The STRIVE Study: Breast Cancer Screening Cohort.

 Detection of early stage cancer may be possible through analysis of circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs) shed into the blood by tumors.

 GRAIL is using high-intensity sequencing (based on broad genomic coverage and deep sequencing) of cfNAs, combined with machine learning, to develop blood tests to detect cancer early.

 The purpose of this prospective, multi-center, observational cohort study is to train and validate an assay for the early detection of breast cancer.

 The study will collect blood samples from participants within 28 days of their screening mammogram.

 Additional blood samples will also be collected for a subset of participants.

 For participants who receive a cancer diagnosis during the study, tissue samples will be collected.

GRAIL is using high-intensity sequencing of circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs) to develop blood tests to detect cancer early.

 The purpose of this study is to train and validate an assay to detect invasive breast cancer in patients undergoing mammography.
