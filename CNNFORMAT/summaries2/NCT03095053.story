(fifthQuint)CCS Versus Blastocyst Morphology Selection.

 Introduction Embryo aneuploidy is likely the leading cause of implantation failure in IVF cycles.

 Since the inception of IVF, non-invasive morphology based scoring has mostly been used in the selection of embryos for transfer, resulting in relative low embryo implantation rates.

 Embryo morphology assessment methods have significant limitations (i.

e.

, the assessments are subjective and the method uses fixed time-point assessments to define dynamic embryo development) and shortcomings (i.

e.

, exposes embryos to sub-optimal conditions during assessment).

 Notwithstanding the limitations and shortcomings of this method its use world-wide has continued, because it is a relatively simple and non-invasive method and its scores have been shown to be positively correlated to embryo euploidy, ongoing pregnancy, and live birth (Van Royen et al.

, 1999, Ahlstrom et al.

, 2011, Forman et al.

, 2013, Capalbo et al.

, 2014, Oron et al.

, 2014, Rhenman et al.

, 2015).

 However multiple gestations still represents one of the most significant complications in IVF, which are mainly the result of multiple-embryo embryo transfers, with multiple-embryo transfers used to overcome the relatively low embryo implantation rates in IVF.

 Our understanding of the optimal conditions required for in vitro embryo culture in IVF has advanced significantly in the past two decades.

 The implementation of improved in vitro embryo culture technologies (i.

e.

, culture media and incubators) has resulted in an increase in the number of good quality embryos and consequently in the number of blastocysts developing.

 While blastocyst transfers have seemingly improved the reproductive outcomes in IVF, the increased use of single embryo transfer (SET) and the use of improved preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) technologies have revealed embryo implantation still to be sub-optimal (Schoolcraft et al.

, 2013).

 New CCS platforms were a major breakthrough in PGS, allowing 24-chromosome screening to be performed with high accuracy from single cells (Harper and Harton, 2010).

 Along with the evidence that morphology scores were only moderately associated with euploidy and that the transfer of CCS euploid embryos resulted in higher implantation rates (Dahdouh et al.

, 2015), the continued use of morphology based scoring methods has increasingly being challenged.

 In addition to all the other advances in IVF, significant improvements have also been made in cryopreservation technologies.

 These improvements have resulted in significant improvements in frozen-thawed embryo survival (i.

e.

 minimizing of risks), post-thaw developmental competence (Cobo et al.

, 2012; Balaban et al.

, 2008), and in the reproductive outcomes of FET (Evans et al.

, 2014; Ozgur et al.

, 2015).

 The benefits of FET include; the transfer of embryos to a more physiologic endometrium (i.

e.

, early luteal phase), the capability to time transfers more accurately, and patient specific endometrial preparations can be used (Casper and Yanushpolsky, 2016, Franasiak et al.

, 2016; Groenewoud et al.

, 2013, Yarali et al.

, 2016).

 More RCT are required to confirm whether CCS in selecting blastocysts for transfer was truly superior over the conventional morphology based selection of blastocysts, in terms of reproductive outcomes.

 The present study will test the superiority of CCS selection by comparing FET reproductive outcomes of blastocyst freeze-all cycles; to avoid the complications associated with controlled ovarian stimulations (COS) when using fresh ET.

 Objectives The main objective of this RCT will be to investigate the superiority of the reproductive outcomes of CCS euploid blastocyst FET compared to morphology scored blastocyst FET.

 The choice to transfer all blastocyts in FET will eliminate any confounding related to endometrial development, while a freeze-all strategy ensures the comparison of primary blastocysts.

 The ultimate aim of this study is to investigate which one of the two blastocyst selection methods is most efficient in terms of ongoing pregnancy rates.

 Ongoing pregnancy rate will be defined as an intrauterine pregnancy with a fetal-heart beat on ultrasound at 5-8 gestational weeks that continues passed 14 weeks.

 Secondary objectives The secondary objectives of measurement of the RCT will be to investigate whether the early pregnancy loss is also superior for CCS euploid blastocysts compared to for morphology scored blastocysts.

 While blastocyst transfers have seemingly improved the reproductive outcomes of IVF, the use of improved preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) technologies have revealed embryo implantation still to be sub-optimal.

 The main objective of this randomized controlled trial will be to investigate the superiority of comprehensive chromosome screening (CCS) euploid blastocyst transfer compared to morphology scored blastocyst transfer, in FET.

 Methods This trial will be performed as a single-centre randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a segmented-IVF program, with intracyoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), blastocyst freeze-all and artificial frozen embryo transfer (art-FET).

 Normo-ovulatory infertile patients, with maternal age 35 years and at least two blastocysts with a morphology grade of 2BB cryopresreved, will be randomized by computer generated randomized allocation to one CCS or the morphology group.

 All transfers will be single embryo tranfers (SET) in art-FET, with only the first transfers following the ICSI blastocysts freeze-all included.

 Consent and Ethics Akdeniz University Medical Faculty Clinical Research Ethics Committee has approved the trial (reference number: 2015/399), with anonymized results to be released in ClinicalTrials.
