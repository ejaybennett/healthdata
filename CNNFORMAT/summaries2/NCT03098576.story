 Targeted therapy in this study can be either off label-use of a U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug or a clinical trial that includes investigational drugs.

 Matched targeted therapy outcomes will be compared to the outcomes of patients who were not matched to a treatment.

 In order to find a matched treatment, a patient's sample will undergo a test known as a "gene chip algorithm.

" This is will be done by having a sample of a patient's tumor analyzed at a Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) laboratory that specializes in molecular profiling.

 Molecular profiling is a process used to study a tumor's genetic characteristics.

 DNA will be taken from the tumor sample and will be screened for "actionable genes.

" These genes are called actionable because mutations (structural changes) in these genes have FDA-approved matched therapies or are eligible for current clinical studies.

The purpose of this study is to examine the usefulness of matching patients to targeted therapy by analyzing a tumor sample taken at diagnosis and testing it against 50 cancer-associated genes.

 Targeted therapy is a highly personalized, newer approach to cancer treatment that aims to more precisely identify and attack cancer cells, in an effort to do less damage to normal cells.
