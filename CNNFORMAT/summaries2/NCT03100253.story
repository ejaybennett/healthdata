(secondQuint)Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment After First Anti-TNF INvestiGation.

 New drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with action on specific molecular target (e.

g.

 anti-TNF) have improved the prognosis of patients with an inadequate response to conventional therapy such as methotrexate (MTX).

 However, approximately 50% of patients treated with first-line anti-TNF discontinue treatment after two years due to ineffectiveness or adverse events.

 The second line treatment involves the use of another anti-TNF drug or switching to a different molecular target (anti-IL6, -CD20 or CTLA-4-Ig) in combination with MTX.
