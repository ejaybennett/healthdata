 Women in puerperium with known T2DM or GDM diagnosed at the hospital were invited to participate in the study.

 Gestational diabetes was diagnosed with a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test.

 Weight (kg) and height (m) were measured using a mechanical column scale (SECA).

 The specific dimensions of eating behavior were measured through the 18-item Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-18 (TFEQ-18).

 The Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) was offered every 2-4 weeks.

 This therapy consists of providing a food plan with the following recommendations: limiting carbohydrate intake to 35-45% of total calories calculated as 30 kcal/kg based on pregestational BMI for an ideal weight .

 We evaluated the effect of MNT on GWG using a multiple linear regression model.
