(firstQuint)Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy on Periodontal Treatment and Salivary Status of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Patients.

 Diabetes Mellitus is a risk factor for periodontal disease increasing its prevalence, extension and severity.

 Periodontal disease is considered the sixth complication of diabetes.

 There is a global epidemic of diabetes, including an increase of type 1 diabetes incidence in younger patients.

 Adjuvant treatments to scaling and root planing as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy show improved clinical outcomes.

 Thus, the aim of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate adjuvant effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in periodontal treatment and salivary status of type 1 diabetes patients.
