(thirdQuint)Caries Cognition and Identification in Adults.

 The study will consist of a randomized controlled trial of two parallel groups.

 One group will correspond to adults who will receive the diagnosis and indication of treatment according to FDI criteria (control group).

 And the other group will receive a diagnosis and treatment decision according to the detection criteria "Caries Associated with Restorations or Sealants" (CARS) - ICCMS (International Caries Classification and Management System) - experimental group).

 Patient evaluations will be performed after 12 and 24 months.

 The primary outcome will be the number of surfaces restored with the need for new interventions.

 Secondary outcomes will be: impact of oral health on quality of life and cost-effectiveness.
