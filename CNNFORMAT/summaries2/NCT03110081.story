(thirdQuint)Comparing the Efficacy of Epidural and Quadratus Lumborum Analgesia After Open Nephrectomy Surgery.

 QL blocks with a single shot and catheters infusions may be an alternative to epidural analgesia.

 However, the relative efficacy, safety, and cost of the two approaches remain unclear.

 Epidural analgesia is frequently used as a component of multimodal analgesia for thoracic and abdominal surgery.

 QL block has been introduced recently as a component of multimodal analgesia for lower thoracic and abdominal surgery.

 In general, insertion of QL catheter is easier and safer than insertion of epidural catheters.

 QL catheter management is also less complicated than epidural analgesia (fewer catheter displacements and less hemodynamic compromise) and decreases the level of complexity in postoperative care.

 Our hypothesis is that the subcostal QL approach with a continuous catheter is non-inferior to epidural analgesia for pain control and opioid consumption in patients having open partial nephrectomy procedure.

 Comparing the Efficacy of Epidural and Quadratus Lumborum Analgesia After Open Nephrectomy Surgery@highlight

This study aims to assess if Quadratus Lumborum (QL) blocks are non-inferior to epidural analgesia for pain control and opioid consumption through the third postoperative day in patients having open partial nephrectomy.

 Patients satisfying all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either epidural catheter or QL catheter.
