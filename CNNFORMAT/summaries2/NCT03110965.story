(firstQuint)Yoga in the Treatment of Adolescent Idiopathic and Degenerative Scoliosis.

 We obtained baseline Cobb angles on simple and complex curves, and collected previous, earlier studies of each adolescent idiopathic and degenerative scoliosis patient.

 We then taught them to do the side-plank pose with the convex side of lumbar and thoracolumbar scoliotic curves downward, and a slightly altered version of the the half moon pose of yoga with the convex side of thoracic and cervicothoracic curves downward.

 The half moon pose was altered in that a belt was looped around the horizontal leg's foot, and held in a vertically extended upper arm's hand, and pulled tightly in that vertical position.

 Each pose was held as long as the patient could at least once daily.

 Cobb angles were again measured in films taken 4-10 months later.
