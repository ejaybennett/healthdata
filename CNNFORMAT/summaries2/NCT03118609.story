(fifthQuint)Understanding Needs.

 The "Understanding Needs" Project highlights the needs of informal caregivers.

 An informal caregiver is defined as a person who regularly provides unpaid care to another adult.

 The survey will ask about pain intensity, pain interference, and relation of pain to the caregiving role.

 The survey will also address which activities the caregiver assists with, and activities now lacking since becoming a caregiver.

 One focus group will be completed to refine the contents of the survey prior to dissemination.

 The results will be analyzed by an occupational therapist, with a focus on how pain may connect to assistance with daily living activities provided to the care recipient.

 The needs of caregivers within the community will be compiled to inform future involvement in remediation of needs.

 Understanding Needs@highlight

The "Understanding Needs" Project is designed to gain an understanding of the needs of informal caregivers.

 Researchers have designed a survey to highlight activities of daily living involved in the caregiving role, pain related to caregiver, and potential services desired.

 The initial phase of the study will consist of a focus group of informal caregivers to discuss current needs.

 The survey will then be refined based on knowledge gained from the focus group, and feedback from expert researchers.

 The refined survey will then be disseminated to caregivers throughout the country.
