 Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of Alzheimer Disease (AD).

 Increasing evidence has indicated that cognitive trainings improve cognition functions of MCI patients in multiple cognitive domains, making it a promising therapy for MCI.

 However, the effect of long-time training has not been widely explored.

 It is also necessary to evaluate the extent of its function in reducing the conversion rate from MCI to AD.
