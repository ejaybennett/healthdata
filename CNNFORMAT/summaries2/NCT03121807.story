This survey is a single arm study to assess the effect of home parenteral nutrition on overall survival, cycles of salvage chemotherapy completed, side effects of salvage chemotherapy, quality of life, nutritional status, functional status, inflammatory status and complications of HPN in malnourished unresectable metastatic gastric cancer (mGC) patients in a single medical center.

 It is expected that about 20 subjects will be recruited during an estimated period of 48 months.
