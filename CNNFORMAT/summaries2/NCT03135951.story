(thirdQuint)Pharmacokinetics of SPI-2012 (Eflapegrastim) in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide (TC) Chemotherapy.

 This is a Phase 1, single-arm multicenter study to evaluate the PK and safety of SPI-2012 (a long acting myeloid growth factor) in breast cancer patients treated with TC chemotherapy.

 Approximately 25 patients will be enrolled.

 Each cycle will be 21 days and patients will receive 4 cycles of treatment with 2 additional cycles based on the investigator's discretion.

 On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will receive TC chemotherapy and on Day 2 of each cycle, patients will receive SPI-2012.

 Pharmacokinetics will be evaluated only in Cycles 1 and 3.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a fixed dose of SPI-2012 in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) chemotherapy, as measured by the serum concentration of SPI-2012 on specific days following drug administration.
