(thirdQuint)CAR-GPC3 T Cells in Patients With Refractory Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 A single arm, open-label pilot study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and engraftment potential of CAR-GPC3 T cells in patients with GPC3-positive hepatocellular carcinoma.

 Primary objectives: Determine the safety, tolerability and cytokinetics of the autologous T cells transduced with the anti- GPC3 lentiviral vector in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

 Secondary objectives: Make a preliminary evaluation on the efficacy of CAR-GPC3 T cells in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma by the following parameters: Objective response rate (ORR); Disease Control Rate (DCR); Time of tumor progression (TTP); Overall survival (OS).

 CAR-GPC3 T Cells in Patients With Refractory Hepatocellular Carcinoma@highlight

This study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of CAR-GPC3 T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory hepatocellular carcinoma.

 Single or multiple doses of GPC3-targeted CAR T cells will be given to subjects with unmet medical needs for which there are no effective therapies known at this time.
