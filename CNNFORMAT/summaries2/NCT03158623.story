(secondQuint)Wound Additives in Primary Total Joint Athroplasty.

 Background: Wound healing remains a concern in primary total joint arthroplasty given the risk of deep infections arising from hematomas, wound separations, and superficial infections.

 If wound additives can prevent these early complications, their universal application would be cost effective.

 This study examined whether two wound additives, Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) and CellerateRX(R) (activated collagen), would improve postoperative wound healing and reduce complications in primary total joint arthroplasty.

 Methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled study using three cohorts with 30 patients each (Group 1: PRP, Group 2: activated collagen, Group 3: control) were examined postoperatively at two and six weeks, at which time the following data were recorded: six wound measurements, total postoperative blood loss, complications of superficial infections, and reoperations.
