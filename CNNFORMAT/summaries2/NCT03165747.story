(fifthQuint)Effect of VSL#3 on Bone Mineral Density in Postmenopausal Women.

 Osteoporosis has a devastating impact on quality of life of postmenopausal women, and is a significant cause of disability and morbidity.

 Many drugs are approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, but are associated with high costs and side effects.

 Some data from animal studies suggests that supplementation with probiotics can safely treat and prevent osteoporosis.

 The probiotic VSL#3 is commercially available, is safe for human consumption, and has been widely used in human clinical trials, and has known health-promoting effects in both children and adults.

 The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of VSL#3 will be conducted in a population of ambulatory, otherwise healthy, postmenopausal women for 12 months.

 Control and VSL#3-treated postmenopausal women will be matched by age ( 3 years).

 Study visits will include all or some of the following procedures: a medical exam, urine collection, height and weight measurement, a blood draw to assess bone biomarkers, a DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan to measure bone density, and health questionnaires.

 The primary endpoint is the change in bone mineral density (BMD) at the L1-4 lumbar spine over one year of study.

 Changes in BMD at the femoral neck and total hip area will be secondary endpoints.

 All BMD data will also be used as a tool for future studies power calculation and design.

 Additional endpoints will include changes in bone turnover markers and inflammatory/osteoclastogenic cytokines.

 Measurements of indices of bone turnover and cytokine levels will provide much needed mechanistic information.

The data will allow to establish whether VSL#3 prevents bone loss and/or increases bone mass by regulating bone resorption, formation, or both.

 Effect of VSL#3 on Bone Mineral Density in Postmenopausal Women@highlight

Osteoporosis has a devastating impact on quality of life of postmenopausal women, and is a significant cause of disability and morbidity.

 Many drugs are approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, but are associated with high costs and side effects.

 Some data from animal studies suggests that supplementation with probiotics can safely treat and prevent osteoporosis.

 The probiotic VSL#3 is commercially available, is safe for human consumption, and has been widely used in human clinical trials, and has known health-promoting effects in both children and adults.

 The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of VSL#3 will be conducted for 12 months in 40 postmenopausal women to determine if VSL#3 improves bone mineral density and related bone markers.

 Study visits will include all or some of the following procedures: a medical exam, urine collection, height and weight measurement, a blood draw to assess bone biomarkers, a DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan to measure bone density, and health questionnaires.

 This is one of the first clinical trials proposed to investigate the effects of probiotics in bone in humans.

 If successful, this proposal will provide the first evidence that nutritional supplementation with the probiotic VSL#3 is a safe and effective strategy for preventing postmenopausal bone loss.
