(thirdQuint)Managing Anxiety From Cancer (MAC): Testing an Intervention for Anxiety in Older Adults With Cancer and Their Caregivers.

 This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial of a seven-session telephone-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for anxiety in older adults with cancer and their primary informal (unpaid) caregiver.

 The primary purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the intervention on patient and caregiver anxiety, depression, distress, and quality of life relative to a usual care control condition.

 Anxiety is the primary outcome; depression, distress, and quality of life are secondary outcomes.

 Patients will be 65 years of age or older and will be recruited from the myeloma, lung, lymphoma, gynecologic, breast, and genitourinary cancer clinics at a single institution.

 Study measures will be administered by telephone prior to initiating the intervention (baseline) and following intervention completion for participants in the treatment condition or 8-9 weeks after the baseline survey for participants in the usual care condition (follow-up).
