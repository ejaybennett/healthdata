(fifthQuint)Biodex Sit2Stand for Individuals With Cardiac Disease.

 Patients who are diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and enter cardiac rehabilitation present with limitations in activity and restrictions in their abilities to participate in society.

 Even after a standard course of cardiac rehabilitation, some individuals will still present with deficits.

 One area this is seen is the ability to stand up from a chair.

 A new device, the Biodex Sit2Stand Trainer, has been designed to help improve the standing movement in those with lower extremity weakness.

 The trainer provides a graded lift or push through the seat to help the participant reach a standing posture.

 This study will whether a six week training program using the trainer will lead to improvements in strength, function and quality of life for those individuals who have recently completed a cardiac rehabilitation program.

 This study is a pilot study to help determine the ideal dosage of training and identify any limitations in using the device with this population.

 Based on the results of this pilot work, a larger intervention study will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of the trainer in a cardiac rehabilitation program.
