(fifthQuint)4SCAR-IgT Against Glioblastoma Multiform.

 Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most dangerous and aggressive form of brain cancer.

 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells can mediate long-term durable remissions in recurrent or refractory CD19+ B cell malignancies, and are a promising therapy to treat GBM.

 Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III, EGFRvIII is one of the GBM tumor antigens expressed in about 30% of glioblastomas.

 EGFRviii is a mutated form of EGFR protein, a neo-antigen, and is not expressed in normal tissues.

 Tumor microenvironment has been known to inhibit immune responses.

 Many immune checkpoint inhibitors are now being tested for targeting various cancers.

 Instead of infusing antibody, we plan to infuse antibody-producing T cells (IgT) based on tumor surface antigen guided CAR-Tcells.

 EGFRvIII is an attractive target for GBM CAR-T therapy.

 Combination of EGFRviii or other GBM-specific CAR-T and IgT strategy, the CAR-IgT cells could target both the tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment.

 4SCAR-IgT Against Glioblastoma Multiform@highlight

This study is for patients that have a type of brain cancer called Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

 This study will combine two different ways to fight cancer: antibodies and CAR-T cells.

 Several immune checkpoint antibodies have been examined on various tumors with good outcomes.

 GBM is known to express increased levels of surface antigens that can be targeted by CAR-T cells.

 Thus, in this study, the 4SCAR-IgT cells targeting GBM surface antigens will be infused in dose escalation cohorts.
