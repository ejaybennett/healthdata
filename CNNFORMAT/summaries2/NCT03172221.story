(fifthQuint)Clinical Performance of the HRP2 HS-RDT for Malaria Diagnosis in Pregnant Women.

 The activities proposed will be performed in the context of health centres receiving pregnant women for antenatal care visit.

 Finger-prick blood (300 mu L) will be collected and used to test for malaria with the HS-RDT, as well as with conventional good quality RDTs, microscopy and local NAATs (LAMP and nPCR).

 Dried blood spots will also be collected for qRT-PCR testing.

 Patient information (demographics, obstetric history, malaria prevention measures, etc.

) as well as laboratory results will be recorded and entered into a dedicated database.

 Clinical Performance of the HRP2 HS-RDT for Malaria Diagnosis in Pregnant Women@highlight

This is a cross-sectional and multicentre clinical trial to study the performance of the Histidine Rich Protein 2 (HRP2) highly sensitive rapid diagnostic test (HS-RDT) for the detection of malaria during pregnancy in low transmission settings from Colombia and Indonesia.

 The new HS-RDT will be compared with conventional good quality RDTs, microscopy, and NAATs [loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), nested PCR (nPCR)], in peripheral blood samples with quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) as reference standard.
