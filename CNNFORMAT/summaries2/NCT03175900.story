(thirdQuint)Effectiveness and Neural Mechanism of Naoan Dripping Pills for Migraine.

 Naoan dripping pills, which is a Chinese patent medicine proved effectively in treating migraine on clinic, but its neural mechanism remains unknown.

 This study is expected to validate the effectiveness and explore its neural mechanism by fMRI and DTI so as to provide evidence for physicians to promote the appropriate use of Naoan dripping pills treatment for migraine patients.

 Patients will be randomly assigned to either Naoan dripping pills group or placebo group, they will receive Naoan dripping pills/Placebo treatment for 12 weeks.

 Clinical evaluation will be performed at baseline, every 4 weeks during treatment and the follow-up week(16 weeks) .

 MRI scans are performed at baseline, and 12 weeks later.

 Responder rate (defined as the percentage of subjects in a treatment group with 50 % or greater reduction in attack frequency during treatment compared with the baseline period) and fMRI and DTI imaging changes after treatment are defined as primary outcome.

 In addition, 10 healthy controls will also undergo MRI scanning at baseline to determine abnormal brain activity and structure in migraine patients.

 Effectiveness and Neural Mechanism of Naoan Dripping Pills for Migraine@highlight

This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

 Its main purpose is to investigate the effects and neural mechanism of Naoan dripping pills on migraine patients by utilizing fMRI and DTI method, as well as headache evaluation measures such as responder rate, headache duration, PRO scale, etc.
