(fifthQuint)Preventing Sexual Violence Through a Comprehensive, Peer-led Initiative.

 Sexual violence (SV) impacts adolescents at rates higher than most other age demographics.

 Although it is a critical public health issue for youth, there are few prevention initiatives that lead to reductions in SV.

 There is increasing recognition that SV prevention efforts may be most effective if youth are central to the development and implementation of such efforts.

 Problematically, there are no rigorously evaluated youth-led SV prevention efforts, and researchers also know little about the process by which youth create prevention initiatives.

 Teen UP (TU) is a youth-led initiative in Rapid City, SD that focuses on addressing a variety of public health issues, including awareness about SV.

 This "homegrown" initiative is well integrated in the community and is the ideal platform on which additional multi-level, evidence-based SV prevention strategies can be added.

 Researchers and SV prevention specialists at the University of New Hampshire, in partnership with Rape Prevention Education-funded agencies in South Dakota (SD) (i.

e.

, Network Against Family Violence and Sexual Assault [The Network] and Working Against Violence Inc.

 [WAVI]), will work together along with a number of community stakeholders (e.

g.

, educators, peers, elders) and expert consultants to enhance TU to include additional SV prevention strategies, a project titled Youth Voices in Prevention (Youth VIP).

 Although the plan for the programming enhancement will be refined based on feedback from the Research and Programming Advisory Board (RPAB) and data collected during the refinement and planning phase of the project, the current plan is to convene a youth summit where high school youth will be trained as popular opinion leaders to diffuse SV prevention messages in addition to youth joining a formal working group specific to a SV prevention strategy that also aligns with youth's career aspirations.

 A mixed method approach will be used to measure implementation processes, fidelity, and costs over time, and to assess the impact of Youth VIP on rates of sexual violence among middle and high school students and intermediate outcomes including positive bystander actions, and indicators of positive youth development.

 Collaboration with the community of students, parents, and professionals in Rapid City will be promoted by establishing a Research Programming Advisory Board (RPAB) that will meet monthly during the project.

 All students in grades 7 through 10 in the fall of 2017 will be invited to participate in two baseline and four follow-up surveys that will be given in school.

 Surveys will take place in fall and spring of each of three school years, and the cohort enrolled in fall of 2017 will be followed over time.

 Recruitment of students and parents is being done in close collaboration with the Rapid City Area School District.

 The investigators anticipate enrolling 4,000 students.

 A comparison community that is demographically similar to Rapid City but located in a neighboring state will enroll a cohort of 7th through 10th graders during the 2017-18 school year.

 These students will take three surveys, one each spring during the three years of the study.

 This school district will not receive Youth VIP.

 The investigators anticipate enrolling 1,000 students.

 Qualitative data related to implementation process and fidelity will be examined using content analysis.

 Continuous variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation); categorical variables will be described with counts and percentages.

 Change scores and percent change scores will be calculated across several baseline time points as well as across two years of program implementation.

 Multilevel modeling will be used to examine changes among Rapid City students compared to students in the comparison community.

 One data set will be change across time at the individual level and another will be aggregated school-level data with the matched control school data merged in.

 Descriptive statistics will be conducted to evaluate the distributions of variables, testing for out of range values and outliers, and determining the need for transformation of non-normal distributions.

 In addition, the investigators will evaluate the measures for their psychometric properties for the current samples using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis or structural equation modeling.

 Evaluation will include inspection of factor loadings, error variances, intercorrelations of factors, path coefficients and overall model fit.

 Additionally, the investigators will test for treatment differences in the total sample on key variables collected on each time point (e.

g.

, gender, income, race/ethnicity, etc.

).

 The investigators will calculate Horvitz-Thompson weights or propensity scores to adjust for bias in the models to compare treatment effects.

 For the primary outcome, SV rate of victimization and perpetration, the investigators will use mixed effect logistic regression models to estimate the difference of intervention and non-intervention groups (pre-intervention vs.

 post intervention in single case, multiple baseline design and treatment difference between intervention schools and matched non-intervention schools), adjusting by other background variables including social, demographics, and community-level characteristics.

 Secondary behavioral, dichotomous outcomes will be analyzed the same way SV perpetration and victimization are analyzed.

 The model can also be slightly altered to include time as a continuous variable to examine the trajectories of SV rate reduction as well as changes over time in intermediary and secondary outcomes as a function of Youth VIP exposure and engagement.

 Preventing Sexual Violence Through a Comprehensive, Peer-led Initiative@highlight

The purpose of this matched comparison, multiple baseline study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive youth-led sexual violence (SV) prevention program, Youth Voices in Prevention (Youth VIP).

 The prevention program builds on youth-adult partnerships among middle and high school students in Rapid City, South Dakota.

 Consenting students will take part in a youth summit where they will be trained as popular opinion leaders to spread SV prevention messages among middle and high school youth and parents.

 Following the summit, youth will work in small groups focused on different aspects of evidence-based prevention strategies including bystander intervention, social marketing messaging, parent education, norms change, and social emotional learning.

 Multiple research methods will be used to examine implementation process and cost.

 In addition, consenting students will take six surveys across three years including several surveys before programming begins, and several to document Youth VIP outcomes after prevention programming takes place.

 Survey data from a demographically similar community will be used to compare changes over time among youth in Rapid City, SD and youth a comparison city not implementing Youth VIP.

 All phases of the project will be implemented with collaboration from a Research Programming Advisory Board of community members and professionals from Rapid City, SD.
