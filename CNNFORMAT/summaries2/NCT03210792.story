(thirdQuint)Comparison Manufactured Rib Splint With Hand-made Rib Splint.

 Investigators performed VAS assessments to determine the level of pain in the subjects with RFs during resting and forceful respiration.

 Investigators applied either the CCO rib splint or the ER splint to the RF subjects in a randomized order.

 At 30 minutes after splint application, investigators repeated the VAS assessments during resting and forceful respiration.

 Subsequently, additional pain control was provided via intravascular drug injection.

 Comparison Manufactured Rib Splint With Hand-made Rib Splint@highlight

A pilot study for a prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare subjects using the CCO (Group-A) with those using the ER-splint (Group-B) before and after the intervention.

 The primary outcome was difference in the level of pain based on the visual analogue scale (VAS) between before and after intervention in each group during forceful and resting respiration.
