(secondQuint)Peer Outreach and Navigation Intervention to Increase PrEP Uptake Among Women at High Risk for HIV.

 Women who are involved in transactional sex (i.

e.

, sex in exchange for money, drugs, or other services) remain are at substantial risk for HIV infection.

 Due to a confluence of social and structural factors, transactional sex is relatively prevalent among women from socially and economically marginalized groups, such as women who are transgender, unstably housed/homeless and/or those who use and/or inject drugs.

 The overarching goal of this research is to decrease new HIV infections among women who engage in transactional sex.

 Daily oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an innovative method of HIV prevention that women, themselves, can control; as such, PrEP has the potential to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition among women who engage in transactional sex.

 Therefore, the investigators developed a theory-guided behavioral intervention (PrEP-UP) which utilizes street-based peer outreach and navigation to increase access to PrEP and promote PrEP uptake among women involved in transactional sex.

 Specifically, PrEP-UP involves a Peer delivering PrEP education and counseling during street-based outreach followed by offer of a PrEP care appointment along with peer navigation (e.

g.

, appointment accompaniment and reminders, etc.

) for the first several PrEP care visits.

 The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of PrEP-UP.

 To implement PrEP-UP, the investigators will collaborate with an established community-based organization (CBO) in East Harlem, NY, which uses street-based peer outreach and navigation to connect individuals to needed health and social services.

 Medical and pharmacy records will be reviewed to assess PrEP initiation.

 The investigators will conduct self-report surveys at baseline and at 12-week follow-up that will collect data about sexual and drug use risk behaviors, perceived HIV risk, and PrEP-related knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy to assess for temporal changes in these variables.

 Additionally, individual interviews will be conducted post-intervention with a subset of the women as well as the CBO staff and leadership to access acceptability of the intervention.

 Following the study, the findings will be utilized to refine the PrEP-UP intervention for testing in a pilot randomized controlled trial.

This pilot study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of a peer outreach and navigation intervention designed to increase access and promote HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake among street-based cisgender and transgender women involved in transactional sex.
