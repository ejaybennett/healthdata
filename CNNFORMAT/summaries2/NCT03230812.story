(fifthQuint)Carnitine Supplementation in Type 2 Diabetic Patients.

 Rationale: Type 2 diabetic patients are characterized by a decreased metabolic flexibility: a reduced capability to switch from fat oxidation in the basal state to carbohydrate oxidation in the insulin-stimulated state.

 This metabolic inflexibility is an early hallmark in the development of diabetes.

 Recent evidence suggests that a low carnitine availability may limit acetylcarnitine formation, thereby reducing metabolic flexibility.

 Thus, when substrate flux in the muscle is high, acetyl-CoA concentrations increase, leading to inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and thereby reducing glucose oxidation.

 The conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetylcarnitine relieves this acetyl-CoA pressure on PDH.

 In humans, carnitine supplementation is sometimes also beneficial, but not in everyone.

 Here we aim to test the hypothesis that carnitine supplementation in type 2 diabetic patients with initially low carnitine status enhances metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity to a greater extent than in subjects with an initially high carnitine status.

 Our novel non-invasive MRI-based method to determine acetylcarnitine in muscle provides the opportunity for a priori identification of patients with low acetylcarnitine status in muscle.

 Objective: The primary objectives are to investigate whether carnitine supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes with an initially low carnitine status can improve metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity.

 Furthermore, a secondary objective is to examine the molecular pathways of carnitine and acetylcarnitine, responsible for muscle insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility as well as the effects of carnitine supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes with an initially low carnitine status on intrahepatic lipid content, acetylcarnitine formation, blood plasma metabolites, body composition, physical performance and quality of life.

 Study design: The current study is an interventional parallel design.

 Subjects will not be blinded for the intervention since all subjects will receive oral carnitine supplementation.

 Study population: n=26, patient with type 2 diabetes (BMI 25-35, age 40-70 years) male and female will be included.

 13 patients with an initially low carnitine status (4.

5 mmol/kg).

 Only subjects with relatively well-controlled non-insulin depended diabetes will be included.

 Intervention (if applicable): Participants will be asked to take three chewing tablets of L-carnitine (330mg), three times a day (breakfast, lunch and dinner), for 96 days.

 Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary study endpoints are insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility, measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.

 Secondary endpoints are maximal acetylcarnitine concentrations after exercise, Intrahepatic lipid content, body composition, metabolites in the blood before (i.

e.

 glucose, free fatty acids, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin), CrAT activity, acylcarnitine profiles, lipid and lipid intermediates, functional markers of physical performance, quality of life and quality of sleep.

 Carnitine Supplementation in Type 2 Diabetic Patients@highlight

the results from animal studies and preliminary human studies show that carnitine availability and acetylcarnitine concentrations are low in insulin resistant states such as with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 However, in humans, carnitine supplementation is sometimes beneficial, but not in everyone.

 We hypothesize that this variability in response is due to differences between individuals in the amount of carnitine in the muscle i.

e.

 only subjects with a low initial carnitine status will benefit from supplementation.

 The state of the art non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy method allows us to identify patients with low vs high muscle acetylcarnitine status.

 Here we aim to - for the first time - make the translational step to humans and test the hypothesis that carnitine supplementation in type 2 diabetic patients with initially low carnitine status enhances metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity to a greater extent than in subjects with an initially high carnitine status.
