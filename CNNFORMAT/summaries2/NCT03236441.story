(thirdQuint)Biochemical Effects of Remote Ischemic Pre-Conditioning on Contrast-induced Acute Kidney Injury.

 The BRICK study is a prospective, double-blind, sham-controlled, randomized clinical trial in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina undergoing cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention who are at high risk for contrast-induced acute kidney injury.

 The study will investigate the effects of remote ischemic preconditioning before cardiac catheterization on rate of contrast induced acute kidney injury and novel biomarkers of renal injury/protection within 48hrs of cardiac catheterization.
