(firstQuint)Taiwan ACE Beads for Embolization Therapy in Symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.

 T-ACE Beads can be used for prostatic arterial embolization safely and efficiently.

 Furthermore, investigator's microspheres has advantageous characteristics in biodegradability, drug delivery capability, and cost-effectiveness.

 After the clinical trial, we anticipate introducing a new microsphere for Lower Urinary Tract Symptom/Benign prostatic hyperplasia patients, which is beneficial to the participants in precise medicine as well as in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry.
