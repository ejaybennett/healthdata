(thirdQuint)Impact of Self-monitoring of Blood Pressure and Self-titration of Medication in the Control of Hypertension (ADAMPA).

 ADAMPA study.

 Objectives: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of an intervention that includes educational components, self-monitoring of blood pressure and self-titration of antihypertensive medication in the improvement of control of hypertension compared to usual care in a poorly controlled population of hypertensive patients.

 Design: Pragmatic, controlled, randomized, non-masked clinical trial with two parallel arms.

 Disease related to the study: Hypertension.

 Main outcome measure: Difference in mean systolic blood pressure, in mmHg.

 At 12 months of follow-up between the intervention and control groups, determined at physicians' practice with a validated automatic electronic sphygmomanometer Study population: Patients assigned to the Valencia Clinic-La Malvarrosa Health Department.

 Total number of patients to be randomized: 458 (229 per arm).

 Duration of intervention: 12 months (also, a pragmatic extension with passive follow-up is planned for 24 months, collecting a reduced set of outcome variables, as secondary variables) Calendar and expected completion date: The trial will take place over 3 years (6 months of recruitment, 12 months of follow-up for the main analysis of results, 12 months of pragmatic follow-up at 24 months, and finally 6 months for reporting results).

 Estimated Completion Date: 2020.

 Impact of Self-monitoring of Blood Pressure and Self-titration of Medication in the Control of Hypertension (ADAMPA)@highlight

The ADAMPA study is a pragmatic randomized clinical trial which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention based on self-monitoring and self-titration of medication in poorly controlled hypertensive patients 40 years and older.

 The total duration of the study is 3 years, with 6 months of enrolment and 1 year of follow-up to measure the primary endpoint (Difference in mean systolic blood pressure, in mmHg, between the intervention and control groups).
