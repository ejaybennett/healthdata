(fifthQuint)Regional Analgesia After Cesarean Section.

 Written consent will be obtained before the cesarean section.

 Only subarachnoidally anaesthetised patients may participate in the study.

 Pencil-point spinal needle and bupivacaine (Marcaine Heavy Spinal 0.

5 %) will be used.

 All patients will receive PCA (patient controlled analgesia) pump with morphine (1 mg/mL, 5 minute interval, no loading dose) after transfer to PACU (post-anesthesia care unit).

 In PACU vital signs will be monitored.

 Each patient will be randomly assigned to one of three groups.

 In the first group of patients no additional regional analgesia will be performed.

 In the second and the third group, ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane or quadratus lumborum block will be done with 0.

375 % ropivacaine (0.

2 ml per kg on each side).

 Postoperative pain will be measured with VAS (visual-analogue scale) 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after the end of operation.

 Paracetamol, metamizol, ketoprofen may be given as required.

 1, 3, 6 months patients will be called to assess neuropathic pain.

 Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) will be used.

 2 of 3 groups of patients will receive ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane or quadratus lumborum block to treat postoperative pain.

 Postoperative pain will measured with visual-analogue scale (VAS).

 Total morphine consumption and time to the first demand will be noted.
