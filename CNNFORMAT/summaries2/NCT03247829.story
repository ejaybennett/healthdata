(secondQuint)Investigation to Optimize Hemodynamic Management of Left Ventricular Assist Devices Using the CardioMEMS.

 The study is an observational, single group study where all participants receive the same intervention.

 The study plans to enroll up to 100 patients at 25 US sites.

 All patients will have a HeartMate Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) and a CardioMEMS device implanted as standard of care.

 After enrollment into the study, the patient will be followed until six month follow up completion.

 The objective of this clinical investigation is to understand the role of hemodynamic monitoring in LVAD patients and: - Characterize PA pressure measurements with the CardioMEMS HF System in LVAD patients under different clinical and physiologic conditions - Characterize the effects of PA pressure on functional status, quality of life, and hospital readmissions of LVAD patients - Evaluate target ranges for PA pressure and assess the impact of medication and pump speed changes on PA pressures.
