This study investigates electrical acupoint stimulation (EAS) administered in peri-operation for improving postoperative recovery in elder patients, who accept knee arthroplasty.

 the surgery cause to change of stress response, which might be associated with postoperative recovery of patient Totally, three groups are created, 1/3 participants receive transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation, 1/3 participants receive electroacupuncture, the rest 1/3 will use sham transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation.
