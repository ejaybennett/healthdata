(secondQuint)Small Aortic Annulus - a New Solution to the Old Problem.

 Aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients with a small aortic annulus is a challenging problem.

 Implantation of a small aortic valve sometimes leads to high residual gradients, despite a normally functioning prosthesis.

 Patients with a small aortic annulus, especially those with a large body surface area, are at higher risk of prosthesis-patient mismatch, which is associated with worse clinical outcomes and decreased survival.

 The purpose of this study was to compare the hemodynamic performance among the 2 management strategies (standard AVR with stented bioprosthesis and Ozaki procedure) in the context of a small aortic annulus (<21 mm).

In this prospective single-center study included 60 patients with a severe degenerative aortic stenosis and small aortic annulus (<21 mm) who underwent standard AVR with stented bioprosthesis (group 1, n=30) and aortic valve reconstruction using autologus pericardium (Ozaki procedure) (group 2, n=30)
