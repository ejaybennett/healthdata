(fifthQuint)A Facebook Intervention for Young Sexual and Gender Minority Smokers.

 Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: (1) a Facebook-delivered intervention addressing tobacco use, tailored to SGM young adults; or (2) a 3-month Facebook intervention targeting tobacco use.

 Both interventions will include 90 days of Facebook-based messages and activities tailored to participants' readiness to quit smoking.

 Assessments will occur at baseline, 3, and 6 months follow-up.

 Assessments will include measures on smoking, thoughts about abstinence, and SGM identity experiences.

 All participants who report no past 7-day smoking will be asked to give biochemical verification of smoking status with saliva cotinine test kits that will be mailed to participants.

 A Facebook Intervention for Young Sexual and Gender Minority Smokers@highlight

The 2-year research plan will test the Put It Out Project (POP) in a pilot randomized trial (N=120) compared to TSP and two historical control conditions.

 Participants will be young adults who smoke, identify as sexual or gender minorities, and use Facebook.

 The primary outcome will be biochemically verified 7-day abstinence from smoking at 3 and 6 months.

 Secondary outcomes will be a quit attempt (y/n), stage of change, and thoughts about tobacco abstinence at 3 and 6 mos.
