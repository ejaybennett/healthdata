(firstQuint)Safety Tolerability, and PK of RYI-018 After Repeat Dosing in Subjects With Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).

 BRB-018-001 will be conducted as a multicenter, adaptive design, randomized, parallel group study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of repeat IV doses of RYI-018 in subjects with NAFLD.

 Subjects in each cohort shall be randomized to either RYI-018 or placebo as weekly injection for four weeks.

 The active doses of RYI-018 will be as follows: Cohort 1: 0.

6 mg/kg, Cohort 2: 1.

2 mg/kg, and Cohort 3: 2.

5 mg/kg.

 Primary endpoints include safety and tolerability.

 Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity.
