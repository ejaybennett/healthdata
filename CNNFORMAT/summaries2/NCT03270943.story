 Project: Stress Management and Resilience Training for Teens.

 Depressive symptoms are common in adolescents, with 20-25% of adolescents experiencing a depressive episode before they graduate high school, and implications into adulthood.

 Since depression often first appears in adolescence and unsuccessful treatment of adolescent depression increases the risk of chronic or recurrent depression in adulthood, managing depression symptoms at this critical stage of development can benefit mental health and functioning throughout the lifespan.

 Preliminary studies have indicated that a mindful self-compassion program is a promising intervention to prevent depression and improve wellbeing in at-risk teens.

T Project (Stress Management and Resilience Training for Teens) is designed to learn about mood in teens, and whether emotional well-being can be improved with an 8 week class.

 In this study, 80 adolescents ages 14-17 ,with subsyndromal depression, will be randomized to either the 8-week mindful self-compassion intervention or the 8-week healthy lifestyles control program, followed by 6 monthly continuation sessions.

 Feasibility of the research protocol and of the program elements will be assessed.

 Focus group feedback will also inform program modifications and refinement.

 Additionally, baseline, mid-intervention, and 3- and 6-months post intervention measurements of depression, resilience, and other related psychosocial measures will allow preliminary exploration of the impact of each program on outcomes.

The rate of depression increases markedly over the course of adolescence.

 Adolescents struggling with depression are often set on a maladaptive behavior trajectory which may lead to academic challenges, substance abuse, risky sexual behavior, impairment in relationship building, and suicidality.

T Project (Stress Management and Resilience Training for Teens) is designed to learn about mood in teens, and whether emotional well-being can be improved with an 8 week class.

 The study proposes to refine and test the feasibility of a mindfulness-based self-compassion training program for adolescents who are experiencing subsyndromal depression, comparing it with a "healthy lifestyles" group program as a comparison attention-control for the treatment intervention.

 Secondarily, the study will explore the impact of these programs on measures of psychopathology and well-being (i.

 depressive symptoms and resilience).
