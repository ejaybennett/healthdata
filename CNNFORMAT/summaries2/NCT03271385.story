(fifthQuint)Differentiating Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy From Hypertensive Heart Disease.

 Both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and hypertensive heart disease (HHD) present left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), but the prognosis varies.

 Nevertheless, the feasibility of distinguishing these two conditions is limited by the fact that overlapping LVH and diverse forms of HCM can often lead to diagnostic ambiguity when diagnosis is based on a single morphological index.

 Diagnosis is more difficult in a patient with a history of hypertension and with left ventricular wall thickness between 11 and 15 mm.

 It also puzzles the situation when hypertrophy without outflow-track obstruction was found in hypertensive subjects which might not be explained solely by the history of hypertension.

 The investigators have deduced an integrated formula based on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and established a differentiating flow-chart between HCM and HHD.

 In this study, the investigators aim to explore the applicability of the quantifying scheme for distinguishing HCM from HHD in the multi-center trial.

 Differentiating Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy From Hypertensive Heart Disease@highlight

Differentiating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) from hypertensive heart disease (HHD) unavoidably encounters diagnostic challenges especially in patient of suspected HCM with history of hypertension.

 Diverse and overlapping forms of HCM can often lead to ambiguity when diagnosis is based on a single genetic or morphological index.

 The investigators have deduced a integrated formula based on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and established a differentiating flow-chart between HCM and HHD, the investigators aim to identify their method in the current multi-center trial.
