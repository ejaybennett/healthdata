(thirdQuint)Randomized Controlled Trial of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Severe Obesity.

 Obesity is a main threat to public health in western countries.

 This condition increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, physical stress disorders, dispose for cancer and contributes to increased overall morbidity and mortality.

 However sustained weight loss lead to the reduction of risk factors and improvement of several obesity related co-morbidities.

 Currently there are mainly two established treatments for severe obesity: a conservative approach through lifestyle intervention and a surgical approach with bariatric surgery.

 The gut microbiota is recognized as an environmental modulator of nutritional uptake and body weight.

 This has led to the hypothesis that the gut microbiota could be a therapeutic target fighting obesity.

 Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been applied for more than 50 years, and is a established treatment for refractory recurrent infection with Clostridium Difficile (CDI).

 Recent scientific studies have also applied FMT as treatment for other diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel disease and even metabolic syndrome and the results are promising.

 The investigators are planning a randomized, double-blinded and placebo controlled prospective trial with sixty patients to investigate the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on body weight in patients with severe obesity.

 In the trial there will also be collected data that possibly could give a better understanding of mechanisms of this correlation; with insulin resistance, blood pressure, inflammation and biochemical parameters of hepatic steatosis, hunger related hormons, changes in the patients microbiota and the development in quality of life as secondary outcome measures.
