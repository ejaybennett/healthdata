 The intervention will be weekly group therapy session of SMART for 8 weeks duration.

 Once enrolled, participants will complete a Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (SCID).

 The SCID will primarily serve to confirm a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder.

 Each study intervention group (3-4 groups) will be composed of 6-8 research participants per group.

 There will be no comparison group.

 The investigators aim to assess adherence with goal of 75% completion of the 8 sessions of SMART and of the homework assignments.

 Resilience will be measured with the Connor-Davidson resilience scale.

 Secondary outcomes will include subjective and objective clinical rating scales for major depression.
