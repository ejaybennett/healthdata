(fifthQuint)The Effect of Aspirin on Patency of Metal Stent in Malignant Distal Bile Duct Obstruction.

 Endoscopic drainage is the first choice for bile drainage in patients with malignant distal biliary obstruction.

 Metal stents are mainly used for malignant biliary obstruction if the surgical treatment is not considered.

 Metal stents have proven superior in many clinical aspects over plastic stents.

 Nonetheless, the maintenance period of the metallic stent patency has been reported to be around 8 months, and it is often necessary to undergo further procedure due to dysfunction of stents.

 Recently, it has been reported that the duration of the metallic stent patency in patients with aspirin is prolonged.

 Since the previous study was a retrospective study, we prospectively conducted randomized controlled study with aspirin treated patients who received metal stents in patients over 20 years who were confirmed malignant distal biliary obstruction.

 We compared the incidence of stent dysfunction in both groups for 6 months after the procedure.

 Stent dysfunction is defined as any case which further procedure is required due to jaundice or cholangitis after stent insertion.

 The aim of this study is to determine whether administration of aspirin can help maintain the patency of metallic stents for distal malignant common bile duct obstruction.

The aim of this study is to determine whether administration of aspirin can help maintain the patency of metallic stents for distal malignant common bile duct obstruction.

 Metal stents are mainly used for malignant biliary obstruction if the surgical treatment is not considered and its maintenance period has been reported to be about 8 months.

 We prospectively conducted randomized controlled study with aspirin treated patients who received metal stents in patients over 20 years who were confirmed malignant distal biliary obstruction.

 The primary endpoint is the incidence of stent dysfunction in both groups for 6 months after the procedure.

 The secondary endpoints included duration of metalic stent patency, incidence of further procedures, and adverse events related with aspirin.
