(secondQuint)Video-based Family Therapy for Peripartum Depression in Home Visited Mothers.

 The purpose of the pilot study is to partner with two Federal Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting (HV) Program sites to implement a family-based treatment for depression, using HIPAA-compliant video-based communication technology, in adolescent mothers (pregnant and post-delivery).

 This implementation-effectiveness hybrid trial includes depressed adolescent mothers and their adult family members.

 It has three aims: 1.

 Explore the feasibility of integrating the treatment model into two Federal HV Program sites in New Hampshire.

 2.

 Test the acceptability of the treatment model among depressed adolescent mothers and their families.

 3.

 Explore preliminary impacts of the treatment on maternal depressive symptoms and parenting attitudes, family emotion regulation, and family functioning at two months post-intervention.
