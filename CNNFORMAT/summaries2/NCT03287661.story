(fifthQuint)A Trial of an Online Chronic Pain Treatment for Military, Police and Veterans.

 This study is an extension of a pilot study that was conducted investigating an online acceptance-based behavioural therapy (ABBT) for chronic pain.

 The online treatment runs for a total of 8 weeks and includes interactive content to promote the participant's engagement with the treatment material.

 The treatment has been specifically tailored for military, police and veteran populations as it uses language and audio vignettes to which military, police and veteran individuals can easily relate.

 Based on promising results from a pilot study conducted using the online ABBT program, the investigators will be conducting a randomized control trial (RCT) of the treatment by randomly allocating participants into either a treatment group, or a wait-list control group.

 By comparing differences in the changes between the group's pre-post-and follow-up means on various pain and pain-related measures, insight will be gained on the utility of the treatment and the justification of its use.

 Clients who are new to the participating clinic participate in an intake appointment with the clinic's intake nurse, and during this appointment are informed about the different research projects currently being run at the clinic.

 Participants interested in the study will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria during their intake appointment.

 For this study, all eligible participants will be asked to complete an informed consent form prior to being issued a unique password and user ID for access to the online portion of the treatment.

 A treatment fidelity plan and data safety monitoring plan have been established to ensure treatment procedures remain consistent across groups, and that data integrity is monitored over the duration of the study.

 The treatment program is an eight module (8-week) ABBT for chronic pain.

 The online treatment material is administered via the WebCAPSI Therapy program.

 This is an online password-protected program which allows participants to progress through the treatment modules at their own pace.

 Each module is designed to cover a specific component of ABBT and will facilitate understanding of the components through audio files, veteran, military and RCMP-specific vignettes, text-based material, and homework exercises/assignments.

 Each module is designed to be completed in 60 minutes or less and participants have the option to return to the program and the modules as often as they like during the course of the treatment period.

 On the completion of each module, and facilitated through the WebCAPSI Therapy program, the participants are asked to complete a homework exercise to which they answer questions previously encountered throughout the module.

 The principle therapist responds to each homework exercise within 24-hours of its online submission, with feedback and encouragement.

 A randomized controlled trial will be conducted by randomly allocating participants into either the treatment or wait-list control group.

 Given the nature of the treatment and size of our clinic, a maximum of 10 participants can progress through the treatment at a time.

 The initial randomization with allot five participants into either group.

 Once the treatment group has completed the 8-week treatment, the five wait-list control group participants will then begin the treatment with five newly randomized participants.

 This process will continue until 20 participants have completed the treatment condition, and 20 the wait-list condition.

 Only one set of data will be used from each participant, in that, whatever condition they are allotted to first will be the data we use in our analyses.

 The participants will complete a battery of measures at the outset of the randomization process (both treatment and wait-list control conditions), and again at the end of the 8-weeks.

 A 3-month follow-up assessment will also be conducted to evaluate the maintenance of treatment gains.

 Only participants who complete at least 5 out of the 8 modules will be considered to have "completed" the treatment, and therefore included in the analyses.

 A 2 x 3 mixed model ANOVA will be conducted (treatment vs.

 wait-list control; and pre-post-follow-up), to assess the magnitude of changes for main outcome variables between the treatment and wait-list control conditions .

 Treatment efficacy will be based on the significance and magnitude of the differences in the changes between the conditions, thus providing meaningful insight into the utility of the online ABBT treatment.

 A hierarchical regression model will be used to evaluate the influence of PTSD and depression symptoms on main outcome variables.

 A Trial of an Online Chronic Pain Treatment for Military, Police and Veterans@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an online acceptance-based behavioural treatment for chronic pain designed for military, police, and veteran populations.

 Participants will be randomized into either the treatment condition, or the wait-list control condition, and asked to complete a battery of measures which underscore the key facets of the fear-avoidance model of chronic pain.

 The pre, post, and follow-up measure scores will be analyzed through the means of a 2 x 3 mixed model ANOVA which will assess the magnitude of changes between the treatment and wait-list control groups.

 The results will assist in establishing the effectiveness of the novel online treatment.
