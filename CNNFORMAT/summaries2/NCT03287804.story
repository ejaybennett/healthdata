(firstQuint)APRIL CAR T Cells (AUTO2) Targeting BCMA and TACI for the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma.

 The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I/dose escalation phase and a Phase II/expansion phase.

 Patients with relapsed and relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma will be enrolled in both phases of the study.

 Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T cells, which is the starting material for the manufacture of the autologous CAR T product AUTO2.

 AUTO2 has a dual target BCMA (B cell maturation antigen) and TACI (Transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor).

 Following pre-conditioning by a chemotherapeutic regimen, the patient will receive AUTO2 intravenously as a single or split dose and will then enter a 12-month follow-up period.
