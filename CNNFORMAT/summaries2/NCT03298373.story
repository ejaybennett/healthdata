(secondQuint)28-Day Repeat-Dose, Dose Escalation Study of 11- Methyl Nortestosterone Dodecylcarbonate (11-MNTDC) in Healthy Men.

 This repeat dose, dose-ranging study will be conducted at two centers: the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and the University of Washington.

 Two doses of 11-MNTDC (200 mg and 400 mg) were selected for a dose-escalating 28-day repeat dose study.

 Twenty subjects will complete this study at each of the 11-MNTDC (15 on 11-MNTDC and 5 on placebo) yielding a total of 40 completed subjects (30 on 11-MNTDC and 10 on placebo) across both sites.

 Safety will be assessed in subjects receiving the lower dosage before additional men receive the higher dose for 28 days.

 In addition to safety and tolerability, suppression of serum T, calculated free T, E2, gonadotropins (LH & FSH), and SHBG will also be assessed as secondary pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints.

 The 24-hour detailed PK of 11-MNTDC will be assessed on Days 1 and 28.

 Trough levels of 11-MNTDC will be obtained throughout the 28-day treatment period, at 48 and 72 hours (Days 30 and 31) after the last dose and at the End of Study visit (between Days 70-76).
