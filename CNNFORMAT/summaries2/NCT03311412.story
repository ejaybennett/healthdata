(thirdQuint)Sym021 (Anti-PD-1) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies or Lymphomas.

 This study will evaluate the preliminary safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of Sym021, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) .

 The goal is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of sequential escalating doses of Sym021 when administered once every 2 weeks (Q2W) by 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion to patient cohorts with locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic solid tumor malignancies or lymphomas that are refractory to available therapy or for which no standard therapy is available.

 If an MTD is not identified, a maximum administered dose (MAD) will be determined.

 Sym021 will be given to patients in escalating dose cohorts; each patient will be given one fixed dose level.

 Sym021 (Anti-PD-1) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies or Lymphomas@highlight

This is the first study to test Sym021 in humans.

 The primary purpose of this study is to see if Sym021 is safe and tolerable for patients with locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic solid tumor malignancies or lymphomas that are refractory to available therapy or for which no standard therapy is available.
