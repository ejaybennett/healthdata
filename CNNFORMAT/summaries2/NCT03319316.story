(firstQuint)Combination of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab as Maintenance Treatment in Patients With Non Squamous and Squamous (NSCLC).

 Patients will receive four cycles of standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy.

 Upon confirmation of response or tumor stabilization, patients will be registered and allocated into two cohorts based on the tumor histology and each cohort will be randomized into two arms.

 The experimental arm will receive combination of durvalumab + tremelimumab, the other arm is according to standard of care.

 The objective of this trial is to evaluate whether a maintenance approach with the combination immunotherapy with durvalumab + tremelimumab improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to standard of care in patients with advanced NSCLC.

 Each cohort is powered separately based on PFS.
