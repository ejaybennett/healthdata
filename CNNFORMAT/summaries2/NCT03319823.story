(fifthQuint)Treating Nocturnal Hypertension and Nocturia in African American Men.

 Aims and Significance of pilot data Determine: 1.

 The feasibility of the Southern California Healthy Heart and Blood Pressure registry as an effective method to recruit African American men to participate in a new research program 2.

 If participants are willing to comply with the study procedures including wearing an activity monitor, sleep study device, and ambulatory blood pressure monitor 3.

 The within subject variation for repeated measures of nocturnal blood pressure by ambulatory blood pressure and activity monitoring 4.

 If nocturnal systolic blood pressure is higher in men with self-reported nocturia 2 than in men with 0-1 nocturia 5.

 If use of long-acting antihypertensive medication as well as nighttime dosing of medication can lower nocturnal systolic blood pressure and reduce nocturia Purpose: Obtain key pilot data to show feasibility and document the reproducibility of the proposed measurements.

This is a protocol to obtain pilot data to submit a new NIH grant on Nocturnal Hypertension and Nocturia.

 In the diversity supplement to Dr.

 Victor's current NIH grant (Cut Your Pressure Too: The Los Angeles Barbershop Blood Pressure Study) the results show that uncontrolled systolic hypertension is an independent determinant of nocturia in African American men.

 the investigators now want to pursue this correlation by designing a new NIH grant proposal to determine whether replacing short acting with long acting drugs and dosing them at bedtime rather than in the morning will: A.

 Lower systolic blood pressure during sleep B.

 Improve nocturia and result in better sleep quality
