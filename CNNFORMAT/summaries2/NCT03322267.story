(thirdQuint)Adjuvant Pembrolizumab for Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma at High Risk of Recurrence.

 It is a single-arm phase II trial.

 The target population is patients with histologically diagnosed locally advanced ESCC patients (clinically staged at least T3 and/or any N and M0 by endoscopic ultrasonography [EUS] and fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography [FDG-PET]) who have received preoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by surgery, and exhibit high risk (closed or involved resection margin or extranodal invasion of involved lymph nodes) of tumor recurrence.

 Eligible patients will receive adjuvant cisplatin-based CRT followed by pembrolizumab for 18 cycles.

The study will enroll 46 patients in Taiwan.

 The estimated enrollment period is 2 years.

 Adjuvant Pembrolizumab for Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma at High Risk of Recurrence@highlight

In this study, participants with histologically diagnosed locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who have received preoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery harbouring high risk of tumor recurrence will receive adjuvant cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy followed by pembrolizumab.

 The primary study hypothesis is that adjuvant pembrolizumab will improve the 1-year recurrence-free survival rate compared to historical control.
