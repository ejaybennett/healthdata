(thirdQuint)Meditation and Exercise to Treat Back Pain.

 Exercise and mindfulness based mediation can both produce analgesic effects in patients with chronic pain, but the mechanisms are not clear.

 Combining treatments could produce analgesic effects that are additive, synergistic, or counteractive to each other.

 Here the investigators examine the effects of a 4-week intervention in patients with chronic low back pain.

 Patients are assigned to a meditation/exercise group or a control group.

 The investigators will measure pain and disability using a variety of tools including surveys, VAS scales, and quantitative sensory testing.

 Meditation and Exercise to Treat Back Pain@highlight

This study evaluates the analgesic effect of a combination treatment of exercise and mindfulness based meditation in patients with chronic back pain.

 Half of the participants will partake in a 4-week exercise and meditation intervention, while the other half will receive a placebo treatment.

 The investigators hypothesize that a combination treatment reduces pain more than the control intervention.
