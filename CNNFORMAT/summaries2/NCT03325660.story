(fifthQuint)Whole Body Vibration and Pelvic Floor Exercises on Urinary Incontinence.

 The initial sample was adult patients suffering from urinary incontinence at least 6 months after radical prostatectomy.

 The exclusion criteria included patients with an artificial pacemaker, body mass index more than 35 kg/ m2, urinary infection, bleeding from the urinary bladder or the digestive tract, polyuria, diabetes mellitus, detrusor instability, neuromuscular disorders and any other medical condition that affects participation in the training program.

 After the approval of the Research Ethical Committee, of the Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University according to Declaration of Helsinki principles, subjects were selected from Cairo University Hospitals.

 An informed consent form was signed by each subject before starting the study.

 70 patients were randomly divided between study and control groups and were assessed pre and post intervention.

 Two patients were excluded from the study because of urinary infection and one because he had already undergone surgical intervention for his urinary incontinence.

 6 patients were excluded due to an irregular attendance, inner ear problem and intolerance to whole body vibration.

 The study group included 30 patients participated in synchronous whole-body vibrations, 3 times weekly for 4 consecutive weeks; the frequency and peak-to-peak displacement of vibration were 2 mm/20 Hz for the first week for 5 minutes, 3mm/25 Hz, 10 minutes for the second week and 4 mm/30 Hz, 15 minutes for the last two weeks.

 Every patient was made a request to remain on the stage, stacking their feet consistently, with the knee and hip joints bent at 35 and the upper limbs stretched horizontally forwards, clutching a railing.

 The hip and knee flexion range of motion was measured by a goniometer to guarantee that each subject kept up the required position.

 The previously mentioned position is very sheltered as knee flexion decreases the measure of vibration which reaches the head [32].

 The control group included 31 patients received only pelvic floor exercises.

 Pelvic floor exercises: The patients were instructed to empty their bladders before the treatment sessions in an effort to feel comfortable and relaxed during the treatment session.

 Each patient was prepared and taught a program of pelvic floor exercises to be performed in daily sessions in lying, sitting, and standing positions consisting of 10 seconds of contractions followed by 10 seconds of relaxation and repeating the exercises 15 times each session.

 The contraction and relaxation times were continuously expanded by 1 second every week as a training for the slow twitch muscle fibers.

 While, fast twitch muscle fibers can be trained through asking the patient to contract as if he controls his urine by quick contraction and relaxation of the levator ani muscles 20 times, rest for ten seconds, and then repeat again for a total of 2 to 4 sets of contractions.

 Whole Body Vibration and Pelvic Floor Exercises on Urinary Incontinence@highlight

Background: Urinary incontinence is common in men following prostate cancer surgery.

 Conservative treatment incorporates pelvic floor muscle exercises, biofeedback, electrical stimulation, lifestyle changes, or a blend of strategies.

 Little is thought about the physiologic impacts of entire body vibration practice on people body.

 The aim of the current study is to determine the effect of the whole body vibration and pelvic floor exercises on urinary incontinence following prostate cancer surgery.

 Methods: 61 patients were divided randomly into two groups.

 Group (1) included 30 patients participated in synchronous whole-body vibrations, 3 times weekly for 4 consecutive weeks; the frequency and peak-to-peak displacement of vibration were 2 mm/20 Hz for the first week for 5 minutes, 3mm/25 Hz, 10 minutes for the second week and 4 mm/30 Hz, 15 minutes for the last two weeks.

 Group (2) included 31 patients received only pelvic floor exercises.

 The intervention in both groups was for three times per week for four weeks.

 The outcome measures were urodynamic measurements for pressure at maximum flow rate and maximum flow rate.

 Also, patients were instructed to complete 2 questionnaires; incontinence visual analogue scale (I- VAS) and the international consultation of incontinence-short form.

 Results: When comparing between pre- treatment and post treatment for group 1 the results revealed that there were significant differences including all test parameters, while the results of group 2 showed non- significant differences including all test parameters except for the pressure at maximum flow rate which showed a significant difference from the baseline data (P> 0.

05.

 It was revealed that there were significant differences when comparing the results of all test parameters after the treatment protocol in favor of group 2 (P> 0.

05).

 Conclusion: It can be concluded that the whole body vibration is a simple training and has a good effect in treating the patients with urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.
