(secondQuint)Genetic Risk Assessment for Cancer Education and Empowerment (GRACE) Project.

 There is increasing evidence that activated and engaged patients who are equipped with necessary skills and information are more likely to follow through with recommended care and have better health outcomes at reduced costs.

 Identification of individuals at increased risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) is crucial for cancer survivors and their families to benefit from biomedical advances in cancer prevention, early detection, treatment and survivorship.

 The primary purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of two remote interventions aimed at promoting cancer genetic risk assessment (CGRA) for HBOC.

 The randomized controlled trial will have 3 arms: usual care (UC) vs.

 targeted generic print (TP) vs.

 tailored telephone counseling and navigation intervention (TCN).

 Genetic Risk Assessment for Cancer Education and Empowerment (GRACE) Project@highlight

GRACE is a randomized 3-arm trial to determine the comparative effectiveness of two remote cancer communication interventions: 1) a targeted generic print (TP), or 2) a tailored telephone-based counseling and navigation intervention (TCN).
