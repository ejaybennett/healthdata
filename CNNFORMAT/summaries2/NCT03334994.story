(secondQuint)Facial Gingival Level Evaluation Following Soft Tissue Augmentation Using CTG Around Immediate Dental Implants vs Immediate Dental Implants Alone in the Esthetic Zone.

.

 P- Adult patients with single or multiple non-restorable teeth in esthetic zone.

 I- Immediate implant + Connective tissue graft.

 C- Immediate implant alone.

 O- Primary Outcome: Facial gingival level Secondary Outcome: Patient satisfaction, Pocket depth and Clinical attachment loss.

 P.

M will select patients from the outpatient clinic of the Oral Medicine and Periodontology Department - Cairo University.

 Screening of patients will continue until the target population is achieved.

 Identifying and recruiting potential subjects is achieved through patient database.

 Facial Gingival Level Evaluation Following Soft Tissue Augmentation Using CTG Around Immediate Dental Implants vs Immediate Dental Implants Alone in the Esthetic Zone.

@highlight

Aim of current study to evaluate connective tissue graft combined with immediate implant placement as an innovative option for less facial gingival tissue recession, less pocket depth and less clinical attachment loss versus immediate implant alone.
