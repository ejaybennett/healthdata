(fifthQuint)Anti-PD 1 Brain Collaboration + Radiotherapy: The ABC-X Study.

 1.

 BACKGROUND The ABC study (NCT02374242) is a phase II clinical trial recruiting 3 cohorts of patients with melanoma brain metastases.

 Two cohorts were patients who were asymptomatic from the brain metastases and local treatment naive.

 A 3rd cohort included patients with a poorer prognosis who may have had one or more of: failed prior local therapy for brain metastases where disease has progressed per RECIST; have neurological symptoms related to brain metastases and / or have leptomeningeal disease concurrently with brain metastases.

 Patients received immunotherapy with either nivolumab alone or nivolumab combined with ipilimumab.

 Recruitment of 76 patients is complete and the preliminary results have been presented in 2017.

 Nivolumab together with ipilimumab is a proven treatment combination and in the ABC study, shown to be more effective than nivolumab alone in melanoma brain metastases.

 The combination will therefore be used in this trial.

 In addition, findings from pre-clinical and clinical research provides evidence supporting the ability of radiotherapy to induce anti-tumour immune responses and augment the efficacy of anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade in melanoma and provide mechanistic rationale for clinical trials of combined therapy in the definitive and metastatic setting.

 2.

 STUDY DESIGN This current protocol builds on the ABC study and will assess the clinical outcomes of the combined modalities of immunotherapy with radiotherapy to the brain, in patients who progress on combined ipilimumab and nivolumab in the first 6 to 18 weeks of treatment.

 In the ABC trial, early results showed that 50% of patients who were treatment naive and received ipilimumab with nivolumab, had a partial or complete response in the brain assessed by imaging at 6 to 12 weeks.

 By delaying the decision to administer salvage radiotherapy until 6 to 18 weeks, a significant proportion of patients will avoid the toxicities associated with the addition of radiotherapy.

 The main aim of this study will be to measure the effect of immunotherapy +/- radiotherapy on intracranial disease control.

 The study will recruit 155 patients with asymptomatic, untreated melanoma brain metastases and all will be treated with combination ipilimumab and nivolumab at the doses and duration approved by worldwide regulatory authorities.

 As in the ABC study, imaging of intracranial and extracranial disease will be performed at weeks 6, 12 and 18 from commencing systemic study treatment.

 3.

 CRITERIA FOR SALVAGE RADIOTHERAPY Patients who demonstrate intracranial disease progression per RECIST criteria, between week 6 and week 18, will receive either stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT): - SRS for progression in the setting of 5 or fewer intracranial lesions - WBRT for progression in the setting of 6 or more intracranial lesions The size or volume of the lesions will not be considered in the treatment choice.

 Radiotherapy will be delivered concurrently with immunotherapy, which may continue beyond week 6 imaging and continue beyond week 18 imaging if the circumstances described in Section 7 are met.

 Some patients treated with immunotherapy may develop pseudo progression of disease (by conventional response criteria).

 Differentiating between disease progression and pseudo-progression, perilesional oedema, necrosis and intralesional haemorrhage at imaging between weeks 6 and 12 may require discussion at a multidisciplinary forum.

 4.

 NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE Neurocognitive impairment is a concern in the setting of radiotherapy delivered for brain metastases.

 The addition of immunotherapy for enhanced local disease control and survival may augment the risks.

 Quality of life (QoL) assessment is therefore an important objective in clinical trials studying the effects of new interventions, where side effects and tolerability are as important as clinical benefit.

 It is important to understand what cognitive problems exist before treatment, to establish a baseline by which the effect of treatment is judged, and to determine whether different treatment regimens improve neurocognitive function due to better tumour control, slow the expected neurocognitive deterioration due to the tumour, or have more or less short- and long-term neurotoxicity.

 This aspect of patient evaluation, in addition to survival and time to tumour progression, will yield better risk-versus-benefit assessments and provide a basis for improving interventions.

 A number of tools will be used to assess neurocognitive function and quality of life related to brain disease.

 The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) is a commonly used examination for measuring gross neurocognitive function (NCF) in patients with brain metastases.

 The test can be administered by trained staff in minutes and can provide some insight into the overall neurological functioning of the patient.

 Questions are designed to screen the patient's visuo-constructional and language skills, memory, orientation in time and space, and ability to calculate and sustain attention.

 The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaires are commonly used to assess cancer-related QoL issues.

 The FACT-Brain (FACT-Br) module provides an additional set of disease-specific questions pertaining to brain neoplasms and is completed by the patient.

 The EORTC QLQ-C30, an internationally validated cancer-specific QOL-instrument, assesses various facets of functioning, symptoms common in cancer patients and global QOL.

 The Brain Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-BN20 is a 20-item supplement for the QLQ-C30 to assess neurological related quality of life and neurological symptoms and is being utilised in the main ABC study.

 Among the symptoms captured by neurocognitive tests are communication deficits and memory problems.

 In these cases, a patient-rated QoL tool may not capture the true effects of the disease or the intervention to treat it.

 The EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises six functional scales (physical functioning, cognitive functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and global quality of life) as well as nine symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, and financial difficulties).

 Both C30 and BN20 modules have been validated for assessing health-related quality of life and symptoms in patients with brain cancer.

 Anecdotally, the partner or carer of a patient reports different observations of the impact of disease and treatment, and therefore capturing these provide an additional insight of the impact of disease and treatment on neuro-cognition.

 The EORTC QLQ C30 and BN 20 can be modified for the collection of proxy-ratings in the third person, instead of the first person self-rating version.

 Proxy-ratings obtained from the 'significant other' is a useful measure, if a patients' ability to report on his QOL diminishes due to physical or cognitive deterioration.

 General health status will also be measured using the EQ-5D.

 The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of self-reported health status.

 The EQ-5D comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety) and a visual analogue rating scale (VAS).

 The utility data generated from the EQ-5D is commonly used in cost effectiveness analyses.

 This current study will utilise the above tools, together with the ECOG performance status and adverse event profile, in order to assess the costs and benefits of adding radiotherapy to immunotherapy in patients with melanoma brain metastases.

 In particular, the neurological adverse event profile will be recorded, including the incidence of radionecrosis, intracranial haemorrhage, seizure, cerebral oedema and cognitive dysfunction.

 Comparisons will be made with reported rates for patients with brain metastases receiving radiotherapy only.

 5.

 CORRELATIVE BLOOD AND TISSUE BIOMARKER STUDIES Some patients may not benefit from radiation therapy and immunotherapy combinations.

 Therefore, biomarkers predictive of response.

 or the lack of it.

 are needed.

 Extensive correlative analyses of tumoral and peripheral blood immunologic changes will be essential to a better understanding of the mechanistic interactions between these 2 treatment modalities.

 To address this, blood and tissue samples will be obtained.

 Blood will be collected at baseline, at 2 weeks of treatment and then 6 weekly to examine serum chemokines, cytokines, inflammatory markers, lymphocyte and T cell subsets and myeloid derived suppressor cells and to assess correlation with disease response or progression.

 All Cohorts will be included in this study, as will the 3 Cohorts in the main ABC study.

 In patients with sufficient archival melanoma tissue from metastatic sites, a baseline tumour PD-L1 level, immune markers and genetics of response and resistance will also be measured.

 If available, tumour tissue following progression of accessible extracranial disease and / or craniotomy will also be tested for immune and genetic markers.

 6.

 CONTINUED SYSTEMIC TREATMENT IN CASES OF PROGRESSIVE DISEASE The application of traditional RECIST criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) in patients treated with immunotherapy may lead to premature discontinuation of treatment in a patient who will eventually respond to treatment or have prolonged disease stabilization.

 Disease progression may occur in extracranial lesions whilst patients may continue to have disease stabilisation or response of their intracranial melanoma disease, and vice versa.

 The patterns of response to treatment with these immunotherapy agents differ from those with molecularly targeted agents or cytotoxic chemotherapy in several important respects: - Patients may have a transient worsening of disease, manifested either by progression of known lesions or the appearance of new lesions, before disease stabilizes or tumour regresses.

 Therefore caution should be taken in abandoning therapy early.

 In general these delayed responses are not observed in patients with rapidly progressive, symptomatic disease.

 - Responses can take appreciably longer to become apparent compared with cytotoxic therapy.

 Continued disease regression is frequently observed well after completion of the initial induction period.

 - Some patients who do not meet traditional criteria for objective response can have prolonged periods of stable disease that are clinically significant.

 An evaluation of data from ipilimumab phase II clinical trials in advanced melanoma found patients characterized as PD at week 12 (by WHO criteria), either by an increase in tumour burden and/or the appearance of new lesions, subsequently experienced an objective response or SD (relative to baseline) without the addition of non-ipilimumab anticancer therapy.

 Examination of biopsies taken from patients receiving ipilimumab demonstrated that in some small unmeasurable lesions noted at baseline, an increase in size may be interpreted as PD, when instead, this may be due to inflammation due to T cell infiltration.

 7.

 CONTINUED TREATMENT WITH NIVOLUMAB Patients who are found to have RECIST defined intracranial or extracranial progression (or both) from 12 weeks onwards, and who do not have clinical signs or symptoms of progression, may continue on nivolumab and must have a confirmatory scan within 4 to 6 weeks.

 The date of the original assessment of progression will be used to record progression, and not the date of the confirmatory imaging.

 Continued immunotherapy treatment is permitted if the treating clinician determines that the patient is still clinically benefiting from immunotherapy and the patient is willing to continue drug treatment.

 Consideration may be given to stable or good response extra- or intra- cranially with concurrent progression in the other as a scenario that may warrant further treatment.

 Anti-PD 1 Brain Collaboration + Radiotherapy: The ABC-X Study@highlight

This is a phase II, open label, non-randomised study of ipilimumab and nivolumab, with salvage radiotherapy, in adult patients with melanoma brain metastases.

 All patients will be in a single systemic treatment group at study entry and will receive 12 weeks of ipilimumab and nivolumab, followed by nivolumab monotherapy until confirmed disease progression, drug toxicity or death.

 Patients may be treated beyond progression if their treating clinician believes there is clinical benefit to do so.

 At brain MRI scans between 6 and 12 weeks after starting systemic therapy, patients who have RECIST-determined intracranial disease progression will receive salvage radiotherapy.

 Patients with fewer than 5 progressing metastases will receive stereotactic radiotherapy and patients with 6 or more progressing metastases will receive whole brain radiotherapy.

 The main aims of the study are to determine the objective response to systemic treatment and the intracranial progression free survival for patients who require salvage radiotherapy.

 Adverse events, neurocognitive function, quality of life and the study of tissue and blood biomarkers will also be examined.
