(thirdQuint)Dysfunctional Lens Index Serves as a Novel Surgery Decision Maker for Age-related Cataracts.

 Each patient received a comprehensive eye examination, including corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) preoperatively and the day after surgery, subjective refraction, slit-lamp evaluation, noncontact tonometry (TX-F; Cannon, Tokyo, Japan), and dilated fundus examination.

 According to the surgery decision made by the three surgeons based on the slit lamp biomicroscopy and CDVA, patients were divided into two groups: Surgical and Non-Surgical.

 The results of the DLI, OSI and average lens density (ALD) were masked to the surgeons.

 The DLI, OSI, average lens density, LOCS III nuclear opalescence grading, and preoperative CDVA were obtained.

 Correlations among these parameters were analyzed.

 ROC curves were used to analyze DLI values to determine a value to separate between surgical and non-surgical cataracts.

 Dysfunctional Lens Index Serves as a Novel Surgery Decision Maker for Age-related Cataracts@highlight

To study the correlations among the dysfunctional lens index (DLI), Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III) nuclear opalescence grading score, preoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), the objective scatter index (OSI) and Scheimpflug based average lens density in age-related cataracts.

 To investigate the potential of the DLI as a novel surgery decision maker via the Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
