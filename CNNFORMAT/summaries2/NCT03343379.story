(fifthQuint)Core Stability Measures as a Risk Factor for the Development of Lower Extremity Injuries in Physical Education Students.

 September 2014 - December 2014: 139 male and female participants 18+ were subjected to different test to evaluate corresponding aspects of core stability.

 The following test were performed: Star excursion balance test; Lumbopelvic proprioception test; Lumbopelvic neuromuscular control test; Lateral step down test; Hip strength test measured with a handheld dynamometer(flexion/extension/abduction/adduction/internal rotation/external rotation); Trunk strength tests measured with a handheld dynamometer (trunk flexion and trunk extension) and core muscle endurance tests (prone bridging test/Biering-Sorenson test/side bridging tests).

 January 2015 - April 2017: Prospective follow up of lower extremity injury contracted during sports activity.

 The injuries were confirmed by a medical examiner and were recorded in an online injury registry platform (Survey Monkey).

 Statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate which core stability outcome measure can be considered a risk factor for the development of lower extremity injuries.

 Core Stability Measures as a Risk Factor for the Development of Lower Extremity Injuries in Physical Education Students@highlight

Male and female physical education students were subjected to a clinical test battery comprised of valid and reliable tests to measure different aspects of core stability at the start of the study.

 After a period of 2 months testing, the injury registration procedure started with the use of an online injury registration platform and regular call back moments.

 After 2 years of injury registration, all data was gathered and will be analysed statistically to link the measured core stability aspects as risk factors for certain lower extremity injuries.
