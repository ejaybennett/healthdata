(secondQuint)Accelerated Rehabilitation After Arthroscopic Bankart Repair Surgery.

 Traditional rehabilitation regimes post arthroscopic stabilization commonly stipulate a period of immobilization of between 2 weeks and 6 weeks.

This is apparently embedded in practice and is reportedly based on tissue healing times.

 However early mobilisation would allow good clinical results in terms of clinical outcome, return to play data and recurrence rates.
