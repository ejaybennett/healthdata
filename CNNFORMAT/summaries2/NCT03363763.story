(secondQuint)Topical Sirolimus Ointment for Cutaneous Angiofibromas in Subjects With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.

 This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of topically-applied sirolimus for the treatment of cutaneous angiofibromas in pediatric subjects with TSC.

 The investigational product is sirolimus (0.

2% and 0.

4%), administered as an ointment formulation for topical administration during the double-blind treatment period.

 Subjects entering the open-label treatment period will receive sirolimus 0.

2% administered as an ointment formulation for topical administration.

 Study subjects will be enrolled at 3-5 investigational sites in the United States (US).

 Approximately 45 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 3 treatments.

 Subjects, or a parent/guardian, will apply the study medication topically to the cutaneous angiofibromas on the face once daily at night before going to bed for 12 weeks.

 Subjects who complete the doubleblind phase of the study, with an overall compliance rate >80%, as determined by the number of dose days divided by the total of days between visits, will be offered entry into an open-label period for an additional 12 weeks.

The maximum study duration for each subject will be approximately 32 weeks and includes a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a blinded treatment period of 12 weeks, optional open label period of 12 weeks, and a follow-up period of 4 weeks.

 An interim analysis will be performed when all subjects have completed the double-blind phase (Visit 5 - Week 12).

 The data will be unblinded to assess for efficacy and results reported.
