(thirdQuint)Study to Investigate the Nicotine Pharmacokinetic Profiles and Pharmacodynamic Effects of P4M3 Variants.

 The goal of the study is to evaluate the nicotine concentration profiles and derived PK parameters, subjective effects, behavioral parameters, including puffing topography parameters of P4M3 with four different variants of P4M3, in experienced e-cigarette users after a single-use experience with fixed puffing and after ad libitum use of P4M3.

 Four variants of P4M3 will be evaluated together with subjects' own e-cigarettes to evaluate the relationship between the e-liquid composition (nicotine concentrations and presence of lactic acid) and the amount of nicotine absorbed, the speed of absorption, and the puffing topography.

This is a single-center, open-label, concentration-ranging study to evaluate the nicotine PK profile and PD effects in healthy adult experienced users of closed tank/cartridge e-cigarettes using four different variants of P4M3 (nicotine concentration of 1.
