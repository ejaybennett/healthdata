(firstQuint)Smoking Cessation and Functional CT Assessment.

 The purpose of this research study is to find out if smoking cessation combined with sildenafil, an FDA approved drug for pulmonary hypertension, will decrease inflammation in the lung.

 Even if a smoker stops smoking, the harmful effects caused by previous smoking may recruit inflammatory cells to those affected areas, leading to lung injury.

 In about 30-40% of smokers, this inflammation combined with irregular blood flow in the lungs may lead to emphysema.

 The study goal is to measure and compare individual responses to smoking cessation, Sildenafil and placebo used three times per day, and imaging of your lungs using non-contrast and contrast CT scans to see if there is a possible decrease of inflammation and an increase of blood flow in your lungs.

 The study also intends to see if using Sildenafil three times per day, in addition to smoking cessation will restore blood flow to the possible injured areas of the lungs.

 Sildenafil is an FDA approved medication for pulmonary hypertension but will be used off-label to study the effects it may or may not have on the blood flow in possible injured areas of the lungs.

The investigators will study the effect of pulmonary arterial vasodilation to see if it eliminates indices of persistent lung injury in smokers that are susceptible to emphysema.
