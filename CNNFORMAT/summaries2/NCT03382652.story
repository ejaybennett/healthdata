(secondQuint)Continuum Metal Bearing System in Total Hip Arthroplasty.

 The subject of this clinical investigation is the Continuum Metal Bearing THA System in primary total hip arthroplasty.

 This system consists of a cementless modular Trabecular Metal cent (TM) Continuum Acetabular Shell, a modular Metasul Taper liner, and a modular Metasul femoral head.

 The characteristics of this THA system may allow for reduction in wear and osteolysis as compared to other approved and marketed THA systems and thus increase the expected implant life.

 In total, 3 centers will be involved.

 This number of clinical sites will permit assessment of the consistency among a multitude of investigators.

 A total number of 100 subjects will be included in the study.

 It is anticipated that each clinical site will enroll 10 to 45 eligible study subjects, who have provided written informed consent.
