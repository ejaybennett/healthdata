(fifthQuint)Impact of Non Digestible Carbohydrate on Production of Phenolic Acids From Strawberry Juice.

 Polyphenol rich plant foods have been associated with several health benefits but their bioavailability is generally low.

 The majority of plant polyphenols are poorly absorbed in the small intestine and enter the colon where the colonic microbiota metabolise them to release a range of phenolic acids, which are now thought to be the main bioactive components related to the reduction in disease risk.

 Very little is known about the impact of other constituents of the diet on the metabolism and bacterial catabolism of these polyphenols.

 The colonic microbiota are key agents in the release of the bioactive molecules from polyphenols but also ferment non-digestible carbohydrates (NDC) such as dietary fibre to short chain fatty acids.

 It is likely that there are key interactions in the colonic bacteria metabolism of fibre and phenolics.

 We hypothesize that combination of polyphenolics and non-digestible carbohydrates (NDC) will increase the urinary output of bioactive phenolic acids.

 This study will enable a better understanding of how to deliver combinations of ingredients and nutrients to achieve maximum nutritional value and health benefits.

 Impact of Non Digestible Carbohydrate on Production of Phenolic Acids From Strawberry Juice@highlight

This is an acute human bioavailability study in self-reported healthy participants aged 20-70 years old.

 We hypothesize that combination of dietary polyphenolics and non-digestible carbohydrates (NDC) will increase the production of phenolic acids by bacteria in the human colon and these will be detected in urine.

 Participants will attend for three arms in a randomised order: Strawberry juice (a high polyphenol food), Inulin (NDC) or Mixture of strawberry juice and inulin.
