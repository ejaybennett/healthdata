(fifthQuint)Oral Care in Infants With Gastroschisis.

 Breast milk is recommended for most infants by the American Academy of Pediatrics as there are multiple benefits.

 However, some infants, such as extremely premature infants, are unable to receive enteral nutrition for a variety of clinical reasons.

 In order provide these infants with some of the benefits of mother's milk, a novel adjunctive therapy called oral care has been developed.

 Oral care consists of applying mother's breast milk to the buccal mucosa.

 Oral care has been studied in the premature infant population and been shown to improve both feeding tolerance and to provide immune protection.

 Although only studied in the premature population, many institutions have adopted oral care as a standard of care for all infants as oral care poses minimal risk to the patient and has many potential benefits.

 Gastroschisis is a rare abdominal wall defect.

 Although the survival rate for infants with gastroschisis is high, there are significant morbidities related to feeding intolerance and infection.

 The investigators believe that this population of patients will also benefit from oral care.

 The mechanism by which oral care works is not completely understood.

 It is theorized that oral care stimulates the oropharyngeal-lymphoid tissue in the buccal mucosa.

 Additional mechanisms include alteration of the intestinal microbiome.

 The intestinal microbiome is the millions of microorganisms that line the intestine.

 Normally, there is a mutually beneficial relationship.

 The intestinal microbiome is altered by many factors, including gestational age, antibiotic use, type of delivery, etc.

 Alterations in the microbiome can be detrimental and cause severe diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis.

 Thus, far studies have shown that oral care alters the oral microbiome to include more healthy bacteria.

 The investigators believe that oral care with breast milk will be associated with a more diverse fecal microbiota.

 Finally, the investigators will evaluate a novel mechanism by which the investigators believe oral care is protective; via increased salivary gland secretion of certain proteins important for healing.

 In particular, saliva contains vascular endothelial growth factor, which is important for palatal wound healing and alimentary tract healing.

 Oral Care in Infants With Gastroschisis@highlight

Gastroschisis is a rare abdominal wall defect.

 Though survival rate is high, there are significant complications related to feeding intolerance and infections.

 Recently, oral care with breast milk has been studied in extremely premature infants and has been shown to improve both feeding tolerance and protect against infection.

 Though only studied in premature infants, it is likely that other populations of patients can benefit form oral care as well.

 This study is a randomized controlled trial aimed to demonstrate the benefits of oral care with all breast milk (either mother's milk or pasteurized donor breast milk) in infants with gastroschisis.

 Additionally, the investigators will evaluate how oral care with all breast milk affects the intestinal bacterial environment and how oral care with all breast milk affects the secretion of certain proteins from the salivary gland.

 Primary hypothesis: The primary objective is to compare the magnitude of increase in intestinal microbiota alpha diversity over a four week period between the two study arms using a paired analysis.

 Secondary hypothesis: - Oral care with breast milk will decrease the days to start enteral feeds after primary surgical closure inpatients with gastroschisis.

 - Oral care with breast milk will decrease the days to reach full enteral feeds of 140 cc/kg/day in patients with gastroschisis.

 - Oral care with breast milk will decrease length of stay in patients with gastroschisis.

 - Oral care with breast milk will increase secretion of certain proteins, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, from the salivary gland.
