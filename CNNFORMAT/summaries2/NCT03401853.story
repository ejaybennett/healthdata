(thirdQuint)Rituximab and Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma or Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Overall response rate (ORR) of rituximab and pembrolizumab in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL).

 II.

 Overall response rate (ORR) of rituximab and pembrolizumab in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of rituximab and pembrolizumab, and of extended pembrolizumab administered for up to 1 year.

 II.

 To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) with this combination, in relapsed/refractory FL, and relapsed/refractory DLBCL.

 III.

 To explore treatment outcomes with this combination in patients with rituximab refractory FL.

 OUTLINE: INDUCTION: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.

 Patients also receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of course 1 and on day 1 of course 2.

 Courses repeat every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 EXTENDED THERAPY: Patients with at least a partial response receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

 Courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 years (35 doses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days.

 Rituximab and Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma or Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well rituximab and pembrolizumab work in treating patients with follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B cell lymphoma that has come back or does not respond to treatment.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab and rituximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.
