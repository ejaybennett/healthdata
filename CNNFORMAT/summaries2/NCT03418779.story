(thirdQuint)Treatment Effects of Chinese Medicine (Yi-Qi-Qing-Jie Herbal Compound) Combined With Immunosuppression Therapies in Patients of IgA Nephropathy With High-risk of ESRD.

 The investigators designed to recruit 56 participants with high-risk IgA nephropathy (proteinuria greater than 1 g/d and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 20 to 60 mL/min/1.

73m2 after a run-in phase of 4 weeks of optimized supportive care) and to provide follow-up.

 Patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment groups- combination therapy group(n = 28): optimized supportive care, oral herbal compound, prednisolone plus intravenous cyclophosphamide; immunosuppressive monotherapy group(n = 28): optimized supportive care, oral herbal coompound placebo, prednisolone plus intravenous cyclophosphamide.

 All patients were followed up for 48 weeks.

This study is a prospective open-label randomized controlled clinical trial with a two-group parallel design, aiming to prove the Yi-Qi-Qing-Jie compound combined immunosuppressive agents reduces the risk of adverse events (e.

g.

, severe infection) and brings more potential renal benefit than only immunosuppressive monotherapy both under optimized supportive care for the treatment in high-risk IgAN patients.
