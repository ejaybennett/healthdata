(thirdQuint)Effect of Zinc and Selenium Supplementation on HIV+ Individuals on Antiretroviral Treatment.

.

 HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral treatment have lowest risk of AIDS events and more life expectancy.

 However, antiretroviral treatment does not fully restore the immune system in all individuals due to persistent immune activation and inflammation, increasing the risk of non-AIDS complications, such as insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, low bone mass density, oxidative stress and micronutrient deficiencies.

 Several studies showed that HIV+ patients present zinc and selenium deficiency.

 Those micronutrients are involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic complications and have a major role in maintaining immune system function.

 It remains unknown the effect of zinc and selenium supplementation on metabolic and immunological parameters associated to non-AIDS complications.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of zinc gluconate and/or selenium yeast supplementation during six months on clinical (glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, bone mineral density and body composition) and immunological (oxidative stress, CD4+ count and pro-inflammatory cytokines) parameters in a population with HIV diagnosis on antiretroviral treatment.
