(secondQuint)Effect of Preoperative MRI Virtual Reality in Patients Undergoing Knee Arthroscope Surgery.

 The primary outcome of the study is APAIS score assessed at 24 hours postoperation.

 Experimental VR group will be applied with virtual reality transformed knee MRI whereas no interverntion group will be applied with traditional knee MRI.

 MRI will be transformed to virtual reality images by Mesh rendering technique.

Knee MRI is difficult for patients to understand as the image offers a single plane image.

 Accordingly,investigators sought to transfer the MRI image to 3-dimensional virtual reality system by Mesh rendering technique.
