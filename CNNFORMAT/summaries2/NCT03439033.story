(thirdQuint)Comparison Study of PET/CT or PET/MRI Imaging to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Alone in Men With Prostate Cancer.

 This is a multi-reader methodological study comparing the diagnostic value of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT or 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/MRI over MRI alone, using histologic confirmation or serial follow-up for up to 2 years as the gold standard for determination of primary prostate cancer or prostatic cancer recurrence/metastasis.

 It is hypothesized that this will demonstrate the superiority of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET to MRI for sensitivity, and the non-inferiority of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET to MRI for specificity.

This is a paired, case-control design that is appropriate to statistically evaluate the difference in sensitivity and specificity between the two imaging modalities.

 Therefore, the estimation of population prevalence is not a study objective, and estimation of clinical utility through calculation of positive and negative predictive values is not appropriate.

 Imaging studies and follow up subject scans will be organized so that a panel of independent readers will evaluate the MRI and PET studies to assess the level of suspicion for prostate cancer.

 Comparison Study of PET/CT or PET/MRI Imaging to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Alone in Men With Prostate Cancer@highlight

This is a study primarily comparing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) alone to Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/MRI using an experimental tracer, 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC, among men with prostate cancer or prostatic cancer recurrence/metastasis.

 It is hypothesized that this comparison will demonstrate that PET using the tracer, 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC, is more sensitive than MRI alone.

 Potential subjects who cannot undergo MRI may undergo PET/CT instead.
