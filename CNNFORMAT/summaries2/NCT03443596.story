(fifthQuint)Blood Pressure Control in Acute Ischemic Stroke.

 Specific aims- 1.

 To determine the tolerability of intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering with intravenous Labetalol infusion (assessed by achieving systolic BP 140-160mmHg range within 6hours of symptom-onset and maintaining it for 72hours post-ictus) in subjects with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who are treated with intravenous thrombolysis, 2.

 To quantify the effect of intensive BP lowering on cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured by computed tomographic (CT) perfusion imaging.

 3.

 To obtain preliminary estimates of clinical impact of intensive BP lowering in acute phase and functional outcomes at 3months.

 Hypothesis- Investigators hypothesize that early and intensive BP lowering in AIS is safe in patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-TPA).

 Furthermore, such reductions in BP would not produce any significant reduction of CBF on CT perfusion or adversely affect the functional outcomes at 3 months Methodology - AIS patients presenting within 4.

5hours of symptom-onset with measurable neurological deficits (NIHSS >4points), treated with intravenous thrombolysis and having elevated BP (systolic BP 160-185mmHg) would be included.

 In this randomised open label pilot study (with blinded end-point analysis), study participants in target group would receive intravenous Labetalol infusion for 72hours (target systolic BP 140-160mmHg).

Close neurological monitoring and serial CT perfusion studies would be performed to evaluate the short-term clinical effects and changes in CBF.

 Functional outcomes would be evaluated by modified Rankin scale at 3months.

 Conclusion This pilot randomised study would provide preliminary data about the safety of intensive BP lowering in AIS and form a basis of designing a larger phase III study.

 Blood Pressure Control in Acute Ischemic Stroke@highlight

Management of acutely elevated blood pressure during the early phase of ischemic stroke remains controversial.

 In patients treated with IV-tPA, the risk of ICH is closely related to the BP levels.

 However, intensive reduction of BP carries a theoretical risk of clinical deterioration by inducing cerebral hypoperfusion.

 Assessment of cerebral perfusion before and after BP reduction is one of the most scientific method to evaluate the safety (and potential benefits) of BP management in the acute phase of stroke.

 This project will impact practices and delivery of BP management during the acute phase of ischemic stroke.

 The findings would aid in designing phase 3 clinical trials will track clinical indicators, including the impact on functional outcomes as well as quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness.
