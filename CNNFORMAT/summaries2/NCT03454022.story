(fifthQuint)Decision-Aid for Renal Therapy Pilot Trial.

 Successful end-of-life communication between patients, caregivers, and physicians is associated with superior psychosocial outcomes, less intensive treatment, greater satisfaction, and higher likelihood of death at home.

 The Decision-Aid for Renal Therapy (DART) is an interactive web-based decision-aid that can empower patients and caregivers to select the treatment choice for chronic kidney disease that best suits them.

 DART was developed using a rigorous, validated, patient-engaged process and helps clarify decision-points and tradeoffs by providing individualized information about outcomes that matter most to patients.

 DART is designed to promote shared decision-making between patients, caregivers, and physicians and align preferences with treatment received.

 Although proven effective and in current use in the general population, DART's effectiveness in an older population is unclear.

 The purpose of this project is to conduct a pilot study of DART's feasibility and effectiveness to improve end-of-life planning and shared decision-making among older end-stage renal disease patients.

Successful communication between patients, caregivers, and physicians can improve how patients feel about their treatment.

 Our recent studies of older dialysis patients find, however, that many patients do not engage in this type of communication about treatment options.

 This study aims to determine whether the Decision-Aid for Renal Therapy (DART), a web-based program, can improve shared decision-making (decisions where patients are actively engaged) among patients, caregivers, and physicians, and improve certainty and satisfaction in treatment decisions.
