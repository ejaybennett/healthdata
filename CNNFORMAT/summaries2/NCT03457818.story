(fifthQuint)Therapy of the Skeletal Disease of Type 2 Diabetes With Denosumab.

 Objective #1: To determine whether Prolia(R) treatment in T2D decreases skeletal cortical porosity over 12 months to a greater extent than placebo.

 Prolia(R) has particular appeal for T2D because in postmenopausal osteoporosis it reduces cortical porosity at the proximal femoral shaft and at the distal radius, thus potentially reversing a proposed mechanism for increased diabetic fractures.

 Columbia University's ownership of high resolution, second-generation QCT technology, HR-pQCT XCT2, with an isotropic resolution of 61 mu m makes such evaluations possible.

 HR-pQCT will be performed with the XtremeCT2 (Scanco Medical, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) at baseline, 6 months and 12-month visits.

 This high speed in vivo CT scanner uses a microfocus x-ray source (60 mu m spot size, 68 kVp, 100 W).

 The scans will be analyzed for volumetric BMD and bone microarchitecture, including cortical porosity (Ct.

Po).

 It is expected that reductions in cortical porosity with Prolia(R) treatment in T2D will be detectable.

 Objective #2: To determine whether Prolia(R) treatment in T2D decreases bone resorption over 12 months to a greater extent than placebo.

 In postmenopausal women without T2D, Prolia(R) decreases bone resorption, yet it is unknown if this effect occurs in T2D.

 Blood will be collected at baseline, and 3, 6 and 12 months to measure the collagen degradation product s-CTX (serum C-telopeptide) as a marker of bone resorption, as well as serum TRAP-5b, an enzyme derived from resorbing osteoclasts.

 It is expected that reductions in s-CTX and TRAP-5b with Prolia(R) treatment in T2D will be detectable.

 Objective #3: To determine whether Prolia(R) treatment in T2D increases areal bone mineral density (aBMD) by DXA over 12 months to a greater extent than placebo.

 In postmenopausal women without T2D, Prolia(R) increases aBMD, yet it is unknown if this effect occurs in T2D.

 aBMD by DXA will be measured at baseline, 6 and 12-month visits.

 DXA will be performed at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip and radius on a Hologic QDR4500.

 It is expected that increases in aBMD with Prolia(R) treatment in T2D will be detectable.

 Objective #4: To determine whether Prolia(R) treatment in T2D increases bone material strength over 12 months to a greater extent than placebo.

 Recent evidence suggests that fracture risk is increased in T2D because of abnormal bone material properties.

 Impact microindentation (IMI) of the cortex is a research tool that estimates bone material strength in humans.

 At baseline and at 12 months, following local anesthesia, IMI will be done with the OsteoProbe(R) to create microindents over the shaft of the tibia and provide a measure of bone material strength (bone material strength index [BMSi]).

 The BMSi measurement reflects the ability of bone to resist microcrack generation.

 It is expected that increases in BMSi with Prolia(R) treatment in T2D will be detectable.

 Objective #5: To determine whether Prolia(R) treatment in T2D reduces AGEs in collagen over 12 months to a greater extent than placebo.

 Decreases in bone material strength in T2D might be due to the accumulation of AGEs in collagen.

 Because skin AGEs are similar to bone AGEs, skin autofluorescence (SAF) can be a reflection of bone AGEs.

 At baseline, 6 and 12 months, SAF is measured with the AGE Reader (DiagnOptics Technologies BV), a device that uses the characteristic fluorescent properties of certain AGEs to estimate the AGE levels in the skin.

 It is expected that decreases in SAF with Prolia(R) treatment in T2D will be detectable.

 Therapy of the Skeletal Disease of Type 2 Diabetes With Denosumab@highlight

The goal of the study is to characterize the effect of Prolia(R) (denosumab, AMG 162; Human Monoclonal Antibody to RANK, Ligand) on indices of bone strength in type 2 diabetes (T2D).

 The investigational plan involves administration of Prolia(R) or identical placebo for 12 months as a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 66 T2D postmenopausal women assigned to Prolia(R) or placebo.

 The study will include assessment of different measures of bone quality: skeletal microarchitecture, including measurement of skeletal cortical pores; bone mineral density; bone material quality, and accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) in collagen.

 This information will help to determine whether Prolia(R) treatment in type 2 diabetes has skeletal benefits.
