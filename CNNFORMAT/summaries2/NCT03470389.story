(fifthQuint)Establishment and Assessment of the HVPG Using Biofluid Mechanics (HVPGBFM).

 The study is mainly divided into two stages: 1.

 Establishment and improvement of the HVPGBFM model: 79 patients will be enrolled to the study as an original cohort.

 Biofluid mechanics specialists will calculate patients' HVPGBFM after HVPG measurements according to patients' blood test, Doppler ultrasound and computed tomography results.

 Biofluid mechanics specialists will know patients' HVPG in this cohort.

 Weighting factors and parameters of the model will be adjusted to reduce the difference between HVPGBFM and HVPG.

 2.

 Assessment of the HVPGBFM model: at least 16 patients will be enrolled to the study as a validation cohort.

 Biofluid mechanics specialists will make no changes to the model and will calculate patients' HVPGBFM after HVPG measurements according to patients' blood test, Doppler ultrasound and computed tomography results.

 Biofluid mechanics specialists will not know patients' HVPG in this cohort.

 And the investigators will compare the HVPGBFM and HVPG to make assessment of the HVPGBFM model.

 HVPG measurements will be performed after finishing blood test, Doppler ultrasound and computed tomography; and specialists for HVPG measurements will not have access to patients' clinical data to prevent certain biases.

 Blood test, Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography and HVPG measurements will be performed within 5 days and treatments that may affect HVPG will be avoided during this possess.

 Establishment and Assessment of the HVPG Using Biofluid Mechanics (HVPGBFM)@highlight

This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center trial that will be conducted at Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Renji Hospital and Xinhua Hospital.

 In this study, the investigators aim to establish the HVPG using biofluid mechanics (HVPGBFM) model using biofluid mechanics methods and validate the HVPGBFM model.

 First, in the original cohort, the investigators will use some of the patients' clinical data to establish and improve the HVPGBFM model; then, in the validation cohort, the investigators will calculate the HVPGBFM of the other patients, compare the HVPGBFM and HVPG, and assess the model.
