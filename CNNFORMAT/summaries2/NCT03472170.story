(secondQuint)Clinical Trial for Valuation of the Effectiveness of Lactoferrine in the Prevention of Sepsis in New Premature Born.

 Bimonitorization of the Antinflammatory Mechanisms, Antioxidants and the Intestinal Microbiote.

.

 To date there are no published clinical data that jointly assess the impact of direct Lf supplementation on oxidative status, on biomarkers of systemic inflammation and on the microbiota of premature infants with or without sepsis.

 Clarification of these additional questions is essential for a better understanding of the benefits and implications of enteral administration of Lf in preterm infants.

 The enteral administration of lactoferrin reduces the incidence of late sepsis in preterm infants of very low birth weight (BMPN).

 Enteral supplementation with lactoferrin in NBWNS can have a beneficial effect on the systemic oxidative and inflammatory state, and may contribute to the creation of a healthy faecal microbiota.
