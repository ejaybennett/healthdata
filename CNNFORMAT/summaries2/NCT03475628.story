(secondQuint)Effects of Daratumumab Monotherapy on Bone Parameters in Patients With Relapsed and /or Refractory Multiple Myeloma.

 This is a prospective, multicenter, non-comparative, open-label Phase II study.

 Daratumumab will be administered according to approved label.

 Approximately 57 subjects located in Greece will be enrolled in the study.

 Patients shall receive treatment until disease progression, physician decision, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death (whichever occurs first).

 Survival status and data of subsequent anti-myeloma treatment will be collected post-treatment.

 Primary and secondary variables related to bone disease markers will be evaluated every other cycle of therapy.

 Disease evaluations will occur monthly and consist mainly of measurements of myeloma proteins.

 Other parameters may include bone marrow examinations, skeletal surveys, assessment of extramedullary plasmacytomas, and measurements of serum calcium corrected for albumin, and 2- microglobulin and albumin.

 Assessment of myeloma response and disease progression will be conducted in accordance with the modified IMWG response criteria.
