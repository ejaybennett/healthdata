(secondQuint)The Impact of Anticipatory Guidance on Early Childhood Caries: a Quasi-experimental Study.

 This quasi-experimental study was conducted at two government dental clinics in Batu Pahat District, Malaysia.

 The samples comprised of 478 mother-child-sibling trios (233 families in the intervention group, and 245 families in the control group).

 An oral health package named the Family Dental Wellness Programme (FDWP) was designed to provide anticipatory guidance to the intervention group at six-month intervals over three years.

 The control group received the standard MOH oral health education activities.

 The impact of FDWP on net caries increment, caries prevented fraction, and mother's oral health literacy was assessed after three years of intervention.
