(secondQuint)Allogeneic Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Injection in PAtieNts With FaceTogenic Back Pain.

 There are 40 subjects that will be randomized into the trial into one of 4 groups.

 In the pilot phase 5 subjects will be enrolled into Group 1, and another 5 subjects will be enrolled into Group 2.

 Subjects in group 1 will receive placebo but will be eligible for a cross over phase where they will receive a injection of the study investigational product.

 In the pilot phase, the first three (3) subjects in each treatment group will not be treated less than 10 days apart.

 Following the pilot study, thirty (30) subjects will be scheduled to undergo CT guided facet injection of the lumbar facet joints using a posterior approach after meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria and baseline evaluation.

 Eligible participants will be randomized to either Group A or Group B.

Group A will consist of 15 subjects that will receive 20 million Allogeneic hMSCs.

 Group B will receive placebo.

The study is a phase I/II trial where allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are injected intracfect into the lumbar facet joints.

 Forty (40) subjects are scheduled to undergo injection after meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluate at baseline.
