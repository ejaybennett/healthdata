(fifthQuint)Phase I/II Study of Immunotherapy Combination BN-Brachyury Vaccine, M7824, ALT-803 and Epacadostat (QuEST1).

.

 Background: - PD-1/PD-L1 signaling appears to be a major inhibitor of activated T cell anti-tumor immune responses.

 The rapid, deep and durable responses seen in various malignancies with PD-1/PD-L1 targeted agents demonstrate that blockade of this axis is key to facilitating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME).

 - Prostate cancer is poorly recognized by T cells.

 Lack of an immune response is one explanation for the lower response rates ( 21 days) in greater than or equal to 2 patients is shown.

 - If only one arm is open for additional enrollment, patients will be directly assigned to this arm.

 If 2 arms are open for additional enrollment, patients will be randomized between these 2 open arms.

 If 3 arms are open for additional enrollment, patients will be randomized among these 3 open arms.

 - If there are greater than or equal to 6 of 25 patients with a positive signal of activity in any expansion arm, that arm will be considered of interest for future studies.
