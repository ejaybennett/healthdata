(thirdQuint)Tanglewood Trail Walking Program in Rural Kentucky.

 In the summer of 2017, community members of Whitesburg, KY were recruited to join the Tanglewood Trail Walking Program to the Whitesburg farmers market.

 Each Saturday, participants reported whether or not they walked the 1 mile trail to the farmers market and they reported which fruits and vegetables they purchased.

 The Walking Program was held June - Sept 2017.

 Participants completed questionnaires about fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity.

 Participants also provided physical and biological measurements.

 Recruiting for the 2018 Walking Program will begin in May.

The Tanglewood Trail Walking Program is a well established community health initiative that encourages community members to walk approximately 1 mile to the Whitesburg Farmers Market each Saturday.

 The study aims to determine if walking to the market with a community health coach results in healthier options being selected at the market when compared to the driving group.
