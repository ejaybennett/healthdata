(fifthQuint)The Effect of Physical Activity on Decreasing Risk Level.

 The purpose of this study is to determine Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk level in 40-65 year-old individuals coming to a FHC and to evaluate the effect of increasing the physical activity and interventions about the changeable risk factors on reducing the risk level in individuals with moderate CVD risk.

 Hypothesis; the 12-week group walking activity about changing CVD risk factors reduces the risk level more in intervention group compared to the control group (H1).

 It provides blood pressure control in the intervention group.

 It reduces cholesterol.

 It helps reducing the weight, BMI, and waist circumference values.

 This study was conducted in two stages.

 Stage 1: In order to determine the high risk prevalence of CVD, it was carried out in Akdeniz FHC located in Konyaalti Central District of Antalya between April and September 2016.

 Stage 2: In order to evaluate the effect of the interventions for the changeable risk factors (HeartScore 2- cent Individuals were asked to come with empty stomach and water was distributed before the walk so that they could meet their fluid needs.

 They were advised to drink at least 2.

5-3 liters of water per day.

 In addition, in order to encourage the individuals to healthy diet, "ayran" (a drink made with yoghurt and water), milk and mineral water were regularly distributed in certain periods every day.

 Intervention: 12-Week Physical Activity Program Physical activity program was administered to all individuals in the experimental group whose risk was found as 2-<5% by evaluating their all risk factors using HeartScore(R) program.

 In this direction, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ Short Form) was first applied to the individuals in order to determine again their physical activity levels.

 Individuals determined to be inactive and minimally active according to this measure were included in the physical activity program recommended by the Ministry of Health and International Guidelines as a nonpharmacological tool in primary prevention of CVD.

 Duration of moderate intensity physical activity or aerobic exercise which can reduce total and cardiovascular mortality are 2.

5 - 5 hours a week; as the total period of the weekly physical activity prolonged, the observed benefits increased as well.

 For this reason, physical activity program was completed in such a way to complete minimum 150 minutes per week.

 It was explained that the time individuals need to walk per week should be minimum 150 minutes.

 However, some individuals increased this time up to 200-250 minutes per week according to their availability and willingness statuses.

 With the pedometer distributed to the individuals, step, distance, pace and the calories burned were recorded and these records were taken daily with the table prepared specific for the individuals.

 The aim here was to increase their motivation by showing them the developments in their physical activity levels.

 In addition, thanks to the record feature of pedometer, the extra steps taken by individuals who wanted to continue to walk could be recorded, the steps taken by the individuals who could not continue to walk due to personal reasons (being sick, hospital appointment, etc.

) and walked individually on that day were also recorded.

 In order to regularly determine the weight lost by the individuals and to increase their motivations, Mondays in each week were determined as "Scale Day" and weight and waist circumference values were measured and the obtained values were recorded.

 Application of WHO Smoking Cessation Algorithm After fagerstrom test was applied, the modified smoking cessation algorithm of World Health Organization (WHO) was applied to the individuals and those who decided to quit smoking were referred to smoking cessation outpatient clinics.

 For the individuals who decided to quit smoking, appointments were made from the smoking cessation outpatient clinic located in Cancer Early Detection, Screening and Education Center which provides free services.

 Routine Practice for Control Group As routine practice, a brochure provided from the Public Health Directorate on protection from CVD was delivered to the individuals in the control group.

 As the posttest to the individuals after applying the above-planned interventions; HeartScore(R) risk level assessment, implementation of IPAQ questionnaire, BMI, weight and waist circumference measurements were performed.

 The Effect of Physical Activity on Decreasing Risk Level@highlight

Objective: The aim of the first part of this study with two stages is to determine prevalence of CVD risk and the associated variables in individuals aged 40-65 years registered in a Family Health Center (FHC) in city center of Antalya; the aim of the second one is to evaluate the effect of intervention to increase physical activity in individuals with moderate risk of CVD on decreasing the risk level.

 Methods: Stage 1 and Stage 2 were conducted as cross-sectional and Randomized Controlled Experimental Trial, respectively.

 In the first stage the CVD risk level was calculated using the HeartScore.

 In the second stage, 11 individuals with moderate CVD risk (2-<5%) found in the intervention group participated into a 12-week physical activity program (a moderate walk outdoor, with group 5 days in a week, each lasting for 40 minutes) guided by nurse.

 CVD brochure and physical activity guide was distributed to 11 individuals in control group within the scope of routine practice of FHCs.
