(fifthQuint)Walking Rehabilitation After Spinal Cord Injury: Locomotor Training Using Adaptive Robotics.

 The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of locomotor training using adaptive robotics in adults with chronic SCI.

 Safety will be determined by monitoring of adverse responses such as skin irritation, pain, changes in spasticity and function.

 Preliminary efficacy for improving walking function will be determined by tests of walking speed and endurance prior to and following 60 daily sessions of locomotor training using adaptive robots.

 Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that locomotor training using adaptive robotics such as the Cyberdyne Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) is safe for individuals with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI).

 Safety will be demonstrated by an adverse response rate that does not exceed the frequency and severity of adverse responses reported for other well-established locomotor rehabilitation approaches.

 Safety will be assessed by monitoring of specific conditions such as skin integrity, pain, and spasticity.

 Specific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that locomotor training using adaptive robotics such as the Cyberdyne HAL (5x/week for 12 weeks, 60 sessions, 2 hours each) is efficacious for improving walking function in adults with chronic incomplete SCIs.

 Walking function will be assessed using standard clinical tests such as the 10m walk test (10MWT) to measure walking speed and the 6 min walk test (6MWT) to measure walking endurance.

 Secondary aims will determine the effects of locomotor training with the HAL adaptive robot on walking biomechanics, neural control of walking as well as respiratory function.

 To address the aims of the study, the investigators will use a pre-post repeated measures study design.

 Following phone and in-person screenings and physician approval, individuals will provide informed consent to the study procedures.

 Non-invasive tests of physical function and health will be conducted prior to and following 60 sessions of locomotor training using the HAL, an adaptive robotic device that is custom fitted to each individual to provide assistance to the lower limbs during locomotor training.

 Interim and follow-up testing sessions also will be conducted.

 Subject recruitment: Individuals with chronic SCI (>1 year) who meet the given enrollment criteria (see inclusion and exclusion criteria), and who have already been accepted into the Brooks Cybernic Treatment Program for walking rehabilitation, will be included into this study.

 Walking Rehabilitation After Spinal Cord Injury: Locomotor Training Using Adaptive Robotics@highlight

Locomotor training is an established rehabilitation approach that is beneficial for improving walking function in individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCIs).

 This approach focuses on repetitive practice and appropriate stepping movements to activate spinal neural networks and promote rhythmic motor output associated with walking.

 Assistance with stepping movements is often provided by physical therapists and trainers, but this can be costly and difficult to deliver in the cost-constrained U.

 healthcare market.

 Robotic devices have been used as an alternate method to deliver locomotor training, but current robotic approaches often lack the natural movement variations that characterize normal human stepping.

 Furthermore, studies to compare locomotor training approaches have not shown any specific benefits of using robotic devices.

 A new type of robotic device has emerged that uses an individual's muscle activation and stepping movements to control the robot during walking.

 This adaptive robotic device adjusts to the user's intentions and can assist with stepping during locomotor training in a manner that matches natural human stepping.

 While this type of adaptive robot has been preliminarily tested, the safety and efficacy of locomotor training using adaptive robotics are not well-established in patients with SCI.

 This is a critical step to determine if individuals with SCI may benefit from use of this device and for preliminary adoption of this technology.

 Recent studies have used the Cyberdyne Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) to deliver locomotor training and have reported outcomes suggesting that the HAL adaptive robot is safe and efficacious for walking rehabilitation in European SCI patients.

 Therefore this study will use the HAL adaptive robot to deliver locomotor training.

 This research is necessary to determine if use of the HAL is potentially beneficial and warranted for use with locomotor training and SCI patients receiving care in the U.

 Results of this study may contribute to the development and implementation of effective walking rehabilitation approaches for people with SCIs.
