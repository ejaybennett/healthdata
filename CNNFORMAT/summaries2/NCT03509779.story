(thirdQuint)Pronostic and Predictive Value of EMT in Localized Lung Cancer.

 One critical issue in studying oncogenesis is the comprehensive understanding of tumor genome complexity.

 Molecular subtypes may be identified through large-scale molecular screenings or gene expression analyses and molecular signatures are recognized as a relevant source of disease stratification.

 We focus on NSCLC patients with localized diseases that are included in the ONCOHEGP tissue collection project (OncoHEGP, Ministere de la Recherche n DC 2009-950).

 We had previously shown that in EGFR mutated cancer, reactivation of TWIST1 was reversibly linked to EMT and to survival.

 To go further, we planed to investigate EMT in a large cohort of patients with lung cancer to identify prognostic and predictive markers.

 We will integrate mutation, and copy number alterations to EMT gene expression analysis and miR profilling to analyse tumor phenotype.

 Tumor phenotype, miR signatures, mutation status will help classify patients according to survival.

 Clinical data will be assessed thanks to the epithor database.

 Epithor is a government-recognized clinical database, accredited by the French Health Authorities (Haute Autorite de Sante) and is supported by the National Cancer Institute (Institut National du Cancer).

 EMT characterization and scoring is done using 10 markers by qPCR, mutation and CNV screenings by targeted NGS analysis, miRs signature by MIRSeq and qPCR.

 Pronostic and Predictive Value of EMT in Localized Lung Cancer@highlight

The goal of the present research is to identify an "EMT signature", associated with long disease-free survival after surgery, which might potentially lead to specific treatment recommendations, thanks to an integrated molecular approach, including tissue analysis at DNA, RNA and miR levels Fonctional analyses using lung cancer cell lines will subsequently be used to validate markers identified in tumor screenings.
