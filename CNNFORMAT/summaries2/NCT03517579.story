(fifthQuint)Personalized Treatment in Thyroid Disorders.

 Radioiodine treatment for thyroid disorders represented an early example of individualized medicine.

 Since its introduction 80 years ago, the therapeutic I-131 dosage has usually been tailored to individual patient requirements based on the uptake of a tracer radioiodine dose.

 Various techniques have been employed to estimate the administered dose of I-131 for optimal therapeutic benefit.

 Estimated exposure has typically been extrapolated from the results of activity measurements at one or two time points, e.

g.

, at 4 and 24 hours.

 We now know that treatment of hyperthyroid Graves' disease with these methods lead to a 13-25% rate of failure to cure hyperthyroidism and a 46-80% rate of long-term hypothyroidism in cured patients.

 Similarly, such relatively crude dosimetry doubtless result in significant overtreatment in the case of remnant ablation for differentiated thyroid cancer.

 For patients with differentiated thyroid cancer requiring remnant ablation, the administered activity has, in most cases, been derived empirically, ranging between 30-100 mci.

 The high success rates in ablating remnant thyroid tissue implies that many patients are still treated with higher 131-I doses than required, with potential side effects, such as radiation sialadenitis.

 Pilot Study Rationale; Our overall objective is to provide the optimal dose to each patient.

 This study will apply a novel "wearable" radiation detection technology to determine continuous cervical measurements over days following tracer radioiodine administration will provide information that permits the tailoring of subsequent therapeutic radioiodine doses more precisely to improve clinical outcomes, as described above.

 The actual therapeutic dose decisions in this pilot trial, however, will not be based on the collar device measurements.

 Patients with Graves' disease will receive 180-200 mu Ci I-131 per gram of estimated gland mass based on the conventional method of dose calculation, based on a 24-hour % uptake and gland volume.

 Most patients with thyroid cancer would receive the 30 mCi dose for remnant ablation prior to the placement of the COTI device, as per the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines.

 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This will be an unmasked prospective pilot study involving patients with Graves' disease (Group I) and differentiated thyroid cancer (Group II).

 Five patients in each group will have radiation activity measurements using the COTI devise.

 All persons in the study will receive 131-I treatment based on the current standards of care for dose estimation.

 Study Device; The CoTI has 3 components; - A collar unit: a gamma detector wrapped around a body part-neck in this case and contains a scintillating crystal and a silicon photomultiplier.

 The photon pulse signal is then converted to digital signals (measuring the counts per second).

 Usually two detectors are placed in specified positions.

 - A cable that connects the collar unit to the Control Unit - A control unit that collects the signals and transmits it wirelessly to a hand-held computer tablet.

 Two types of collar devices will be used: the lower activity and the medium activity 1.

 Lower activity collar for patients with Graves' disease as well as diagnostic I-123 scan in thyroid cancer patients.

 These patients typically receive 0.

2-1.

2 m Ci of I-123/I-131.

 2.

 Medium activity collar for Patients with thyroid cancer after 131-I ablation, for which patients typically receive 30-100 mci of I-131.

 Study Population; - Group I: Patients with diffuse toxic goiter (Graves' disease) diagnosed clinically with no prior history of radioiodine treatment.

 - Group II: Patients with differentiated epithelial thyroid cancer who are s/p total thyroidectomy and candidates for remnant ablation based on ATA guidelines.

 Personalized Treatment in Thyroid Disorders@highlight

The Collar Therapy Indicator (CoTI) (A device that is placed in collar around the neck resembling a turtle neck sweater collar with a wire and recording box) has been shown in a single small previously published experience to provide data regarding radioiodine exposure that correlates with conventional methods of measuring I-123 and I-131 uptakes after diagnostic dose administration and/or therapy for thyroid disorders.

 We hypothesize that the device's continuous measurement capability will permit more accurate estimates of radiation exposure to thyroid tissue than conventionally employed methods assessing fractional uptake at one or a few time points.

 It may also provide information about the extent of variability in the absorbed radiation dose among patients with thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism.

 By providing more complete information about individual patient's exposures, it will facilitate more accurate estimation of the administered I-131 dose requirements for control of hyperthyroidism and thyroid remnant ablation while reducing the need for repeated visits to the clinic for dosimetry measurements.

 The aims of our project include the following: (1)To compare quantitative imaging-derived thyroid time activity curve to that obtained using the CoTI and to determine the extent to which there is variability in radiation dose predicted using conventional methods to that predicted from measurement of the full Time-Activity Curve (TAC).

(2) Evaluate the uptake and clearance kinetics across the 5 patients in each category as proof of principle for a potential larger trial to investigate use of this device in optimizing the administered doses of radioactive iodine to achieve therapeutic goals while minimizing risks of comorbidities, such a post-radioiodine hypothyroidism in patients with Graves' disease.

(3)Evaluate patient experience, convenience, and discomfort in using the CoTI device with a survey instrument.
