(firstQuint)Prospective Tissue Collection Research Protocol.

 This study intends to collect tumour tissue and blood from consenting patients for the development of manufacturing processes for potential immunotherapies.

 Suitable patients will provide consent at the first patient visit.

 Baseline assessments as per standard of care and a record of patient demographics will be taken for visit 1.

 Details will also be collected about current medical conditions and procedures and current medications.

 Patients will be tested for infectious diseases e.

g.

 HIV, Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV), Hepatitis B, C and syphilis.

 Visit 2: At this visit, tissue samples will be obtained per standard treatment.

 The patient will also donate blood.

 This procedure is outside the standard of care.

 All donated samples will be couriered to the specialist Sponsor laboratory with appropriate oversight.

 Visit 3 Following standard of care procedure, patients will receive their standard follow up care.

 For this protocol a follow up telephone call will be made to ensure patients have recovered fully.

 This then concludes the patients' participation in the study.
