(fifthQuint)ATR Kinase Inhibitor VX-970 and Carboplatin With or Without Docetaxel in Treating Participants With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the difference in response rate (either achievement of prostate specific antigen [PSA] reduction of greater than 50% or radiographic response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.

1) of the combination of M6620 (ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970) and carboplatin as compared to the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the difference in time to PSA progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)2 criteria of the combination of M6620 and carboplatin as compared to the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin.

 II.

 To describe radiographic progression-free survival and progression-free survival by PCWG3 criteria in both arms of the study.

 III.

 Assess the relationship with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) detected from baseline tumor biopsy with response to the combination of M6620 and carboplatin and the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin.

 IV.

 To describe the safety and adverse events from the combination of M6620+carboplatin as well the combination of docetaxel+carboplatin.

 EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Comparison of overall survival in the two arms of the study.

 II.

 Explore response rate, time to PSA progression, radiographic progression-free survival, and progression-free survival by PCWG3 criteria in patients who initially receive docetaxel+carboplatin after crossover to M6620+carboplatin.

 III.

 To assess the relationship with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) detected from baseline circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) with response to the combination of M6620 and carboplatin and the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin, and describe alterations seen in cfDNA (and optional tumor biopsy) at end of study.

 OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

 ARM A (docetaxel, carboplatin): Participants receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 or carboplatin alone on day 1.

 Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Participants have PSA progression or radiographic progression may crossover to Arm B.

 ARM B (carboplatin, ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970): Participants receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 IV over 60 minutes on days 2 and 9.

 Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up between 30-42 days.

 ATR Kinase Inhibitor VX-970 and Carboplatin With or Without Docetaxel in Treating Participants With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 and carboplatin with or without docetaxel works in treating participants with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body.

 ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Giving ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970, carboplatin and docetaxel may work better in treating participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
