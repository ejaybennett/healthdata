(fifthQuint)A Study to Examine the Safety, Tolerability and Biological Effects of REGN4461 in Healthy Volunteers.

 This is a 2-part study of the safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) of single and repeated doses of REGN4461 in healthy participants.

 In Part A, healthy lean or overweight subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of single ascending intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) doses.

 Interim PK and safety information from Part A will be used to select the dose level, frequency, and mode of administration (IV or SC) for repeat dosing in Part B.

 A Study to Examine the Safety, Tolerability and Biological Effects of REGN4461 in Healthy Volunteers@highlight

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of REGN4461 in healthy subjects.

 The secondary objectives of the study are to: - Characterize the Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single and repeated doses of REGN4461 - Estimate the effects of repeated doses of REGN4461 on body weight - Assess the effects of repeated doses of REGN4461 on ad lib energy intake in overweight and obese subjects - Evaluate the effects of single and repeated doses of REGN4461 on soluble forms of lipid-regulating proteins levels over time - Assess the immunogenicity of single and repeated doses of REGN4461
