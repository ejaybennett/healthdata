(thirdQuint)Prognostic Significance of Lymph Node Yield and Lymph Node Ratio Prospective Observational Study.

 Lymph node status is a important determinant of survival in patients affected by head and neck cancer.

 The last edition of the AJCC cancer staging manual introduced tumor depth and extra nodal extension (ENE) in the staging system for oral cavity, pharynx and larynx sub sites.

 It is still unclear if other factors such as Lymph node yield (LNY) and Lymph Node Ratio (LNR) may have a prognostic role and should be implemented in the staging system of squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, hypopharynx and larynx.

 Retrospective studies, meta-analyses and a meta-regression seem to indicate that LNY and LNR may have a important role in defining the prognosis.

 This study aims to validate with a appropriate methodology the results coming from the retrospective studies and the meta-analyses.

 This study should account for potential biases and should provide proper stratification of the analyzed outcomes in order to finally define the exact role and the precise cut-off values of LNY and LNR.

 A proposal of a new staging system will be provided by the results of the present study.

 Prognostic Significance of Lymph Node Yield and Lymph Node Ratio Prospective Observational Study@highlight

It is still unclear if Lymph Node Yield (LNY) and Lymph Node Ratio (LNR) may have a prognostic role in patients affected by carcinoma of the head and neck.

 Only retrospective studies are available.

 For this reason, this prospective, multi center, observational study should provide indications in this regard.

 Proper stratification by patients characteristics will allow to understand if LNY and LNR may enter in the future TNM staging system
