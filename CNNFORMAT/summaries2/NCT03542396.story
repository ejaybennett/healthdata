(thirdQuint)Evaluation of a Group Therapeutic Exercise Program.

 The current study aims to examine the effectiveness (i.

e.

, symptom reduction, increase of heart rate variability, improvement of sleep quality, increase of intrinsic motivation to engage in physical activity, increase of the level of physical activity) of a three-months manualized group exercise program, named ImPuls.

 The program contains supervised and non-supervised endurance training combined with group psychotherapeutic elements.

 The manual was designed for patients with major depression, anxiety disorders, ADHD or sleep disorders who are waiting for psychotherapy.

 It is assumed that the program will improve the symptoms of the different disorders.

 Heart rate variability, level of exercise, sleep quality, motivation and symptoms are measured by objective measures (physiological measurements, activity sensors) and subjective measures (structured interviews and questionnaires).

 In a randomized controlled trial, the ImPuls program will be evaluated (n = 20 intervention group vs.

 n = 20 control group).

 For four weeks, small group sessions of four to five people take place three times a week, combining endurance exercise (i.

e.

, running) and group psychotherapeutic elements, supervised by two therapists.

 The training is individually adapted to each patient's fitness level (60-80% of the maximal heart rate) and lasts 30 minutes.

 In the following eight weeks, participants are encouraged to engage in physical activity independently for two times a week.

 It is assumed that the program will improve the symptoms of the different disorders as well as increase the heart rate variability, level of exercise, sleep quality, and the motivation to engage in physical activity.

 Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

 Evaluation of a Group Therapeutic Exercise Program@highlight

Physical activity can reduce symptoms of mental disorders like sleep disorders, anxiety disorders, major depression and ADHD.

 However, in Germany there are no group therapeutical exercise programs for psychotherapy patients in an outpatient context.

 The current study aims to examine the effectiveness of a manualized exercise program, named ImPuls, which consists of a supervised and non-supervised endurance training and group psychotherapeutic elements.
