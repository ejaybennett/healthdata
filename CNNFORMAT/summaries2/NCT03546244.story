(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Efficacy of Musical Treadmill in PD Rehabilitation.

 Gait is altered in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.

 It has been shown that treadmill training is useful in improving the gait's parameters in patients in early-moderate stages of disease.

 Moreover, it has been shown that the music, exploiting the entrainment, is effective in order to ameliorate several gait parameters, as step lenghts and cadence.

 No data are available about the effectiveness of the association between treadmill and music.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a gait training using musical treadmill in patients in stages I-II-III Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y).

 100 patients with PD in early-moderate stage of disease will be enrolled.

 All patients will undergo an intensive treatment: 2 session of 20-minutes treadmill training per day, 5 times a week, for 4 weeks.

 Treadmill speed will be previously set at 20% less the confidence speed and progressively increased of 20%.

 All patients will be evaluat at the enrolment and at the end of the treatment.

 The outcome misures are: 6 Minute Walking Test and Timed Up and Go Test.

 Evaluation of Efficacy of Musical Treadmill in PD Rehabilitation@highlight

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of musical treadimll on gait parameters in patients with Parkinson's Disease, the investigators compare the outcome measures on two group of patients: one will undergo a 4-week daily musical treadmill training and one will undergo a 4-week daily traditional treadmill training
