(fifthQuint)We Prevent: A Dyadic Approach to HIV Prevention and Care Among Young Male Couples.

 Young (15-24 years old) gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (YMSM) continue to be the group most heavily impacted by HIV in the US, despite stable or declining rates of infection among other groups.

 HIV prevention and research efforts in the US have continued to target MSM as individuals, largely focusing on messages that encourage the uptake of prevention efforts and reducing sexual risk.

 Recently, there has been growing interest in structural interventions to reduce HIV risk, tackling social, economic and cultural factors that place MSM in contexts of risk.

 However, despite socio-ecological theory postulating the importance of individual, dyadic and social influences on HIV risk, there has been a dearth of intervention efforts focused at the dyadic level.

 We Prevent seeks to intervene on relationship communication skills as a pathway to HIV prevention during the critical period of adolescence.

 The proposed activities will develop and test a relationship skills focused HIV prevention intervention for young YMSM aged 15-19 as an addition to the current Couples HIV Testing and Counseling (CHTC).

 Phase I of the project includes collection of data from two groups of participants: 1) 40 YMSM in in-depth interviews and 10 YMSM in cognitive interviews and 2) 10 Technical Experts (TEG), for a total sample of 60 research participants.

 Phase II will consist of a one-arm pilot test of the intervention condition with 60 YMSM and their partners (total 120 participants).

 Participants will complete a Baseline, 3-month, and 6 month assessment.

 Phase III involves a pilot two-arm prospective RCT in which 160 YMSM and their partners (320 participants) will complete a Baseline assessment and then complete assessments every 3 months for 9 months.

 Recruitment of all participants is in all 50 states and will be conducted through popular social media sites (e.

g.

 Facebook).

 All interviews will be conducted through the HIPAA video-conferencing platform, VSee.

 Specific Aims: Phases I and II: To develop and refine a developmentally appropriate relationship skills session as an addition to the current CHTC intervention for 15-19 year old YMSM and their partners.

 Phase III: To conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the efficacy of the adapted intervention for YMSM versus a control condition, which is CHTC alone.

 We Prevent: A Dyadic Approach to HIV Prevention and Care Among Young Male Couples@highlight

We Prevent seeks to develop and pilot test a developmentally-appropriate relationship skills session as an addition to the current Couples HIV Testing and Counseling (CHTC) intervention for young gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (YMSM).

 This project involves three phases to develop and pilot test the intervention.

 Phase I will collect brief quantitative survey data, in-depth qualitative interview data, and cognitive interview data from YMSM and feedback from a technical expert group (TEG) to develop and refine the two-session intervention.

 Phase II involves conducting a one-arm pilot of the intervention condition to further refine the intervention content with a sample of 120 YMSM (60 dyads).

 Phase III involves conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the combined relationship skills session and CHTC to a control condition, which is CHTC alone with a sample of 320 YMSM (160 dyads).
