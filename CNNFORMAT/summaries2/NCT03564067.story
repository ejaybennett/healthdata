(thirdQuint)MARt-Depression Trial.

 Home-based tDCS-cCBT will involve 30-min tDCS (3 days per week) for the first 3 months and once weekly for the subsequent 3 months, in combination with computerized CBT delivered through an online portal for the duration of tDCS each day.

 Subjects who miss 4 consecutive treatment days or 20 percent of total treatments will be excluded from the study as it is our intention to encourage compliance with the proposed treatments to maintain optimal wellness.

 All missed treatment days will be recorded in a log for each participant.

 Aim 1.

 To investigate the effectiveness of maintenance tDCS-cCBT for patients with MDD who have responded to a successful acute course of ECT.

 Hypothesis 1.

 tDCS-cCBT will effectively maintain treatment response in MDD in a manner that is non-inferior to that of maintenance ECT.
