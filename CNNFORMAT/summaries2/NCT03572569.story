(secondQuint)Risk Stratification in Children and Adolescents With Primary Cardiomyopathy.

 RIKADA is a long-term prospective study performing in-depth phenotype and genotype characterization in children and adolescents with primary cardiomyopathy and their first-degree family members.

 Family screening contains complete cardiac work-up with medical history, physical examination, 12-lead-/Holter-electrocardiogram, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and laboratory including genetic testing.

 The aim is to facilitate early identification of at-risk individuals and contribute to patient-specific follow-up and therapy regimes preventing progressive heart failure and arrhythmia in pediatric CMP.
