(firstQuint)Vaccine Study of MVA-MUC1-IL2 in Patients With Prostate Cancer.

 The experimental product, TG4010, is a modified vaccinia virus (already used in humans) into which two (2) genes have been placed.

 One gene is for a protein (MUC1) found in cancer cells.

 The second gene is for human interleukin 2 (IL2) which the body's immune system makes to help it fight cancer.

 The TG4010 is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) once a week for six weeks followed by a schedule of every three weeks or every three weeks for the first twelve (12) weeks.

 If the therapy is working, it can be continued for up to 9 months until no further improvement or until the patient gets worse for as long as it is tolerated.
