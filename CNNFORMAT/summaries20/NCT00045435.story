(fifthQuint)Reduced Intensity Donor Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With De Novo or Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine if a one-year disease free survival of >= 35% can be achieved among patients >= 55 years old with de novo and secondary AML in first complete remission (CR1) who undergo nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical related donors.

 II.

 To determine if a day +200 nonrelapse related mortality of = 55 years old with de novo and secondary AML in CR1 who undergo nonmyeloablative HSCT from HLA identical related donors.

 OUTLINE: CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to -2 and undergo TBI on day 0.

 TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSC transplant on day 0.

 IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine (CSP) orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 56 with taper to day 77.

 Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) PO BID on days 0-27.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 28, 56, and 84; months 6, 12, 18, and 24; and then yearly for 5 years.

 Reduced Intensity Donor Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With De Novo or Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well reduced intensity donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant works in treating patients with de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in remission.

 Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation (TBI) before a donor PBSC transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells.

 It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells.

 The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect).

 Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells.

 Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening
