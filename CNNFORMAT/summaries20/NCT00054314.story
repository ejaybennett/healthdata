(secondQuint)BAY 59-8862 in Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall response rate, including partial and complete response, in patients with taxane-resistant non-small cell lung cancer treated with BAY 59-8862.

 - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine duration of response and time to progression in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive BAY 59-8862 IV over 1 hour on day 1.

 Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients with responding disease receive 2-4 additional courses beyond maximal response.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-84 patients will be accrued for this study.
