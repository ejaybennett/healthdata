(fifthQuint)Oxandrolone Compared With Megestrol in Preventing Weight Loss in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Compare the lean body mass and weight of patients with solid tumors and weight loss who are receiving chemotherapy when treated with oxandrolone vs megestrol.

 - Compare the health-related quality of life of patients treated with these drugs.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to disease stage (I-III vs IV), concurrent radiotherapy (yes vs no), and gender.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive oral oxandrolone twice daily.

 - Arm II: Patients receive oral megestrol once daily.

 In both arms, treatment continues for 12 weeks in the absence of excessive weight loss or gain or unacceptable toxicity.

 Quality of life, weight, and body composition are assessed at baseline, at 1, 2, and 3 months during study therapy, and then at 1 month after study completion.

 Patients are followed at 1 month.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62-155 patients (31-77 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

 Oxandrolone Compared With Megestrol in Preventing Weight Loss in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Oxandrolone and megestrol may help prevent weight loss and improve quality of life in patients with cancer.

 It is not yet known whether oxandrolone is more effective than megestrol in preventing weight loss and improving quality of life in patients who are receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying oxandrolone to see how well it works compared to megestrol in preventing weight loss and improving quality of life in patients who are receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors.
