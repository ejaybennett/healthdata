(fifthQuint)Quality of Life in Postmenopausal Women Who Are Receiving Either Exemestane or Anastrozole With or Without Celecoxib for Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIIA Primary Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare treatment-related symptoms using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES) questionnaire in postmenopausal women with receptor-positive stage I, II, or IIIA primary breast cancer undergoing treatment with exemestane vs anastrozole with or without celecoxib on protocol CAN-NCIC-MA27.

 Secondary - Compare health-related quality of life using the FACT-ES questionnaire in patients treated with these regimens.

 - Determine the extent to which differences in treatment-emergent symptoms affect overall quality of life in patients treated with these regimens.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, companion study.

 Patients receive treatment on CAN-NCIC-MA27.

 Health-related quality of life and treatment-related symptoms are assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES) questionnaire at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,253 patients will be accrued for this study.
