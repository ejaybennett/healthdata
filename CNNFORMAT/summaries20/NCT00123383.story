(firstQuint)Randomised Placebo-Controlled Trial of Modafinil for Cocaine Dependence.

 Modafinil is a novel wake promoting agent approved in Australia for the treatment of narcolepsy.

 Preliminary studies have suggested that modafinil may have value in the treatment of psychostimulant dependence through positive effects on mood, sleep patterns, concentration, fatigue and drug craving.

 It appears to be well tolerated with a low abuse liability.

 Thirty dependent cocaine users will be randomised to 2 equal groups.

 The experimental group will receive modafinil 200 mg/day for 10 weeks and a tailored cognitive behavioural therapy program.

 The control group will receive placebo under equivalent conditions.

 Primary outcome will be a between group comparison of cocaine negative urine samples collected over the 10 week study period.

 Adverse events, side effects, compliance, retention, self reported health, psychosocial and drug use outcomes will also be compared between the groups.
