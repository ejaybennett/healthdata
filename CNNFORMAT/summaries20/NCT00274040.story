(fifthQuint)Comparison of Tiotropium and Ipratropium in a Double-Blind, Double-dummy, Efficacy and Safety Study in Adults With COPD.

 This is a 2-treatment, randomized, double-blind, parallel design trial in adult patient with COPD.

 Each dose of tiotropium or placebo will consist of one capsule self administered from the HandiHaler device once daily during the treatment period (tiotropium or placebo).

m.

 and 10:00 a.

m.

; subsequent doses will be taken at lunch, at dinner and when going to bed.

 Study Hypothesis: The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in mean response between tiotropium and ipratropium.

 The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in mean response between tiotropium and ipratropium.

 Comparison(s): This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group trial to compare the bronchodilator efficacy and safety of Tiotropium (18 mcg once a day) and ipratropium Metered Dose Inhaler (2 puffs of 18 mcg four times a day).
