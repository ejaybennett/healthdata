(fifthQuint)Bumetanide Versus Furosemide in Heart Failure.

 Insulin resistance is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and is associated with a worse functional capacity and more severe symptoms of heart failure.

 The majority of HF patients take furosemide on at least a daily basis for symptom relief.

 Bumetanide is a loop diuretic with a similar therapeutic diuretic effect to furosemide.

 There is evidence from observational and small comparative trials that bumetanide has a significantly less deleterious effect on indirect measures of insulin resistance compared with furosemide.

 However, a formal comparison between the 2 drugs using rigorous measures of insulin resistance has never been conducted in patients with HF.

 If bumetanide can be demonstrated to have a similar diuretic and a superior (less deleterious) effect on insulin resistance in patients with HF, the potential exists for bumetanide to have a significantly reduced morbidity in patients with heart failure compared to furosemide.

 In order to prepare for such a study, the variance of the MINMOD-derived insulin resistance from the FSIGT (26), in this group of patient needs to be determined along with the feasibility of conducting such a study.

 Functional capacity will be determined by duplicate 6-minute walk tests.

 Bumetanide Versus Furosemide in Heart Failure@highlight

Patients with NYHA FC II-III heart failure will be randomized in a cross-over fashion to 8 weeks of bumetanide versus furosemide therapy (equipotent dose), to test whether bumetanide therapy has a superior effect on insulin resistance compared to furosemide.

 Patients will be subject to a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) with minimal model (MINMOD) analysis to assess insulin resistance and to a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) to assess functional capacity; patient recruitment and retention success, as well as medication adherence, will also be assessed.
