(firstQuint)Catechin Mouth-washing for Removal of Intraoral Bacteria.

 Catechins are the major components of tea flavonoids and recent in vitro experimental studies have revealed that tea catechin extracts induce bactericidal effects.

 However, a limited number of studies have been conducted on the clinical effects of tea catechin against bacterial infection and also the effects in the elderly is unclear.

 Based on these backgrounds, we designed a prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate the effects of catechin mouth washing on oral pathogenic bacterial detected in the elderly.
