(secondQuint)Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the major objective response rate (partial response and complete response) in patients with advanced bronchoalveolar cell non-small cell lung cancer treated with erlotinib hydrochloride.

 Secondary - Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the duration of response and time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the median survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well erlotinib works in treating patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
