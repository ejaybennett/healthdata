(thirdQuint)Computed Tomography in Detecting Movement of the Esophagus in Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy to the Chest.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the inter- and intra-fraction movement of the esophagus using CT scans in patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy.

 OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

 Patients undergo CT scans at baseline and then once weekly during their scheduled radiotherapy sessions to determine esophageal placement while in the treatment position.

 CT scans are performed before and after the radiotherapy session.

 Pretreatment and post-treatment scans are compared.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Comparing results of diagnostic procedures, such as computed tomography scan (CT scan), done before and after radiation therapy to help detect movement of the esophagus may help doctors plan the best treatment.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is using CT scan to help detect movement of the esophagus in patients undergoing radiation therapy to the chest.
