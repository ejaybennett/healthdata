(secondQuint)Effects of Soy Protein on Serum paraoxonase1 Activity and Lipoproteins in Postmenopausal Women.

 In a double blind clinical randomised clinical trial with parallel design this study was done.

52 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to 50 g/d soy protein or placebo for 10 weeks.

serum lipoproteins and pon1 activity were measured at baseline and 10th week.

There were significant increase in PON! activity and significant decrease in LDL-C,LDL-C/HDL-C,TC/HDL-C and TG/HDL-C in soy group compare to placebo group.

 Effects of Soy Protein on Serum paraoxonase1 Activity and Lipoproteins in Postmenopausal Women@highlight

paraoxonase 1 is involved to prevent LDL and HDL oxidation,so increase of it's activity leads to lower risk of coronary heart disease.

In postmenopausal women ,we have decrease of paraoxonase1 activity and soy proteins may increase paraoxonase1 activity
