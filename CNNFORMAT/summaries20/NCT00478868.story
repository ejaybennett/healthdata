(secondQuint)Modic Changes and Associated Features in Southern European Chronic Low Back Pain Patients.

 Ten radiologists from six hospitals across six cities in Spain, consecutively recruited 487 adult patients (263 women and 224 men) in whom lumbar MRI had been prescribed for low back pain lasting 3 months.

 Patients' characteristics and imaging findings were assessed through previously validated instruments.

 A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to assess the features associated with Modic changes.

 Outcome measures were: Gender, age, body mass index (BMI), life time smoking exposure, degree of physical activity, and image features (disk degeneration, type and extension of Modic changes, disk contour, annular tears, spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis).
