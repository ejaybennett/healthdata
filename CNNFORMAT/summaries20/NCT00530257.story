(firstQuint)Study of the Effects of Osmotic-Release Oral System (OROS) Methylphenidate (Concerta) on Attention and Memory.

 This study investigates the effect of Osmotic-Release Oral System (OROS)-methylphenidate, a long-acting stimulant, on multiple dimensions of attention and on working memory.

 Specifically, we will investigate the following two hypotheses: (1) OROS-methylphenidate will result in improved performance on measures assessing multiple domains of attention, including sustained attention, attentional control, selective attention, and divided attention, and (2) OROS-methylphenidate will result in improved performance on measures of working memory.

 In addition we will use the study to collect pilot data on whether the magnitude of the effect of OROS-methylphenidate varies across the different components of attention and working memory and whether improvement across any of these measures is helpful in predicting parent or teacher ratings of improvement.
