(fifthQuint)Increasing Use of Mental Health Services.

 The primary aim of this research study did not change from the original application; it is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of a brief, psychosocial intervention on engagement in mental health care among homebound depressed older adults.

 Engagement is defined as accepting a referral and attending a visit with a provider who could provide traditional mental health care (medication or psychotherapy).

 The intervention, now called Open Door, was developed to work collaboratively with an older adult who has depressive symptoms to address the barriers to care with the aim of helping them consider a referral and engage in mental health care.

 In prior research, this intervention has been found to improve treatment participation, reduce depressive symptoms and increase adherence to antidepressant therapy among depressed older adults in primary care and outpatient psychiatric settings.

 We propose that Open Door will improve the access to mental health care by reducing psychological barriers, providing education about care, and managing the resignation associated with the symptoms of depression among community dwelling depressed elders.

 Additionally, we believe that despite the heterogeneity of mental health care that may be received, Open Door will be associated with reduced depressive symptoms by empowering the older adult to initiate care for him/herself.

 Increasing Use of Mental Health Services@highlight

The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of Open Door (previously known as the Treatment Initiation Program [TIP]), a brief psychosocial intervention to address the psychological barriers to care and improve the use of mental health services by depressed community elderly.

 The intervention is designed to help the older adult identify the barriers, problem-solve to find solutions and mobilize the motivation to seek help.

 Open Door was developed to work collaboratively with an older adult who is depressed to improve access and adherence to mental health treatment.
