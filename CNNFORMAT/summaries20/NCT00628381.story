(thirdQuint)L-citrulline Supplementation During Sepsis.

 NO synthesis is compromised during sepsis through lack of arginine de novo synthesis and may thereby contribute to impaired microcirculation and organ dysfunction.

 Supplementation of L-citrulline in septic patients will increase NO production without increased arginase activity and these effects will be studied on arginine-NO metabolism,improved organ function, vascular permeability and microcirculation.

 L-citrulline Supplementation During Sepsis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to study the stimulating effects of prolonged (8h) enteral L-citrulline supplementation on the normalisation of the plasma citrulline concentrations and the Arginine-NO metabolism, the microcirculation, the systemic hemodynamics, vascular permeability, and organ function and disease severity scores.
