(fifthQuint)Effect of Increlex on Children With Crohn Disease.

 1.

 Subjects.

 We will recruit 20 established Crohn patients from our gastroenterology (GI) referral practice at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.

 Each will have previously undergone a complete diagnostic workup and classification of disease.

 Information on disease activity, location and behavior are routinely recorded at each follow up visit.

 Medical records will be assessed for this information.

 These patients will be followed every three months.

 All of these patients will be assigned to receive rhIGF therapy for 12 months and results will be compared to medical record data.

 We will recruit 10 per year.

 2.

 Assessment of growth and IGF-1 generation.

 Each subject will undergo IGF-1 generation testing using standard published "high-dose: protocol and interpreted according to guidelines of Blum.

 Briefly, GH will be given as a one time per day subcutaneous injection in a dose of 0.

05mg/kg/dy.

 IGF-1 will be measured at baseline and again after 7 days.

 Inadequate generation will be interpreted by an IGF-1 increase , IL-1, and IL-6 at the initiation of the study, at 6 months and 12 months.

 This will better help us understand the role of cytokines on disease course, activity, and the growth hormone axis.

 8.

 Biomarkers for rhIGF-1 dosing efficacy.

 We will draw BL, 6 mos and 12 mos levels of IGF-1, IGFBP3 and ALS levels.

 The baseline level will be collected prior to the 1st dose of Increlex.

 At six months patients will be instructed to take their Increlex the morning of their visit and the sample will be drawn within 2 hours of dosing which will represent peak biomarker levels.

 The 12 month level will be obtained in the morning the day after the patient completes his/her final dose and will represent a trough level.

 9.

 Measures of Disease Activity.

 At each protein turnover measure we will ask subjects to bring stool samples which will be evaluated for fecal calprotectin.

 We will complete the Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), a reliable and valid index for disease activity in clinical research.

 Subjects will complete the IMPACT-III, a valid and reliable measure of quality of life in pediatric Crohn disease.

 Effect of Increlex on Children With Crohn Disease@highlight

Patients with Crohn disease often have poor weight gain and short stature, yet the etiology of the poor growth is not well defined.

 Studies in chronically ill patients who do not have Crohn disease have suggested that inflammation causes IGF-1 deficiency due to inadequate IGF-1 generation.

 Previous studies of GH use in Crohn patients have demonstrated improvement in linear growth, weight and bone mineralization.

 However, GH can cause glucose intolerance in chronically ill children, particularly those who require treatment with corticosteroids.

 Recently the FDA has approved recombinant IGF-1 (rhIGF) for treatment of IGF-1 deficient short stature.

 This medication has not been studied in Crohn disease.

 The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that poor growth in Crohn disease is associated abnormal IGF-1 generation which leads to poor linear growth, decreased weight and osteoporosis and that replacement of IGF-1 with rhIGF will correct growth and improve bone density.

 To test our hypothesis we will recruit 20 patients with Crohn disease from our pediatric gastroenterology practice.

 Each will have been previously diagnosed with Crohn disease for a minimum of one year and will be studied at baseline and six month intervals for one year while on treatment with Increlex.
