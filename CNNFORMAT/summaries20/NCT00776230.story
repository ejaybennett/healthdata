(secondQuint)Immunogenicity of a Commercial Batch of JEV IC51 up to 24 Months Post Filling.

 Open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study assessing immunogenicity at various time points throughout the shelf-life of a commercial batch of IC51 (Batch IC51/07F/008) The study population consists of male and female healthy subjects, aged at least 18 years.

 The study will be performed at 3 study centers in Germany and Austria.

 Three sequential cohorts, each containing 100 subjects, will be enrolled into the study at approximately 12, 18 and 24 months after filling of the commercial batch IC51/07F/008 of IC51.
