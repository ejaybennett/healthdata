(secondQuint)One-Lung Ventilation in the Morbidly Obese Patient: Comparison of Double Lumen Versus Bronchial Blockers.

 The purpose of the study is to compare a double lumen tube versus the standard single-lumen tracheal tube, with an Arndt(R) blocker, in the morbidly obese patient who requires one-lung ventilation during surgery.

 The objects is to determine which device is best for intubation and is most effective in terms of optimal positioning of the device, of lung collapse, and quality of lung isolation.
