(thirdQuint)OX-40 Protein Expression in the Sentinel Lymph Nodes of Patients With Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the qualitative and quantitative expression of OX-40 and related markers in sentinel lymph nodes previously removed from patients with cancer.

 - Determine the qualitative and quantitative expression of OX-40 and related markers in sentinel lymph nodes freshly removed from patients with cancer.

 - Correlate the expression of OX-40 and related markers in sentinel lymph node tissue with expression in nonsentinel tissue from primary tumors and nonsentinel lymph nodes, tumor stage, and patient outcomes.

 OUTLINE: Sections of primary tumors, nonsentinel lymph nodes, and sentinel lymph nodes will be analyzed for expression of OX-40 by immunohistochemistry.

 Sections of negative (no tumor metastases) lymph nodes will be used as internal controls.

 Fresh tissue and blood will be tested for marker analysis and in vitro assays of immune function.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 specimens from sentinel lymph nodes previously removed from cancer patients and 100 specimens from sentinel lymph nodes freshly removed from cancer patients will be accrued for this study.

 OX-40 Protein Expression in the Sentinel Lymph Nodes of Patients With Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Studying protein expression in sentinel lymph node tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

 It may also help the study of cancer in the future.

 PURPOSE: This laboratory study is evaluating OX-40 protein expression in the sentinel lymph nodes of patients with cancer.
