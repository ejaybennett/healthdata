(fifthQuint)Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 The ideal chest radiotherapy dose/fractionation scheme for limited stage small cell lung cancer is undefined.

 Strategies of radiotherapy dose intensification with minimization of overall treatment time are felt to improve cure rates for LS-SCLC.

 Hypofractionation (giving higher than standard daily doses) facilitates both of these goals.

 In this study, we propose to use a dose escalated hypofractionated regimen of chest radiotherapy for patients with LS-SCLC.

 Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

It is accepted that giving higher doses of chest radiation in as short a time span as possible improves chances of cure.

 In this study, the investigators propose to give an increased dose of chest radiotherapy for limited stage small cell lung cancer patients using a strategy of giving a slightly higher daily dose of radiotherapy than normal.

 The investigators hypothesize that our proposed chest radiotherapy dose will improve 2-year overall survival rates in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer.
