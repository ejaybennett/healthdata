(firstQuint)Prevalence of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Patients With Perianal Disease.

 IBD of the small bowel is associated with perianal disease such as ano-rectal abscesses and fistulas.

 Colonoscopy with ileoscopy and small bowel series are relied upon to document the presence of Crohn's disease of the small bowel.

 We suspect that the prevalence of inflammatory small bowel disease is underestimated.

 In my practice I have cases that had negative colonoscopy ileoscopy and positive findings at capsule endoscopy.

 These patients are receiving therapy for Crohn's disease.

 It is important to prove that the prevalence is higher.

 Capsule Endoscopy (CE) is the "first line tool" diagnostic procedure for the examination of the small bowel.

 It is performed today in more than 2,900 GI clinics in hospitals, outpatient departments and physicians' offices all over the world using the PillCam(R) Platform.

 Over 500,000 CE procedures with the Given PillCam SB have been completed to date.

 Prevalence of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Patients With Perianal Disease@highlight

To show that prevalence of inflammation of the small bowel in patients with anorectal disease is under-diagnosed based on colonoscopy ileoscopy alone.
