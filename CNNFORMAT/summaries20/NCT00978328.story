(thirdQuint)Oxycodone User Registry (OUR).

 Real-world utility of Schedule II immediate release opioids depends on both efficacy and side effects.

 Few existing data sources systematically captured opioid-related side effects and their impact on patient outcomes and physician practice.

 This study is expected to lead to an in-depth understanding of patient and prescriber perceptions of both effectiveness and side effects associated with medications containing the most widely prescribed oral Schedule II immediate release opioid for pain management, oxycodone immediate release (OXYRX), alone (eg, Roxicodone(R)) or in combination (eg, Percocet(R), Tylox(R)) in actual clinical practice.

 This is a prospective, multi-center, observational patient registry.

 Adult outpatients who have pain due to a non-cancerous condition meeting study eligibility will be enrolled.

 Prescribers will treat patients according to their usual practice.

 Prescribers will treat patients, meeting study eligibility, with OXYRX according to their usual practice.

The purpose of this study is to describe clinical and demographic characteristics of patients receiving prescription medications containing oxycodone immediate release (OXYRX), to characterize patient and prescriber perceptions of the effectiveness outcomes and tolerability of OXYRX treatment, to describe prescriber decision-making about pain management with a Schedule II opioid and to explore how prescribers identify suspected abuse of pain medications.
