 Clopidogrel in High-risk Patients With Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of a 3-month regimen of clopidogrel initiated with a loading dose (LD) of 300 mg followed by 75 mg/day during the first 21days versus a 3-month regimen of ASA 75 mg/day alone on reducing the 3-month risk of any stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic, primary outcome) when initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset in high-risk patients with TIA or minor stroke.
