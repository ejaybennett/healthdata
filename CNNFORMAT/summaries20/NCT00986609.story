(thirdQuint)MUC1 Vaccine for Triple-negative Breast Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the efficacy of MUC1 peptide-poly-ICLC adjuvant vaccine in boosting systemic immunity to MUC1 in women who have completed therapy for AJCC(American Joint Committee on Cancer)stage I-III 'triple-negative' [i.

e.

, ER(-) PR(-) HER2/neu(-)] breast cancer.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the safety and toxicity of the MUC1 peptide and poly-ICLC vaccine in this cohort of patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive MUC-1 peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) and poly-ICLC vaccine SC in weeks 0, 2, and 10 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Some patients may receive a booster vaccine in week 52.

 Patients will be followed for study-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) for a period of 30 days after their last vaccination.

 If a patient experiences a SAE while participating in this study, they will be followed until the resolution of the SAE.

RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

 Giving booster vaccinations may make a stronger immune response and prevent or delay the recurrence of cancer.

 PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of poly-ICLC + MUCI peptide vaccine in boosting the immunologic response to MUCI in patients with triple-negative BC
