(secondQuint)Internet Self-Management Program With Telephone Support for Adolescents With Arthritis.

 This feasibility study will (1) assess adolescents' willingness to be randomized; (2) pilot the intervention, attention control strategies (e.

g.

, adolescents' 'own best efforts' at managing arthritis), and outcome measures; (3) determine adolescents' perceptions regarding acceptability of the web-based intervention; and (4) obtain estimates of treatment effects in primary (HRQL) and secondary (knowledge, coping, self-efficacy, stress, treatment adherence, pain) outcome measures to inform the calculation of appropriate sample size for the future RCT.

 We hypothesize that adolescents with JIA in the web-based intervention will demonstrate: (a) improved HRQL; (b) increased disease-specific knowledge; (c) improved coping, self-efficacy, and adherence to prescribed management; and (d) decreased pain and stress compared to adolescents in the attention control group.
