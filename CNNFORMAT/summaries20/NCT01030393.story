(thirdQuint)Intra-uterine Injection of Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) Before Embryo Transfer.

 Background : Human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG) was found to secreted immediately after fertilization by the embryo.

 It plays an important role in implantation and in attracting regulatory T cells to the endometrium.

 Rational : Intrauterine injection of hCG before embryo transfer in IVF/ICSI may increase endometrial regulatory T cells ( Treg ) and improve the implantation and pregnancy rates.

 Aim of the work : To study the effect of intrauterine injection of hCG before embryo transfer on the implantation and pregnancy rates after IVF/ICSI.

 Subjects : Infertile patients undergoing ICSI.

 Inclusion criteria : - Female age less than 40 years - Male factor infertility - Normal female hormonal profile and uterine cavity Exclusion criteria : - Previous ICSI failure - Azoospermia - Endometriosis Study group: Intrauterine injection of 100 iu of hCG (group 1)or 200 iu of hCG ( group 2) will be done during the dummy embryo transfer which is done 10-15 minutes before the actual embryo transfer.

 Control group: The embryo transfer will be done without prior intrauterine injection of hCG Main outcome measures : Implantation and pregnancy rates Secondary outcome measures : miscarriage and delivery rates.

 Intra-uterine Injection of Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) Before Embryo Transfer@highlight

Chorionic gonadotrophins (hCG) play an important role in implantation.

 The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of intrauterine injection of hCG before embryo transfer in IVF/ICSI on the implantation and pregnancy rates.

 The rational is that intrauterine hCG injection will attract regulatory T cells and improve implantation.
