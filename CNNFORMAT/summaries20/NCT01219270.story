(firstQuint)Radiocontrast Media Induced Hyponatremia.

 Radiocontrast media after percutaneous coronary interventioncan lead to increased osmolaliry of plasma, which results in translocational hyponatremia.

 The investigator will exam the incidence of hyponatremia after percutaneous coronary intervention, and will evaluate the underlying mechanism related to hyponatremia including translocational hyponatremia, or osmotic natriuresis.
