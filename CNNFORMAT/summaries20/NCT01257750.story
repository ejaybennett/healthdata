(fifthQuint)Treatment of Corneal Neovascularization With Topical Pazopanib.

 Normally avascular, under many pathologic conditions, vessels may invade the cornea from the limbal vascular plexus.

 Infection, inflammation, ischemia, degeneration, or trauma, and the loss of the limbal stem cell barrier can cause corneal neovascularization.

 Growth of new vessels may result in corneal scarring, edema, lipid deposition, and inflammation that may alter visual acuity and is a leading cause of monocular visual impairment and blindness.

 Additionally, it results in the loss of immune response across the cornea, thereby worsening the prognosis of a subsequent penetrating keratoplasty (PK).

 Growth of new blood and lymphatic vessels from preexisting vessels are mediated by members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family.

 In previous studies, inhibition of new blood or lymphatic vessels has been achieved by neutralization of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A).

 It has also been shown that platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) plays a role in corneal and choroidal neovascularization by regulating mural cell recruitment.

 Inhibition of PDGF-B and VEGF-A signaling pathways has shown to more effectively promote vessel regression than solely inhibiting VEGF-A.

 Pazopanib is a drug designed to block these pathways, stop new growth, and regress old vessel growth.

 Treatment of Corneal Neovascularization With Topical Pazopanib@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of a drug [Pazopanib (Votrient)] as a treatment for corneal neovascularization.

 The cornea is the clear, central portion of the eye and neovascularization means blood vessel growth.

 The cornea is typically avascular, or without blood vessels.

 Corneal neovascularization in the cornea and can put vision at risk.

 Numerous diseases of the cornea such as inflammation, ischemia (restriction of blood supply), infection, degeneration (or deterioration), trauma, or corneal stem cell deficiency can lead to corneal neovascularization.

 This major ocular complication can lead to corneal scarring, edema (swelling), lipid deposits, and inflammation that may significantly alter your vision.

 In addition, it worsens the outcome of potential future treatments, such as a corneal transplant.

 A corneal transplant is a treatment that many patients with severe corneal disease may ultimately need.
