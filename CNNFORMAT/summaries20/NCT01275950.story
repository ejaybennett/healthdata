The Project aims at enlisting the outlets selling tobacco in any form and enlisting the tobacco based advertisements (Direct and Surrogate) directed towards the community, within 100 yards of the selected educational institutes and studying their impact on the students of that institute.

 This will further be followed by an intervention program directed at the outlet owners which entails creating awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco and the existing bill and thereby assessing any change in Knowledge, Attitude and Practice.

 The results thus obtained will facilitate implementation of the existing Bill.
