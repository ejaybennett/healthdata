(firstQuint)Reduction of IgE Antibody in Human Allergic Subjects.

 Allergic Rhinitis (Hay fever) affects many children and adults and is a risk factor for development of asthma.

 This study utilizes the neurotransmitter, substance P, a small molecule which is present in nerve endings, the brain, skin, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract.

 Subjects will receive substance P and a low dosage of an allergen, such as ragweed in an attempt to reduce allergic reactivity.
