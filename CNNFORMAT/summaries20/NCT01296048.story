 James Zhu Tel: +86 1330 8036568 Used Equipments DUT (Device Under Test): Transtek Glass Body Analyzer, GBF-830, GBF-835, GBF-950, and SA-15.

 Reference Device: Scaleman Body Fat Scales, FS-148BW1 (Predicate Device).

 Test Protocol 1.

 Test Purpose: The aim of clinical test is to collect weight, body fat, total body water, bone mass, and muscle mass reading value which measured by DUT and reference device.

 Note: GBF-835 has not total body water, bone mass, and muscle mass functions.

 So it just collects weight and body fat data.

 2.

 Target Subject: The subject database shall contain at least 25 male and 25 female subjects and all above 18 years old.

 Patient's population analysis is bellow.

 3.

 Test procedures 1) Record the name, age, gender, and height of each subject.

 2) Let subject seated calmly for two minutes before test, dry the feet.

 3) Use device to measure weight, body fat, total body water, bone mass, and muscle mass; record reading value.

 4) For each subject, repeat 3) to get 3 pairs measurements.

 5) Repeat step 1) to 4) for every device (DUT: GBF-830, GBF-835, GBF-950, and SA-15; and reference device: FS-148BW1).

 6) Repeat step 1) to 5) for each subject.

 5.

 Note: 1.

 No motion and speaking are allowed during the measurement.

 2.

 All DUT use the same algorithms, have the same number of electrodes and contact the patient at the same body locations (feet), and operate on the same frequency.

 3.

 Test environment: Temperature: 201; Relative humidity: 40~50%.
