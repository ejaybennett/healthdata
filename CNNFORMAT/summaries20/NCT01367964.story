(thirdQuint)Prevention of West Syndrome With Low-dose Adrenocorticotropin Hormone (ACTH).

 Hypothesis: Preemptive ACTH will halt the evolution of hypsarhythmia and improve the EEG patterns in infants with pre-hypsarhythmic EEG.

 Aim.

 To determine whether a low dose ACTH improves EEG, we will repeat EEG one month after a 2 week course of daily ACTH.

 Prevention of West Syndrome With Low-dose Adrenocorticotropin Hormone (ACTH)@highlight

West syndrome (WS) is a specific type of epilepsy (or seizure disorder) that has three features: infantile spasms (type of seizure), loss of milestones, and a specific pattern on electroencephalogram (EEG or brain wave test) called hypsarhythmia.

 The purpose of this study is to detect pre-hypsarhythmia in infants at high-risk for WS and determine whether treatment with ACTH will prevent WS.
