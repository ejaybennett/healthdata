(firstQuint)Imaging of Trabeculectomy Blebs Using the Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography.

 After a trabeculectomy with mitomycin C 0,02% for 3 minutes, the blebs are controlled by a glaucoma specialist on day 1, week 1,2,3,4, month 3 and 6 after surgery.

 The glaucoma specialist will evaluate the bleb appearance according to a standardized protocol.

 At the same time points the bleb will be imaged with the spectral domain optical coherence tomography, to monitor bleb changes objectively.

 The investigators hope to see signs of bleb incapsulation and scarring earlier and then treat the patient accordingly.
