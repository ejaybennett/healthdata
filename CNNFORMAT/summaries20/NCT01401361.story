(thirdQuint)Atrial Flutter Ablation With Contact Therapy Cool Path Ablation System Along With EnSite Velocity Contact System.

 This will be a prospective, multi-center and non-randomized study.

 All enrolled patients who meet the eligibility criteria will receive ablation therapy for typical atrial flutter using the Contact Therapy cent Cool Path cent Cardiac Ablation System.

 Historical data from published (PMA P060019 Cool Path) , reported (IDE G090109 Cool Path Duo) and published literature on Atrial Flutter RF ablation studies is used to determine performance goals for primary study endpoints and derive the sample size.

 In addition, the following analyses will be performed in the study 1.

 Validation of ECI against conventional methods of assessing tip tissue contact and 2.

 Ancillary analysis to assess the relationship between the ECI and study outcomes.

 Subjects will undergo two follow up visits at day 10 and month 3 post procedure.

 The following assessments will be performed during these visits: - ECG - Query regarding adverse events since the last visit - Assessment of anti-arrhythmic and anti-coagulation medication - Query regarding recurrence or repeat ablation for typical atrial flutter.

 Atrial Flutter Ablation With Contact Therapy Cool Path Ablation System Along With EnSite Velocity Contact System@highlight

To demonstrate that the use of Contact Therapy cent Cool Path cent ablation catheter in conjunction with the EnSite Velocity Contact Technology for the treatment of typical atrial flutter - Does not result into unacceptable risk of intra-procedural composite serious adverse events and, - Does not affect efficacy of the ablation procedure The study will also evaluate the
