(fifthQuint)Evaluation of Navigation Assisted Reconstruction of Posttraumatic Zygomatic Deformity.

 Treatment of late deformities following fractures of the orbitozygomaticomaxillary complex can be considered a formidable challenge.

 Even to the skilled surgeon, over-or underestimation of the displacement is likely to occur, leading to an unsatisfactory result caused by over- or undercorrection.

However,The development of Computer-Assisted Navigation technology Offers new opportunities in the treatment of such deformities.

 With the help of navigation system,pre- and intraoperatively,the objective of any supporting medical device for reconstruction of the orbitozygomaticomaxillary complex would be visualization of the real and desired positions of the zygoma.

 In this randomized controlled trial, we would like to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of a new method for planning and realizing zygomatic osteotomies in cases of established post-traumatic deformities using computer assisted navigation.
