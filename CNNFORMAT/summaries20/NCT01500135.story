(thirdQuint)Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of TachoSil Versus Surgicel Original for the Secondary Hemostatic Treatment of Needle Hole Bleeding in Vascular Surgery.

 The drug being tested in this study is called TachoSil(R).

 TachoSil(R) was used to treat people undergoing scheduled subacute vascular surgery.

 This study looked at how well TachoSil(R) patches stopped bleeding at the surgical site compared to Surgicel(R) Original patches.

 The study enrolled 150 patients.

 Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two open label treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio: - TachoSil(R) - Surgicel(R) Original This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States.

 The overall time to participate in this study was approximately 6 months.

 Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, including safety follow-up visits at 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery.

Present trial is the third study that in combination with two completed studies (one being a trial in hepatic resection surgery also comparing TachoSil(R) and Surgicel(R) Original) targeted toward providing clinical safety and efficacy data to support extending the current label of TachoSil(R) to a general hemostasis indication across several surgical procedures and organ systems in the USA.
