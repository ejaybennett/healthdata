(thirdQuint)Evaluating the Safety and Immune Response to Two Admixtures of a Tetravalent Dengue Virus Vaccine.

 Dengue viruses cause dengue fever and the more severe condition, dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome.

 Dengue viruses are common in most tropical and subtropical regions of the world and infection with dengue viruses is the leading cause of hospitalization and death in children in many tropical Asian countries.

 For these reasons, the World Health Organization (WHO) has made the development of a dengue virus vaccine a top priority.

 This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of a live attenuated, tetravalent dengue virus vaccine called TetraVax-DV in healthy adults (18-50 years old) who have previously been infected with a dengue virus or other flavivirus or have previously received a flavivirus vaccine.

 Two different formulations of the TetraVax-DV vaccine will be evaluated.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of two admixtures of the TetraVax-DV vaccine or a placebo.

 At a baseline study visit (Day 0), participants will undergo a medical history review, physical examination, blood collection, vital sign measurements, and a pregnancy test for females.

 Participants will then receive one subcutaneous (SC) injection of their assigned vaccine or placebo in the upper arm.

 After receiving the vaccine, participants will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes for observation and monitoring.

 At home, participants will monitor and record their temperature three times a day for 16 days after the first vaccination (from Day 0 through Day 16) and for 16 days after the second vaccination (from Day 180 through Day 196).

 Additional study visits will occur at Days 3, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, and 150 and will include a physical examination, vital sign measurements, and blood collection.

 On Day 180, participants will receive a second SC injection of their assigned vaccine or placebo.

 Additional study visits will then occur at Days 183, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 201, 208, 236, 270, and 360, and will include the same study procedures and monitoring that occurred after the first vaccination.

 Evaluating the Safety and Immune Response to Two Admixtures of a Tetravalent Dengue Virus Vaccine@highlight

Dengue viruses can cause dengue fever and other serious health conditions, primarily affecting people living in tropical regions of the world.

 This study will evaluate the safety and immune responses to two formulations of a tetravalent dengue virus vaccine in healthy adults who have previously been infected with a dengue virus or other flavivirus or have previously received a flavivirus vaccine.
