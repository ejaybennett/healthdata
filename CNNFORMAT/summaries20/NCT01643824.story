(firstQuint)Hypofractionated Proton Beam Radiotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 The primary endpoint is local progression free survival.

 The trial is a single arm phase II trial with the historical arm.

 The expected 3-year local progression free survival for patient with HCC patients treated with proton beam therapy would be 80%.

 With a power of 80% and a type I error level of 10%, evaluable 40 patients are required to reject that the null hypothesis that true 3-year local progression free survival rate is 65%.

 Considering the 10% unevaluable patients due to loss of follow up, a total 45 eligible patients for each arms will be enrolled.
