(secondQuint)QT Interval in Patients With Pacemaker Dependency.

 This investigation aims at determining a possibility to assess the usefulness of various formulae that correct for the different effects of various pacing modes on the QT interval.

 More specifically, the hypothesis will be tested that applying adequate correction will preserve the predictive power of the QT-interval regarding proarrhythmia in various cardiac pathologies and therapies.

 QT Interval in Patients With Pacemaker Dependency@highlight

The aim of this study is to examine a correction term for an adapted QT interval during ventricular pacing (right, left and biventricular pacing) to obtain valid formulae correcting for the QT intervals in various pacing conditions.
