(thirdQuint)Weight Loss & Comorbidity Resolution With LAGB Alone vs.

 LAGB With Gastric Plication.

 Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding when combined with gastric plication will provide lasting weight loss benefits to patients.

 We are projecting that the percent of Excess Body Weight Loss (% EWL) will be greater in study subjects when compared with our control group with LAGB alone.

 Furthermore, it is anticipated that the % EWL in study subjects will be similar to patients who have laparoscopic Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass.

 LAGB With Gastric Plication@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether combining laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (AKA: lap-band surgery, LAGB) and laparoscopic gastric plication (making tucks in the large curve of the stomach with stitches) to lap-band surgery alone will result in a greater loss of excess weight over time.

 We anticipate that the average percent of excess body weight loss for study subjects will exceed 29% at 12 months.
