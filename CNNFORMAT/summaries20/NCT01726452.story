(fifthQuint)NEOadjuvant Trial in Adenocarcinoma of the oEsophagus and oesophagoGastric Junction International Study (Neo-AEGIS).

 Indication: Patients with cT2-3 N0-1 M0 adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or junction, based on clinical, CT-PET, and EUS staging, will be randomised to the MAGIC chemotherapy regimen versus the CROSS neoadjuvant chemo radiation protocol prior to surgery.

 Patients will be randomised to either Arm A (MAGIC regimen of chemotherapy only and surgery) or Arm B (CROSS protocol: chemotherapy with radiation therapy and surgery as per multimodal protocol).

 Eligible patients will be randomised in a 1:1 fashion between the MAGIC regimen or the CROSS protocol.

 Exploratory Study- Translational Research : Patients enrolled in this trial at the St James's' Hospital site, will be invited to consent to having some of their tissue and blood taken for use in future research studies.

 Following consent from the patient, tissue biopsy of tumour and/or normal oesophageal tissue will be obtained for research at the same time as that biopsied for histological diagnosis.

 In addition, tumour and/or normal tissue will also be obtained following surgical resection.

 Patient blood samples will also be obtained, both before and during treatment.

 The identification of both tumour and circulating biomarkers will increase knowledge of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying treatment response in oesophageal cancer and may facilitate the identification of biomarkers predicting patient response to treatment.

 NEOadjuvant Trial in Adenocarcinoma of the oEsophagus and oesophagoGastric Junction International Study (Neo-AEGIS)@highlight

Primary Objective: To evaluate one, two and three year survival of patients treated with resection plus neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy versus resection plus neoadjuvant chemo radiotherapy.

 Secondary Objective(s): To evaluate the effect of both neoadjuvant regimens on clinical and pathological response rate (in particular relief of dysphagia, improvement in health related quality of life (HRQL), endoscopic regression, and CT-PET evidence of tumour response), tumour regression grade, node-positivity, post-operative pathology, disease-free survival, time to treatment failure, toxicity, post-operative complications and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL).

 Exploratory Objective(s): Translational Research: The collection of blood and tissue samples for storage in the bio bank for future research.
