(fifthQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Three Experimental Drugs Compared With Telaprevir (a Licensed Product) for Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Infection in Treatment-experienced Adults.

 A randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of the 3-DAA regimen (ABT-450/ritonavir/ABT-267 [ABT-450/r/ABT-267] and ABT-333) plus ribavirin (3-DAA/RBV) compared with the combination of telaprevir (TPV) with RBV and pegIFN (TPV/RBV) in noncirrhotic participants with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 (HCV GT1) infection who were previously treated with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV).

 Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 3-DAA/RBV (ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 plus RBV for 12 weeks) or TPV/RBV (TPV co-administered with pegIFN and RBV for 12 weeks, followed by followed by pegIFN and RBV for either 12 or 36 weeks, per local prescribing information).

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of 3 direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs; ABT-450/ritonavir/ABT-267 [ABT-450/r/ABT-267; ABT-267 also known as ombitasvir] and ABT-333 [also known as dasabuvir]) plus ribavirin (RBV) compared with telaprevir (TPV) with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 (HCV GT1) infection without cirrhosis who were previously treated with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV).
