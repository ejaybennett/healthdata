(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Blood Pressure Reduction, Safety, and Tolerability of Canagliflozin in Patients With Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus on Stable Doses of Anti-hyperglycemic and Anti-hypertensive Agents.

 This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double blind (neither the patient nor the study doctor will know the name of the assigned treatment), parallel-group, 3-arm (patients will be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups) multicenter study to determine the effect of canagliflozin (100 mg and 300 mg) on blood pressure (BP) reduction compared to placebo (a pill that looks like all the other treatments but has no real medicine) in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

 The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase and a follow-up period.

 Approximately 153 participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (in a 1:1:1 ratio) in the double-blind treatment phase to receive canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg or placebo for 6 weeks.

 The total duration of participation in this study will be approximately 13 weeks.
