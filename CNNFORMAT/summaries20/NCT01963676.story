(thirdQuint)Transcranial Current Stimulation as a Treatment for Auditory Hallucinations in Schizophrenia.

 AIM 1: To evaluate the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (2mA for 20min on five consecutive days) on auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia patients using the change in ratings on the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) by patients before and after stimulation.

 We hypothesize that tDCS will modulate the abnormal neuronal activity found in schizophrenic patients and thereby decrease their auditory hallucinations when measured after stimulation.

 AIM 2: To evaluate the long term effects of tDCS by having patients give a rating on the AHRS after one month has passed since stimulation and comparing this value to their baseline score and their score immediately after stimulation.

 We hypothesize that there will remain a significant reduction in auditory hallucination score in participants who received tDCS at one month.

 Transcranial Current Stimulation as a Treatment for Auditory Hallucinations in Schizophrenia@highlight

Investigating the effect of non-invasive transcranial current stimulation on auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia.

 Normal neuronal activity is perturbed in schizophrenia, so selective targeting of this abnormal activity could serve as a treatment for schizophrenia and alleviate symptoms caused by abnormal neuronal activity, such as auditory hallucinations.
