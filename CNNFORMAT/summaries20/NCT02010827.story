(firstQuint)Endogenous Glucoseproduction in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus During Oral Glucose and iv.

 Glucose Infusion.

 Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are not able to suppress their glucagon secretion after a meal or after ingestion of glucose.

 Previous studies have shown that gastrointestinal hormones might play a role in this phenomenon.

 However, it has not yet been possible to determine whether this lack of glucagon suppression postprandially results in an increased endogenous glucose secretion, and thus is a factor in the patients postprandial hyperglycemia.

 We aim to perform oral glucose tolerance tests and isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusions with and without a continuous glucagon infusion in patients with T2DM and healthy control subjects.

 The glucagon infusion is aiming at copying the inappropriate "physiological" glucagon response observed in patients with T2DM.

We want to investigate how lack of glucagon suppression during an oral glucose tolerance test in patients with type 2 diabetes contributes to patients postprandial hyperglycemia.
