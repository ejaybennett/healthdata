(fifthQuint)Echocardiographic Analysis in Healthy Child.

.

 We select children addressed to paediatric cardiologist for not serious reason (heart murmur, chest pain, sport capacity.

.

.

), which had normal heart after evaluation.

 If they satisfied all inclusive criteria (0 to 17 years old, parental agreement, social security fund) and neither exclusive criteria (cardiac, respiratory or muscular problems, chronic diseases, drug with heart impact, poor image quality), we randomly execute a second echocardiography.

 Echocardiography are done with Vivid 7 ultrasound (General Electrics) and/or IE 33 ultrasound (Philips) by one or two trained operators.

 Strain loops are taken on three standard apical views (two, three and four-chamber views), short axis midventricular and aortic views, sub-costal short axis aortic view and sub-costal four-chamber apical views.

 Strain analysis are done in a second steps by one or two trained readers with adapted software : Echopac (General Electrics) or QLAB 0.

0 (Philips).

 Strain and Strain rate results are collected for each ventricle in each dimension.

We compare results between the two tests and done statistical analysis with a study of variability : ultrasound variability, operator variability, reader variability (correlation coefficient).

 We also done a feasibility study with use of "poor image quality"exclusion criteria.

 Echocardiographic Analysis in Healthy Child.

@highlight

2D Speckle Tracking echocardiography gained importance for the evaluation of ventricle contractility.

 Many indications have been developed in child population.

 However, the comparability of measurements between different software systems is not well defined.

 We choose to compare two software systems very often used in paediatric subjects : Echopac by General Electric and QLAB 9.

0 by Philips.

 We offer a randomly second echocardiography to children which have normal heart.

 We compare Strain and Strain rate results between the two tests with a study of variability : ultrasound variability, operator variability, reader variability.
