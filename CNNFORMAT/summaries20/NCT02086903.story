(firstQuint)Clopidogrel And Ticagrelor in Healthy Subjects.

 Consist with previous study Ticagrelor had greater, faster and more the platelet inhibition effect than Clopidogrel in both healthy subjects and stable coronary artery disease patients.

 Moreover, Asian subjects exposed higher active metabolite and stronger pharmacodynamics response than European subjects with same oral dose of antiplatelet agent.

 However, previous report comparing the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor and Clopidogrel in healthy Asian ethnicity is lacking.

 Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamic responses of a lower Ticagrelor dose using laboratory platelet function tests in healthy Korean volunteers.
