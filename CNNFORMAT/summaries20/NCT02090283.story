(firstQuint)Open Label Extension Study to Evaluate the Safety of SD-101 Cream in Subjects With Epidermolysis Bullosa.

 Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a rare group of inherited disorders that manifest as blistering or erosion of the skin and in some cases, the epithelial lining of other organs, in response to little or no apparent trauma.

 There is a lack of effective agents for skin disorders involving blistering and lesion formation.

 Current approved therapies are minimally effective and have safety issues.

 Scioderm has developed SD-101 Dermal Cream (6%) for treatment of EB.

 This is an open label extension study to assess the continued safety of topically applied SD-101 Dermal Cream (6%) in subjects with Simplex, Recessive Dystrophic, and Junctional non-Herlitz Epidermolysis Bullosa.

 SD-101 Dermal Cream (6%) will be applied topically, once a day to the entire body for the duration of the study.

 Subjects who successfully complete the entire SD-003 study will have the option to roll over into the SD-004 study.

 The baseline visit 1 will occur at the final visit date for SD-003.

 The Body Surface Area (BSA) coverage of blisters and lesions assessment made at the final SD-003 study visit will be used as the baseline information at visit 1 for the SD-004 study.

 The subject will return to the study site for visit 2 through visit 14 (1080 days) to have BSA assessed.

 Body Surface Area will be assessed at all subsequent scheduled study center visits.

 Scheduled study center visits occur every 6 months after visit 14 (visits 16, 18, 20, etc.

).

 After completion of visit 14, the next subject visit (visit 15) will be a phone call from the site to the patient.

 Telephone visits will occur every 6 months thereafter (visits 17,19, 21, etc.

) and include assessment of adverse events and concomitant medications only.

 For female subjects of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at visit 4 and every 6 months up to and including the final study visit.
