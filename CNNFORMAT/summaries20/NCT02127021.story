(thirdQuint)The Effects of High Dose Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy After Pancreatoduodenectomy.

 There are not enough studies evaluating nutritional parameters in patients with pancreatic resection.

 After pancreatic surgery, there are several ways to improve patient condition in terms of quality of life including nutrition.

 In the investigators previous study, pancreatic enzyme supplement through the administration of Norzyme(R) 25000 IU containing lipase 25000 IU, amylase 22500 IU, and protease 1250 IU after various type of pancreatectomy to improve quality of life and nutritional status failed to prove its effectiveness.

 After administration of low-dose Norzyme(R) (25000 IU), some patients showed weight gain, but statistically significant conclusions were not obtained mainly because of various types of pancreatectomy and low supplementary dosage of pancreatic enzyme.

 Therefore, the investigators design this study to find out the effect of high-dose Norzyme(R) (40000 IU) on weight gain, quality of life, stool habit change, and nutritional status in patients with pancreaticoduodenectomy.

 The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness and adequacy of high-dose pancreatic supplementary treatment through a randomized, placebo-using, single-blinded, and multicenter study.

 The Effects of High Dose Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy After Pancreatoduodenectomy@highlight

Up to now, the studies concerning nutritional assessment after pancreatic resection were rare.

 The low-dose pancreatic enzyme treatment after pancreatectomy showed no significant benefit in terms of nutritional status.

 This study is a multicenter randomized phase IV study by using high-dose Norzyme(R) (40,000 IU) to evaluate quality of life and nutritional status after pancreaticoduodenectomy.
