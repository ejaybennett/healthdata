(fifthQuint)The Short- and Long Term Outcomes of Early Routine PCI With the Standard Treatment in Low-intermediate Risk ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction Patients Who Successfully Fibrinolysis.

.

 1.

Research design: Intervention trial 1.

1 Study domain: STEMI patients who will receive the fibrinolysis for reperfusion therapy 1.

2 Target population: STEMI patients who will receive the percutaneous coronary intervention after fibrinolysis in Lampang Regional hospital and Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital.

 1.

3 Study population: STEMI patients who will receive the percutaneous coronary intervention after fibrinolysis during the year of 2013-2014 at Lampang Regional hospital and Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital Inclusion criteria: 1.

 The patients who received the percutaneous coronary intervention after fibrinolysis 2.

 Adult patients with age more than 18 years old 3.

 GRACE risk score less than 155 (low-intermediate risk) Exclusion criteria: 1.

 The patients who received primary PCI or rescue PCI 2.

 The patients who had the previous history of coronary-artery bypass surgery 3.

 The high risk patients (such as cardiogenic shock, complete heart block, GRACE 155) 1.

4 Occurrence relation Y (Composite outcomes) = f (Treatment early vs.

 delay | confounders) 1.

5 Setting: The study will be conducted in Lampang Regional hospital and Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital.

 1.

6 Determinant (x): Time to percutaneous coronary intervention (early vs.

 delayed).

7 Events (y): composite outcomes (included of death, re-infarction, and recurrent ischemia), re-hospitalized with ACS, and worsening heart failure.

 The Short- and Long Term Outcomes of Early Routine PCI With the Standard Treatment in Low-intermediate Risk ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction Patients Who Successfully Fibrinolysis.

@highlight

1.

 Objective: To evaluate short- and long-term in the STEMI patients who successfully thrombolysis with early routine and delay percutaneous coronary intervention in low-intermediate risk patients.

 2.

 Educational/ application advantages: To evaluate the time of early and delay PCI after received fibrinolysis had an effect to the short- and long-term clinical outcomes in low- intermediate GRACE risk score patients.

 No available of randomized controlled study in these group of the patients.
