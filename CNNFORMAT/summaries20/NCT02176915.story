(thirdQuint)Trial of Fresh Start Weight Loss Intervention in WIC Participants.

 The goal is to study the effectiveness and implementation of a postpartum weight loss intervention for WIC clients that has potential for sustainability.

 The investigators will compare outcomes among participants in a group-based weight loss intervention condition (Fresh Start) to outcomes among participants in a self-directed, print materials only, comparison group.

 The Fresh Start intervention, informed by formative research studies, consists of an 8-session group-based weight loss intervention delivered by WIC nutritionists and peer leaders.

 The intervention integrates key educational and skill building strategies from the lifestyle arm of the Diabetes Prevention Program with delivery strategies and messages specific for the WIC program and postpartum women.

 The intervention will be evaluated in a randomized clinical trial that will contribute to generalizable knowledge.
