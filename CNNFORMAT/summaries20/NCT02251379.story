(fifthQuint)Environmental Control as Add-on Therapy in Childhood Asthma.

 The study is a parallel arm study of an individually tailored, multi-faceted ECS plus controller medication titration versus controller medication titration alone.

 After a 4-week run-in period to stabilize their asthma, the investigators will randomize 200 Baltimore children with persistent asthma and a recent exacerbation in a 1:1 ratio to the two arms and follow them for six months.

 There will be five clinic visits and three home visits over this time period for clinical and home assessments, respectively.

 There will be up to four environmental intervention visits for participants randomized to the environmental control plus controller medication group.

 The environmental modules include mouse, cockroach, furry pets, dustmites, and smoking.

 Air purifiers and laundered bedding are also included in this arm.

 Participants randomized to the controller medication group have the option of having one home visit after completing the study at which the participants will receive home intervention services that the environmental control plus controller medication group received.

 Participants will have repeated assessment of: controller medication requirements; secondary clinical, physiologic, and inflammatory outcomes; and particulate matter (PM), air nicotine, and allergen levels.

 Environmental Control as Add-on Therapy in Childhood Asthma@highlight

This study evaluates the effects of adding on an environmental home intervention to standard asthma medication management on controller medication requirements among children and adolescents with asthma.

 The investigators hypothesize that the addition of an individually-tailored, multi-faceted Environmental Control Strategy (ECS) to guidelines-based controller medication will result in less controller medication requirement and allergic inflammation than controller medication alone among urban asthmatic children.
