(secondQuint)rTMS for PTSD Comorbid With Major Depressive Disorder.

 This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for adults with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD).

 Although standard rTMS uses stimulations delivered to the left prefrontal cortex at 10 pulses per second, prior work has shown that other stimulation frequencies may work for both PTSD and MDD.

 In this study, we examine the efficacy of left-sided 5Hz in patients with PTSD and MDD, hypothesizing that this lower frequency will improve PTSD and MDD symptoms.
