(fifthQuint)The Comparison of the 3 Minutes Ramp Walk Test With 6 Minutes Walk Test in Stable Patients After Valve Replacement.

 The patients who have undergone valve replacement surgeries face difficulty in their functional activities especially during climbing stairs, walking uphill.

 The six minute level walk test has been a gold standard in the assessment of functional capacity in cardio respiratory conditions like, coronary heart diseases , valvular heart diseases, chronic respiratory illness.

 Moreover, six minute walk test has been framed to assess the functional capacity in level walking.

so far, no test have been developed to assess the functional capacity of the patients during uphill walking and stair climbing.

 Though ramp walking ( uphill walking) can be trained using treadmill, it is not feasible for the indian patients as they are not familiar in the treadmill and their fear may also show variation in the functional assessment.

 Hence this study has been proposed.

 The Comparison of the 3 Minutes Ramp Walk Test With 6 Minutes Walk Test in Stable Patients After Valve Replacement@highlight

In view of assessing the uphill walking capacity and to provide a functional stress test with better sensitivity the investigators need a short term functional stress test over the gold standard six minute walk test.

 To demonstrate the significance of 3 minutes ramp walk test over 6 minutes walk test as a functional stress test.

 The investigators hypothesize that the investigators three minutes ramp walk test (3MRWT) will be superior to the existing six minutes level walk test (6MWT) in the measurement of functional capacity of post valve replacement patients.
