(thirdQuint)To Investigate Agreement Between the EM-3000 and the Predicate Device Noncon Robo Pachy (F&A) (CellChek XL).

 The observational clinical investigation is intended to measure agreement between two diagnostic instruments of the eye's corneal endothelium.

 The study device is the EM-3000 specular microscope and the control device is the NonCon Robo Pachy (F&A) (CellChek XL) specular microscope.

 Both instruments measure corneal endothelial cell layer parameters including cell density, coefficient of variation, percent hexagonality, and central thickness.

 The primary variable is the measurement of agreement between the two instruments for the four parameters described.

 The secondary variables include repeatability (intra-investigator) and reproducibility both inter-investigator, and inter-instrument.

 Additionally, measurements of agreement will be made on the EM-3000 using automated analysis with and without touch-up.

 To Investigate Agreement Between the EM-3000 and the Predicate Device Noncon Robo Pachy (F&A) (CellChek XL)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the precision and agreement of the study device, a specular microscope, in comparison to a currently commercially available specular microscope in establishing substantial equivalence of the two devices in clinical use for diagnostic purposes of the human cornea.
