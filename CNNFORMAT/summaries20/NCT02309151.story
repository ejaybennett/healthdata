(fifthQuint)Direct or Subacute Coronary Angiography for Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest.

 The study is an open prospective randomized multicenter study with a registry follow up where out of hospital cardiac arrest without ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in ECG will be randomized to direct coronary angiography with possible intervention or the usual care without acute coronary angiography.

 The study will include 120 patients in total , of which 80 patients without STEMI and 40 patients with STEMI after successful resuscitation after cardiac arrest.

 Randomization takes place immediately after ECG is taken in conjunction with the first medical contact.

 First ECG can be taken to the emergency room if the prehospital situation for various reasons do not permit or enable ECG recording.

 Randomization will then occur in the emergency room.

 Coronary angiography should be done within 120 minutes from first medical contact in the treatment group.

 Randomization will be done via a web based module.

The group without STEMI whom will not be randomized to acute coronary angiography will be treated according to standard practice where coronary angiography with possible following intervention is up to the competent cardiologist.

The strategy is avoid coronary angiography during the first 3 days unless urgent indication occurs during the care process such as renewed chest pain, renewed STEMI circulatory instability or cardiogenic shock.

 This is also the standard method currently practiced in Swedish and international hospitals.

 The group with STEMI on the first ECG is logged and followed, and the patients in this group are studied separately in order to describe and evaluate the frequency of acute intervention in this group and look at the survival data compared with the study population and against an unselected STEMI material without cardiac arrest.

 Direct or Subacute Coronary Angiography for Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest@highlight

The overall aim of this prospective, randomized pilot study is to investigate whether acute coronary angiography (within 120 minutes) with a predefined strategy for revascularization, is safe to implement in patients with out of hospital cardiac arrest.

 The primary question at issue is whether early angiography (within 120 minutes) with a predefined strategy for revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is safe to carry out in this group of patients.

 The patients randomized to acute coronary angiography will be compared with a control group who will be treated according to standard practice with coronary angiography with possible subsequent intervention according to the current routine, which usually does not occur within the first three days after cardiac arrest.
