(secondQuint)The Effect of Mobile App Home Monitoring on the Number of In-Person Visits Following Ambulatory Surgery.

 Women's College Hospital offers specialized surgical procedures, including breast reconstruction.

 Patients often travel great distances to undergo surgery.

 The average ambulatory breast reconstruction patient travels 76 km from home to hospital, with the furthest patient coming from 540 km away.

 Most patients receiving ambulatory breast reconstruction have a low rate of postoperative events necessitating clinic visits.

 However, regular follow-up is still considered important in the early post-operative phase.

 Increasingly, telemedicine is used to overcome the distance patients must travel to receive specialized care.

 Telemedicine data suggests that mobile monitoring and follow-up care is valued by patients and can reduce costs to society (1-3).

 Currently, Women's College Hospital is using a mobile application (QoC Health Inc.

, Toronto) to complement in-person postoperative follow-up care for breast reconstruction patients.

This study evaluate if in an ambulatory breast reconstruction patient population at Women's College Hospital (WCH), can we avert in-person follow-up care through the use of mobile app home monitoring compared to conventional, in-person follow-up care in the first 30-days following surgery.
