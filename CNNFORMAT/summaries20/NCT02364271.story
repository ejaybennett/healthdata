(fifthQuint)Early Risk Stratification in ED Chest Pain Patients.

 Patients with chest pain commonly present to Emergency Departments (ED), and often have underlying ischaemic heart disease.

 Although more than 40% are of non-cardiac origin, clinical assessment places a heavy burden on hospital resources.

 Conversely, despite increased awareness and diagnostic advances, 2-8% of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are misdiagnosed by conventional methods and inappropriately discharged home, resulting in a double mortality.

 In Hong Kong, 1.

4 million people (17% of the total population) will be 65 years old and over by 2021.

 The risk of developing ischaemic heart disease increases with age.

 Thus an aging population may lead to a larger burden on health services.

 Since 2009, the Hospital Authority has identified the improvement of ACS management as a priority area.

 Current protocols for ruling in/out patients suspected of ACS involve symptom monitoring, serial electrocardiograms and serial troponin tests over 6 hours.

 This lengthy assessment is safe but contributes to ED overcrowding, and duplication of effort which is associated with increased costs and adverse patient outcomes.

 Even in patients who are protocol negative, and who are discharged, it is unclear who should be followed up earlier, and who should be followed up later.

 An assessment process that efficiently and safely improves early risk-stratification in patients with suspected ACS would be beneficial.

 Current advances in proteomics have paved the way for more sensitive biomarkers.

 One of these biomarkers - heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) - is detected in blood within one hour after myocardial injury, and has recently emerged as a prognostic marker for ACS.

 It predicts mortality and re-infarction in patients with troponin-negative ACS.

 If both troponin and H-FABP are negative, the mortality rate at 6 months is 0%.

 Adding H-FABP to troponin-based protocols could also avoid unnecessary investigations caused by false-positive troponins.

 Although high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) tests may achieve better analytical performance than standard troponin tests, there is increasing concern about excessive false-positive rates, and about the burden of risk if the result is ignored, and the burden of admission if most positive hs-cTn cases are admitted.

 This poses the question of whether there is additional value in measuring novel markers such as H-FABP which may be used in conjunction with hs-cTn tests.

 With the rapid development of non-invasive cardiac imaging, a combination of biomarkers with cardiac imaging may provide a better solution to the diagnostic challenge of rapid assessment and risk-stratification of patients suspected of ACS.

 Coronary artery calcium score (CACS) is a non-invasive imaging method for assessing the degree of calcification in coronary artery plaques which is related to the degree of underlying atherosclerosis.

 CACS can be performed on conventional CT scanners without iodinated contrast administration, completed within a single short breath hold, is inexpensive and with minimal radiation exposure.

 A CACS of 0 is associated with a 5-year cardiac event rate of less than 1%, whereas increased CACS indicates increasing risk which correlates positively with the score.

 Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score system is an externally validated and widely used structured risk assessment method to predict adverse outcome in patients with unstable angina and non-ST elevation MI.

 It is also helpful to stratify risk for adverse outcome in patients with undifferentiated chest pain.

 Its use in conjunction with biomarker tests and cardiac imaging has not been prospectively tested.

 This study is designed to investigate whether CACS, H-FABP test and TIMI score can provide additional values in the current assessment process, which in turn will reliably identify patients with suspected ACS presenting to ED at low- and high-risk of adverse cardiac events.

 The investigators hypothesize that CACS, H-FABP concentration, hs-cTnT concentration and TIMI score positively correlate with the rate of the major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30 days and 6 months in patients presenting to the ED with suspected ACS.

 Aims: The aims of the present study in patients with chest pain of uncertain cardiac cause and a non-ischaemic initial electrocardiogram (ECG) presenting to the ED are 1.

 To investigate whether there is any correlation between CACS, H-FABP concentration, hs-cTnT concentration and TIMI score with the MACE rate at 30 days and 6 months; 2.

 To evaluate the predictive values of CACS, H-FABP, hs-cTnT, TIMI score and various combinations.

 Study design and participants: Patients were recruited consecutively on weekdays between 9:00AM - 5:00PM excluding weekends and holidays.

 For each eligible patient, apart from the routine chest pain protocol including clinical assessment, ECG and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) test, three additional steps were fulfilled: 1.

 a H-FABP point-of-care test performed on ED arrival and repeated 3 hours later; 2.

 a TIMI score performed on ED arrival; and 3.

 a CACS performed within 24 hours of ED arrival.

 All the ED physicians and cardiologists responsible for patient management were blinded to the CACS results, H-FABP results and TIMI scores of the enrolled patients but aware of the clinical record, serial ECG and hs-cTnT results from usual care.

 All recruited patients were treated according to standard practice.

 Immediate patient management were not affected by the CACS results, H-FABP results and TIMI scores.

 The decision to discharge a patient home from the ED or to recommend admission to a chest pain unit, a coronary care unit or an intensive care unit were determined by the ED physician based on the clinical record, ECG and serial hs-cTnT results as per standard practice.

 After hospital discharge, patients were contacted by an English- and Cantonese-speaking research nurse via telephone for a follow-up at 30 days and 6 months after initial presentation and asked specific scripted questions about subsequent visits to the ED, hospital readmission for evaluation of chest pain, and all cardiac procedures performed.

 The research nurse also accessed to the patients' medical records.

 All-cause mortality, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, all-cause readmission and readmission for ACS or other cardiac event, such as arrhythmia or cardiac failure, and all cardiac tests and coronary revascularization procedures were retrieved and verified for each patient.

 Data collection and measurable parameters: Demographic data, medical history, conventional risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, lipid profile, smoking history, family history, current medication and contact information to facilitate subsequent follow-up, were collected and recorded in a computerized database.

 ECG results, serial hs-cTnT results, H-FABP results, CACS results and TIMI scores were also recorded.

 In addition, subsequent visits to ED, hospital readmission for evaluation of chest pain and all cardiac procedures performed were retrieved from the hospital authority's computerised medical system and verified via telephone follow-up at 30 days and 6 months after initial presentation.

 Furthermore, death, myocardial infarction, readmission for ACS, and all cardiac testing and coronary revascularization procedures were also obtained via a dedicated hospital-based computer system.

 Outcome measures: The primary outcome is the number of patient that had MACE within 30 days and 6 months after initial ED presentation.

 The time to the first cardiac event or the final contact encounter in patients without events will be chosen for assessing patient outcome.

 The prognostic performance of CACS, H-FABP test, hs-cTnT test, TIMI score and various combinations on the presence and absence of MACE were assessed.

 MACE is defined as relating to safety outcome, which consists of all-cause mortality (including cardiac death and sudden cardiac death), cardiac arrest, readmission with myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, or effectiveness outcome, which consists of revascularization (e.

g.

 coronary artery bypass grafting), ventricular arrhythmia needing intervention and high-degree atrioventricular block needing intervention.

 The secondary outcomes include the number of MACE, safety and effectiveness MACE respectively, at 30 days and 6 months after initial ED presentation, and the prognostic performances (i.

e.

 sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, positive likelihood ratios and negative likelihood ratios) of CACS, H-FABP test, hs-cTnT test, TIMI score and various combinations.

 Protocol amendment: Previous study showed that the prognostic value of HEART score is comparable to TIMI score in patients presenting to ED with chest pain suspected of acute coronary syndrome.

 It would be beneficial to add HEART score into the study to assess its prognostic value when hs-cTnT is used instead of conventional troponin and its possible role in an accelerated diagnositic protocol for chest pain patients in ED when used alone and in combination with TIMI score, H-FABP and CACS.

 In October 2014, modified HEART score of the patients recruited were determined retrospectively based on information in patients' record.

 The modified HEART score consists of 5 assessment items with a maximum score of 9 points.

 Study design and participants This prospective observational study was conducted in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong.

 Chest pain adult patients suspected with acute coronary syndrome were recruited.

 Point-of-care H-FABP and hs-cTnT tests, TIMI score and CT scan for coronary calcium score were performed on study subjects.

 Patients were followed-up at 30-day and 6 months for the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events.

 In 2014, a modified HEART score incorporating hs-cTnT was included as one of the predictors under study alongside with modified TIMI score, FABP and CACS.

 The HEART score was completed retrospectively.
