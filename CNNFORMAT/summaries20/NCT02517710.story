(firstQuint)Study to Compare Suture Material in Closure of Uterine Incision in Cesarian Section.

 Cesarean section is one of the most common medical procedures women of child bearing age undergo, in the United States and the world.

 This trial is designed to provide information and possible recommendation as to suture material used during closure of the uterus during that procedure.

 Our intent is to provide data relating to time of uterine closure, blood loss, and post operative pain.

 These conclusions may provide substantiated recommendations as to self locking and tying suture material in the performance of cesarean section as related to readily available synthetic suture material, which has the need for standard suture knot placement.
