(secondQuint)A Study of Enzalutamide in Combination With AZD5363 in Patients With mCRPC.

 Patients with mCRPC will receive enzalutamide and AZD5363 (or enzalutamide and placebo in the randomised phase II) until confirmed disease progression.

 The trial aims to identify the safety and tolerability of enzalutamide and AZD5363 and identify recommended phase II dose of AZD5363 (phase I safety run-in).

 The randomised phase II will estimate and compare the anti-tumour activity of AZD5363 and enzalutamide, and placebo and enzalutamide as measured by response.

 The single stage phase II expansion cohort will estimate the anti-tumour activity of AZD5363 and enzalutamide in patients who have previously progressed on enzalutamide alone.
