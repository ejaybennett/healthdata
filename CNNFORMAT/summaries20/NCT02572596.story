(secondQuint)Comparing Intermediate-dose CTX+ G-CSF Plus or Not rhTPO for PB CD34+ Cells Mobilization in MM Patients.

 The purpose of this study is to try to find out whether rhTPO combined to ID-CTX + G-CSF could improve the results of peripheral blood stem cell mobilization.

 Comparing ID-CTX and G-CSF plus rhTPO or not for peripheral blood stem cell mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma.

 rhTPO15000U/d were given from day 5~7 after chemotherapy until the stem cell collection .
