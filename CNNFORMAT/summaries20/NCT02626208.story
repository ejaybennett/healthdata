(fifthQuint)Dose Finding Study of Contraceptive Vaginal Ring With Different Estradiol Levels in Combination With Nestorone.

 This dose-finding study aims to evaluate serum estradiol levels with use of contraceptive vaginal rings releasing Nestorone(R) and escalating doses of estradiol in normal cycling women.

 The primary objective is to evaluate one-month data on the serum estradiol (E2) levels of three different contraceptive vaginal rings containing a fixed dose of Nestorone(R) (NES) and escalating doses of estradiol as the basis for selecting a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) dose for a contraceptive efficacy trial.

 The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of three different estradiol doses of a NES- E2 CVR on progesterone levels, bleeding and side effects during one month of use and to evaluate the effects of a hormone-free internal on bleeding patterns.

 Nestorone serum levels will further be measured as an indication of compliance with the continuous use of the ring.

 Dose Finding Study of Contraceptive Vaginal Ring With Different Estradiol Levels in Combination With Nestorone@highlight

This clinical trial investigates a new vaginal delivery system made of silicone rubber, containing Nestorone(R), a 19-nor progesterone derivative and a low dose of serum estradiol (E2).

 The investigators plan to evaluate one-month data on the serum estradiol (E2) levels of three different contraceptive vaginal rings that contain a fixed dose of NES and escalating doses (75 mu g/day, 100 mu g/day, or 200 mu g/day) of estradiol as the basis for selecting a CVR for a larger contraceptive efficacy trial.
