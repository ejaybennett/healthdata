(thirdQuint)Study of TRC105 and Bevacizumab in Patients With Refractory Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN).

 TRC105 is a monoclonal antibody that binds to endoglin, an angiogenic target highly expressed on the tumor vessels and tumor cells in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).

 Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that inhibits angiogenesis and extends survival in patients with a wide variety of solid tumor types.

 TRC105 has been well tolerated as a single agent and when combined with bevacizumab.

 These antibodies may be efficacious in refractory GTN, a tumor type that is highly vascular and has been shown to densely express endoglin.

 Study of TRC105 and Bevacizumab in Patients With Refractory Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN)@highlight

The purpose of the study is to determine the overall response rate of single agent TRC105 and the combination of TRC105 and bevacizumab in patients with refractory GTN (including choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT), and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT)).

 Up to 30 patients will be treated.
