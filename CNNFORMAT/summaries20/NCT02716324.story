(fifthQuint)Communication to Improve Shared Decision-Making in ADHD.

 Fragmentation in health care and poor communication across systems adversely impact engagement and adherence to treatment by children with ADHD and their families.

 Fragmentation of services for ADHD impairs communication and collaboration between families and primary care providers, mental health providers, and educators, and leads to suboptimal outcomes for children.

 Prior studies have documented that little communication and coordination exist among providers across different systems despite calls for better system integration.

 Fragmentation in communication between providers has the potential to impair shared decision-making.

 To promote shared decision-making, we have developed an electronic health record (EHR)-linked portal to collect information from parents, teachers and clinicians on children's ADHD symptoms and treatment-related preferences and goals.

 We have also developed an ADHD Care Manager intervention manual.

 Approximately 300 participants will be enrolled for this study.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to use either the EHR portal alone, or the EHR portal plus a Care Manager.

 For those assigned to the EHR portal plus Care Manager, the Care Manager will meet with families at the beginning of the study to confirm their treatment preferences and goals, provide additional education on ADHD treatment, and distribute handouts on common concerns among ADHD patients and families.

 The Care Manager will contact families weekly to every 3 months by phone, email, or in-person as needed to assess treatment use, identify new concerns, and assist families with problem-solving.

 Using the portal or other means, the Care Manager will also communicate with pediatric clinicians, mental health providers, and teachers to clarify family treatment preferences and goals and address emerging treatment issues.

 Participants will complete surveys that will assess ADHD symptoms, goal attainment, patient-reported outcomes, patient and family engagement and treatment initiation and adherence.

The purpose of this study is to explore whether using an online patient portal plus a Care Manager is more effective than using an online portal alone in managing care for children with ADHD.

 Doctors at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia currently use the online patient portal to help gather information from parents and teachers on ADHD symptoms, treatment, and medication side effects.

 The Care Manager is a person who meets with participants during the study to discuss their child's ADHD care.

 The Care Manager communicates with the child's doctor and teacher to communicate a parent's goals and preferences for their child's ADHD care.
