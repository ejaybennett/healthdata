(fifthQuint)Programme of Lifestyle Intervention in Families for Cardiovascular Risk Reduction.

 STUDY AIMS: AIM 1.

 To identify barriers to implementing an integrated cardiovascular risk management program in families of individuals with a positive history CHD.

 AIM 2.

 To assess the effectiveness of an integrated cardiovascular risk management strategy (consisting of screening for risk factors, lifestyle education and linkage to primary care for cardiovascular risk factor management) on risk factor clustering in families, and changes in blood pressure (BP), lipids, glucose, smoking and physical activity.

 AIM 3.

 To estimate the scalability of the integrated cardiovascular risk reduction strategy in families of individuals with a positive history CHD for state- or nation-wide implementation.

 Scalability will be informed by cost-effectiveness and acceptability of the integrated cardiovascular risk reduction approach.

 STUDY DESIGN: The proposed project uses mixed methods to achieve the study aims, the three design approaches include: Aim 1, formative qualitative research; Aim 2, a randomized controlled trial; and Aim 3, cost effectiveness and evaluative qualitative research.

 Additionally a pilot study will be conducted with the aim to understand the practical feasibility of the study, acceptability among participants, appropriateness of the study tools and finally to explore the interests of other stakeholders (community health workers and department of health service, Government of Kerala).

 The pilot study will include only 30 participants.

 It is essentially to check the validity of the responses elicited from the tools.

 We also plan to conduct two focus group discussions with the potential participants (individuals with family history of CHD).

 Additionally, 6 in-depth interviews will be conducted with community health workers (convenient sampling) to assess their opinion about the intervention programme.

 Formative qualitative research (Aim 1): Semi-structured focus group discussions (FGDs) of 6-12 adults with family history of CHD will gather information on understanding of diseases, barriers to care, and feedback on the intervention (lifestyle education, care and linkage coordination).

 In-depth interviews with stake-holders (frontline community health care workers (FCHW), primary care physicians, and general practitioners) will be face-to-face and semi-structured and will include questions regarding integration of cardiovascular risk management at the family level.

 The intervention and trial protocols will be modified to incorporate key findings collected from FGDs and interviews to make the intervention more contextually-relevant.

 Integrated cardiovascular risk reduction intervention (Aim 2): A randomized controlled trial of families of individuals with a positive history CHD will be used to address Aim 2.

 Eligibility criteria: Eligible families include those with at least one family member with physician confirmed CHD diagnosed before the age of 55 years.

 If there are family members who have died from CHD (physician confirmed deaths) before the age of 55 years, such families will be also eligible to participate in the study.

 The medical records of CHD patients will be used to confirm the diagnosis and the age of the index case.

 A written informed consent to the study randomization plan from the head of the family is a mandatory eligibility criteria.

 All participating family members will also be required to provide individual consent to participate.

 Family randomization: Each family will randomly be assigned to participate in either the treatment intervention arm (integrated CVD risk management) or usual care arm (no interventions other than initial screening).

 Participants eligibility criteria: Minimum of two members from each family will be included even if they reside in separate houses.

 Potential participants must be either parents, children or brothers and sisters of the affected person (individual with history of CHD) in order to enter the study and more than 18 years of age.

 Bedridden and terminally ill patients will be excluded from the study.

 To address Aim 2, several clinical outcomes will be assessed.

 Primary outcome: proportions in each group achieving or improving risk factor control status (blood pressure150 min/week of moderate intensity physical activity, BMI6 months ago and a healthy diet score), 2.

 between group mean difference in main risk factors (SBP, DBP, LDL, FPG), 3.

 proportions meeting >80% of recommended process measures (smoking cessation, moderate or high intensity physical activity, and 3 daily servings of fruits and vegetables), and 4) proportions achieving or maintaining ten year Framingham CVD risk score15/WHO CVD risk score of Primary outcome-Treatment arm] - [Primary outcome-usual care arm].

 Similarly, incremental cost utility ratio will be calculated using data from a 12 monthly health utility assessment.

 Quality adjusted life years (QALY) will be used as the measure of health utility.

 The acceptability of the interventions will be assessed through qualitative research.

 Semi-structured FGDs (6 each in men and women) will be conducted among study participants at the end of the intervention period.

 In-depth interviews with FCHW (6 interviews) will be also conducted to gauge the acceptability of the interventions.

 Programme of Lifestyle Intervention in Families for Cardiovascular Risk Reduction@highlight

The overall goal of the study is to test the effectiveness and sustainability of an integrated care model for managing cardiovascular risk in individuals with family history of premature coronary heart disease (CHD).

 This care model involves: 1.

 screening for cardiovascular risk factors, 2.

 providing lifestyle interventions for prevention and management of cardiovascular risk factors, 3.

 providing a framework for linkage to appropriate primary health care facility and 4.

 active follow-up of intervention adherence.

 Initially, a formative qualitative research component will gather information on understanding of diseases, barriers to care, specific components of the intervention package (for example, context specific ways to enhance physical activity and to reduce prolonged sitting time, ways to improve diet etc.

) and feedback on the intervention strategies (lifestyle education, care and linkage coordination).

 Then a randomized controlled trial involving ~700 families and 1400 participants will be used to determine whether an integrated care model is effective in reducing or halting the progression of CHD risk factors and risk factor clustering in families.

 The sustainability and scalability of this intervention will be assessed through economic and qualitative lenses to estimate value and acceptability.

 Scalability will be informed by cost-effectiveness and acceptability of the integrated cardiovascular risk reduction approach.
