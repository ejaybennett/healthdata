(firstQuint)CALYPSO Pilot Study: Machine Learning Based Predictions of Surgical Complications.

 CALYPSO is a software platform that uses machine learning techniques to create personalized risk predictions for postoperative complications.

 Individual risk factors are then linked to best-practice interventions tailored to the individual patient.

 The investigator aims to test the hypothesis that using CALYPSO-augmented postoperative care will reduce complication rates in patients undergoing elective general surgery.

 Subjects undergoing surgery will be assigned to the CALYPSO intervention in the postoperative period.
