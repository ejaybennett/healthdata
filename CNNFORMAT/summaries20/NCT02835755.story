(thirdQuint)Mobile Health Intervention in Increasing HPV Vaccine Coverage Among Young Adult Gay and Bisexual Men.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Pilot test a mobile health (mHealth) HPV vaccine intervention for young gay and bisexual men to establish feasibility and acceptability.

 II.

 Obtain preliminary efficacy data on whether the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention increases HPV vaccine initiation compared to the control group.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Examine whether the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention affects secondary outcomes compared to the control group.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

 GROUP I (CONTROL): Patients receive standard information about HPV and HPV vaccine, such as the vaccine information statement (VIS), on a mobile-friendly website study portal.

 GROUP II (INTERVENTION): Patients receive the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention consisting of content about HPV and HPV vaccine on the study portal for 15 minutes and vaccination reminders sent by the portal via text or e-mail.

 All patients complete a survey on the study portal at baseline, immediately after the mHealth intervention or control materials, and at 3 months and 7 months thereafter for about 10-15 minutes each.

 Mobile Health Intervention in Increasing HPV Vaccine Coverage Among Young Adult Gay and Bisexual Men@highlight

This pilot trial studies how well a mobile health (mHealth) human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine intervention works in increasing HPV vaccine coverage among young adult gay and bisexual men.

 Giving young men information about the HPV vaccine and the importance of vaccination may encourage them to get the HPV vaccine.
