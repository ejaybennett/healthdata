(thirdQuint)Clinical and Radiological Effect Of Platelet Rich Fibrin on the Healing of Periodontal Intrabony Periodontal Defects.

 Anorganic bovine bone mineral (ABBM) is extensively used in the treatment of intrabony defects.

 Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) is a new generation platelet concentrate with a simplified technique.

 Although there are some studies on the use of PRF in the treatment of intrabony defects, to date none of them evaluate its additive effects with ABBM.

 Therefore, a randomized, split mouth clinical trial was conducted to compare the healing of intrabony defects treated with a PRF/ABBM combination and to those obtained with ABBM alone.

 Using a split mouth design, 15 paired intrabony defects were randomly treated with either ABBM alone (control group) or with ABBM- PRF combination (test group).

 The following clinical parameters and radiographic measurements were recorded at baseline and six months postoperatively: plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), clinical attachment level (CAL), vertical bone loss, the depth of the defect and defect angle.

The aim of this split mouth, single-center, controlled study is to compare the healing of intrabony defects treated with a combination of Anorganic Bovine Bone Mineral (ABBM)/Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) or Anorganic Bovine Bone Mineral alone.

 The hypothesis being tested in the study was that PRF would augment the regenerative effects of ABBM in human intrabony defects.
