(secondQuint)Celsius TCS Hyperthermia System PMCF Trial.

 During this PMCF Trial from each participating center the internal data of all Celsius TCS Hyperthermia devices are collected.

 The participating centers are obligated to report any device-related failure and Adverse Event (injury to the patient).

 The center reports together with the device-internal data allows to calculate the failure and the complication rates.

 It will be analyzed regarding the kind of tumor and the concomitant treatment (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy).

 The outcome groups (with/without failure or complication) will be analyzed regarding demographic and treatment parameters.
