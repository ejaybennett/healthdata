(fifthQuint)Phase 3 Clinical Trial: D-methionine to Reduce Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL).

 Hearing loss can render a soldier less able to detect and identify the enemy, less able to understand commands, particularly in background noise typical on the battlefield, and may permanently reduce quality of life.

 In some cases, hearing loss may preclude redeployment or result in less optimal job assignment.

 Currently, no FDA approved pharmacological prevention exists for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).

 We have documented in animal studies that administration of D-methionine (D-met) can reduce or prevent NIHL.

 We now need to determine if it has similar efficacy in humans.

 Although we have not yet tested D-met on protection from noise-induced tinnitus in animals, this clinical trial would provide us the opportunity to also test for protection from noise induced tinnitus simultaneously.

 Objective Hypotheses: Primary Hypothesis: Administration of oral D-methionine prior to, during and 4 days post-weapons training will reduce or prevent permanent noise-induced hearing loss.

 Secondary Hypothesis: Administration of oral D-methionine prior to, during and 4 days post-weapons training will reduce or prevent noise-induced tinnitus.

 Specific Aims: To determine whether administering oral D-met can prevent permanent NIHL after weapons training.

 This aim will be addressed by comparing the results of D-met versus placebo administration starting 3 days prior to, during the 11 day period of weapons training (Monday-Friday for first week, Monday-Thursday for second week), and 4 days after for a total of 18 days.

 Pure tone hearing thresholds will be assessed before and 22 days after completion of weapons training (ie; 18 days after the last day of study drug/placebo administration).

 To determine whether administering oral D-met can prevent tinnitus after weapons training.

 This aim will be addressed by comparing the results of D-met versus placebo administration starting 3 days prior to, during the 11 day period of weapons training (Monday-Friday for first week, Monday-Thursday for second week), and 4 days after for a total of 18 days.

 Tinnitus questionnaires will be assessed before and 22 days after completion of weapons training (ie; 18 days after the last day of study drug/placebo administration).

 To monitor for any potential side effects of D-met in human subjects.

 This aim will be accomplished by subject query on each day study drug is dispensed (twice daily) and at final study visit, routing of any adverse event reports to study medical personnel, statisticians and to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

 Phase 3 Clinical Trial: D-methionine to Reduce Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL)@highlight

This prospective study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of oral D-methionine (D-met) to reduce noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus.

 The goal of the study is to develop a safe, oral pharmacological agent to augment physical hearing protectors for noise exposures that exceed the protective capabilities of ear plugs and/or muffs.

 The study population is a cohort of Drill Sergeant (DS) instructor trainees during and 22 days after their 11 day weapons training.

 The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of D-met in preventing NIHL or reducing tinnitus secondary to a minimum of 500 rounds of M-16 weapons training occurring over an 11 day period.
