(fifthQuint)Toxicity and Outcome of Whole Breast Hypofractionated Radiotherapy: a Single Institution Experience.

 The study is observational, homogeneous (performed in a single institution), non-interventional, and has two parts: one retrospective and one prospective (for which we ask the registration in the register of clinical trials).

 The patients with breast cancer treated with adjuvant hypofractionated radiotherapy at the Department of Radiotherapy of "San Raffaele Scientific Institute" (IRCCSSRaffaele) between January 2009 and June 2016 will be identified and their clinical and dosimetric data retrieved and analyzed.

 The objectives of the retrospective arm of the study are the analysis with a follow up of 5 years of acute and late toxicity, and clinical outcomes, such as local and regional control, overall survival, disease free survival, cancer-specific survival.

 A secondary objective is the identification of prognostic factors for toxicity and for the disease progression.

 The objective of the prospective arm of the study, for a number of 500 consecutive patients who agree to participate to the study, is to assess the quality of life of the patients treated with hypofractionated short course (3 weeks) radiotherapy.

 The quality of life questionnaires (QLQ) of European organization for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC), general, QLQ-C30 and, specific for the breast (BR), QLQ-BR23, will be distributed before the radiation treatment, enrollment of the patient, at the end of therapy and during the follow up visits, for a duration of 5 years after the first follow up, scheduled at 6 months and then yearly.

 Being an observational non-interventional study, the follow up program of the patients with breast cancer, treated according the standard departmental protocol, will not be modified.

 The patients will be identified from the patients data base, from the medical records retrieved from the archive of radiotherapy, or alternatively the electronic archive, the pictures monitorising the local evolution from the photo archive.

 The data will be extracted from medical records.

 In addition, the dosimetric data of the treatments will be recovered from the physical dosimetric Archives and the extrapolated data related to clinical and toxicity outcomes.

 For the patients of the prospective observational arm, the dosimetric data and quality of life questionnaires, asa well as the results of follow up visits will be prospectively collected and registered in a data base, and subsequently analyzed.

 The toxicity registered during the visits carried out during the treatment will be determined using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scale, and during the follow up visits using the Scoring system of late effects of radiations on normal tissues (SOMA-LENT scale).

 The clinical point analyzed will be: quality of life, overall survival, disease free-, cancer specific-survival, local and regional control, distant metastases free survival, acute and late toxicity, physical dosimetry and aesthetic results.

 The detected parameters will be correlated between them, for the identification of prognostic factors.

 Statistical analyzes will be performed with SPSS software version 17.

 Toxicity and Outcome of Whole Breast Hypofractionated Radiotherapy: a Single Institution Experience@highlight

This is an homogeneous, single institution, observational, non -interventional, prospective study of 500 patients who will be treated according to the standard protocol of adjuvant hypofractionated radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery, with forward-planned intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to a total dose of 40 Gy/ 15 fr (5 fr/ week, 3 consecutive weeks).

 In addition to the regular follow up, the patients will have to respond to the quality of life questionnaires (QLQ) of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), general, QLQ- C30, and specific for breast (BR), QLQ- BR23, at the first visit, at the end of radiotherapy ant then at the subsequent follow-up visits form 6 months up to 5 years and a half, to evaluate the quality of life during and after the treatment.

 The study has also a retrospective arm, the evaluation of disease control and toxicity results in approximately 1300 patients treated from January 2009, when the hypofractionated radiotherapy has been adopted as a standard after breast conserving radiotherapy, up to 2016.
