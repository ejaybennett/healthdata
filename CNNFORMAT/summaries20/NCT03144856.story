(firstQuint)Apatinib as Second Line Therapy in Patients With Advanced Refractory Biliary Tract Cancers.

 Biliary tract cancers (BTC) includes cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma (GBC).

 The systematic treatment based on gemcitabine plus cisplatin is recommended as the current standard chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic BTC.

 There is no standard recommendation for second line therapy.

 Apatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2(VEGFR-2).

 This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of Apatinib in patients with advanced refractory BTC who had received first-line chemotherapy.
