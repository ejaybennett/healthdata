 The patients were randomly allocated in three groups according the following treatments: - Group 1: Closure of the socket by primary intention through a palatal pedicle subepithelial connective tissue flap by the technique of Khoury & Happe (2000) (Figure 1); - Group 2: Filling the socket with a synthetic bone substitute of biphasic calcium phosphate (Bone Ceramic(R), Straumann) and covering it with a palatal pedicle flap by the technique of Khoury & Happe (2000) (Figure 2); - Group 3: Sealing of the socket with a provisional ovoid pontic of acrylic resin (Figure 3).

 As response factors were performed evaluations of study casts and tomographic analysis for dimensional stability evaluation of the sockets at immediate postoperative and after four months of the surgical procedures.
