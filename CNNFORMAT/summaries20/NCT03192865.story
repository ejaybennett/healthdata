(firstQuint)Diaphragmatic Paralysis in Arthroscopic Shoulder Surgery.

 This prospective observational study will screen patients with body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m undergoing acromioplasty or supraspinatus tendon repair.

 Occurrence of post-operative hemidiaphragmatic paralysis will be observed using M-mode ultrasonography and its consequences on patient ventilation: arterial oxygen saturation, dyspnea, success of ambulatory procedure.

 Causes of diaphragmatic paralysis will be analyzed.
