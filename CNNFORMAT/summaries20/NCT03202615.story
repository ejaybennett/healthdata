(fifthQuint)Bovine Lactoferrin Versus Ferrous Sulphate In The Treatment Of Iron Deficiency Anemia During Pregnancy.

 The study will includes130 pregnant women, from the outpatient clinics in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, in Ain Shams University Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.

 Women should be diagnosed as having iron deficiency anemia, in the 2nd trimester (complete blood count, showing microcytic hypochromic anemia, hemoglobin range from 9-10.

5, serum ferritin less than 12 ng/ml).

 Women will be enrolled and distributed into one of 2 groups by a computer generated random number table.

 Each of the 2 groups will receive 2 medication for 2 months with specific instruction to increase iron absorption.

 One group named L will receive powders of bovine lactoferrin and tablets of placebo form, the 2nd named F will receive ferrous sulphate tablet and placebo in powder form.

 Hemoglobin concentration, PCV, MCV, MCH, MCHC, Serum ferritin will be done at the start and the end of the treatment period.
