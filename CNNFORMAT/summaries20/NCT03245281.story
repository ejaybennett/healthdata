(thirdQuint)LINQ for impEdance meAsuremeNt While Off From HF Medication Study.

 Up to 30 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of Heart Failure will be enrolled in the study.

 It is expected that the subjects will be enrolled over a period of approximately 6 months.

 3 follow up visits are planned at 2, 4 and 6 months (+/- one week) following the LINQ ICM implant.

 The total expected duration of the study is of about 1 year.

 According to the enrolment chronological order, each subject will be allocated to Diuretic Suspension group (DS), Diuretic Increase (DI) or Diuretic+MRA medication Suspension (DMS), which will define the medication regimen before the follow-up visit.

 Primary objective of the study is detecting the variation of impedance magnitude and the time of occurrence after medication regimen changes will be evaluated at each follow-up.

The purpose of this non-randomized, cross-over, unblinded, single-center feasibility study is to assess the sensitivity of the LINQ ICM to measure derived-subcutaneous impedance in patients with heart failure during periods when diuretics and/or HF-medication consumption is increased or suspended for 48 hours (up to 72 hours at physician discretion) and to collect safety information related to HF status and to medication consumption changes.
