(firstQuint)Ruptured Aneurysms Treated With Hydrogel Coils.

 RAGE is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, post-market study.

 The RAGE study is designed to determine the safety and occlusion rates of hydrogel coils in the ruptured aneurysm study population.

 Secondary objectives include determining clinical outcomes, packing density, occlusion stability, rates of recurrence, rebleed, retreatment, and adverse events.
