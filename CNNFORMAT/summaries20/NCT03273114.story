(fifthQuint)Cognitive Functional Therapy (CFT) Compared With Core Training Exercise and Manual Therapy (CORE-MT) in Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain.

 Randomized controlled trial with concealed allocation, blinded assessor, blinded participants and intention to treat analysis.

 Patients will be evaluated at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 and 12 months after randomization, to assess the maintenance of any effect of treatment.

 The patients in the CFT group will be treated by a physical therapists that attended twice the CFT workshops with two of the tutors of the method.

 She completed 106 hours of training including workshops, patient examinations and a pilot study with the supervision of a physical therapist with more than three years of clinical experience in CFT.

 Patients in CORE-MT group will be treated by a physical therapist with clinical experience in manual therapy and core training exercises.

 Cognitive Functional Therapy (CFT) Compared With Core Training Exercise and Manual Therapy (CORE-MT) in Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain@highlight

There is evidence, of a single randomized controlled trial, that CFT is better than combined manual therapy and motor control exercise for chronic low back pain.

 However, this study had significant methodological shortcomings regarding the failure to carry out the intention to treat analysis and a considerable loss of follow-up of patients.

 As it is, it is important to carry out more studies involving CFT compared to other interventions already used in clinical practice and to correct these methodological shortcomings.

 Therefore, the aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of Cognitive Functional Therapy in patients with chronic non specific low back pain.
