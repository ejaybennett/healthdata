(thirdQuint)Saturated Fatty Acids Intake and Mortality, Diabetes, Hypertension and Overweight.

 The role of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) intake in the development of total death, diabetes, hypertension and overweight are in great controversy but evidence from large population in China is lacking.

The investigators aim to utilize the data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey.

 The investigators will calculate the cumulative average intake of SFAs based on 3 consecutive 24-h dietary recalls in each round.

Sex-specific Cox regression models will be used to estimate the relative risk.

Results from our work will be used to provide epidemiological evidence for improving recommendation on SFAs intake for Chinese in dietary guidelines.

 Saturated Fatty Acids Intake and Mortality, Diabetes, Hypertension and Overweight@highlight

The role of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) intake in the development of total death, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and overweight are in great controversy but evidence from large population in China is scant.

The investigators aim to use the data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey to assess the long-term association of SFAs intake with total mortality, diabetes, hypertension and overweight.
