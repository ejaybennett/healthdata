(fifthQuint)Study of a Transdiagnostic, Emotion-focused Group Intervention for Young Adults With Substance Use Disorders.

 Young adults with substance use disorder (SUD) commonly experience co-occurring emotional distress in the form of affective/emotional disorders (i.

e.

 anxiety, depressive, and related disorders) and self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs).

 Based on the conceptualization of emotion dysregulation as a transdiagnostic treatment target, the current study utilizes the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) to target core psychopathological processes related to emotion dysregulation that underlie SITBs and emotional disorder pathology.

 Given its transdiagnostic format, the UP has the potential to address comorbidity among the emotional disorders (and other functionally similar problems such as SUDs) simultaneously and more comprehensively than single-diagnosis treatments.

 Patients seeking services or currently engaged in care at an existing comprehensive outpatient program for adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders (the MGH Addiction Recovery Management Service) are eligible for this study.

 Participants will be randomized to receive either UP + TAU or TAU alone.

 The adjunctive UP intervention consists of 16 twice-weekly group sessions (delivered over an 8-week period) designed to deliver transdiagnostic, emotion-focused CBT strategies.

 Study of a Transdiagnostic, Emotion-focused Group Intervention for Young Adults With Substance Use Disorders@highlight

The overall aim of this pilot study is to conduct a preliminary trial to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of adding a transdiagnostic, emotion-focused group intervention (the Unified Protocol, UP) to treatment as usual (TAU) in a comprehensive outpatient program for adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and emotional distress.

 Only patients seeking services or engaged in care at an existing outpatient program at MGH (the Addiction Recovery Management Service) are eligible for participation.
