(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of 4th Generation Safety-engineered CAR T Cells Targeting Sarcomas.

 Patients with late staged and/or recurrent sarcoma have poor prognosis despite complex multimodal therapy.

 Therefore, novel curative approaches are needed.

This study will combine two different ways to fight sarcoma: antibodies and CAR-T cells.

 Several immune checkpoint antibodies have been examined on various tumors with good outcomes.

 Sarcoma is known to express increased levels of surface antigens that can be targeted by CAR-T cells.

 Thus, in this study, the 4SCAR-IgT cells targeting sarcoma surface antigens will be infused in dose escalation cohorts.

This study will assess the feasibility, safety, efficacy and side effects of CAR T cells immunotherapy in patients who have sarcoma that is relapsed or late staged.

 Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of 4th Generation Safety-engineered CAR T Cells Targeting Sarcomas@highlight

The aim of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of CAR T cells immunotherapy in patients who have sarcoma that is relapsed or late staged.

 Another goal of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the therapy that combines CAR T cells and IgT cells to treat sarcoma.
