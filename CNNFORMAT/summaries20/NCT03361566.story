(firstQuint)Short-term Regulation of Energy and Macronutrient Balance: Impact of Energy Flux.

 A low energy flux is achieved by low energy expenditure, equivalent to low physical activity and with a corresponding low energy intake.

 A high energy flux is achieved by high energy expenditure, equivalent to high physical activity and with a corresponding high energy intake, respectively.

 The protocol of this randomized, intra-individual nutrition intervention includes 12 one-day interventions with 3 different levels of energy flux and 4 different diet conditions.

 Short-term Regulation of Energy and Macronutrient Balance: Impact of Energy Flux@highlight

Aim of the study is to investigate the impact of energy flux (achieved by changes in physical activity) under the conditions of energy balance, caloric restriction and overfeeding in healthy subjects.
