(fifthQuint)Biomedical Investigations for Optimized Diagnosis and Monitoring of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM): Elucidating the Heterogeneous Diagnosis of SAM by Current Anthropometric Criteria and Moving Beyond.

 DIAGNOSTIC DISCREPANCY According to WHO experts, WHZ and MUAC can be used independently to indicate severe acute malnutrition (WH.

 There is however a significant and sometimes huge discrepancy between these two criteria: they do not usually identify the same children as acutely malnourished; moreover when used as proxy indicator to assess a deteriorating nutritional situation at a population level, these criteria do not report the same level of global acute malnutrition in the same zone.

 It was reported that only about 40% of SAM cases identified by one indicator are also diagnosed as such by the other.

 For example, among severely malnourished children hospitalized in rural Kenya, 65.

1% (486/746) of the WHZ -3 cases also had a MUAC 115mm.

 Many benefits of using MUAC exist: MUAC is predictive of death, easy to use, acceptable, and favors community-based screening methods.

 Yet, as these two anthropometric tools select different children for treatment, as outlined above, this complicates the programmatic paradigm shift from admitting children using MUAC 115mm, i.

e.

 only with WHZ 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP).

 CRP, AGP, as well as biomarkers of iron (serum ferritin and serum transferrin receptor) and vitamin A status (serum retinol binding protein) can be assessed in a few drops of capillary blood.

 CRP and AGP will be used to adjust for the effect of inflammation on the micronutrient status indicators.

 Inflammation is indeed known to elevate serum ferritin and depress retinol binding protein as part of the biological acute phase response to inflammation.

 URINE TESTS The presence of ketones in the urine, indicating lipid catabolism (fat tissue disintegration and rapid weight loss) was evidenced during fasting and SAM.

 Metabolic status for SAM children at the time of enrollment in CMAM has been characterized by ketonemia; yet, lipolysis decreases in response to nutritional rehabilitation suggested by total ketones.

 Moreover, biomarkers of urinary infections like urinary nitrites and urinary leucocyte esterase (LE) have also been shown to be associated with an increased mortality risk in SAM children.

 Positive dipstick urinalysis administered as a bedside screening test for either nitrates or LE is associated with a higher case fatality and was shown to be a strong predictor of mortality in children admitted with SAM.

 Non-sterile urine sample will be also carried out when possible, and these biological parameters will be measured using through the urinary multiple indicator strips (e.

g.

 Roche laboratory, or Combi Screen of Analyticon).

 BIOELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE (BI) It has been suggested that different anthropometric diagnoses identify children with different body composition, and associated nutritional needs.

 Restoration of body composition indicates successful management of SAM.

 Bioelectral impedance (BI) is a safe, rapid and easy technique often used to assess body composition, predicting total body water (TBW) in non-edematous children.

 It has demonstrated utility for indexing acute changes in hydration in children with SAM during in-patient treatment.

 This technique could also potentially distinguish tissue versus hydration relates weight catch-up during or post treatment.

 Lastly, BI analysis may predict survival outcomes for children hospitalized for SAM.

 BI parameters will therefore be used to describe body composition at admission and the restoration of body composition throughout nutritional recovery.

 METHODS STUDY DESIGN This study consists of three prospective follow-up studies (Bangladesh, Burkina Faso and Liberia) including cohorts of SAM children between 6 and 59 months of age.

 Children will be recruited according to the current WHO recommended anthropometric criteria for SAM diagnosis, WHZ and MUAC.

 Clinical examination, interviews with caregivers and blood and hair samples will be collected at admission and follow-up.

 Prospective follow-up cohort studies will be nested into currently operational Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programs run with the technical support of ACF-France, in hospitals and primary health-care centers involved in SAM management.

 All participants will be treated according to the standard of care outlined in the national protocol for SAM management of the country; this included a medical examination and standard treatment for infections as well as hospital referral for any complications requiring medical attention.

 The follow-up duration for enrolled SAM cases will be three months at minimum.

 Each individual cohort study will last approximately one year.

 This study design is multi-centric, and will be conducted in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso and Indonesia to account for potential contextual variation in the link between anthropometry and nutritional status.

 The various biomarkers assessed in this study, alongside anthropometry and clinical characteristics, at admission and follow-up times, can be grouped into the following three main groups: 1.

 Biomarkers of micronutrient deficiencies: (1) iron status biomarkers like serum ferritin and serum transferrin receptor; (2) vitamin A status biomarkers like retinol binding protein; and (3) vitamin C in the urine.

 2.

 Biomarkers and indicators of body composition and energy metabolism: (1) urinary ketones; (2) natural enrichment of nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes in hair; and (3) circulating leptin and IL-6.

 3.

 Biomarkers of non-specific immune response or urinary infections: (1) c-reactive protein level; (2) urinary nitrites; and (3) urinary leucocytes esterase.

 QUESTIONNAIRES Data collection sheets, hereafter referred to as case report forms (CRF) will be linked to the patient's information by his or her unique study ID number.

 All data will be collected by trained ACF research staff.

 A baseline questionnaire will be administered upon admission by means of a structured interview with the caregiver.

 The interview content includes socioeconomic indicators, family size, income, expenditure as well as the medical history of the child (including changes in the child's weight, quantity and quality of food consumed and global health status).

 This questionnaire will include changes in the child's weight, quantity and quality of food consumed and overall health status.

 At each weekly visit, caregivers will answer a morbidity questionnaire (regarding fever, diarrhea, respiratory infection, and appetite) over the past week.

 Additionally, the caregiver will be asked to score the child's health status using a visual analog scale (VAS), table 4 the VAS is a psychometric response scale used in questionnaires to measure subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot otherwise be directly measured ("Visual Analog Scale," 2015).

 The use of a VAS in the assessment of severity of illness has been shown to be a strong predictor of mortality.

 These data will be compared to the patient's nutritional progress to assess the relationship between maternal health perception and nutritional indicators of recovery.

 Additional questions will probe adherence to treatment ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) on a weekly basis.

 ANTHROPOMETRY Weight, height, MUAC, edema, will be measured weekly in all children.

 Weight will be measured to the nearest 0.

1 kg with an electronic SECA scale, which will allow for simultaneous weighing of caregiver and patient.

 A standard weight of 5-10 kg will be used for daily calibration of the scale, and it will be stabilized on wooden plank to ensure the scale stays in a horizontal position.

 Length and height will be measured to the nearest 0.

1 cm with a UNICEF model wooden height board with graduated index strips in millimeters on each side.

 A standardized length stick will be used to check the accuracy of the equipment.

 Children less than 2 years of age will be measured lying down and older children will be measured standing up.

 In case the age cannot be verified, children less than 87cm will be measured lying down.

 Children above 2 years of age, or above 87 cm who are not able to stand, will be measured lying, and 0.

7 cm will be subtracted the recumbent length during data analysis.

 MUAC will be measured with a non-stretchable MUAC tape on the left arm to the nearest millimeter.

 Anthropometry will be measured and recorded twice.

 Measurements will be repeated by the same person and directly after each other to minimize discomfort for the child.

 The measurer will read out loud his measurement, which will then be repeated by the assistant who will record the results.

 In case of large differences between the measurements, the procedure will be repeated.

 All measuring tools will be calibrated and checked daily for accuracy and replaced if needed.

 To quantify the inter-measurer error, as part of training and refresher training programs, anthropometry measurements will be repeated by a second person.

 This procedure will be done on a small sample of children and will take place at the beginning, mid-way and end of the trial.

 CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND EDEMA Presence of bilateral pitting edema of nutritional origin will be assessed by applying normal thumb pressure on the tops of both feet for three seconds.

 In the presence of edema (a remnant impression remains for some time, where the fluid has been temporarily pressed out of the tissue) the same procedure will be repeated on the lower legs, hands.

 Generalized, severe edema can be observed sacral pad and face (forehead, eyelids).

 The degree of edema generalization will be recorded according to WHO categorization of edema severity outlined in the guidelines for the management of severe acute malnutrition in children 6 to 59 months of age with edema, presented in table 5.

 The nurse will conduct a weekly clinical assessment of the child (i.

e.

 temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate, diarrhea, vomiting, and malaria).

 Symptoms, diagnosis and treatments prescribed will be recorded.

 The clinical assessment will also serve to monitor the development of medical complications requiring inpatient care.

 Any serious adverse effects or development of medical complications will be immediately reported to the study supervisor and the child will be referred for inpatient treatment if necessary.

 BLOOD SAMPLES AND ANALYSES Since no laboratory in the study area performs all the desired analyses required, the samples must be exported for analysis.

 A serum sample of 0.

5 mL of serum from baseline and at two weeks and two months after nutritional rehabilitation will be sent to Dr.

 Juergen Ehardt at VitMin Laboratory in Wilstaett, Germany for the following analyses: - C-reactive protein (CRP), - a1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), - Serum ferritin - Retinol Binding Protein (RBP) - Soluble Transferrin Receptor (sTfR).

 A duplicate serum sample will be kept in the event that the first sample is lost or destroyed during transport.

 Serum RBP will be used to assess vitamin A status.

 Serum ferritin and sTfR will be used to assess iron status.

 Additionally, the two acute phase reactants, CRP and AGP, will be measured and used to adjust for the effect of inflammation on the micronutrient status indicators.

 These five proteins will be measured using a specialized ELISA kit which analyses all five components simultaneously.

 HAIR SAMPLES AND ANALYSES A single lock of 20 - 25 hair follicles will be shaved at the back of the skull at admission and throughout treatment to both retrospectively characterize the nature and magnitude of metabolic deficits at admission; and also the efficacy of treatment in correcting them.

 Hair samples will be sent to Dr.

 Jean-Francois Huneau and Dr.

 Helene Fouillet at the Human Biology and Nutrition Laboratory at AgroParisTech in Paris, France.

 Hair samples will be sub-sectioned into 2.

5 mm samples and analyzed for d13C and d15N through EA-IRM analysis.

 URINE SAMPLES AND ANALYSES Freshly voided, clean catch urine samples will be tested using reagent test strips (e.

g.

 Multistix) at admission and at the end of treatment to assess biomarkers of urinary infections, urinary nitrites and urinary LE.

 BIOELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE BI parameters will be measures using a NutriGuard-S (DataInput, Germany) using protocols described elsewhere.

 Self-adhesive disposable electrodes will be attached to the right hand and foot.

 Measurements will be taken in triplicate, each spaced 5 minutes apart, while children are supine with limbs abducted from the body.

 DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS DATA MANAGEMENT All questionnaire data and measurements will be measured on paper print-outs.

 The field supervisor will digitize, back-up and share data with the project coordinator at least weekly.

 Appropriate consistency checks and completeness rules will be applied to all data templates.

 Anthropometric measurements will be standardized using the ENA SMART software standardization tools; additionally, regular supervision and refresher training workshops will be organized to maintain the highest quality data.

 In addition to a digital database, paper forms including the date, the patient's and caregiver's name, study ID, age, length and height at admission will be produced at enrollment.

 These forms will be kept at each health center and new anthropometric values will be added at each visit to track the child's health progress.

 Field tables for anthropometric conversion to z-scores will be available at all health centers.

 To maximize the follow-up rate, all participants will be registered in a digital logbook (for example using Epidata) where each visit will be registered with the date of attendance.

 Weekly lists of expected participants will be produced and printed for reminder calls.

 Participants who do not show up at the health center will be contacted per telephone, and if not successful, a team of community health workers will try to trace the family at the home address and encourage them to go to the health center for continuation of the treatment.

 DATA ANALYSIS All data will be analyzed using STATA Data Analysis and Statistical Software version 13 (StataCorp, College Station; Lakeway, Texas, U.

 Biomedical Investigations for Optimized Diagnosis and Monitoring of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM): Elucidating the Heterogeneous Diagnosis of SAM by Current Anthropometric Criteria and Moving Beyond@highlight

INTRODUCTION In 2014, 50 million children under 5 suffered from acute malnutrition, of which 16 million suffered from SAM, most of them living in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.

 SAM children have higher risk of mortality (relative risk between 5 and 20).

 It is an underlying factor in over 50% of the 10 - 11 million preventable deaths per year among children under five.

 At present, 65 countries have implemented WHO recommendations for SAM treatment (both in-patient for complicated cases and outpatient for uncomplicated cases) but these programs have very low coverage, reaching only around 10 - 15 % of SAM children.

 In 2009 the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) issued a joint statement in an effort to harmonize the application of anthropometric criteria for SAM diagnosis and monitoring in child aged 6 - 59 months; the statement presents recommended cut-offs, and summarizes the rational for the adoption, of the following two anthropometric criteria: 1.

 Weight-for-Height Z-Score (WHZ): "WHO and UNICEF recommend the use of a cut-off for weight-for-height of below -3 standard deviations (SD) of the WHO standards to identify infants and children as having SAM.

" Additionally, analysis of existing data show that children with a WHZ < -3 have a highly elevated risk of death.

 2.

 Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC): "WHO standards for the MUAC-for-age show that in a well-nourished population there are very few children aged 6 - 59 months with a MUAC less than 115 mm.

 Children with a MUAC less than 115 mm have a highly elevated risk of death compared to those who are above.

 Thus it is recommended to [use] the cut-off point [of] 115 mm to define SAM with MUAC.

" GENERAL OBJECTIVE To generate new evidence on pathophysiological process, nutritional needs and risks associated with different types of anthropometric deficits in children under 5, in order to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of SAM.

 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES - To compare nutritional status, metabolism, pathophysiological process and risks in different types of SAM anthropometric diagnosis, with or without concomitant stunting (growth retardation).

 - To analyze the extent to which current SAM treatment is promoting recovery and healthy growth in different categories of children.

 - To evaluate the relevance of current discharge criteria used in nutrition programs and their association with metabolic recovery, in different age groups and among those who are stunted.

 - To test novel rapid tests of emerging biomarkers predicting long-term outcomes and mortality risk in the field.

 METHODOLOGY A wide range of supplementary information related to nutritional status, body composition, metabolic and immune status, including emerging biomarkers of metabolic deprivation and vulnerability, will be collected besides anthropometry during prospective observational studies.

 They will be collected with minimum level of invasiveness, compatible with field work requirements in the humanitarian context.

 Phase 1: Cross-sectional surveys.

 Phase 2: Prospective cohort studies involving SAM children between 6 months and 5 years old.

 Children admitted as SAM at the nutrition centers will be enrolled into the cohort.

 The follow up duration will be at least three months.

 EXPECTED OUTCOMES - Confirmation of current hypotheses related to: 1.

 possible misdiagnosis of SAM made by MUAC or WHZ criteria, 2.

 varying degree of severity and need for admission to treatment of the different types of diagnosis, 3.

 underlying heterogeneity of the pathophysiology.

 - Generation of new algorithms for the assessment and classification of malnourished children, based on the combined use of emerging biomarkers and anthropometric measures, or on the modification of anthropometric criteria.

 - Generation of new treatment paradigms based on the predictive value of biomarkers in combination with traditional anthropometric measures.

 This will enable us to assess the power of current treatment regimens to promote long-term weight gain and growth and will allow us to tailor treatment to the physiological needs of the child.
