(secondQuint)A Study of ABTL0812 in Pancreatic Cancer.

 This is an open-label, non-randomized phase I/II multicenter study to evaluate ABTL0812 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel at first line therapy and as maintenance therapy after chemotherapy.

 Patients will be assigned to the following groups during the study conduct: Phase I: A 3+3 de-escalation design followed by an expansion phase will be performed - ABTL0812 will be administered chronically daily.

 Potential dose levels are 1300 mg tid, 1000 mg tid, 650 mg tid and 500 mg tid.

 Intrapatient escalation or de-escalation is not permitted.

 A run-in period of one week for ABTL0812 is planned before starting the first cycle of chemotherapy.

 - Chemotherapy will be administered on 28-day cycles: gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 + nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15.

 - If any, or all, the components of the chemotherapeutic regimen must be interrupted for any reason (excluding disease progression), ABTL0812 will be administered as maintenance therapy until disease progression, onset of unacceptable drug toxicities, or patient/physician's request to discontinue.

 Phase II: - ABTL0812 will be administered chronically daily at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).

 A run-in period of one week for ABTL0812 is planned before starting the first cycle of chemotherapy.

 - Chemotherapy will be administered on 28-day cycles: gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV + nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8 and 15 - If any, or all, the components of the chemotherapeutic regimen must be interrupted for any reason (excluding disease progression), ABTL0812 will be administered as maintenance therapy until disease progression, onset of unacceptable drug toxicities, or patient/physician's request to discontinue.
