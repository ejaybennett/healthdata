(thirdQuint)Vaginal Birth After Caesarean Section and Levator Ani Avulsion.

 Levator ani muscle avulsion is a frequent postpartum trauma imposing a considerable risk of pelvic organ prolapse on women in later life.

 Furthermore, the trauma reduces the effectiveness of pelvic reconstructive surgery and has a detrimental effect of the sexuality of the affected women.

 The trauma occurs most frequently in the first vaginal delivery with an incidence of 10-30%.

 However, the risk of levator avulsion in women after vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) is unknown although possible increased risk has been suggested.

 The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of levator ani avulsion among women who delivered vaginally after a caesarean section and make a comparison with a primiparous cohort.

 The secondary aim is to evaluate and compare the health related quality of life regarding pelvic floor disorders and sexuality.
