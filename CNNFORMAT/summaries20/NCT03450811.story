(fifthQuint)Effect of Inguinal Hernia Repair on Uroflowmetric Parameteres.

 Inguinal hernia repair is a common procedure performed in general surgery, with an annual rate of 28 per 100,000 of the population in the USA.

 The incidence of post operative inability voiding in males following open or laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair varies from 3 to 25%.

 Evaluating risk factors to reduce the occurence of this complications after one of the most commonly performed surgery by general surgeons could help reduce that high rate of that complication.

 Although some authors recommend prophylactic alpha blockers, there is no consensus on whether these can decrease rate of urinary retention or voiding dysfunction in male patients.

 In current study, investigators aimed to determinate the uroflowmetric parametric changes of patients after elective inguinal hernia repair.

 Effect of Inguinal Hernia Repair on Uroflowmetric Parameteres@highlight

Post operative acute urinary retension or voiding dysfunction are complications after inguinal hernia repair and they cause a great deal of discomfort and stress to patients.

 Furthermore, they can also increase hospital costs by increasing hospital stay, and by growing the need for outpatient appointments after an elective surgical procedure.

 Some studies recommend prophylactic alpha blockers to minimizing these adverse effects.
