(fifthQuint)Abdominal Closure Bundle to Reduce Surgical Site Infection in Patients Undergoing C-sections.

 Cesarean Section Lead to Reduction in Surgical Site Infection? - A Randomized Controlled Trial.

 All patients, aged 18 years or older, greater than 34 weeks of gestation who will be undergoing a scheduled cesarean section to be performed by Abington Primary Women's Health Care Group, Abington Ob/Gyn Associates, Womencare, Women's Health Care Group, Dr.

 Ron Hoffman, or the Ob/Gyn Chief Service will be considered for participation in this study.

 Scheduled cesarean sections include all routine cesarean sections- whether receiving spinal or general anesthesia, as well as patients who present to obstetrical triage in labor or with ruptured membranes who are for cesarean section.

 The following patients will be excluded from our study: - Unscheduled, STAT or urgent cesarean sections from the labor floor (failure to descend, failure to progress, non-reassuring fetal heart tracing, chorioamnionitis, placental abruption, prolapsed cord, etc.

) - SOAT (Surgical Operative Assist Team) cesarean sections - Gestational age 2cm, subcuticular skin closure, and removal of surgical bandage on post-operative day 2.

 The abdominal closure bundle includes changing of the surgical gown and gloves, repeat surgical scrub, and usage of new surgical instruments, light handles, suction, and bovie tip for closure of fascia, subcutaneous tissue, and skin.

 Given the nature of the intervention, the surgeon and patient will not be blinded to group assignment.

 Cesarean Section Lead to Reduction in Surgical Site Infection? - A Randomized Controlled Trial@highlight

This study is a single center, randomized controlled trial investigating the use of an abdominal closure bundle to reduce surgical site infection in patients undergoing cesarean section.

 The abdominal closure bundle consists of surgeon repeat scrub, changing gown and gloves, as well as usage of new instruments for closure of fascia, subcutaneous tissue, and skin.

 Patients will be randomized to either abdominal closure bundle or normal operative procedure.

 Primary outcome is surgical site infection within 30 days of procedure.
