(thirdQuint)Nobio Antimicrobial Particles Effect in a Split Mouth Model.

 An exploratory, comparative, self-controlled single blinded interventional study.

 Intended to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of Nobio particles incorporated within Novidia Dental Bonding and Flowable composite versus Filtek bond and flow composite within a split mouth model.

The study population (N=35) will be high risk population for cervical caries (with at least 2 carious cavities in the mouth) affected by uncontrolled plaque accumulation.

Each subject will serve in this model as his own control.

On one side the Novidia intervention will be made and on the contralateral side the Filtek intervention.
