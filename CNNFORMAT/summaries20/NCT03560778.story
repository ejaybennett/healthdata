(thirdQuint)Comparisons of Urodynamic, Bladder Diary, Quality of Life Parameters Between OAB-wet and OAB-dry Female Patients.

 Aims: To identify factors predicting the presence of OAB-wet and to further derive the underlying pathophysiology in OAB-wet vs.

 OAB-dry.

 Methods: Between September 2007 and September 2013, the medical records of women with OAB who completed a 3-day bladder diary and underwent urodynamic studies in a tertiary referral center will be reviewed.

 OAB-wet will be diagnosed in patients who complained of at least one episode of urgency incontinence in the previous month; otherwise, OAB-dry is diagnosed.

 Multivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to predict the presence of OAB-wet.

 Comparisons of Urodynamic, Bladder Diary, Quality of Life Parameters Between OAB-wet and OAB-dry Female Patients@highlight

A small bladder capacity and more frequent urgency episodes were predictors of OAB-wet, and the above findings might indicate that OAB-wet and OAB-dry are a continuum of OAB.

 Older age, high maximum flow rate, high detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate and the presence of urodynamic stress incontinence were also independent predictors for OAB-wet, and the above might indicate that OAB-wet and OAB-dry have at least partly different underlying pathophysiologies.
