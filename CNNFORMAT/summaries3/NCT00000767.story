(fifthQuint)A Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Recombinant Vaccinia-HIV-1 IIIB Env/Gag/Pol Vaccine (TBC-3B).

 Antigenic drift, defined as the genetic variation of the HIV-1 envelope gene that results in antigenic variation during natural infection, may confound attempts to achieve protective immunity using a vaccine based solely on HIV-1 envelope proteins.

 Inclusion of conserved core and polymerase proteins along with envelope protein in a candidate vaccine may address some of the problems with antigenic variability.

 A prime-boost immunization approach using a novel priming immunogen expressing env, gag, and pol genes of the HIV-1 IIIB strain will be attempted in this study.

 In Part I, vaccinia-immune volunteers are randomized to one of two regimens.

 Group A receives priming with TBC-3B on days 0 and 56, followed by boosting on day 224 (8 months) with one of the following: TBC-3B, an alternative immunogen such as pseudovirion particles or a recombinant HIV-1 subunit or peptide vaccine, or placebo.

 Group B receives priming with control vaccine (DryVax), followed by boosting with an appropriate placebo.

 At least 50 percent of subjects in Part I will be observed for a minimum of 8 weeks before subsequent volunteers are enrolled in Part II.

 PER 11/18/94 AMENDMENT, Part I boosting is given on day 392.

 PER 5/19/95 AMENDMENT, Part I boosting is given on day 756 if not available on day 392; if the appropriate product is not available then, the study will end on day 756.

 In Part II, vaccinia-naive volunteers are randomized to one of three regimens.

 Group C receives TBC-3B on day 0 and saline placebo on day 56.

 Group D receives TBC-3B on days 0 and 56.

 Both Group C and D receive boosting with TBC-3B or an alternative immunogen on day 224.

 Group E receives control vaccine (DryVax) on days 0 and 56, followed by appropriate placebo on day 224.

 Per 06/10/94 addendum, volunteers will be contacted once or twice per year for at least 5 years to check on health status.

 NOTE: Part I (Part A) of the protocol has closed to accrual.

 A Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Recombinant Vaccinia-HIV-1 IIIB Env/Gag/Pol Vaccine (TBC-3B)@highlight

To evaluate, in healthy HIV-1 seronegative vaccinia-immune and vaccinia-naive volunteers, the safety and immunogenicity of an HIV-1 candidate vaccine (TBC-3B) consisting of a live recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the env, gag, and pol genes of HIV-1 IIIB strain.

 To evaluate the potential of boosting with one of a variety of HIV-1 recombinant subunit, peptide, or pseudovirion vaccines, if available, to augment the immune responses of the vaccinees.

 Antigenic drift, defined as the genetic variation of the HIV-1 envelope gene that results in antigenic variation during natural infection, may confound attempts to achieve protective immunity using a vaccine based solely on HIV-1 envelope proteins.

 Inclusion of conserved core and polymerase proteins along with envelope protein in a candidate vaccine may address some of the problems with antigenic variability.

 A prime-boost immunization approach using a novel priming immunogen expressing env, gag, and pol genes of the HIV-1 IIIB strain will be attempted in this study.
