(thirdQuint)The Effects of Prednisone on HIV Levels and the Immune System.

 By inhibiting cellular activation, corticosteroids such as prednisone may inhibit HIV expression and reduce the population of potentially infectable cells.

 Furthermore, no studies have been performed to systematically evaluate immune function in prednisone-treated, HIV-infected patients or the immune mechanisms that may facilitate increases in CD4+ cell number.

 This study explores this issue.

 Patients are separated into 2 arms according to whether or not they are currently receiving a protease inhibitor (PI) as part of their antiretroviral (ARV) therapy regimen (PI vs no PI therapy).

 Arm I: Current stable ARV therapy plus prednisone for 8 weeks, followed by 4 weeks at half the prior dose, then a 2-week taper.

 Arm II: Current stable ARV therapy plus prednisone placebo for 12 weeks.

 The Effects of Prednisone on HIV Levels and the Immune System@highlight

The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give prednisone to HIV-infected patients.

 Prednisone is a corticosteroid, a hormone produced by the body that inhibits immune cell responses.

 Prednisone may be able to lower the level of HIV in the body (viral load) by reducing the number of cells that HIV can infect.

 At the same time, prednisone may be able to increase CD4 cell counts (cells of the immune system that fight infection).
