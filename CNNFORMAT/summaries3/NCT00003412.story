(thirdQuint)Interleukin-12 in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Received High-Dose Chemotherapy and Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the toxic effect profile and maximum tolerated dose of interleukin-12 (rhIL-12) in women with advanced breast cancer who have undergone high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue.

 II.

 Determine the effect of rhIL-12 on cellular and humoral immune systems following high dose chemotherapy.

 III.

 Explore the effect on treatment failure of rhIL-12 after high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of interleukin-12 (rhIL-12).

 RhIL-12 therapy begins 3-5 weeks after discharge from the chemotherapy/stem cell transplant hospitalization or 2-3 weeks after completion of posttransplant radiation.

 Patients receive rhIL-12 subcutaneously twice a week for 12 consecutive weeks.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at each dose level of rhIL-12.

 The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 2 months after treatment.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.

RATIONALE: Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill breast cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-12 in treating women with metastatic breast cancer who have received high-dose chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation.
