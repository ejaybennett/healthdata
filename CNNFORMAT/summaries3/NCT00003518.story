(thirdQuint)Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Refractory Metastatic Germ Cell Tumors.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the effect of gemcitabine plus paclitaxel on response rate, duration of remission, and survival in patients with refractory germ cell tumors.

 II.

 Evaluate the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 4 week course.

 Treatment is repeated for a maximum of six courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 44 patients will be accrued over 19 months for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in treating patients with refractory metastatic germ cell tumors that have not responded to surgery or chemotherapy.
