(thirdQuint)SR-45023A in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the maximum tolerated dose of SR-45023A in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

 II.

 Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of SR-45023A in these patients.

 III.

 Assess the plasma and urine pharmacokinetics of SR-45023A and relate these to drug effects, if possible, in these patients.

 IV.

 Determine any preliminary antitumor activity of SR-45023A in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

 Patients receive oral SR-45023A weekly.

 Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SR-45023A until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

 Patients are followed for up to 1 month.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of SR-45023A in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have not responded to previous treatment.
