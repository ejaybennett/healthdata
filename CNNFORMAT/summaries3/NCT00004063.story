(fifthQuint)Cisplatin, Gemcitabine, Interferon Alfa, and Hyperthermia in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity and tumor response in patients with metastatic, recurrent, or refractory malignancies treated with cisplatin, gemcitabine, interferon alfa, and long-duration, low temperature whole body hyperthermia (LL-WBH).

 OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of cisplatin.

 - Phase I and II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and 8.

 Patients receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 15, followed by subcutaneous interferon alfa on days 16 and 17.

 Patients undergo long-duration, low temperature whole body hyperthermia over 6 hours plus gemcitabine over 30 minutes on day 17.

 Courses repeat every 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 - Phase I: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cisplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

 The MTD of cisplatin is used for phase II study.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Cisplatin, Gemcitabine, Interferon Alfa, and Hyperthermia in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.

 Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above body temperature.

 Combining hyperthermia with chemotherapy and interferon alfa may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of cisplatin, gemcitabine, interferon alfa, and whole-body hyperthermia and how well they work in treating patients with metastatic, recurrent, or refractory cancer.
