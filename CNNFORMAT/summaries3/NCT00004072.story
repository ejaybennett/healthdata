(thirdQuint)O6-benzylguanine And Carmustine in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the efficacy of O6-benzylguanine combined with carmustine in patients with previously untreated or refractory multiple myeloma.

 - Assess the effects of O6-benzylguanine on bone marrow myeloma cells in this patient population.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 60 minutes followed 1 hour later by carmustine IV over 60 minutes.

 Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients receive 2 additional courses beyond attainment of best response (partial or complete response or stable or plateau disease).

 Patients are followed every 2 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining O6-benzylguanine with carmustine in treating patients who have previously untreated, refractory, or relapsing multiple myeloma.
