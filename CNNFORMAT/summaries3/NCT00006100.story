(thirdQuint)Allogeneic Epstein Barr Virus-Specific Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes in Treating Patients With Progressive, Relapsed, or Refractory Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity of allogeneic Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (EBV CTL) in patients with progressive, relapsed, or refractory EBV-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 - Detect alterations in the anti-EBV cellular immunity of patients treated with EBV CTL.

 OUTLINE: Donors undergo leukapheresis.

 Epstein Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (EBV CTL) are cultured in vitro.

 Patients receive an infusion of EBV CTL over 10 minutes on day 0.

 The EBV CTL infusion is preceded by 3 doses of fludarabine.

 Patients then receive interleukin-2 injections for 12 days after the EBV CTL infusion.

 Patients are followed weekly for 1.

5 months, twice a month for 1.

5 months, and then monthly for 3 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing.

 Donor white blood cells that are treated in the laboratory with Epstein-Barr virus may be effective treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T cells in treating patients who have progressive, relapsed, or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma.
