(thirdQuint)Radiofrequency Ablation in Treating Patients With Refractory or Advanced Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and toxicity of radiofrequency ablation in patients with refractory or advanced pulmonary malignancies.

 - Determine the efficacy of this treatment, in terms of local control, in these patients.

 - Determine whether CT scan is a reasonable imaging assessment tool for treatment delivery and follow-up in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation directly to the tumor over 2 hours.

 Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency electric current to kill tumor cells.

 CT-guided radiofrequency ablation may be effective treatment for lung cancer.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation in treating patients who have refractory or advanced lung cancer.
