(thirdQuint)Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Neurofibromatosis and Progressive Plexiform Neurofibromas.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effect of chronic vinblastine and methotrexate on time to disease progression in children or young adults with progressive plexiform neurofibroma associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.

 - Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

 - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to tumor status (severely debilitating and/or life-threatening vs cosmetically disfiguring).

 Patients receive methotrexate and vinblastine IV weekly for 26 weeks and then every 2 weeks for 26 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 months during study participation.

 Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 3 years.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining methotrexate with vinblastine may be effective treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1 associated with progressive plexiform neurofibromas.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have neurofibromatosis type 1 associated with progressive plexiform neurofibromas.
