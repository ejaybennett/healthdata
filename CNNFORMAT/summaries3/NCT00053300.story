(secondQuint)Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effect of thalidomide on time to disease progression and survival in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer who achieve a complete or partial response to induction chemotherapy.

 - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

 Patients receive oral thalidomide daily beginning 3-4 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy.

 Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity Patients are followed every 3 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 18 months.
