(thirdQuint)Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the clinical effect of monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF, determined by the PSA response, in patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer with rising PSA values without metastasis.

 - Determine the pharmacokinetics and safety profile (including immunogenicity) of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the time to disease progression and time to PSA progression in patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF IV over 1 hour once weekly.

 Treatment continues every 8 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as ABX-EGF can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ABX-EGF in treating patients who have prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.
