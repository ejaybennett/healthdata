(firstQuint)Effect of Phosphatidylcholine on Plasma Homocysteine in Healthy Volunteers.

 A high homocysteine concentration is a potential risk for cardiovascular disease.

 Plasma homocysteine concentrations can be lowered through betaine supplementation.

 However, effects of choline supplementation, the precursor for betaine, on plasma homocysteine concentrations in healthy humans are unknown.

 If supplementation with choline or phosphatidylcholine, the form in which choline occurs in foods, lowers homocysteine concentrations, then extra intake of these compounds may lower cardiovascular disease risk in humans.

 Comparison: We compared the effects of supplementation with phosphatidylcholine to the effects of a placebo on fasting and post-methionine concentrations of plasma homocysteine in healthy men.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether supplementation with phosphatidylcholine lowers plasma homocysteine concentrations in healthy men.
