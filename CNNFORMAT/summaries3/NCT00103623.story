(thirdQuint)The Plenaxis Experience Study.

 This is a postmarketing patient safety study in the FDA indicated population of patients receiving Plenaxis(R).

 On a quarterly basis, patients enrolled in the Plenaxis(R) Experience Study will have their charts audited to record the number of immediate-onset systemic allergic reactions that may occur while receiving Plenaxis(R).

 The study will close when 2,000 patients have been enrolled.

 If immediate onset allergic reactions occur, patients may be eligible to enroll in a second protocol (skin testing in patients who experience an immediate onset allergic reaction).

 Collection of all immediate-onset systemic allergic reactions will continue for each patient enrolled in the study until the patient discontinues Plenaxis(R) for any reason, the patient withdraws consent to continue in the study or the patient is lost to follow-up.

 The Plenaxis Experience Study@highlight

Praecis is currently conducting a 2000 patient Experience Study; this is a Phase IV commitment postmarketing safety study in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicated population of patients receiving Plenaxis(R).

 The purpose of the study is to estimate the incidence of immediate-onset systemic allergic reactions in the indicated population receiving Plenaxis(R) and to determine whether the hazard rate changes over time.
