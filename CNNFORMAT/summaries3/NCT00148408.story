(secondQuint)Trial of Asthma Patient Education (TAPE).

 This is a study of the effects of education and drug presentation on efficacy of montelukast and placebo in asthma.

 This trial will answer the following questions: 1) Is there a true placebo response in asthma that is not due to non-specific factors? 2) Can the placebo effect in asthma be augmented by interventions that increase expectancy of benefit? 3) Can interventions that increase expectancy augment the effect of active treatment? 4) Are placebo effects additive or interactive with treatment effects?.
