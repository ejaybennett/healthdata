(firstQuint)The Use of Repetitive Magnetic Stimulation for Strength Training of the Quadriceps Muscle.

 Quadriceps strength is reduced in COPD.

 Increasing quadriceps strength is one of the goals of pulmonary rehabilitation yet some patients with severe COPD are unable to exercise with sufficient intensity, due to breathlessness, to achieve a true training benefit.

 Transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve has been shown to improve quadriceps muscle strength, muscle mass, and performance in patients with severe COPD.

 Magnetic stimulation may be preferred because it offers the opportunity to train the whole muscle and because it is painless.

 In this pilot study we are investigating whether repetitive magnetic stimulation camn increase the strength of the quadriceps muscle and whether it confers any change in structure or metabolism of the muscle itself.

We intend to use repetitive magnetic stimulation to the quadriceps muscle to try to improve strength and improve the metabolic function of the muscle.
