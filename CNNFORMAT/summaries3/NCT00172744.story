(firstQuint)Effect of Cyclic Tensional Force on Osteogenic Differentiation of Human Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells.

 This study is to investigate the effect of the cyclic mechanical strain on the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.

 Mesenchymal stem cells will be cultured from the periodontal ligament tissue of the premolars extracted due to orthodontic reason.
