(firstQuint)Effectiveness of D-Cycloserine as an Aid to Enhance Learning for Individuals With OCD Receiving Behavior Therapy.

 We hope to enroll 50 subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of D-cycloserine augmentation of behavior therapy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.

 All subjects will undergo a pre-treatment assessment, and then be randomly assigned to receive Seromycin (100 mg) or placebo one-hour before each of 10 therapy sessions.

 Subjects will then come in for a treatment planning session and the behavior therapy sessions delivered twice weekly for 5 weeks.

 Comprehensive assessments of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, mood state, and cognitions will be given at baseline, after 5 treatment sessions, after 10 sessions and 1 month and 6 months post-treatment.
