(thirdQuint)Light Based Analysis of Developing Breast Tissue in Adolescent Girls: a Feasibility Study.

 The period between menarche and the age of first full-term pregnancy has been identified as being most crucial for establishing an individual's future breast cancer risk.

 Epidemiological studies further suggest exposures, such as foods and toxins, during adolescence to have a significant impact on the likelihood of transformation in the developing breast resulting in cancer later in life.

 Adolescent diet affects mammary development directly and indirectly by influencing the micronutrients and the hormonal status of the adolescent.

 The goal of this study is to investigate the feasibility of Optical Spectroscopy (OS), a method based on differential light scattering and absorption in tissue, to quantify bulk breast tissue properties in adolescent females.

 Light Based Analysis of Developing Breast Tissue in Adolescent Girls: a Feasibility Study@highlight

The proposed pilot study attempts to investigate the feasibility of Optical Spectroscopy (OS) as a method to quantify breast tissue composition and density in adolescent females.

 Our goals include: to assess whether adolescent girls can be instructed to assist with the OS measurement procedure and to determine the OS technique's ability to show breast tissue composition and density in adolescent breast tissue.
