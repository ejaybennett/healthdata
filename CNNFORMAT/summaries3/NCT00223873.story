(firstQuint)The Use of Penile Vibratory Stimulation to Decrease Spasticity Following Spinal Cord Injury.

 Spinal cord injury can result in mild to severe muscle spasms that can both inhibit functional capability and increase the likelihood of injury due to fall.

 Anecdotal reports and a recent study suggest that triggering the ejaculatory reflex in men with vibratory stimulation can result in a significant decrease in spasm activity over a period of 2 to 42 hours.

 This study examines the effects of penile vibratory stimulation on spasticity when conducted daily in the home setting.
