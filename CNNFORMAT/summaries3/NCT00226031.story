(thirdQuint)Optimal Management of Women With Wrist Fractures.

 Numerous studies have demonstrated that women with wrist fractures have lower bone mineral density.

 Despite new guidelines for the care of such women, research has shown that they are not generally evaluated for osteoporosis.

 This care gap exists although it is known that wrist fractures are an important marker for subsequent fractures, such as a hip fracture, which represents a significant socio-economic burden to society.

 Comparison: Cluster randomized trial of women and their physicians, both of whom receive educational material and reminder on post fracture osteoporosis evaluation.

 Comparison is to women and their physicians who receive standard post fracture information.

 Family practices are randomized to intervention or non-intervention group.

 Optimal Management of Women With Wrist Fractures@highlight

To evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention (reminder and educational material) in improving the evaluation of osteoporosis follow-up care of post-menopausal women with wrist fractures by their primary care physicians.

 The intervention is directed at improving the gap in continuity of care between emergency/fracture clinics and family physicians, and reducing knowledge gaps.
