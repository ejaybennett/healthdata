(secondQuint)The Study to Compare Cypher Versus Cypher Select in Treating Cornary Artery Lesions.

.

 This is a multicenter (up to 10 sites), open, prospective, 2-arm, unbalanced, randomized study designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the CYPHER SELECT cent Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent as compared to the CYPHER cent Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent.

 A total of 100 patients will be entered in the study and will be randomized on a 2:1 basis to the CYPHER SELECT cent stent or the CYPHER cent stent.

 100 patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions <23 mm in length and more than 2.

5 to less than 3.

5 mm in diameter by visual estimate who meet all eligibility criteria will be either randomized.
