(fifthQuint)Iron Supplementation in Schistosomiasis and Soil Transmitted Helminths Control Programmes in Zambia.

 Iron deficiency anaemia is a common denominator for both schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminths.

 Iron deficiency appears to affect the immune response against schistosomes and intestinal helminths.

 It therefore follows that correcting the iron deficiency anaemia will improve the efficacy of anthelminthics such as praziquantel (against schistosomiasis) and albendazol (against soil transmitted helminths) and ability of the host immune system to resist reinfection with schistosomes and soil transmitted helminths.

 The aim of this study is to identify factors necessary for a successful weekly iron supplementation programme in schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminths control programmes.

 In addition impact of weekly iron supplementation programme n haemoglobin levels, efficacy of praziquantel, and schistosomiasis re-infection will be studied.

The objectives of this study is: - to establish the coverage rate of weekly iron supplementation in children in intervention schools over a period of nine months - document any side effects of weeekly iron supplementation among children in intervention schools over a period of nine months asses the feasibility of incorporating the weekly iron supplementation programme into the normal school activity in intervention schools determine the extent of acceptability and support for the iron supplementation programme by staff at the health centre nearest to the intervention schools - compare the praziquantel efficacy and schistosomiasis reinfection in children in intervention schools with that of children in control schools following the introduction of weekely iron supplementation over a period of nine months - determine the impact of weekly iron supplementation on haemoglobin levels of children in intervention schools and compare with children in control schools over a period of nine months
