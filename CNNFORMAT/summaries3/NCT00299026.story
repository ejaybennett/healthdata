(thirdQuint)A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Study of the Safety and Performance of the NIRx Paclitaxel-Coated Conformer Coronary Stent.

 The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of coronary artery stenting with the NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated Stent (1.

0 mu g/mm2 of paclitaxel incorporated into slow- and moderate-release formulation of a triblock copolymer carrier system) for the treatment of de novo lesions in native vessels.

 Patients in 2 sequential cohorts will be randomised to receive either the NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated Stent or the uncoated control stent.

 In cohort 1, the slow-release formulation NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated Stent will be studied.

 If the safety profile is acceptable, the moderate-release formulation NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated Stent will be studied in Cohort 2.

 In each f the 2 cohorts, 133 patients will be treated with the NIRx(TM) paclitaxel-Coated Stent and 133 with the uncoated control stent (1.

1 ratio), for a total of 532 patients in study.

 A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Study of the Safety and Performance of the NIRx Paclitaxel-Coated Conformer Coronary Stent@highlight

The clinical investigation is an international, prospective, double-blind, randomized safety and efficacy study.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated Stent (1.

0 mu g/mm2 of paclitaxel incorporated into slow- and moderate-release formulation of a triblock copolymer carrier system)in patients who present for stenting of de novo lesions of a native coronary artery.
