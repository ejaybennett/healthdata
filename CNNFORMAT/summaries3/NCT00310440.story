(thirdQuint)An Assessment of P-15 Bone Putty in Anterior Cervical Fusion With Instrumentation.

 Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF) is a common surgical treatment option for symptomatic degenerative cervical disk disease in patients who fail conservative treatment.

 i-FACTOR bone graft is a unique anorganic bone mineral (ABM) and small peptide, P-15 cent .

 P-15 is a synthetic fifteen amino acid polypeptide that mimics the cell-binding domain of Type I human collagen and is responsible for osteogenic cell attachment via alpha2-beta1 integrins.

 This is randomized, controlled, multi-center, prospective FDA IDE study conducted to assess the safety and effectiveness of i-FACTOR bone graft (Cerapedics, Inc.

 Westminster, CO) in patients treated with single level ACDF.

 Patients received i-FACTOR bone graft or local autologous bone inside a structural allograft.

 An Assessment of P-15 Bone Putty in Anterior Cervical Fusion With Instrumentation@highlight

The aim of this trial is to evaluate if P-15 bone putty (investigational device) is not inferior in effectiveness and safety to local autologous bone (control device) when applied in instrumented anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with use of a structural allograft ring in patients with degenerative cervical disc disease.
