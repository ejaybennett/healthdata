(secondQuint)Doxil and Gemcitabine in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer.

 This study will evaluate the toxicities of Doxil and Gemcitabine given on an every two week basis.

 Our hypothesis is that toxicity will be less than that with standard dosing without any negative effect on survival.

 Patients will also be evaluated with CT scans every 3 months.

 Toxicity will be assessed with every cycle of treatment.

 Treatment will continue until toxicity or signs of progression.
