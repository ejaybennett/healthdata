(fifthQuint)A Study to Assess Antibody Persistence, Boostability & Safety in Previously Primed Subjects.

.

 This study will be conducted in two stages: At 10 months age, half of the subjects will receive a dose of plain meningococcal AC and PRP polysaccharide (PS) vaccine at 10 months age.

 At 15 to 18 months age (DTP booster phase), all subjects will receive a booster dose of Tritanrix cent -HepB/Hib-MenAC or Tritanrix cent -HepB/Hib2.

 A Study to Assess Antibody Persistence, Boostability & Safety in Previously Primed Subjects.

@highlight

The purpose of the study is as follows: - To evaluate the persistence of antibodies and the presence of immune memory induced by a 3-dose primary vaccination with Tritanrix cent -HepB/Hib-MenAC (three formulations) in the study DTPwHB/HibMenACTT001 (CPMS No.

 759346/001) by giving unconjugated PRP, PSA and PSC at 10 months age to one subset of subjects.

 - To evaluate the persistence of all antibodies pertaining to primary vaccination and the booster response to Tritanrix cent -HepB/Hib2.

5 vaccine or Tritanrix cent -HepB/Hib-MenAC vaccine at 15-18 months age in the other subset of subjects.
