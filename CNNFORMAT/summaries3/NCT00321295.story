(fifthQuint)Biventricular Pacing In Patients With Left Ventricular Dysfunction After Cardiovascular Surgery.

 1.

 Basis for the study/study rationale Patients with congestive heart failure have high rates of mortality and morbidity (1).

 There are 5 million people in the United States that have congestive heart failure (CHF) and 52,828 new cases are diagnosed annually.

 There are 995,000 hospital visits with 52,828 deaths annually due to this condition.

 Although there have been numerous medical advances in drug therapy, there was a 164% increase in the number of hospital admissions for CHF since 1979 (1, 2).

 Biventricular (BiV) pacing has been shown to have acute and chronic benefits in a subset of patients with CHF (3-6).

 Those that have been shown to benefit from this mode of therapy have left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a widened QRS duration on the electrocardiogram.

 Acute hemodynamic studies comparing patients at baseline with either right ventricular (RV) or BiV pacing show significant improvements in the systolic blood pressure and cardiac output in patients with BiV pacing compared to either RV pacing or baseline measurements (3, 4).

 Furthermore, BiV pacing was associated with decrease in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and diastolic mitral regurgitation.

 These acute hemodynamic benefits are sustained and manifest as improvements in clinical symptoms.

 The Multisite Stimulation in Cardiomyopathies (MUSTIC) study showed that BiV pacing was associated with a 23% increase in the distance walked in six minutes (P 18 years 2.

 Planned CABG and/or valve surgery 3.

 Able to give written informed consent Exclusion Criteria: 1.

 Enrollment in other research protocols 2.

 Inability to give written informed consent 3.

 Pregnancy 5.

 Methods of data acquisition and analysis Clinical, operative, and in-hospital information for each subject will be recorded on standardized case report forms (see attached) at the time of hospitalization or soon after discharge.

 The characteristics of those that received BiV pacing will be compared to those that received either no pacing or RV pacing.

 The data will be recorded in a manner such that there are no patient identifiers.

 The information will then be transferred to a computer database.

 The case report forms will be kept under lock and key on the third floor of the WBH Heart Center.

 The computer data base will be password protected.

 Only the investigators will have access to the case report forms or computer database.

 Biventricular Pacing In Patients With Left Ventricular Dysfunction After Cardiovascular Surgery@highlight

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a medical condition that is due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD).

 LVSD is a decreased ability of the heart to pump blood forward.

 There are 5 million people in the United States that have CHF and 52,828 new cases are diagnosed annually.

 There are 995,000 hospital visits and 52,828 deaths annually due to CHF.

 Previous studies have shown that people with this condition are at a higher risk for complications immediately after any type of heart surgery than are normal individuals.

 This includes increased dependence on medications and devices to improve the pumping function of the heart and blood pressure.

 Additionally, they also have longer lengths of hospital stay and higher rates of death compared to normal individuals.

 Some patients with LVSD not only have a decreased pumping ability of the heart, they also have an inefficient pumping function.

 These patients have been shown to benefit from a device therapy known as biventricular pacing.

 Biventricular pacing involves simultaneously electrically stimulating the two major pumping chambers of the heart known as ventricles using a pacemaker and wires.

 This causes a more coordinated contraction of the heart chambers resulting in improvement in the pumping ability of the heart and blood pressure.

 Studies have confirmed that in these patients, implantation of a biventricular pacemaker improves patients' symptoms and quality of life as well as decreasing a need for future hospitalizations.

 Whether biventricular pacing in patients with LVSD improves patient outcomes after heart surgery has not been investigated.

 Some patients temporarily develop slow heart rates after cardiovascular surgery.

 These slow heart rates can cause a decrease in the blood pumped from the heart and result in low blood pressures.

 Therefore, all patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery, regardless of left ventricular function, receive temporary pacing wires that are placed on one of the ventricles during the surgery.

 Temporary pacing will result in an increase in heart rate and improvement in the amount of blood pumped by the heart and in blood pressure.

 The placement of these wires is precautionary as only a few patients need to be paced for slow heart rates.

 Once patients are felt to no longer require them, the wires are easily removed.

 The purpose of this study is to determine whether biventricular pacing immediately after heart surgery in patients with LVSD will improve in-hospital outcomes.

 Patients that are scheduled for heart surgery and meet the inclusion criteria will be approached for consent to participate in this study.

 Once consented, they will be randomized to one of three treatment arms: usual care, RV pacing (single ventricle pacing), or biventricular pacing.

 Randomization is a process similar to picking numbers out of a hat.

 The patients will then undergo surgery as scheduled.

 During the surgery, the patients will receive the temporary pacing wires on both ventricles instead of one.

 Immediately after surgery, the patients will receive either usual care, RV pacing, or biventricular pacing depending upon the treatment arm that they were randomized to.

 The pacing wires will be removed as soon as the patients become stable as per routine.

 The clinical, operative, and in-hospital characteristics of these patients will be recorded on specialized forms.

 The characteristics of those that received biventricular pacing will be compared to those that had RV or no pacing to see whether there was any benefit to this mode of therapy.
