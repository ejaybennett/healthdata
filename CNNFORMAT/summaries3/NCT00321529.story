(secondQuint)Comparison of the ProAdjuster Analysis to the Penning Method of Determining Intersegmental Motion of the Cervical Spine.

 This study will utilize the ProAdjuster Device as a method of assessing the motion of the cervical spine in participants with instability as determined by a Penning Radiographic analysis.

 Only participants with existing radiographic studies will be included in the study.

 No additional Radiographic will be required.
