(fifthQuint)Interest of Ribavirin in the Maintenance Treatment of Liver Fibrosis Using Low Dose Pegylated Interferon alpha2b in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Non Responders to Previous Antiviral Therapy.

.

 Up to 45% of patients with chronic hepatitis C do not respond to pegylated interferon/ribavirin combination therapy.

 These patients are prone to develop liver fibrosis leading to cirrhosis and its complications.

 Interferon has proven to be efficient in liver fibrosis treatment even in case of virological non response.

 Maintenance low dose pegylated interferon therapy is currently under investigation in large multicenter trials.

 The aim of our study is to assess wether peginterferon alpha 2 b (0.

5 mu g/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800-1200 mg according to body weight) is more efficient than peginterferon alpha 2 b alone in a long term 3 years treatment of liver fibrosis.

 454 patients, non responders (VHC RNA positive after 24 weeks of treatment or absence of 2 log HCV RNA drop after 12 weeks of treatment) to a previous peginterferon/ribavirin antiviral treatment will be randomized between the 2 arms, with a double-blind masking of ribavirin.

 The efficacy will be assessed on Metavir liver fibrosis score improvement between pre and post therapeutic liver biopsy.

 Interest of Ribavirin in the Maintenance Treatment of Liver Fibrosis Using Low Dose Pegylated Interferon alpha2b in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Non Responders to Previous Antiviral Therapy.

@highlight

Patients with chronic hepatitis C who did not respond to previous antiviral treatment develop liver fibrosis leading to cirrhosis.

 Maintenance low dose pegylated interferon therapy of fibrosis is currently under investigation in large multicenter trials.

 The aim of our study is to assess if peginterferon alpha2b plus ribavirin is more efficient than peginterferon alpha2b alone.

 454 patients will be randomized between the 2 arms and the efficacy will be assessed, after 3 years of treatment, on Metavir liver fibrosis score improvement.
