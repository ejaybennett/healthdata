 Two groups will be define rgarding maternal hypotention following regional anesthesia - maternal hypotention (study group) or normal maternal BP.

 Data will colect from mothers and neonates records as well as operation data.

 Maternal data: gravida, parity, diseases, medications, demographics, and all data regarding the operation (blood pressures, Heart rates, saturation, treatment given etc.

 Maternal Hypotension During Cesarean Section and Short Term Neonatal Outcome.

@highlight

About 20-25% of deliveries are by cesarean section.

 Most are elective with use of regional anesthesia (spinal/epidural).

 Drop of blood pressure after regional anesthesia is common.

 It have the risk of reduction of blood flow to the placenta and the fetus.

 No studies had followed the newborns their first days of live,of mothers who developed hypotension in durins CS.
