(fifthQuint)Invasive Prenatal Testing Decisions in Pregnancy After Infertility.

 Women who are pregnant after infertility often experience heightened anxiety regarding the outcome of the pregnancy.

 When choosing whether or not to have invasive prenatal testing they are faced with a complex decision, set in the unique context of a pregnancy that they often perceive as exceptionally precious.

 The proposed study aims to explore the invasive prenatal testing decision-making experiences of women who are pregnant after infertility.

 A cross-sectional design will be used to investigate relationships between the infertility experience and decisional conflict associated with deciding whether or not to have invasive prenatal testing.

 Women who are pregnant after infertility will be recruited from online support groups and websites for pregnancy after infertility.

 Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire that measures infertility and decision-making variables and elicits their perceptions of the impact of infertility on their IPT decision-making experience.

 The main outcome measure is decisional conflict.
