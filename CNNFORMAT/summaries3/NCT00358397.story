(firstQuint)One Time Injection of Bacteria to Treat Solid Tumors That Have Not Responded to Standard Therapy.

 Investigators at the SKCCC have developed a bacterial strain (C.

 novyi-NT) that can infect tumors and destroy them, but does not grow in normal tissues.

 In animal experiments, a single intravenous injection of these bacteria can cause dramatic regression of many tumors, and the tumors do not recur in approximately (~) 30% of the animals.

 This is a phase I dose escalation study using a single dose of Clostridium novyi-NT spores in patients with treatment-refractory solid tumor malignancies.

 The overall objective of this study is to determine the safety and document any preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity in this patient population.

This study will include a one time intravenous (IV) infusion of Clostridium novyi-NT (C.

 novyi-NT) spores to treat solid tumors which have not responded to standard therapy.
