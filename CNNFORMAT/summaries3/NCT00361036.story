(secondQuint)Comparison Study in the Treatment of Uterine Fibroids Uterine Fibroid Embolization Using BeadBlock Embolic Agent.

 The purpose of the study is to conduct a comparison between BeadBlock cent and Embosphere in uterine fibroid embolization.

 Baseline and follow-up MR Imaging data will be made with respect to changes in fibroid and uterus perfusion and fibroid and uterine volume.

 This is a 12 months study (12 month follow up for all enrollees).

 The primary end-point will be the degree of fibroid devascularization as seen at contrast-enhanced MRI performed 3 months (+/- 15 days) after UAE procedure.

 In addition we will assess symptom reduction in patients that have undergone uterine fibroid embolization with Bead Block cent and Embosphere(R).

 Primary Objective 1.

 To assess the change in fibroid devascularization as seen at contrast-enhanced MRI performed after UAE and at three (3) months (+/- 15 days) following the UAE, and compare the changes between BeadBlock cent and Embosphere.

 Secondary Objective 1.

 To assess the change in fibroid devascularization as seen at contrast-enhanced MRI performed several days after UAE and 6 months (+/- 15 days) following the UAE, and compare the changes between BeadBlock cent and Embosphere.

 Tertiary Objective 1.

 To assess the change in uterine volume as seen at contrast-enhanced MRI performed several days after UAE, 3 months (+/- 15 days) and 6 months (+/- 15 days) following the UAE, and compare the changes between BeadBlock cent and Embosphere.

 2.

 To assess the change from baseline in symptom severity (UFS-QOL)at 3, 6 and 12 months (+/- 15 days) follow-up, as measured by the subscale of the UFS questionnaire, and compare the changes between BeadBlock cent and Embosphere.
