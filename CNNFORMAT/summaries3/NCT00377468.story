(firstQuint)Effect of Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol on the Prevention of Chronic Pain in Patients With Acute CRPS (ETIC-Study).

 Recent animal data suggest that the endocannabinoid system is a promising target in the prevention of chronic pain.

 It has been shown that the endocannabinoid system modifies excitatory and inhibitory currents in structures involved in the development of chronic pain such as the amygdala.

 CRPS is a neuropathic pain condition, which is known to become chronic in a significant percentage.

 The study compares the effect of low dose Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (90 days) and placebo in acute CRPS.

 All patients will receive a standard treatment consisting of drug therapy and physiotherapy.
