(secondQuint)Liposomal Doxorubicin and Docetaxel in HER2 Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 Phase II non comparative study, assessing the safety (primarily cardiac safety) and efficacy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2/neu negative breast cancer not yet treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

 Myocet and Taxotere will be given for a maximum of 6 cycles.

 Endpoints: cardiotoxicity (left ventricular ejection fraction decrease and/or symptoms of heart failure), serious other toxicity, disease progression.
