(thirdQuint)Radial Optic Neurotomy in Central Retinal Vein Occlusion : a Randomized Trial.

 Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) is the second most frequently retinal vascular disease causing loss of vision, after diabetic retinopathy.

 No treatment of CRVO has clearly demonstrated beneficial and long lasting visual results.

 Commonly used treatment options are platelet anti-aggregating agents, correcting rheologic factors with troxerutin and isovolumic hemodilution.

 Surgical treatment of CRVO has recently been proposed (2001) and has been studied in numerous non comparative pilot studies.

 Limited but encouraging results motivate our randomised controlled trial.

 We will evaluate at 6 months visual acuity after surgery associating pars plana vitrectomy and radial optic neurotomy, in patients with central vein occlusion and bad vision, associated with the correction of rheologic factors.

 Radial Optic Neurotomy in Central Retinal Vein Occlusion : a Randomized Trial@highlight

Natural evolution of severe central retinal vein occlusion with low visual acuity is very poor.

 A randomized clinical trial will compare troxerutin and platelet anti-aggregating agents (drug treatment) versus surgery and drug treatment.

 Surgery will include vitrectomy and radial optic neurotomy.

 The primary outcome will be vision measured 6 months after surgery.
