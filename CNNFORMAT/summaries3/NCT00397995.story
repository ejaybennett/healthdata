(firstQuint)Undislocated Distal Both-Bone Forearm Fractures in Children.

 children who arrive at the emergency unit with a undislocated both-bone distal forearm fracture will be asked to join the trial.

 After informed consent, a randomization between 2 kinds of cast will be done.

 Outpatient clinic visits till a follow-up of 6 months.

 During these visits we will investigate: consolidation and dislocation on X-ray, function of both arms, complains in daily living and complications.
