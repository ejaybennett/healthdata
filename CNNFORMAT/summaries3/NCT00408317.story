 This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, two-period cross-over, placebo-controlled study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Ultrase(R) MT20 to placebo in participants with CF and pancreatic insufficiency.

 The study consists of a screening period (up to 11 days) and two treatment periods (6-7 days).

 During screening period participants will be treated with open-label Ultrase(R) MT18 or MT20.

 A safety follow-up visit will be performed 7-10 days after discharge from the last treatment period.
