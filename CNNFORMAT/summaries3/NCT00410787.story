(thirdQuint)Safety and Tolerability of Long-term Administration of OROS Hydromorphone HCI (Slow Release) in Cancer Pain.

 Study DO-118X was a phase-3, multicenter, open-label extension study in adult patients with cancer pain who had successfully completed Study DO-118 with dose-stable pain control taking at least 8 mg of OROS hydromorphone (slow release) or its equivalent morphine sulfate SR (slow release) dosage.

 Patients were started on the dose of OROS hydromorphone equivalent to the opioid dose on which they had achieved dose-stable pain control in the SR (slow release) phase of Study DO-118.

 Patients returned to their study clinic once a month for 1 year.

 Dosage adjustments to study medications and breakthrough pain medication were permitted.

 OROS hydromorphone HCI (slow release) tablets in 8, 16, 32 and 64mg doses administered orally every 24 hours.

The primary purpose of this study was to characterize the pain control achieved with long-term repeated dosing of OROS hydromorphone (slow release) in patients with chronic cancer pain and the secondary purpose was to characterize the effects of pain on the patients' quality of life with long-term, repeated dosing of OROS hydromorphone (slow release) taken by patients with chronic cancer pain.
