(firstQuint)Proteomic Analysis of HLA Complex in Solid Cancers: Breast, Ovary, Colon, Rectum, Stomach, and Pancreas.

 The main objective of the study is to evaluate which proteins are presented by the HLA complex of solid tumors.

 Secondary objectives include to evaluate whether an immune response specific to these proteins has actually been provoked and whether there is a similar immune response following recurrence.

 Real specimens will be evaluated using PCR and mass spectrometry.
