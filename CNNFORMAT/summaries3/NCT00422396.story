(thirdQuint)Effects of Micronized Fenofibrate on Fasting and Postprandial Lipoproteins, Inflammatory Mediators and Thrombosis.

 The aim of this study was to determine the effects of micronized fenofibrate (160 mg/daily) on: 1.

 Fasting and postprandial lipids and lipoproteins after a standarized test meal.

 2.

 Fasting and postprandial oxidized fatty acids and oxidized low density lipoprotein after a standarized test meal.

 3.

 Fasting and postprandial inflammatory mediators after a standarized test meal.

 4.

 Fasting and postprandial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cytokine production after a standarized test meal.

 5.

 Fasting and postprandial markers of hemostasis, fibrinolysis and blood viscosity after a standarized test meal.

 Effects of Micronized Fenofibrate on Fasting and Postprandial Lipoproteins, Inflammatory Mediators and Thrombosis@highlight

This is a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial designed to investigate the effects of micronized fenofibrate on fasting and postprandial lipoproteins, oxidized fatty acids and lipoproteins, inflammatory mediators and thrombotic factors among hypertriglyceridemic individuals with two or more other characteristics of the metabolic syndrome.
