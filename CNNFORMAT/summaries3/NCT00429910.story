(thirdQuint)Natural History Study of Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the impact of current procedures for diagnosis, management, and follow-up on disease status of patients with newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).

 - Determine the natural history of patients with CML who achieve response to imatinib mesylate.

 - Determine the health perceptions, symptoms, insurance issues, and work issues of these patients.

 - Determine whether medication compliance and planned dose reduction affect imatinib mesylate effectiveness in these patients.

 - Determine the molecular and biologic factors associated with disease progression and good and poor response to imatinib mesylate in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a longitudinal, prospective, cohort study.

 Patients complete quality of life, functional status, medical and treatment history, and medication questionnaires at baseline and then every 6 months for 5 years.

 Blood samples are collected at baseline and then every 6 months for 5 years.

 Specimens may be examined in the future in gene array studies and mutation analyses.

RATIONALE: Gathering information about patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia may help doctors learn more about the disease and find better methods of treatment and on-going care.

 PURPOSE: This natural history study is collecting health information and disease-related information over time from patients with newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia.
