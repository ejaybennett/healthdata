(secondQuint)Dialectical Cognitive Traumatherapy (DCT) on Patients With Severe PTSD Following Sexual Abuse.

 Most studies on psychological treatments for PTSD exclude patients with severe, co-occurring psychopathology.

 We designed a new treatment (Dialectical Cognitive Trauma Therapy, or DCT) specifically to treat these patients.

 DCT includes elements of emotion regulation, mindfulness exercises, cognitive and exposure treatment, as well as new elements.

 This randomized controlled study evaluates the effect of inpatient DCT on these patients.
