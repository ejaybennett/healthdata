(thirdQuint)High-Dose Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease That Did Not Respond to Steroid Therapy.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of high-dose cyclophosphamide in patients with steroid refractory acute graft-versus-host disease.

 - Determine the efficacy of this regimen at 28 days post-treatment in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide once daily for 1-4 days beginning on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 10 and continuing until blood counts recover.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of high-dose cyclophosphamide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks.

 High-Dose Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease That Did Not Respond to Steroid Therapy@highlight

RATIONALE: High-dose cyclophosphamide may be an effective treatment for acute graft-versus-host disease that did not respond to steroid therapy.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects, best dose, and how well high-dose cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with acute graft-versus-host disease that did not respond to steroid therapy.
