(thirdQuint)Changes in Semen or Sperm Caused by Temozolomide in Patients With Newly Diagnosed, Progressive, or Recurrent Primary Malignant Brain Tumors.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Assess if temozolomide induces any changes in standard semen or sperm analysis parameters (i.

e.

, volume, viscosity, pH, forward progression, total count, total motile count, motility, presence of round cells, agglutination, and morphology) in patients with newly diagnosed, recurrent, or progressive primary malignant brain tumors.

 OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

 During treatment with temozolomide, patients undergo semen or sperm sample collection at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months for semen analysis.

 Samples are analyzed for volume, viscosity, pH, forward progression, total count, total motile count, motility, presence of round cells, agglutination, and morphology.

RATIONALE: Learning whether temozolomide changes semen or sperm in patients with brain tumors may help doctors learn about the long-term effects of treatment and plan the best treatment.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying changes in semen or sperm caused by temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed, progressive, or recurrent primary malignant brain tumors.
