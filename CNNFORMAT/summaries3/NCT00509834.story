(secondQuint)A Study on the Tolerability and Early Efficacy of hLF1-11 in Patients With Proven Candidaemia.

 RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY Choice of Drug Fluconazole is considered "standard care" for the treatment of Candida infections, including candidaemia in hospitalized patients.

 Preclinical data has demonstrated that hLF1-11 possesses potent antimycotic effects against Candida sp and, importantly, to be synergistic with fluconazole, whereby Candida strains that are fluconazole-resistant become sensitive through the addition of hLF1-11 Choice of Patient Population Based on preclinical data hLF1-11 has been shown to possess potent effects on Candida albicans models in vitro and in vivo.

 Furthermore, candidaemia (bloodstream Candida infection) is one of the most likely settings to elicit a therapeutic response since the product is presented as an intravenous formulation As previously mentioned, fluconazole and hLF1-11 exhibit a synergistic effect in preclinical studies, whereby the effect of fluconazole is enhanced by the addition of hLF1-11.
