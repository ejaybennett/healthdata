(firstQuint)Effects of Contact Lens Wear on Children's Self-Perceptions.

 Eight to eleven year old children will be randomly assigned to wear spectacles or soft contact lenses.

 The children's self-perceptions will be measured at baseline and every six months.

 We will compare the change in self-perception between spectacle and soft contact lens wearers over three years.

 We will also examine the effect of how much children initially like or dislike to wear glasses on the change in self-perception over three years.
