 CC-4047 With Gemcitabine for Untreated Advanced Carcinoma of the Pancreas@highlight

Because the activity of CC-4047 addresses numerous mechanisms of carcinoma growth inhibition - including, but not limited to anti-angiogenesis - CC-4047 has been selected for development as part of induction chemotherapy regimens for solid tumors.

 This study in pancreatic cancer is designed to determine the appropriate CC-4047 dose and regimen in combination with gemcitabine.
