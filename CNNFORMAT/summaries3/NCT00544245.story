(thirdQuint)Is Monitoring Activity Important for Short- and Long-term Weight Loss?.

 The major objective of this study is to determine if two techniques for monitoring physical activity and energy balance promote the maintenance of weight loss in healthy overweight and obese individuals.

 The study compares two approaches designed to help individuals monitor physical activity and to adjust their calorie intake to maintain a reasonable energy balance (bodybugg(R) & Step Diet Book systems).

 Full subject participation in the study spans two years.

 Participants periodically report to a pre-arranged location to be measured by a qualified fitness professional for height, weight, circumferences, and estimated body fat using a bioelectric impedance scale (body fat scale).

 Is Monitoring Activity Important for Short- and Long-term Weight Loss?@highlight

This study is comparing the effectiveness of two techniques for monitoring physical activity and energy balance on long-term weight management (two years).

 The focus is on weight loss, prevention of weight gain, and the maintenance of a healthy weight over time.

 It is expected that both techniques will benefit long-term weight management.
