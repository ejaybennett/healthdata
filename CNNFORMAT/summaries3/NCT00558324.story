(firstQuint)Corneal Flap Thickness Planed vs Measured After LASIK by Using Tree Different Systems Cut.

 Eighty-six eyes had undergone LASIK were examined, al within 2 weeks to 1 month after surgery.

 Study involved 3 treatment groups: One with 30 eyes of 15 patients, corneal flaps were created with the microkeratome femtosecond laser 15 KHz 1001/2m (Intralase Corp, Irvine, Calif.

), one with 30 eyes of 15 patients, corneal flaps were created with mechanical microkeratome (Hansatome 1601/2m (Chiron Vision Corp, Claremont, Calif) and one with 26 eyes of 13 patients, corneal flaps were created with mechanical microkeratome K3000 1301/2m ( BD Ophthalmic Systems, Waltham, Mass) .

 A central scan of the total corneal thickness was taken with the confocal microscope (Confoscan 4, Fortune Technologies, Italy) before and at 2 weeks and 1 month after surgery.

 Corneal epithelial thickness and the Anterior stroma morphology were analyzed by using the NAVIS software V.
