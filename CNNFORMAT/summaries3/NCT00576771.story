(firstQuint)Effects of Different Assisted Mechanical Ventilation in Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ALI/ARDS) Patients: Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV), Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) and Controlled by Patient.

 In this study, PSV is compared with NAVA and assisted mechanically ventilation controlled by patient through a button.

 Inclusion criteria are: assisted mechanically ventilated ALI/ARDS patients.

 Effects of Different Assisted Mechanical Ventilation in Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ALI/ARDS) Patients: Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV), Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) and Controlled by Patient@highlight

The investigators' aim is to study the effect of pressure support ventilation versus neurally adjusted assist (NAVA) and controlled by patient in mechanically ventilated ALI/ARDS subjects.
