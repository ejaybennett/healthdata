(firstQuint)Evaluation of a New Oral Contrast Agent for MR Enterography in the Assessment of Crohn Disease in the Small Bowel.

 Crohn Disease is an inflammatory condition that involves the small bowel.

 Patients usually undergo multiple imaging exams in the diagnosis and surveillance of the disease.

 CT has been shown to have excellent results for detecting active inflammation.

 In the United States MR has lagged behind CT in utilization for imaging the small bowel.

 An advantage of MR over CT is the lack of radiation exposure to the patient.

 A new oral contrast agent is available that provides good distension of the small bowel and allows improved identification of active inflammation.

 The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of MR to CT using this new oral contrast agent and to assess exam quality.
