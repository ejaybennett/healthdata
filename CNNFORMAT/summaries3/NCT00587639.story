(thirdQuint)An Evaluation of Safety and Feasibility Using Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in Adolescents With Depression.

 High frequency rTMS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) has been shown to have an antidepressant effect.

 Initial studies comparing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and rTMS suggest that rTMS has been as effective as ECT in treating non-psychotic depression.

 Given the high degree of ongoing dysfunction in depressed adolescents despite optimization of treatment with antidepressant medications, new concerns regarding suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents treated with antidepressant medications, and the more interventional nature of ECT, the use of rTMS as adjuvant therapy may be of significant clinical benefit.

 Thus far, research using rTMS to treat depression in adolescents has been limited.

 The primary aim of this study is to examine the safety and feasibility of using 10 Hz rTMS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) as adjuvant treatment for depression in adolescents.

The objective of this investigation is to examine the safety and feasibility of a series of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatments (10 Hertz [Hz]; Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex), with a Neuronetics Model 2100 Therapy System as adjuvant treatment for depression in adolescent subjects.
