(thirdQuint)Erlotinib as 1st Line Treatment in NSCLC Stage IIIB/IV.

 A randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial of erlotinib versus placebo, with more than 700 patients demonstrated that therapy with this tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) prolongs survival after first or second line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.

 Statistically significant and clinically relevant differences were observed for overall and progression free survival in favour of erlotinib.

 Moreover, several clinical factors had been correlated with response to gefitinib or erlotinib, including never smoking status, female gender, Asian ethnicity and adenocarcinoma histology (especially bronchioalveolar carcinoma).

 Erlotinib as 1st Line Treatment in NSCLC Stage IIIB/IV@highlight

To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of erlotinib as first line treatment in patients with locally advanced/metastatic (stages IIIB/IV) NSCLC, with clinical predictors of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, gefitinib), such as female gender, never-smoking status and adenocarcinoma histology.

 Furthermore, erlotinib-sensitivity will be correlated with the presence of EGFR mutations in exons 18, 19 and 21, in this population
