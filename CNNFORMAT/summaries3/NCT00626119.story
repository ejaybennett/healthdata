(thirdQuint)Vibro-Acoustography Imaging in Finding Breast Microcalcifications and Lesions in Women.

 OBJECTIVES: - To further develop a new method of in vivo imaging of the breast using vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging.

 - To demonstrate and evaluate the capability of VA imaging in detecting microcalcifications and lesions inside the human breast.

 OUTLINE: Participants undergo vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging of the breast using ultrasonography over 90 minutes.

 Participants may also undergo further imaging using clinical ultrasonography.
