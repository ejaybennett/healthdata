(fifthQuint)Bone Health Observational Study.

 A consequence of ADT is the gradual bone loss, so-called cancer treatment induced bone loss (CTIBL).

 The current standard of care is the addition of Vitamin D and Calcium upon the initiation of ADT.

 Moreover, bisphosphonates are now being considered to treat and prevent CTIBL.

 However, bisphosphonates are costly, thus there is a desire to identify or target a specific subset of patients who would most benefit from the treatment.

 By obtaining baseline BMD and monitoring for Skeletal Related Events (SREs), we hope to identify that specific sub-set of patients who would most benefit from the treatment.

 Using a prospective, observational study design, we propose monitoring how physicians manage CTIBL in their patients.

 Bone Health Observational Study@highlight

Prostate Cancer patients treated with LHRH agonists (e.

g.

, goserelin) lose Bone Mineral Density (BMD).

 Using a prospective, observational study design, we propose that monitoring how physicians manage Cancer Treatment Induced Bone Loss(CTIBL) in their patients.

 The gold standard for evaluating BMD is dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).

 The proposed study will provide some of the first prospective data on the rates of Skeletal Related Events (SREs) in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT and help develop official guidelines on the use of DEXA screening for prostate cancer patients.
