(secondQuint)Effects of Infliximab on Insulin Sensitivity and Beta Cell Function in Insulin Resistant Human Obesity.

 Overweight and obesity are rapidly becoming one of the most pressing health problems.

 Obese subjects face an increased risk for cardiovascular events that is closely related to a cluster of metabolic disturbances (i.

e.

 insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia and impaired fibrinolysis), collectively referred to as syndrome X.

 The actual mechanism underlying development of syndrome X has not been elucidated.

 Increased TNF-alpha activity has been proposed as a key factor.

 The objectives of the study are to test whether neutralizing TNF-alpha with infliximab in obese subjects affects insulin resistance and phenotypical manifestations of the metabolic syndrome such as: - fasting plasma insulin - ivGTT derived parameters of insulin resistance and beta-cell function - total body fat - plasma lipid profile - vascular endothelial dysfunction.

The aim of the study is to test whether neutralizing TNF-alpha with infliximab affects insulin resistance and phenotypical manifestations of the metabolic syndrome as fasting plasma insulin, total body fat, plasma lipid profile or vascular endothelial function in obese male subjects.
