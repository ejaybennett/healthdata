(firstQuint)Evaluation of the DPP HIV 1/2 Test and the HIV 1/2 Stat Pak Test Using Oral Fluid.

 The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using fresh oral fluid specimens, from known HIV-positive individuals, to test for HIV-1 antibodies using both the DPP HIV 1/2 and HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK tests.

 Two oral fluid collection devices will be used and compared (MPC and Chembio collection devices) and the results obtained from oral fluids will be compared with those obtained from whole blood and plasma using paired samples from the same participants.

 The comparison between oral fluid, whole blood and plasma will be made in both Chembio devices (HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK and DPP HIV 1/2).

 Evaluation of the DPP HIV 1/2 Test and the HIV 1/2 Stat Pak Test Using Oral Fluid@highlight

This protocol is intended to test the feasibility of using the HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK and the DPP HIV 1/2 test (with and without the DPP Handheld Reader) to detect HIV antibodies in oral fluids.
