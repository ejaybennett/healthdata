(firstQuint)Evaluation of Phlebotomy as a Treatment for Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.

 In this study phlebotomy will be evaluated as a therapy for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a common and important cause of liver disease.

 Phlebotomy has been used for many years in the treatment of disorders of iron overload such as hemochromatosis, where it is well tolerated and improves symptoms and survival.

 There is some evidence that it is also effective in treating NAFLD.

 However, previous studies have not evaluated whether phlebotomy improves liver biopsy findings.

 We will measure the severity disease in NAFLD patients prior to phlebotomy therapy and again at the end of treatment.

 This will allow us to accurately determine the benefit of this therapy in these patients.
