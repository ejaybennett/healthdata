(thirdQuint)Radiation Therapy During and After Lumpectomy in Treating Women With Stage I or Stage II Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - To determine the feasibility and acute tolerability of intraoperative electron radiotherapy (IOERT) and external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) after lumpectomy in women with stage I or II breast cancer treated with breast conservation therapy.

 - To determine the local tumor control and distant tumor control rates in these patients.

 - To determine the long-term side effects and cosmetic outcome of IOERT to the tumor bed and EBRT after lumpectomy in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard lumpectomy.

 Patients with negative lymph nodes undergo intraoperative electron radiotherapy to the tumor bed.

 Beginning 2-8 weeks after surgery, patients undergo whole breast external beam radiotherapy once daily for 24-27 fractions.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 8 years.

 Radiation Therapy During and After Lumpectomy in Treating Women With Stage I or Stage II Breast Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.

 Giving radiation therapy during and after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving radiation therapy during and after lumpectomy and to see how well it works in treating women with stage I or stage II breast cancer.
