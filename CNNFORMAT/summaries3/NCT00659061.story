(secondQuint)Monitoring and Evaluation of Micronutrients (Sprinkles) Project.

 According to the recent National Nutrition Survey in Pakistan (2001-2002), approximately 66.

5% of children under five have anaemia.

 Looking at the magnitude of the problem, National Program for Family Planning (FP) and Primary Health Care (PHC) (also known as the Lady Health Workers (LHW) Program) has developed National Sprinkles Pilot Project Proposal with technical assistance of Micronutrient Initiative and Aga Khan University (AKU).

 As the projects technical partner, AKU is responsible to conduct the monitoring and evaluation of the project.

 The study will use a cluster randomized pre-post intervention design that compares before and after hemoglobin (Hb) measurements, serum ferritin, serum retinol and urinary iodine among children who received Sprinkles and age-appropriate feeding advice (Sprinkles-Advice group) and children who only receive age-appropriate feeding advice (Advice-only group).

 Age-appropriate feeding advice is part of the standard nutrition messages given by all Lady Health Workers (LHWs) during their community visits.

 However, intervention LHWs, will give additional advice regarding the benefits of Sprinkles and its appropriate use.

 The target population selected for the study consisted of children between the ages of six and eighteen months of age in the catchment area of the Lady Health Workers.
