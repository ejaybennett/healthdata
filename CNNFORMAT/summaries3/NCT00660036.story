(firstQuint)Phase I/II Study of Mitoxantrone, Etoposide and Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin for Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 The combination of mitoxantrone and etoposide is an active regimen in refractory/relapsed AML patients.

 In order to improve the efficacy of mitoxantrone and etoposide as second line therapy in patients with AML we proposed to conduct a phase I/II clinical trial combining gemtuzumab ozogamicin with mitoxantrone and etoposide.

 The phase I portion of the trial will determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin combined with mitoxantrone and etoposide and the phase II portion of the trial will determine the efficacy and safety of the combined regimen in patients with AML.
