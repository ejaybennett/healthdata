(thirdQuint)Removal of Endotracheal Tube Secretions Comprehensively Until Extubation.

 Thirty mechanically ventilated adult patients will be managed with standard suction catheters.

 Just prior to extubation, their physiological parameters (including work of breathing) will be recorded and acoustic reflectometry used to measure the degree of secretion accumulation within the endotracheal tube.

 The endotracheal tubes will then be cleaned using the CAM Catheters (Rescue Cath followed by Endotrach Cath) and the physiological parameters and endotracheal tube reflectometry measurements repeated for comparative analysis.

 Removal of Endotracheal Tube Secretions Comprehensively Until Extubation@highlight

The purpose of this study is to measure secretion accumulation within endotracheal tubes of mechanically ventilated patients and test the efficacy, safety and clinical impact of removing the secretions using novel airway management catheters (Complete Airway Management Catheters: CAM Rescue Cath and CAM Endotrach Cath).
