(firstQuint)Adjuvant Vitamin D With Corticosteroids in Active Crohn's Disease.

 Crohn's Disease is a form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

 It is caused by abnormal immune-mediated gut inflammation and is both chronic and difficult to treat.

 Symptoms are often unpleasant (e.

g.

 abdominal pain, diarrhoea, disfiguring fistulation) and often lead to surgery to remove diseased bowel.

 There is emerging evidence that Vitamin D, a nutrient largely produced in the skin upon exposure to sun-light, may possess properties regulating the immune system in IBD.

 In addition, vitamin D deficiency appears common in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

 This study aims to determine if the addition of vitamin D to standard corticosteroid treatment in active Crohn's Disease helps to achieve remission (resolution of symptoms).
