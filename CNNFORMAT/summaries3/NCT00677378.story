(firstQuint)Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid One (TRPV1) Receptor Expression in Children With Retrosternal Pain.

 Approximately 5% of children between 10-17 years of age report symptoms of heart burn, epigastric pain or regurgitation.

 This study will evaluate the changes in nerve innervation and TRPV1 receptor expression in children having upper endoscopy for evaluation of heart burn and abdominal pain.
