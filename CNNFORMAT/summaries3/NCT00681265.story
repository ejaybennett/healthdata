(secondQuint)Tear Film Break-up Time After Instillation of Artificial Tears.

 Subjects with varying degrees of dry eye syndrome were enrolled in a randomized, controlled, double masked, single site study.

 A new formulation of an artificial tear containing glycerin 1% as an active with polylysine-graft-polyethylene glycol as an excipient was compared against a leading commercial product with propylene glycol (0.

3%) and polyethylene glycol (0.

4%) as active ingredients with hydroxypropyl-guar as a gelling agent.

 The primary outcome was a comparison of tear film stability after eye drop instillation.

 Tear Film Break-up Time After Instillation of Artificial Tears@highlight

This study is an exploratory trial evaluating the tear film break-up time after a single eye drop instillation of over-the-counter artificial tears.

 The primary hypothesis is that tear film break up time will be greater for test than control eye.
