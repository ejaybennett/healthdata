(firstQuint)Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Immunogenicity of Bovine Collagen in ArteFill by Skin Testing.

 This is a single-center, open-label study in approximately 485 healthy male and female subjects to obtain 450 evaluable subjects.

 In this protocol, an ArteFill(R) Skin Test study will be conducted to evaluate the test's clinical utility to determine the incidence of positive skin reactions to ArteFill(R).

 The results of this skin test study will determine if the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction against ArteFill(R) without a skin test is no greater than the published historical risk of a hypersensitivity reaction against a Zyderm or Zyplast treatment after a patient demonstrates a negative response to a single Zyderm skin test.

 Based on prior clinical experience with ArteFill(R) implant in commercial use outside the United States, it is anticipated that no reactions will be observed.

 As such, it may be suggested that there is no practical use of the ArteFill(R) Skin Test for screening patients, and therefore, the test may be eliminated as a requirement prior to treatment with the ArteFill(R) product as is the clinical practice outside the United States.
