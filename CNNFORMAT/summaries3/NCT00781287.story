(fifthQuint)Raltegravir (Isentress/MK-0518) and HIV-1 Infected CD4 Cells During Acute/Early HIV-1.

 The study will be conducted at the UW Primary Infection Clinic and the UW AIDS Clinical Trials Unit.

 Secondary objectives will characterize safety, tolerability, plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ T-cell values.

 The 3-drug HAART will be chosen and provided by the subject.

 Raltegravir (Isentress/MK-0518) and HIV-1 Infected CD4 Cells During Acute/Early HIV-1@highlight

This is an investigator-initiated, two-year, randomized, controlled, single-center, open-label, pilot study comparing 3-drug highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to 3-drug HAART plus raltegravir for persons with acute and early HIV-1 infection.

 The study will test the hypothesis that use of the integrase inhibitor raltegravir (400 mg BID orally) to inhibit the integration step of the HIV-1 life cycle in conjunction with HAART in subjects with recently acquired HIV-1 infection will decrease the number of HIV-1 infected CD4+ T-cells to a greater extent than a 3-drug HAART regimen.
