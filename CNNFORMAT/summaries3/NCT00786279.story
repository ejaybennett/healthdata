(fifthQuint)Alcohol and Atherosclerosis Pilot Study.

 The feasibility of a long-term randomized trial of alcohol intake on clinical endpoints is uncertain.

 One approach that could minimize the size and duration of such a randomized trial would be to assess the effect of alcohol on progression of radiologically-defined atherosclerosis.

 We propose a proof-of-principle pilot study of the effect of longer-term alcohol intake on atherosclerosis.

 We will recruit and randomize 40 participants aged 55 and older at high risk for CHD to a six-month period of consumption of a single 150 ml glass per day of either 10% ethanol (approximating wine) or water.

 At baseline and after 6 months, we will assess aortic atherosclerosis using magnetic resonance imaging.

 We will determine adherence in several ways, including serum markers, dietary recalls, and measurement of unused beverage.

 The primary outcomes in this feasibility study will be compliance with alcohol intake and the two MRI examinations.

 As secondary outcomes, we will measure standard and novel cardiovascular risk markers, including inflammatory markers and measures of glucose metabolism.

 We will assess safety on a continual basis, including repeated testing of liver enzymes and blood counts.

 If successful, this pilot study will form the basis for a more definitive trial to determine the effect of alcohol intake on progression of atherosclerosis, which could itself establish the feasibility of even larger, longer-term studies of alcohol intake and occurrence of cardiovascular events.

 Alcohol and Atherosclerosis Pilot Study@highlight

We propose a pilot study to determine the feasibility of a long-term clinical trial of alcohol intake on atherosclerosis, the first step in determining whether moderate drinking prevents cardiovascular disease and hence in understanding the full health effects of alcohol across the population.

 We will randomize 40 participants aged 55 and older to a six-month period of consumption of 1 glass per day of either pure alcohol (diluted to the strength of wine) or water.

 At baseline and after 6 months, we will measure several standard and novel cardiovascular risk markers in the blood and will perform magnetic resonance imaging to measure atherosclerosis of the aorta.
