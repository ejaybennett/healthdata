 Endostar is free supported by Shangdong Simcere Medgene biotech co.

,Ltd.

 Endostar combination with Chemotherapy has been the first line treatment regimen to advanced NSCLC.

 Clinical data proved that Endostar was a wild spectrum and safe antiangiogenesis factor which could suppress almost 65 kinds of tumor mass in animal models and affect about 12 percent human genome.

 China NCCN colon or rectal cancer clinical practice guideline recommends Chemotherapy plus angiogenesis inhibitor as the first line treatment scheme.

 So we design FOLFOX4 plus Endostar to treat advanced colorectal cancer to research the RR and safety.

 We believe this treatment regimen may be a new approach to the advanced colorectal cancer patients.
