(secondQuint)Topical Nitric Oxide Trial in Chronic Non-Healing Wounds.

 The primary goal of this study is to determine the effects of topically applied gaseous nitric oxide on the bio-burden of chronic non-healing wounds of the lower extremities.

 Reports will include: - Comparisons of the demographics and diagnoses of those patients treated with ViaNOx-H.

 - Tabulation as to the organisms found and the bio-burden as measured by counts (0 to +4).

 - Tabulation of the number and types of adverse events during ViaNOx-H treatment.

 - Comparisons of the response of different organisms to ViaNOx-H treatment.

To determine the effects of topically applied ViaNOx-H for 8 hours daily for 2 weeks on the reduction of the bio-burden in biofilms on chronic non-healing wounds as recorded by measurements of wound size and wound culture.
