(fifthQuint)Enoxaparin and/or Minocycline in Acute Stroke.

 Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin (average molecular weight 4,500 daltons, vs.

 12,000 to 15,000 daltons for unfractionated heparin) administered subcutaneously and intravenously.

 It is a marketed drug FDA-approved in various clinical situations for: the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis; and in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.

 Minocycline is an orally administered antibiotic of the tetracycline class.

 It is a marketed drug FDA-approved for the treatment of various bacterial and rickettsial infections.

 Both medications have been found to be neuroprotective in experimental stroke models.

 Minocycline has shown promise in a human acute stroke study.

 This study is designed to investigate two logistically simple treatment regimens, singly or in combination, employing these medications for acute ischemic stroke: 1.

 pulsed intravenous (iv) administration of enoxaparin initiated within 6 hours and completed by 24 hours after stroke onset; and 2.

 oral minocycline treatment once daily for five days.

 The goal of treatment is neuroprotection: the limitation of the loss of brain tissue that follows ischemic stroke.

 Enoxaparin and/or Minocycline in Acute Stroke@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether enoxaparin, minocycline, or both medications in combination may help in recovery from acute stroke.

 Enoxaparin (brand name Lovenox(R)) is a medication approved for use in humans to prevent and to treat blood clots in deep veins in certain specific medical situations.

 Minocycline (brand name Minocin(R)) is a tetracycline antibiotic approved to treat a number of bacterial infections in humans.

 The investigators are studying these medications in acute human stroke because they have each been separately shown to reduce the amount of injured brain tissue in rats made to have acute ischemic stroke experimentally.

 In a human trial comparing minocycline with placebo (a sugar pill) acute ischemic stroke patients who took minocycline had better recovery after 1 week, 1 month and 3 months than patients who took placebo.
