(thirdQuint)A Phase 1/2, Open-Label, Dose-Escalation Study of JI-101, in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 JI-101 is a compound being developed for the treatment of patients with solid tumors; specifically patients for which no approved therapy or standard of care is available or have solid tumors and have failed standard of care therapy.

 JI-101 is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR), and EphB4 receptor, each of which plays an important role in driving vascularization (angiogenesis and vasculogenesis) during normal development and tumorigenesis.

 JI-101 inhibits the growth of new blood vessels, which in turn, may slow or prevent the growth of tumors.

 The purpose of this open label study is to treat patients with advanced solid tumors, with increasing doses of JI-101, thereby providing information about the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

 The study will also examine safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and may evaluate the effects of the drug on tumor metabolism.

 During this dose-escalation study, at least two patients will be dosed at each dose level (cohort).

 The patients must complete 21 days of dosing and safety results will be reviewed prior to any patients being assigned the next higher dose level.

 A continuous reassessment method will be utilized to escalate JI-101 doses between cohorts.

 Doses will be increased, with an anticipated high dose of 800mg per day.

 If the MTD is not reached, an optimal biologic dose (OBD) will be determined based on the highest doses that are tolerable with acceptable efficacy.

 The cohort at MTD or OBD will be expanded to include up to 30 patients with solid tumors to further explore the safety and tolerability of orally-administered JI-101.

 A Phase 1/2, Open-Label, Dose-Escalation Study of JI-101, in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors@highlight

The purpose of this study, the first clinical trial of JI-101, is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of JI-101 when given orally to patients with solid tumors.

 Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the effects of the drug on tumor metabolism will also be studied.

 JI-101 is an inhibitor of new blood vessel growth that may provide benefit to patients with solid tumors that have failed standard therapeutic regimens.
