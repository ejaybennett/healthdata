(thirdQuint)Immunological Characterization of Bronchoalveolar Cells in Normals.

 To determine the functional capabilities of cells obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and peripheral blood monocytes from normal individuals.

 The ongoing objective varies from investigation to investigation but in general the investigational goals are to better understand the immune function of monocytes purified from normal volunteers.

 In some instances the emphasis will be upon comparing the specific immune function (e.

g.

 ability to sense endotoxin and release a cytokine) from blood monocytes as compared to human alveolar macrophages.

 This comparison is not the only goal of the study, however.

 In many cases the immune function of the monocyte will be sufficient in and of itself as an investigational goal.

 In other cases the same is true of alveolar macrophage function.

 Immunological Characterization of Bronchoalveolar Cells in Normals@highlight

To obtain the monocytes (white blood cells) from normal volunteers for the purpose of studying how proteins, fats, carbohydrates, as well as RNA and DNA for gene expression, relate to immunity.

 This information will be compared to other studies in patients with lung diseases such as Emphysema, Sarcoidosis, and Interstitial Pulmonary Fibrosis.
