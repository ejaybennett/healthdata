(thirdQuint)Exercise for Breast Cancer Patients (EXCAP).

 Fatigue is a frequently reported side effect of cancer treatment.

 Fatigue related to cancer and its treatment is different from fatigue occurring in other situations and its specific causes have not been identified.

 Exercise may or may not improve this type of fatigue.

 The purpose of this study is to examine how cancer treatments impact normal lifestyle physical activity patterns and participation in physical activity, as well as the ability of a walking and progressive resistance exercise program to reduce cancer-related fatigue in breast cancer patients.

 This study also examines if the walking and progressive resistance exercise program improves other factors such as quality of life, depression, anxiety, ability to sleep, self esteem, cardiovascular fitness, energy expenditure, muscular strength, muscle mass, and immune function (as measured by inflammatory cytokines).

 Exercise for Breast Cancer Patients (EXCAP)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine if exercise helps improve cancer-related fatigue.

 Hypothesis: A structured home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise program will be efficacious in relieving cancer-related fatigue, preventing aerobic and anaerobic deconditioning and skeletal muscle wasting, as well as improving inflammatory cytokine profiles in breast cancer survivors as well as those receiving radiation treatment.
