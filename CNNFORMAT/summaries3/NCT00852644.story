(secondQuint)Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Treating Patients With Stage I or Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - To establish the maximum tolerated dose of CyberKnife(R) hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery in patients with medically inoperable, stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer.

 - To establish the relationship between positron emission tomography (PET) response and local control and survival using fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT imaging before treatment and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo placement of 3 gold fiducial markers by CT-guidance or bronchoscopy.

 Patients then undergo CyberKnife(R) hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery over 45-120 minutes twice weekly for 2 weeks.

 Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT scan at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after completion of treatment.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 4 years.

RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiosurgery can send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating patients with stage I or stage II non-small cell lung cancer.
