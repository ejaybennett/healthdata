(thirdQuint)Effect Of Risedronate On Bone Mass In Older Men Receiving Neoadjuvant Therapy For Prostate Cancer.

 A 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted, including 40 men aged 55 years receiving LHRH-agonist treatment for 6 months for locally advanced prostate cancer.

 Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip was measured every 6 months.

 In addition, bone turnover markers including N-telopeptide, serum C-telopeptide and procollagen peptide, and 25-OH vitamin D and intact parathyroid hormone were measured at baseline and at 6 months.

Men treated with neoadjuvant luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)-agonists such as leuprolide and goserelin for prostate cancer will become hypogonadal due to hormonal suppression and demonstrate increased bone turnover and consequent bone loss at the hip and spine.

 This bone loss can be prevented by treatment with 35 mg/week of risedronate.
