(secondQuint)Sunitinib in Soft Tissue Sarcoma.

 This is a Phase II, open label, nonrandomized single institution study to determine efficacy and toxicity of sunitinib in certain subtypes of soft tissue sarcomas.

 Patients are stratified according to sarcoma histology (angiosarcoma vs.

 hemangioendothelioma vs.

 Kaposi's sarcoma).

 The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients with metastatic, locally advanced, or locally recurrent vascular soft tissue sarcoma treated with sunitinib.

 Secondary objectives will be to 1) To determine 3 month and 6 month progression free survival, defined as patients that are alive and without evidence of progression of disease on reassessment of disease after while being treated; 2) To determine overall survival of patients treated with this regimen; 3) To determine safety and tolerability of sunitinib in this patient population.
