(secondQuint)Safety and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Nitrite for Prevention of Cerebral Vasospasm.

 Intravenous sodium nitrite has been shown to prevent and to reverse cerebral vasospasm in a primate model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

 This was a Phase IIA dose escalation study of sodium nitrite to determine its safety in patients with aneurysmal SAH and to establish its pharmacokinetics during a 14 day infusion.

 Sodium nitrite was delivered intravenously for 14 days in 18 patients with SAH from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm using a dose escalation scheme in three cohorts of 6 patients each (3 nitrite, 3 saline), with a maximum dose of 64 nmol/min/kg.

 Sodium nitrite blood levels were frequently sampled and measured using mass spectroscopy and blood methemoglobin levels were continuously monitored using a pulse oximeter.

The purpose of the study is to examine the safety of a 14 day infusion of sodium nitrite, and to study the pharmacokinetics of nitrite, during a 14 day infusion in patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms.
