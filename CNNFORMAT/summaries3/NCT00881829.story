(thirdQuint)Oxitone Blood Validation.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the SpO2 accuracy and performance of the Oxitone Medical Oxitone 1000 pulse oximeter during non-motion conditions over the range of 70-100% SaO2 as compared to arterial blood samples assessed by CO-Oximetry for SpO2 validation.

 The end goal is to show the SpO2 accuracy performance of the Oxitone 1000 pulse oximeter.

 It is expected that the Accuracy Root Mean Square (Arms) performance of the Oxitone 1000 pulse oximeter will meet a specification of 3 or better in non-motion conditions for the range of 70-100% SaO2 thereby demonstrating an acceptable SpO2 accuracy performance specification.
