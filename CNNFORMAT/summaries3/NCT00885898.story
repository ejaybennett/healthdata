(fifthQuint)Out-of-Hospital Non-Invasive Ventilation for Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure.

 Single center, prospective, randomized, intention-to-treat clinical trial.

 The study has been performed within a two tier EMS system of a major city.

 Prehospital emergency physicians are on scene in every patient enrolled to the study.

 Patients with acute respiratory failure (SaO2 20/min) were enrolled to the study using envelopes for randomisation for either "conventional" (O2 + medication) or "NIV.

" Vital signs have been documented as well as venous blood gases have been taken every 10 minutes after treatment has been started.

 Primary endpoints are 28-day mortality, hospital-, ICU- and respirator-days, SAPS, SOFA II and complications.

 Secondary endpoints are out-of-hospital incidence of invasive ventilation, effect on SpO2, CO2, respiratory rate, heart rate and blood pressure.

 Out-of-Hospital Non-Invasive Ventilation for Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure@highlight

In the past, patients suffering from acute respiratory failure had to be treated with Oxygen and specific medication, or - if this had not been sufficient - had to be anesthesized and had to undergo endotracheal intubation for invasive ventilation.

 Nowadays, since emergency ventilators are available that can be used for non-invasive ventilation, the purpose of this study is to investigate if non-invasive ventilation is safe, feasible and effective for the treatment of acute respiratory failure and if less patients will need to be intubated out-of-hospital as well as in the further course.
