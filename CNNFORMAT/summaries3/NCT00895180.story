(fifthQuint)Ramucirumab or Anti-PDGFR Alpha Monoclonal Antibody IMC-3G3 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess the progression-free survival rate at 6 months after treatment with ramucirumab or anti-PDGFR alpha monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

 Secondary - To evaluate the acute and late toxicities associated with these regimens.

 - To assess the objective tumor response rate.

 - To estimate the overall survival of these patients.

 - To describe the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and immunogenicity of these regimens.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are sequentially assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

 - Group 1: Patients receive ramucirumab IV over 1 hour on day 1.

 Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 - Group 2: Patients receive anti-PDGFR alpha monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 IV over 60-90 minutes on day 1.

 Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as ramucirumab and anti-PDGFR alpha monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 (Olaratumab), can block tumor growth in different ways.

 Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

 Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well ramucirumab or anti-PDGFR alpha monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 works in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
