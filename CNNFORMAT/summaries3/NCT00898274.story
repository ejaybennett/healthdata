(thirdQuint)Study of Blood Samples From Older Patients at High Risk of Developing Prostate Cancer and From Healthy Male Participants.

 OBJECTIVES: - To determine whether there are any changes in pro-oxidant-antioxidant profiles in patients who are at high risk for developing prostate cancer.

 - To compare the profiles of these patients with those of healthy controls.

 OUTLINE: Participants undergo blood sample collection.

 Samples are used to measure levels of antioxidant enzymes (i.

e.

, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, and reduced glutathione) and biomarkers of oxidative stress and DNA damage in leukocytes (i.

e.

, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS] and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine).

 Samples are analyzed via antioxidant enzyme assay, TBARS assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 participants (20 at high risk for developing prostate cancer and 20 healthy controls) will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients who are at high risk of developing prostate cancer may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood samples from patients at high risk of developing prostate cancer and from healthy male participants.
