(thirdQuint)Study of Circulating Cancer Cells in Patients With Metastatic Breast, Ovarian, Colon, or Pancreatic Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - To assess frequency of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with metastatic ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and colon cancers.

 - To assess the variability in number of CTCs between patients with the same tumor type.

 - To correlate the number of CTCs with extent of tumor burden as measured by tumor markers, imaging, and the number of metastatic sites and proliferation and apoptotic markers.

 OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected before treatment and analyzed using molecular detection techniques to detect circulating cancer cells.

 Samples are assessed by immunofluorescence for markers of proliferation and survival (e.

g.

, EGFR, phosphorylated EGFR, AKT, phosphorylated AKT, cytokeratins, MAPK, Src, and FAK).

 Study of Circulating Cancer Cells in Patients With Metastatic Breast, Ovarian, Colon, or Pancreatic Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Counting the number of circulating cancer cells in samples of blood from patients with metastatic cancer may help doctors find out how much the cancer has spread.

 PURPOSE: This research study is looking at the number of circulating cancer cells in patients with metastatic breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, or pancreatic cancer.
