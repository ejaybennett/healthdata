(thirdQuint)SWOG-9245 Collecting and Storing Tissue Samples From Patients With Relapsed or Recurrent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma After Treatment on a Southwest Oncology Group Clinical Trial.

 OBJECTIVES: - Acquire fresh snap-frozen lymphoma tissue from patients with relapsed or recurrent non-Hodgkin lymphoma after treatment on a Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) clinical trial.

 - Establish a standard set of procedures for routine acquisition, banking, and study of lymphoma tissues within the SWOG.

 - Use repository tissue to establish clinical correlations via presently activated phenotyping studies and future projected molecular studies assessing specimen DNA and RNA status.

 - Examine the biology of therapy failure in relationship to changes in pretreatment and post-treatment immunophenotypic data.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Tissues collected at biopsy are snap-frozen and archived for future molecular and genetic studies.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified.

RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of tissue from patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma to study in the laboratory may help the study of cancer in the future.

 PURPOSE: This laboratory study is collecting and storing tissue samples from patients with relapsed or recurrent non-Hodgkin lymphoma after treatment on a Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) clinical trial.
