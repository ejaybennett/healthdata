(thirdQuint)Collecting Stem Cells in Patients With Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia.

 OBJECTIVES: - Harvest and store adequate CD34+ stem cells from patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) for potential future use in transplantation strategies.

 - Evaluate the ability to harvest stem cells after therapy for WM (e.

g.

, fludarabine-based chemotherapy) by evaluating the number of days to adequate harvest.

 - Collect aliquots of stem cells for future research analysis as part of a WM database project.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo collection of autologous stem cells beginning on day 4 or 5 and continuing until an adequate number of stem cells are collected.

 Cells are then cryopreserved.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Collecting and storing stem cells to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about collecting stem cells from patients who have undergone treatment for Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

 PURPOSE: This laboratory study is collecting stem cells from patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.
