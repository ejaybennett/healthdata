(secondQuint)Topic Antiinflammatory Therapy Added to Selective Photocoagulation in Macular Edema.

 Selective photocoagulation is the standard treatment for clinically significant macular edema.

 This treatment decreased the incidence of moderate visual loss in the long term.

 Nonetheless, in the first six weeks after treatment it is induced, probably because an exacerbation of macular edema secondary to treatment.

 An inflammatory response has been reported after selective photocoagulation.

 Therefore, antiinflammatory therapy like ketorolac or nepafenac could be useful to manage center point thickness secondary to selective photocoagulation in diabetics with macular edema.
