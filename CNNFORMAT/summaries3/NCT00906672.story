(firstQuint)Medico Economic Evaluation of Dermal Substitute Integra for Coverage of Inferior Limb Traumatic Skin Loss.

 Traumatic skin loss with bone or tendon exposure essentially affects inferior limbs.

 There are considered serious as they often lead to functional and esthetical consequences, and they generally affect young people.

 Flap surgery is the treatment of reference for these skin losses.

 This technique requires expensive material and a lot of medical staff.

 The intervention and duration of hospitalisation are often long with heavy medication.

 Post surgery complications or disabling sequelea involve surgical re-interventions which increase duration of hospital stay and medical staff availability.

 The dermal substitute Integra(R) (Integra LifeSciences Corporation) is an advanced wound care device comprised of a porous matrix of cross-linked bovine tendon collagen and glycosaminoglycan and a semi-permeable polysiloxane (silicone layer).

 This medical device allows formation of a neoderm.

 The silicon layer is a temporary layer which is removed when the neoderm is totally built.

 This surgery is fast, non-invasive, with short hospital stay and limited complications which can be treated easily.

 Objective of the study: to assess medico-economic interest of innovative surgery using dermal substitute Integra(R) compared to the reference using flap surgery in the treatment of traumatic skin loss of inferior limbs.

 Assessment will be based on re-interventions incidence, long-term functional and esthetical scar results and total cost of each technique.

 Study design: multicenter, randomized, open label, parallel design, clinical trial in 12 French plastic surgery / burn care centres.

 Planned number of enrolled patients: 120 (80 patients receiving Integra(R) and 40 patients receiving the flap surgery).

 Patients will be randomized in 1 of the 2 groups, with an imbalance in favour of the innovative technique.

 Duration of enrollment: 24 months Duration of patient follow up: 18 months.
