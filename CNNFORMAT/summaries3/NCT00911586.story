(firstQuint)Pharmacokinetic Study to Determine Time to Steady-state.

 Serum testosterone levels will be obtained in hypogonadal (serum testosterone <300 ng/dL) males receiving testosterone undecanoate capsules administered twice daily.

 Serum samples will be obtained consecutively in the morning on several days during one month of open-label treatment to confirm the time at which steady-state is reached.
