(secondQuint)Study of Participants With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase III trial.

 Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by pemetrexed or paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab as their study treatment.

 Participants randomized to Pemetrexed + Carboplatin + Pemetrexed will receive folic acid, vitamin B12, and dexamethasone as stated in the pemetrexed label.

 Before administration of paclitaxel, participants randomized to Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Bevacizumab will receive premedication (dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, and cimetidine or ranitidine) as recommended in the paclitaxel label.
