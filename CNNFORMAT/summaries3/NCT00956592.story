(thirdQuint)Clinical Evaluation of the Storz CMAC Laryngoscope.

 Patients will be specifically screened for predictors by history and physical exam of potential airway difficulty.

 The role of video laryngoscopy in airways predicted to be difficult is poorly defined.

 This study aims to recognize if video laryngoscopy is more useful than conventional laryngoscopy as a first attempt for those with anticipated difficulty.
