(firstQuint)Bone Mineral Changes Around Stemless and Stemmed Cementless Femoral Components.

 Stress shielding related bone resorption in the proximal femur after total hip arthroplasty continues to be a problem.

 The purpose of this prospective, randomized study was to evaluate which of the two anatomical stem designs achieved a more physiological load transfer by assessing bone mineral changes in the proximal femur after stem implantation.

The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in stress shielding and bone resorption of the proximal femur in two anatomical stem total hip designs.
