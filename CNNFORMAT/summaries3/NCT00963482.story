(secondQuint)Smoking Cessation in Alcoholics.

 The study is designed as a randomised, controlled trial conducted in an inpatient alcohol treatment institution.

 Shortly after alcohol detoxification, smokers are offered to voluntarily participate in a smoking cessation program.

 Participation is possible if patients either want to stop smoking or to reduce their consumption for at least 50%.

 Patients are asked about their smoking behaviour at the following time points: at admission (T0), after finishing the smoking cessation program or the control condition (T1), one month later by phone (T2) and six months later in a closing meeting (T3).

 Urine samples and CO-breath controls are taken to check both nicotine and alcohol abstinence.

 Smoking Cessation in Alcoholics@highlight

Most alcohol-dependent individuals are heavy smokers.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a specific smoking cessation program (based on cognitive-behavioral therapy) for inpatient alcohol-dependent smokers is more effective than a control condition (treatment as usual).
