(secondQuint)Probiotics for the Prevention of Antibiotics Associated Diarrhoea and Clostridium Difficile Associated Diarrhoea.

 The investigators aim to find out whether VSL#3 can prevent Antibiotic associated diarrhoea and Clostridium Difficile associated diarrhoea when VSL#3 is giving during a course of systemic antibiotics.

 Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 proportion to receive either one sachet of VSL#3 or a similar looking placebo twice a day.

 This will be given for the length of the antibiotic course and another week thereafter.

 Follow-up will last until 28 days after the last antibiotic dose.

 Patient restarted on antibiotics during follow-up will be restarted on the trial medication and the 28 day follow-up will be recommenced.

 This trial has 2 co-primary outcome measures.
