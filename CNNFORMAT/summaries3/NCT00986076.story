(secondQuint)Clinical Trial on Anti-inflammatory Effect of Low-Molecular Weight Heparin in Pediatric Cataract Surgery.

 Despite advances in cataract surgery in children, postoperative inflammation is a significant complication following pediatric cataract surgery.

 Any drug that prevents or decreases this inflammation would be beneficial.

 Heparin has anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects as well as anticoagulant properties.

 Several studies on animal and adult human eyes show that adding heparin to the irrigating solution during cataract surgery results in less disturbance of the blood-aqueous barrier and helps prevent posterior capsule opacification (PCO).

 A prospective, randomized, controlled and masked study is mandatory to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of Low-molecular weight Heparin for pediatric cataract surgery.

The purpose of this study is to determine if intraocular infusion of low-molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) influences postoperative inflammation following pediatric cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.
