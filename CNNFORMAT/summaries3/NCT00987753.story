(thirdQuint)Study Evaluating the Safety and Tolerability of L-377202.

 This is an open, nonrandomized, rising-dose study in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer.

 Patients will be treated with L-377202 once every three weeks.

 Plasma concentrations of L-377202, liberated doxorubicin, and leu-doxorubicin will be obtained at defined time intervals throughout the study.

 At least 1 patient will be treated at each dose level until there is evidence of greater than or equal to Grade 2 drug-related toxicity.

 Each patient will be treated at only 1 dose level, although multiple cycles may be administered until signs of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity are evident.

 Doses will be doubled for each subsequent cohort of patients until evidence of greater than or equal to Grade 2 drug-related toxicity.

 Upon documentation of greater than or equal to Grade 2 drug-related toxicity, subsequent dose escalations will proceed along the modified Fibonacci scale and enroll at least 3 patients per dose level until 1 patient experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

 Study Evaluating the Safety and Tolerability of L-377202@highlight

The primary purpose of this study is to (1) determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of L-377202 administered once every 3 weeks, (2) evaluate the safety and tolerability of L-377202 including the dose-limiting adverse effects of treatment with L-377202, and (3) assess the pharmacokinetics of various doses of L-377202 and the plasma profile of liberated doxorubicin and leu-doxorubicin.
