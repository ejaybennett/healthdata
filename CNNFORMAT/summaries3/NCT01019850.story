(fifthQuint)N2007-03: Vorinostat and 131-I MIBG in Treating Patients With Resistant or Relapsed Neuroblastoma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat in combination with iobenguane I 131 in patients with resistant or relapsed neuroblastoma.

 - To define the toxicities of vorinostat in combination with therapeutic doses of iobenguane I 131 in these patients.

 Secondary - To describe, within the context of a phase I study, the response rate in patients treated with vorinostat and iobenguane I 131.

 - To describe histone acetylation levels and norepinephrine transporter mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after treatment with different doses of vorinostat.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-14 and iobenguane I 131 IV over 1 1/2-2 hours on day 3.

 Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 17.

 Blood samples may be collected periodically for correlative biological studies.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

RATIONALE: Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Radioactive drugs, such as iobenguane I 131, may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells.

 Giving vorinostat together with iobenguane I 131 may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving vorinostat together with iobenguane I 131 in treating patients with resistant or relapsed neuroblastoma.
