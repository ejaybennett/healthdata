(thirdQuint)Effects of Antihypertensive Drugs in Patients With Hypertension and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension have a significant interrelationship, and both disorders are well known risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

 Treating them appropriately may improve the prognosis of the patients.

 Presently, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the first-line therapy for OSA, and angiotensin II receptor blockers and long-acting calcium channel blockers for hypertension in Japan.

 Therefore, in the present study, we wanted to compare the effects of these different types of antihypertensive drugs on the control of blood pressure in patients with OSA whose hypertension is not controlled well after CPAP therapy.
