(thirdQuint)Effect of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing(CPET) in Patient With Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

 Patients will be included if they have overlap syndrome.

 Patients will undergo a spirometry and CPET before being started on CPAP.

 Those tests will be repeated after 8-12 weeks of CPAP use.

 Patients will be excluded if they have any contraindication to mild exercise or they can't perform an exercise test due to limited mobility.

 Effect of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing(CPET) in Patient With Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)@highlight

Nasal CPAP will improve cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) performance in patients with overlap syndrome(COPD and OSA).

 Nasal CPAP is proven to improve cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with OSA.

 The investigators hypothesis is that patients with overlap syndrome will have a greater improvement in their cardiopulmonary exercise testing besides a possible improvement in their lung function test and airway resistance.
