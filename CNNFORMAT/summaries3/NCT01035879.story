(secondQuint)Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of MBX-2982 Administered Daily for 4 Weeks as Monotherapy in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.

 Approximately 100 patients will be randomized in this study, 20 to each of of the three MBX-2982 treatment groups, 20 to placebo, and 20 to the sitagliptin group.

 Patients will be taking 3 tablets and 1 capsule daily.

 This sample size provides the minimum number expected to ensure a power of at least 80% to detect a 20% decrease in the weighted mean glucose level associated with an extended mixed meal tolerance test (with 2 standardized meals) relative to placebo after 4 weeks of daily treatment with MBX-2982, assuming a drop-out rate of 20% and a common SD of 25%.

To define the relative efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles of oral daily MBX-2982 at three different daily doses vs.

 placebo and sitagliptin 100 mg when administered for up to 4 weeks in patients that are treatment-naive or taking a single anti-diabetic medication (non-TZD, non-injectable).
