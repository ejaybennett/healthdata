(thirdQuint)The International Nocturnal Oxygen (INOX) Trial.

 Background Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is the only component of the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that improves survival in patients with severe daytime hypoxemia (defined as an arterial oxygen pressure [PaO2] measured in stable state = 30% of the recording time with transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation 90%.

 Placebo: The patients allocated in the control group will receive room air delivered by defective concentrator.

 The comparison will be double blind.

 Primary outcomes The primary outcomes of this trial are mortality from all cause or requirement for LTOT (composite outcome).

 Secondary outcomes Secondary outcomes will include quality of life and utility measures, costs from a societal perspective and compliance with oxygen therapy.

 Trial duration: The follow-up period lasts at least 4 years.

 We expect this trial to be completed within 8 years.

 The International Nocturnal Oxygen (INOX) Trial@highlight

This multicenter randomized placebo controlled trial aims to determine if in patients with COPD not qualifying for LTOT but presenting significant nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturation, whether nocturnal oxygen therapy provided for a period of 4 years decreases mortality or delay the prescription of LTOT.
