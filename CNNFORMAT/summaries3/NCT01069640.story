(secondQuint)Safety Study of Peptide Cancer Vaccine To Treat HLA-A*02-positive Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 The investigators previously identified three novel HLA-A*0201 or HLA-A*0206-restricted epitope peptides, which were derived from a cancer-testis antigen, URLC10, as targets for cancer vaccination against lung cancer.

 In this phase I trial, the investigators examine using a combination of these three peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for HHLA-A*0201 or HLA-A*0206-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients who failed to standard therapy.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immune response and clinical efficacies of HLA-A*0201 or HLA-A*0206 restricted epitope peptides URLC10 emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 for advanced non-small cell lung cancers.
