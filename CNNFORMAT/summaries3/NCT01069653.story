(secondQuint)Safety Study of Peptide Cancer Vaccine To Treat HLA-A*24-positive Advanced Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 The investigators previously identified three novel HLA-A*2402-restricted epitope peptides, which were derived from two cancer-testis antigens, CDCA1 and KIF20A, as targets for cancer vaccination against lung cancer.

 In this phase I trial, the investigators examine using a combination of these two peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for HLA-A*2402-positive advanced small cell lung cancer patients who failed to standard therapy.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immune response and clinical efficacies of HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides CDCA1 and KIF20A emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 for advanced small cell lung cancers.
