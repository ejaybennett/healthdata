(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study for Cognitive Deficits in Adult Subjects With Schizophrenia.

 This is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABT-126 in approximately 210 adults with schizophrenia.

 Subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment groups (ABT-126 Dose 1, ABT-126 Dose 2 or placebo) for a 12-week Treatment Period.

 The purpose of this research study is to find out whether ABT-126 compared to placebo can improve cognition and what side effects ABT-126 may cause.

 Cognition is the way a person thinks, and it includes abilities like paying attention, focusing, remembering things, and solving problems.
