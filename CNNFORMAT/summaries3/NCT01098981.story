(secondQuint)Phase 3, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blinded Trial of the Combined Lysis of Thrombus With Ultrasound and Systemic Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) for Emergent Revascularization in Acute Ischemic Stroke.

 The primary objective of this trial is to provide information regarding the efficacy of a combined treatment with transcranial US and systemic tPA (Target group) compared to systemic tPA alone (Control group) in subjects with acute ischemic stroke.

 The primary efficacy endpoint is functional outcome at 3 months from stroke onset (modified Rankin Score ordinal shift analysis).

 The primary safety endpoint is the proportion of subjects in the Target vs Control group experiencing symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) within 24 hours of treatment.

This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transcranial ultrasound (US) as an adjunctive therapy to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment in subjects with acute ischemic stroke.
