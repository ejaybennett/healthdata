(secondQuint)Phase I Bortezomib (VELCADE) in Combo With Pralatrexate in Relapsed/Refractory MM.

 This is an open-label Phase I dose-escalation safety study of VELCADE in combination with pralatrexate in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma.

 In a standard 3+3 dose escalation trial design, escalating doses of pralatrexate in combination with VELCADE will be studied sequentially, with at least 3 patients in each dose level until the MTD is determined.

 Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and MTD are determined during cycle 1 of treatment.
