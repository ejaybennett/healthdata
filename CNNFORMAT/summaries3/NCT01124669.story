(thirdQuint)Biomarkers in Blood Samples From Patients With Refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Previously Treated With Sorafenib Tosylate.

 OBJECTIVES: - To determine the mutation rates of BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with sorafenib tosylate on protocol ECOG-2501.

 - To determine the association between BRAF, KRAS, or EGFR mutation status and clinical benefits in patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 DNA is isolated from archived plasma samples and analyzed for BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR mutations.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in blood samples from patients with refractory non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with sorafenib tosylate.
