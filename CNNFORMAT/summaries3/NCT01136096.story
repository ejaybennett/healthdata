(firstQuint)Effects of Exercise Behavior Modification on Plasma Adiponectin and Insulin Resistance in High Risk Subjects of Diabetes.

 This randomized clinical trial was designed to investigate whether a home-based exercise could improve adiponectin levels, exercise behavior and metabolic risk factors (insulin resistance, metabolic components and physical fitness) in subjects with at least a diabetic risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 Participants were randomly allocated to either a control group or a home-based exercise group.

 All participants were evaluated for outcome measures at baseline, and at 3-month 6-month and 9-month follow-up after engaging in the intervention.
