(secondQuint)Chlorhexidine Mouthrinses and Plaque Control.

 Chlorhexidine (CLX) mouthrinse has been the gold standard as antiplaque solution.

However, if its efficiency seems to be preserved even if the chlorhexidine concentration is bellow 0.

10%, the formulation of the final product may affect the effectiveness.

 Thus, it can be concluded from this study that 0.

12% CLX alcohol base mouthrinse is significantly more effective in inhibiting plaque than the diluted 0.

1% CLX non-alcohol base containing formaldehyde mouthrinse.
