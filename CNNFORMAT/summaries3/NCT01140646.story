(thirdQuint)Evaluation of SAMe for Hot Flashes.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the impact of SAMe on hot flash scores in women with a history of breast cancer or women who do not wish to take estrogen therapy for fear of increased risk of breast cancer.

 II.

 To evaluate the toxicity of SAMe in this study population.

 III.

 To evaluate the effect of SAMe using quality-of-life (QOL) measures.

 OUTLINE: During the first week, participants will complete a daily, prospective hot flash diary and complete baseline questionnaires and will not be taking any study medication.

 After this baseline week, participants will receive oral s-adenosyl-L-methionine, 400 mg, once daily on days 8-14 and twice daily on days 15-49 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

RATIONALE: S-adenosyl-L-methionine may help relieve hot flashes in women based upon its ability to potentially modulate serotonin.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well s-adenosyl-L-methionine works in treating hot flashes in women with a history of breast cancer or those who do not wish to take estrogen due to a perceived increased risk of breast cancer.
