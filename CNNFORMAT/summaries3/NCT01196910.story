(secondQuint)Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (DTMS) as a Treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Adults.

 Attention deficit disorder in adults may be due to hypoactivity of prefrontal areas of the brain.

 Increasing the activity of these areas may help improve symptoms in many of these patients.

 In addition there is evidence as to dysfunction in both hemispheres of the brain, but it is difficult to determine the contribution of each hemisphere's pattern of activity to behavioral impairment.

 The purpose of this study is to use high-frequency DTMS to stimulate activity either on the left side of the prefrontal cortex (one arm), or on the right side (a second arm), to see if such stimulation improves attention, comparing to sham DTMS simulation (a third arm).

The aim of the study is to assess the effect of left or right high-frequency DTMS on ADHD symptoms, cognitive performance and decision-making ability of ADHD adults, and to compare this to the effect of sham DTMS on ADHD adults
