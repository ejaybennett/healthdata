(thirdQuint)Clinician-Collected Versus Patient-Collected Cervical Pap Smears.

 The SoloPap "kit" provides to subjects who would not otherwise have a Pap smear done a convenient and private way to collect samples and ship them to a laboratory for processing.

 The current study is pilot/pre-cursor study for a larger subsequent study that aims to determine whether SoloPap is truly noninferior to clinician-collected Pap smears in detecting cervical pathology.

 It will also determine user preference and willingness to perform a self- test.
