(thirdQuint)Two Way Bioequivalence Study Under Fed Conditions.

 An open-label randomized, single oral dose, two way crossover bioequivalence study to compare ondansetron Orally Dissolving FilmStrip (ODFS) 8mg with Zofran Orally Disintegrating Tablets [ODT(R) (Containing Ondansetron 8 mg)] in 48 healthy, adult, human study participants under fed conditions.

 Volunteers who signed the consent form and showed their willingness to participate in the study were enrolled.

 Volunteers who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria and found to be healthy on physical examination with laboratory investigation values within reference limits were considered eligible to be admitted into the study.

 Study participants were fasted for 10 hours prior to dosing in both periods.

 Dosing was conducted as per the randomization schedule in each period under fed conditions.

A washout period of 7 days was observed between the two periods.
