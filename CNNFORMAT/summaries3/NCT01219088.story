 Intrathecal Morphine,Femoral Nerve Block,Periarticular Bupivacaine Infiltration for Pain After Intramedullary Hip Screw@highlight

Falls are a common problem in elderly patients resulting fractured femur, which require early operation.

 Adequate postoperative pain control will provide good recovery.

 The investigators will compare the efficacy of postoperative pain control among intrathecal morphine, femoral nerve block, and periarticular infiltration with bupivacaine in patients undergone intramedullary hip screw under spinal anesthesia.
