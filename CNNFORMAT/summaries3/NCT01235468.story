(secondQuint)Allogenic Transplantation of Ex-vivo Expanded Cord Blood (CB).

 Stem cell transplantation is a curative approach for patients with hematological malignancies.

 Umbilical cord blood is a source of stem cells for transplantation in patients with no related donor.

 However, in adults, the number of stem cells in a single unit, may be too low to allow engraftment, and the time to engraftment may be prolonged, increasing the risks of the transplant.

 In this study, we expand part of the cord blood unit, in the lab, trying to increase unit size, such that it would be suitable for adults, and would allow safe engraftment.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety profile and tolerability of infusion of cord blood cells expanded in the lab and to evaluated whether through the infusion of expanded cells it is possible to expedite engraftment time after transplantation.
