(fifthQuint)Early Discharge and Outpatients Care in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Acute Myeloid Leukemia Previously Treated With Intensive Chemotherapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Estimate the early death rate in patients discharged after completion of intensive induction or salvage chemotherapy.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Compare the costs incurred by patients discharged early after induction or salvage chemotherapy with similar patients who are discharged only after their blood counts recover.

 II.

 Compare resource utilization (transfusions, etc.

) in patients discharged early after induction or salvage chemotherapy with similar patients who are discharged only after blood count recovery.

 III.

 Compare the quality of life in patients discharged early after induction or salvage chemotherapy with similar patients who are discharged only after their blood counts recover.

 OUTLINE: Patients are discharged within 72 hours after completion of chemotherapy and undergo standard outpatient care by a registered nurse (RN), physician assistant (PA), or resident/fellow at a local facility or the study center approximately 3 times per week, as clinically indicated for up to 45 days.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up for 1 month.

 Early Discharge and Outpatients Care in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Acute Myeloid Leukemia Previously Treated With Intensive Chemotherapy@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well early discharge and outpatient care works in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia previously treated with intensive chemotherapy.

 Gathering information about patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia who are discharged after finishing chemotherapy, or who stay in the hospital until blood counts return to normal, may help doctors learn more about the safety of allowing patients to leave the hospital early, the patient's quality of life, use of medical services, and the cost of these services associated with such a policy.
