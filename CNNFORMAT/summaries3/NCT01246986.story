(secondQuint)A Study of LY2157299 in Participants With Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 The study consists of four Parts: Part A where HCC participants with an increased alpha feto protein (AFP) level will be treated with either 160 milligrams (mg) LY2157299 or 300 mg LY2157299.

 Part B where HCC participants with a normal AFP level will be treated with 300 mg LY2157299, Part C where treatment-naive HCC participants will be treated with 160 mg LY2157299 + sorafenib or 300 mg LY2157299 + sorafenib, and Part D where HCC participants will be treated with either 160 mg or 300 mg LY2157299 + ramucirumab.

 Participants who continue to receive benefit from treatment at the time that the study is considered completed, may enter the treatment extension period and continue to receive the study treatment.
