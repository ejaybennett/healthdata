(fifthQuint)Health Promotion in Early Adolescence: Sleep, Activity, and Emotion Regulation.

 The primary objective of this project is to examine the short and long-term effects of an intervention focusing on three interrelated dimensions of health: improving sleep, increasing physical activity, and improving skills in emotion regulation.

 This intervention targets high-risk youth at a key neuromaturational period-early adolescence-when many individuals are experiencing new challenges to regulatory systems involved in sleep, activity, and emotion regulation.

 SPECIFIC AIMS: 1.

 To examine the effects of the intervention on sleep, physical activity, and emotion regulation: Hypothesis 1a: The intervention will result in increased total sleep and more regularized sleep/wake schedules (as measured by Sensewear sleep/activity monitors and sleep logs in the home environment).

 Hypothesis 1b: The intervention will result in increased physical activity and less time per week in sedentary activity (as measured by Sensewear activity monitors and standardized physical activity questionnaire).

 Hypothesis 1c: The intervention will result in improved emotion regulation (as measured by a composite index derived from interaction tasks, as well as home and school measures of emotion regulation).

 2.

 To examine intervention effects on externalizing (problem behavior), internalizing symptoms, and peer relationships.

 Hypothesis 2a: The intervention will result in lower levels of externalizing and internalizing symptoms and improved relationships with peers as measured by parent, youth, and teacher reports.

 Hypothesis 2b: Intervention effects for lower levels of externalizing and internalizing symptoms and improved relationships with peers, if found, will be mediated by improvements in child sleep, physical activity, and emotion regulation.

 SECONDARY AIMS: In addition to these specific aims the following exploratory analyses are planned: 3.

 To examine parent-child interaction as a mediator of change in child sleep, physical activity, and emotion regulation.

 Just as we are interested in the possibility that changes in child problem behavior and peer relationships are mediated by improvements in sleep, physical activity, and emotion regulation, we will examine aspects of improvements in sleep, physical activity, and emotion regulation that are mediated by improvements in the quality of parent-child interaction (e.

g.

, parental involvement), based on both parent reports and observations of parent-child quality.

 4.

 To explore directional effects between sleep, daytime activity, daytime mood, emotion regulation, and affective and behavioral symptoms.

 For example, we will examine: a) if sleep difficulties will predict daytime measures of negative mood, irritability, and decreased physical activity the following day; or b) if daytime measures of stress and negative affect will predict sleep difficulties the subsequent night; c) if physical activity during the day will be associated with better sleep that night.

 5.

 To examine the impact of this intervention on measures of physical health (e.

g.

, Body Mass Index and waist circumference) and academic function (e.

g.

, days of school missed/tardiness and school performance).

 Health Promotion in Early Adolescence: Sleep, Activity, and Emotion Regulation@highlight

The primary goal of this project is to examine the short and long-term effects of an intervention focusing on three interrelated dimensions of health: improving sleep, increasing physical activity, and improving skills in emotion regulation.

 This intervention targets high-risk youth at a key neuromaturational period-early adolescence-when many individuals are experiencing new challenges to regulatory systems involved in sleep, activity, and emotion regulation.

 This maturational period is also a crucial time in the normal development of habits, skills, and proclivities in each of these domains.

 Thus, early adolescence presents unique opportunities for intervention targeting these three interrelated regulatory systems.

 Participants will include 200 9-13 year-old children who are siblings of children enrolled in one of three ongoing studies of vulnerability and resilience, whose families were initially identified on the basis of sociodemographic, child, and/or family risk or are recruited thru local Family Centers.

 Children will be selected as having difficulties in at least one of these domains (sleep, sedentary behavior, or emotion regulation) and then randomly assigned to either a control or intervention group.

 All families will receive baseline, one- and two-year follow-up assessments of child sleep, physical activity, and emotion regulation.

 Families in the intervention group will have the opportunity to receive feedback and intervention services on these three child domains and other parenting and family issues (e.

g.

, parent involvement, parent self-care, school problems) following the initial assessment and the one-year follow up.

 The intervention will involve the parent and target youth receiving feedback about the child's current status in these areas and family functioning.

 If desired, the family will also participate in follow-up meetings with the parent and/or target youth to improve the youth's sleep, physical activity, and/or emotion regulation skills, as well as aspects of the family environment.

 The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will be associated with improvements in sleep, physical activity, and emotion regulation among those in the intervention group, as well as improvements in measures of social, behavioral, and affective function.

 Finally, the investigators will explore the possibility that increases in parental involvement mediate some of the changes found in child sleep, physical activity, and emotion regulation.
