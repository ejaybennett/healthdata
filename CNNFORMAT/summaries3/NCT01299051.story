(thirdQuint)Steps to Health: Targeting Obesity in the Health Care Workplace.

 Steps to Health and Steps to Health Plus! aim to help Duke employees achieve weight loss and maintain healthy weights.

 We will be following participants in these programs over a two year period.

 These two groups will be compared with an observational comparison group of employees who meet eligibility criteria but do not take part in the randomized controlled trial.

 We will assess whether the two programs decrease obesity-related injuries in the workplace and estimate the net costs of the two programs relative to their effectiveness more broadly.

 In the additional follow-up, we will be assessing factors that may be related to program success.

 This will include a survey as well as some focus group data.

 Steps to Health: Targeting Obesity in the Health Care Workplace@highlight

The proposal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two worksite weight management programs at Duke: Steps to Health (STH) ('usual standard of care') and the more extensive Steps to Health Plus! (STH+).

 We have added an additional follow-up, by invitation only, for participants in the study who agreed to be contacted for future research.
