(thirdQuint)Ofatumumab vs Physician's Choice in Subjects With Bulky Fludarabine-Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.

 Patients with CLL that is refractory to fludarabine have few treatment options and a poor prognosis.

 There is a continued need for new therapies for these CLL patients, as demonstrated by the limited responses and substantial toxicities with existing therapies.

 This is supported by the lack of a consensus around standard of care treatment for CLL patients with bulky fludarabine-refractory disease.

 The objective of this study was to confirm the response rate and disease control in the refractory setting through a controlled trial comparing ofatumumab with the physicians' choice of therapy in fludarabine-refractory, bulky lymphadenopathy patients.

 After 24 weeks of treatment with ofatumumab, patients were further randomized to either extended ofatumumab treatment or observation.

 Patients on the physicians' choice arm had the option of receiving ofatumumab if they experience progressive disease.

The purpose of this study was to confirm the clinical benefit observed in the pivotal registration study, Hx-CD20-406.

 The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) required that a randomized study be conducted in CLL patients with bulky fludarabine-refractory disease as a specific obligation for grant of conditional approval for ARZERRA cent in the European Union (EU).

 This study compared ofatumumab with the physicians' choice of therapy.
