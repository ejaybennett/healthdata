(secondQuint)A Study of Bone Marrow Transplantation Using Fully-Matched Relatives as Donors for Patients With Hematological Malignancies.

 This research protocol has been developed for patients undergoing matched-sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

 The patients who are treated according to this 2 step allogeneic HSCT protocol will receive cyclophosphamide to induce in-vivo tolerization of both autologous and allogeneic lymphocytes, followed by an allogeneic CD34-selected HSCT.

 The primary research questions relate to immune reconstitution, incidence of GVHD, and relapse in patients who receive lymphocyte treatment of this type in allogeneic HSCT and how it impacts overall survival.

 A Study of Bone Marrow Transplantation Using Fully-Matched Relatives as Donors for Patients With Hematological Malignancies@highlight

This research study uses a drug called cyclophosphamide to decrease the incidence of GVHD in matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

 In doing so, the goal of the study is to increase overall survival.
