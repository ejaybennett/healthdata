(fifthQuint)A Study of Chewing Gum, Snacking and Appetite.

 The study is a randomized, 2-arm, placebo-controlled, within-subjects crossover study to evaluate the satiety and metabolic response patterns of gum/no gum in relatively healthy weight and obese women.

 The study will require one initial screening visit (1 hour) and 2 study visits.

 We are looking for healthy, non-smoking women older than 18 years of age with no significant medical history.

 The initial screening visit will determine subject eligibility through height, weight and waist circumference measurements, vital signs, blood glucose test (finger prick) and completion of a series of surveys related to eating, health, exercise and mood.

 If willing and eligible to participate, subjects will have 2 study visits.

 The lunch will be provided 4 hours after a intra-subject standardized breakfast (the same breakfast for each subject before each study visit).

 Upon arrival at each visit, subjects will have anthropometric measurements, vital signs upon blood glucose finger prick as well as assessment for compliance with breakfast protocol, subsequent fasting and adequate water intake.

 Upon completion of pre-study procedures, a registered nurse will place a catheter (flexible tubing) in the subjects' arm during each study visit.

 A catheter is used so subjects are not stuck with a needle for every blood sample.

 Instead, the catheter is inserted using a needle, the needle is removed and the flexible plastic tubing remains the arm for the duration of the study day serving as a port for collecting blood samples at the specific time points The initial blood draw will be collected (pre-lunch) then the lunch meal served.

 Subjects will have 20 minutes to finish the entire lunch meal.

 Thereafter, subjects will describe feelings of hunger, thirst and desire to eat every 30 minutes for 3 hours followed by blood draws.

 At one of the 2 study visits, subjects will be provided chewing gum at which they will chew gum for 15 minutes leading up to the question set and blood draw.

 A tray of snacks will be provided at 3 hours post-lunch and subjects may consume the snacks as desired.

 Lastly, a final set of questions will be answered followed by a blood draw at 4 hours post-lunch.

 During the course of the study, subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual level of activity and a self-selected diet.

 Three day food records will be maintained throughout the course of the study.

 Each study visit will last approximately 4 1/2 hours and subjects will be required to remain at the Clinical Nutrition Research Center on the IIT Campus for the duration of the visit.

 A Study of Chewing Gum, Snacking and Appetite@highlight

Investigators are interested in learning how appetite responds after chewing gum.

 In this research study subjects will be asked to eat a lunch meal provided at our Center.

 After eating the lunch meal, subjects will answer questions describing their feelings of hunger, thirst and desire to eat every 30 minutes for 3 hours.

 Blood will be drawn throughout the study period to determine how chewing gum impacts certain hormones released from your intestine after eating and therefore how they influence your appetite.

 Blood draws will be done every 30 minutes for 3 hours.

 At only one of the two study visits, subjects will chew gum during specific times.

 One study visit will not include chewing gum.

 After three hours, there will be a snack to eat as much as desired followed by one more set of questions and blood draw.

 All study visits will take approximately 4 1/2 hours.
