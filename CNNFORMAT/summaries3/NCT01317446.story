(firstQuint)Effect of Mouthrinsing on Inflammation of the Gums.

.

 Gingivitis prevalence is 100% among the population.

 This is mostly due to an inadequate mechanical cleaning of the teeth.

 However, remaining dental biofilm can be approached by antibacterial mouthrinses.

 As a consequence of regular use of these mouthrinses, gingivitis can be reduced.

 Amine fluoride/stannous flouride mouthrinse (ASF)has proved its efficacy in several studies.

 In the previous years, a new formulation that does not contain ethanol anymore was introduced in the market.

 Therefore, it is the aim of the study to proof whether rinsing with ASF adjunctive to mechanical oral hygiene is more effective on gingivitis reduction than mechanical oral hygiene alone.

 In addition, effects on dental plaque, discoloration of teeth and bacterial colonization should be studied.
