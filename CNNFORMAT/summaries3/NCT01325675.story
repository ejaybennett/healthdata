(secondQuint)Aerobic Interval Training in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.

 Long term endurance sport practice is associated with a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation.

 Moderate/light physical activity seems to be associated with a lower incidence.

 The underlying mechanisms are uncertain.

 In order to examine the effect of training in this population, the investigators will perform a randomised controlled study with aerobic interval training in patients with paroxysmal/persistent atrial fibrillation.

 Aerobic Interval Training in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of aerobic interval training in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation, especially to see if the burden of atrial fibrillation and symptoms are reduced.
