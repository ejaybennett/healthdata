(secondQuint)Contrast Ultrasound of the Small Intestine in Patients With Crohns Disease.

 Crohns disease (CD) is a lifelong chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) normally with an early debut.

 It requires continuous evaluation with either endoscopy, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) or Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE).

 These methods are either expensive, invasive or with uses radiation.

 Therefore UltraSound (US), as a cheap, fast and well tolerated examination of the small bowel are tested against the the validated MRI examination of the small bowel.

 Both examinations are using intra venous (i.

v.

) contrast agents.

 Obtained results are compared to disease activity.

 Hypothesis is, that dynamic US is comparable to dynamic MRI and therefore should be the first examination of choice in evaluating patients with CD.

 This study is a pilot study only.

 Contrast Ultrasound of the Small Intestine in Patients With Crohns Disease@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine how relevant dynamic ultrasound scans using contrast agents (SonoVue) is in the diagnosis of Crohns disease in the small bowel, compared to dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the small bowel.
