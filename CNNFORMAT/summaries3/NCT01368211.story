(thirdQuint)Mirasol-Treated Platelets - (Pathogen Reduction Extended Storage Study).

 1.

 To evaluate in thrombocytopenic subjects the efficacy and safety of platelets treated with Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) in Platelet Additive Solution.

 The following safety and efficacy measures will be compared between Mirasol treated and untreated platelets stored for 2-4 days and stored for 7 days: - Thrombelastography (TEG(R)) parameters: reaction time R, alpha angle and maximal amplitude (MA) - Platelet Count Increment and Corrected Count Increment - Time to next platelet transfusion - Incidence of transfusion related (serious) adverse events - Incidence and severity of bleedings 2.

 To evaluate the use of the TEG(R) parameters as a measure for platelet transfusion efficacy and to evaluate the correlation between the TEG(R) parameters and the platelet Corrected Count Increments after platelet transfusions in thrombocytopenic subjects.

 Mirasol-Treated Platelets - (Pathogen Reduction Extended Storage Study)@highlight

The PRESS trial is a single-center, two-part, randomized cross-over pilot study in Copenhagen that will evaluate 1) the safety and performance of Mirasol-treated and untreated platelet products stored for 2-4 days and for 7-days in Platelet Additive Solution (PAS) and 2) the correlation between the TEG(R) parameters and platelet count increments after platelet transfusions in thrombocytopenic subjects.
