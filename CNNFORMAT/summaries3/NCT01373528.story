(fifthQuint)Impact of Topical Sinonasal Budesonide Irrigation on Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Function.

 CRS is an inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses that is difficult to treat.

 Current treatment strategies rely upon medical treatment with the long-term daily use of a topical corticosteroid as its foundation.

 Once medical therapy becomes ineffective at controlling CRS and its resultant symptoms, surgical treatment is offered.

 Following surgery, patients must again continue with medical treatment to control the inflammation present in CRS.

 Previously, topical steroids could be applied using only a commercially prepared applicator that is effective at treating no more than the front of the nose and parts of the paranasal sinuses.

 However, relatively new nasal saline irrigation devices have made it possible to treat all of the paranasal sinuses.

 Corticosteroid medication can be added directly to the saline irrigation.

 In an operated patient the sinus openings have been greatly enlarged which then allows the irrigation to more effectively reach all of the paranasal sinuses.

 Therefore, irrigation with a corticosteroid solution allows for better delivery of the corticosteroid medication to treat the mucosal inflammation that is widely present.

 More effective treatment of the paranasal sinus inflammation thereby leads to improved control of inflammation and to the alleviation of patient symptoms such as chronic facial and dental pain, headache, obstructed nasal breathing, loss of smell and discharge from the nose.

 As of yet, with this method of treatment it has not been determined whether there is significant systemic absorption and a resultant suppression of the HPA axis.

 The investigators hypothesize that: 1.

 a single 0.

5 mg dose of budesonide will result in acute but recoverable suppression of pituitary adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion with a resultant transient decrease in adrenal cortisol production; and that 2.

 the long term use of budesonide, 0.

5 mg twice daily (BID), will result in a gradual and cumulative suppression of the HPA axis to the extent that significant hypocortisolism will be present when budesonide irrigation is discontinued necessitating replacement glucocorticoid therapy.

 Specific Aim of Project This study will determine if there is acute recoverable and long-term suppression of the HPA axis when budesonide irrigations are used in patients with CRS following endoscopic sinus surgery.

 This important information is currently not available in the literature.

 Impact of Topical Sinonasal Budesonide Irrigation on Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Function@highlight

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a complex inflammatory disease that is treated primarily with sinus surgery and the long-term use of topical steroid therapy.

 Budesonide irrigation is a common method of topical steroid treatment for these patients.

 However, the effects of budesonide irrigation on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in patients with CRS following sinus surgery, is as of yet not defined.

 The objective of this study is to determine if topical sinonasal budesonide steroid irrigation leads to acute recoverable and/or long-term suppression of the HPA axis.

 Participants in this prospective cohort study will have CRS and have recently undergone endoscopic sinus surgery.

 They will also have had planned use of budesonide irrigations as their postoperative medical treatment.

 The acute effects of this treatment on the HPA axis will be evaluated using serial serum cortisol measurements both the day before and the day of the first budesonide irrigation.

 The long-term effect of sinonasal budesonide irrigation will be evaluated using both a pre- and post-treatment adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test as well as repeated urine free cortisol levels over the length of the study.

 The results will determine the need for additional steroids when patients stop treatment or with a physiologic stressful event.
