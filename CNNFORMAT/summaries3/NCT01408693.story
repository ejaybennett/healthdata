(thirdQuint)Minimal Invasive Anterior Approach Versus Trans-gluteal Approach for Hemi-arthroplasty in Femoral Neck Fractures.

 HA via various well established approaches is the typical treatment for displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.

 In the last decade, so called minimal-invasive surgery (MIS) for the implantation of total hip arthroplasty (THA) has become popular and studies have demonstrated that MIS is as safe as conventional approaches.

 Our hypothesis is that femoral neck fracture patients may especially benefit from MIS.

 To date, no published data exist comparing a Hueter minimal-invasive anterior (AMIS) with a conventional trans-gluteal Hardinge approach (CLAS) for HA.

 Geriatric patients presenting at the University hospital Basel (UHBS) with a femoral neck fracture eligible for HA are randomly assigned to the minimal-invasive or conventional group.

 In both groups HA will be performed using the same implants.

 Postoperatively patients will be followed-up continuously until discharge from our hospital (with 7 days as expected average duration of postoperative hospital stay) with a first functional status assessment on day 5.

 Further follow-up is planned at week 3 and 6, 3 months and one year postoperatively.

The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that patients older than 60 years with a femoral neck fracture eligible for hemi-arthroplasty (HA) operated by an anterior minimal-invasive approach as compared to a standard lateral Hardinge approach show better functional recovery postoperatively as measured by the "Timed up and go"-test (TUG).
