(secondQuint)Prevalence and Level of Thienopyridine Resistance Seen in a Contemporary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention or Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Population.

 This is a prospective cohort study of 1000 patients presenting to the Washington Hospital Center for percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery.

 The aim of this prospective clinical registry is to determine the prevalence and level of thienopyridine resistance seen in a population presenting for cardiac catheterization and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).

 Thienopyridine resistance will be measured by flow cytometry of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation, and/or the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, and/or the Chrono-Log Lumi-Aggregometer, and/or the PlaCor PRT 7000 platelet reactivity assay.

 A secondary objective of this study is to correlate a variety of genetic polymorphisms with levels of platelet reactivity.
