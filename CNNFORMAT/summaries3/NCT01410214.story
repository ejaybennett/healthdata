(secondQuint)Erlotinib Versus Vinorelbine/Cisplatin as Adjuvant Treatment in Stage IIIA NSCLC Patients With EGFR Mutations.

 The LACE meta-analysis identified four cycles of platinum-based program to improve II~IIIA stage completely resected NSCLC pts the role of 5-year survival, but its treatment-related life threatening toxicity limits its use.

 The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) may provide a dramatic response in pts with pulmonary adenocarcinoma carrying EGFR activating mutations in the metastatic setting.

 The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of erlotinib versus NVB plus cisplatin (NP) as adjuvant treatment in pts with stage IIIA NSCLC after Complete Resection with EGFR activating mutations and to explore a new treatment strategy for this subset.
