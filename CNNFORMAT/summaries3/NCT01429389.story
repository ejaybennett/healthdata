(firstQuint)Specimen Collection From Pregnant Women at Increased Risk for Fetal Aneuploidy.

 To collect specimens for the purpose of developing a prenatal aneuploidy test.

 The test will analyze circulating cell free fetal (ccff) nucleic acid from blood samples from pregnant women who have an increased risk indicator/s for fetal chromosomal aneuploidy and are undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and/or genetic amniocentesis.

 The results of the ccff aneuploidy test will be compared to the chromosomal analysis obtained via CVS or genetic amniocentesis.
