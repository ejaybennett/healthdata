(firstQuint)Study of Lenalidomide in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia or High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome.

 The purpose of this study is determine whether lenalidomide can directly inhibit leukemic stem cells in vivo and can be used to prevent the relapse of leukemia stem cells after transplant.

 A concern with any post transplant intervention is the possibility of multiple drug interactions, potential for graft versus host disease exacerbation and/or induction of cytopenia.

 Therefore, the smallest doses of lenalidomide (5 mg) that has been used in this setting will be utilized as dose level 1.

 Starting six months post-transplant, patients will begin on a daily dose of lenalidomide.

 Dependent on the cohort, patients will receive 5 to 20 mg of lenalidomide post transplant.

 The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined by the incidence of grade III-IV toxicities of all organs and grade II-IV GVHD.

 Duration of treatment is six months.
