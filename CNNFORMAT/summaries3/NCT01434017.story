(fifthQuint)Comparison of Three Different Prophylactic Treatments of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) in Children.

 Tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy may be associated with severe postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).

 Causes are principally trigeminal nerve stimulation and presence of blood in the stomach.

 Consequences are disagreement, unsatisfactory, delayed discharge, and overnight admission in day-cases.

 More barely, patients may also have suture and esophagus rupture, aspiration of gastric contents, dehydration and electrolyte disturbances.

 Several medications may prevent and treat PONV, such as steroids, antidopaminergic drugs and serotonin (5-HT3) antagonists.

 The objective of this study is to compare three prophylactic antiemetic treatments: - dexamethasone alone (250 mcg/kg) - dexamethasone (250 mcg/kg) + droperidol (10 mcg/kg) - dexamethasone (250 mcg/kg) + ondansetron (150 mcg/kg).

 The hypothesis is that the combination of dexamethasone and droperidol is as effective as the combination of dexamethasone and ondansetron, both of them being more effective than dexamethasone alone.

 Moreover, droperidol is cheaper than ondansetron and may be recommended as a first-line treatment.

Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in children after tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy may be as high as 75%.

 Several medications may prevent and treat PONV, such as steroids, antidopaminergic drugs and serotonin (5-HT3) antagonists.

 The objective of this study is to compare three prophylactic antiemetic treatments: - dexamethasone alone (250 mcg/kg) - dexamethasone (250 mcg/kg) + droperidol (10 mcg/kg) - dexamethasone (250 mcg/kg) + ondansetron (150 mcg/kg).
