(secondQuint)Proton Radiation for Chordomas and Chondrosarcomas.

 This trial will be conducted in two phases: a feasibility then a phase II trial.

 Once feasibility and safety are established in the first 12 pts.

 the phase II study will begin.

 Proton therapy at standard doses is not known to improve clinical outcome but will likely reduce fatigue and toxicity.

 Proton Radiation for Chordomas and Chondrosarcomas@highlight

The objectives of this study are 1) To evaluate the feasibility and acute side effects of proton therapy for chordomas and chondrosarcomas and 2) To evaluate clinical outcomes and long term side effects of proton beam radiation for treatment of chordomas and chondrosarcomas.
