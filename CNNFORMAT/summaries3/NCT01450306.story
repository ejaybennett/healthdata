(secondQuint)Exposure, D-cycloserine Enhancement, and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in Snake Phobics.

 D-cycloserine (DCS) is a partial N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist that may improve or accelerate extinction learning.

 We will randomly assign people with snake phobia to receive DCS or placebo, and then provide all participants with exposure therapy.

 We will examine whether people receiving DCS and vs.

 placebo show different brain reactions to symptom provocation before and after exposure therapy.

 Exposure, D-cycloserine Enhancement, and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in Snake Phobics@highlight

The aim of the present study is to determine whether people receiving d-cycloserine and exposure therapy show different brain reactions to symptom provocation compared to people receiving placebo and exposure therapy.
