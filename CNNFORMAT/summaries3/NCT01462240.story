(secondQuint)LPS Flex Porous Femoral Components.

 Survival and outcome data on the NexGen LPS-Flex Porous Femoral Components will be done by an analysis of standard scoring system, radiographs and adverse event records.

 Survivorship will be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse device effects, serious adverse device effects, and unanticipated adverse device effects.

 Outcomes will be measured by comparing the overall pain and function performances (based on the Knee Society Scoring System), survivorship, subject quality of life and radiographic parameters of study subjects receiving the LPS-Flex Porous Femoral Components.
