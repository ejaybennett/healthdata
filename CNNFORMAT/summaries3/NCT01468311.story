(fifthQuint)Yttrium-90-labeled Daclizumab With Chemotherapy and Stem Cell Transplant for Hodgkin s Lymphoma.

 Background: - Although Hodgkins lymphoma (HL) is considered a highly treatable cancer, patients with relapsed and chemotherapy refractory disease represent a major therapeutic challenge.

 - Only 30-65% of relapsed patients will achieve long-term disease free survival with the current standard of care high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT).

 - The malignant Reed-Sternberg cells of HL and the surrounding benign T cell infiltrates often express CD25, the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R alpha).

 - In study NCI-97-C-0110, we treated 30 patients with CD25-expressing relapsed or refractory HL with radioimmunotherapy (RIT) using (90)Y-labeled daclizumab (anti-CD25), and achieved a 63% response rate including 12 complete responses with few serious adverse events other than MDS in 4 patients.

 - We propose integrating (90)Y-labeled daclizumab RIT into the induction regimen of ASCT in an effort to improve the response and disease-free survival in relapsed and refractory HL.

 Objectives: Phase I Primary Objectives: - To assess the safety and adverse events associated with (90)Y-daclizumab (humanized anti-CD25) radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in combination with high-dose BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, [Ara-C, cytosine arabinoside] and melphalan) chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin s lymphoma (HL) with adverse prognostic factors.

 - To determine the maximum tolerated dose in mCi of (90)Y-daclizumab RIT in combination with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy and ASCT in patients with relapsed or refractory HL.

 Phase II Primary Objectives: - To assess the frequency of the failure to engraft, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), secondary leukemia for the development of abnormal bone-marrow cytogenetics in refractory or relapsed HL patients treated with (90)Y-daclizumab RIT in combination with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy and ASCT.

 - To estimate the response rate (the number of complete and partial responses) in patients with refractory or relapsed HD to (90)Y-daclizumab RIT administered in combination with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy and ASCT.

 Eligibility: - Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsed or refractory HL with at least 10% of malignant Reed-Sternberg cells or infiltrating T-cells expressing CD25 (IL-2R alpha).

 A.

 Patients must have at least one of the following: (1) had an initial relapse less than 12 months after achieving a complete response (CR) with primary chemotherapy for HL; (2) were Staged at III/IV at diagnosis; (3) exhibited chemotherapy resistant disease or (4) did not achieve a CR with cytoreductive chemotherapy prior to a planned transplant.

 B.

 Patient must have a lesion of at least 1.

0 cm in its greatest diameter.

 C.

 Patients with lymphocyte predominant HL are excluded.

 D.

 Patients with pre-existing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or marrow cytogenic abnormalities will not be eligible to participate.

 - Omission of cytotoxic chemotherapy or other systemic therapy of HL for at least 4 weeks prior to entry into the trial.

 - No prior ASCT or allogeneic stem cell transplant.

 Design: - A single institution non-randomized open-label phase I/II trial.

 - Patients will undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim) and Plerixafor followed by apheresis to collect a target dose of 4 x 106 cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34) cells/kg (minimal dose of 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) of actual body weight.

 - Phase I study will be carried out using a standard 3 + 3 cohort dose-escalation design: - Dose level 1: Patients will receive a single dose of 15 mCi 90Y-daclizumab RIT (day -15 2 days) followed by high-dose BEAM chemotherapy (beginning Day -6) and ASCT (Day 0).

 - Dose levels 2-7: Patients will receive two doses of 90Y-daclizumab RIT 6 weeks apart (Day -56 and -15 2 days) followed by high-dose BEAM chemotherapy (beginning day -6) and ASCT (Day 0).

 The first dose of 90Y-daclizumab will be fixed at 15 mCi.

 The second dose will be escalated in 15 mCi increments from 15 mCi until maximum tolerated dose, not to exceed 90 mCi.

 - Phase II: All patients will receive two doses of 90Y-daclizumab (Day -56 and -15 2 days) followed by high-dose BEAM chemotherapy (beginning Day -6) and ASCT (Day 0).

 The first dose of RIT will be 15 mCi.

 The second dose will be the maximum tolerated dose as determined from phase I.

 111In-daclizumab (5 mCi) imaging may be performed concurrently with each 90Ydaclizumab RIT and at day 100 after ASCT.

 Yttrium-90-labeled Daclizumab With Chemotherapy and Stem Cell Transplant for Hodgkin s Lymphoma@highlight

Background: - Hodgkins lymphoma (HL) is a highly treatable cancer.

 However, if HL does not respond to chemotherapy or returns after chemotherapy, further treatments often are not successful.

 - Some HL cells have a molecule called cluster of differentiation 25 (CD25) on the surface.

 Daclizumab is a drug that can detect CD25 on cells.

 In a treatment study for HL that did not respond to chemotherapy, daclizumab plus a radioactive atom called Yttrium 90 helped kill these HL cells.

 Researchers want to combine this 90Y daclizumab with high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.

 This treatment may be more effective than the daclizumab alone.

 Objectives: - To see if yttrium-90 daclizumab, high-dose chemotherapy, and stem cell transplants can treat HL that has not responded to earlier treatments.

 Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have Hodgkins lymphoma that has not responded to chemotherapy.

 Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

 They will also have blood and urine tests.

 - Participants will have filgrastim and plerixafor to move stem cells into the blood.

 Stem cells will be collected with apheresis.

 - Four weeks after stem cells are collected, participants will have the 90Y daclizumab and normal daclizumab to treat the HL.

 Chemotherapy will start 9 days after the first treatment.

 - Most participants will have a second dose of 90Y daclizumab 6 weeks after the first dose.

 - After each daclizumab treatment, participants will have several imaging studies of the chest and abdomen.

 Blood samples will also be collected.

 - On the day after the last day of chemotherapy, participants will receive the stem cells collected earlier.

 Filgrastim injections will help stimulate stem cell growth.
