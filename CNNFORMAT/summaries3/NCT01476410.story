(fifthQuint)Brentuximab Vedotin and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Older Patients With Previously Untreated Stage II-IV Hodgkin Lymphoma.

 LEAD IN: Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 AVD CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients then receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, vinblastine IV, and dacarbazine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving CR receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

 Brentuximab Vedotin and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Older Patients With Previously Untreated Stage II-IV Hodgkin Lymphoma@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well giving brentuximab vedotin together with combination chemotherapy works in treating older patients with previously untreated stage II-IV Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

 Monoclonal antibody-drug conjugates, such as brentuximab vedotin, can block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD), work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vinblastine, and dacarbazine together may kill more cancer cells.
