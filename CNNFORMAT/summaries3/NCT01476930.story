(fifthQuint)Cupping and Serkangabin Versus Conventional Migraine Treatment.

 In a randomized controlled trial investigators randomly assigned 76 patients with migraine to cupping therapy plus SERKANGABIN or to receive conventional medical treatment.

 The use of CAM in migraine is a growing phenomenon.

 Migraine patients seek and explore both conventional and CAM approaches.

 Wet cupping is an ancient medical technique still used in several contemporary societies.

 It is being used in management of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and headaches, renal and biliary stones and for maintaining health.

 Little experimental study has been devoted to test its efficacy to treat migraine headache.

 Investigators planned this study for evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of wet cupping and an Iranian traditional medicine preparation, SERKANGABIN in treatment of migraine headache compared with current medicine protocols.

 SERKANGABIN is a preparation of honey, vinegar and distilled mint water that in traditional Iranian medicine is believed to have therapeutic effects in many diseases (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive airway disease, interstitial lung disease, hepatitis, fatty liver, ischemic heart disease, migraine, cerebrovascular diseases).
