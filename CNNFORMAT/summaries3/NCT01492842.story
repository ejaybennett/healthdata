 ATN 114 is a cross-sectional substudy of ATN 106.

 In addition to sharing data collected in ATN 106, an oral rinse sample along with the subject's self reported history and medical chart abstraction of HPV vaccination status and medical chart abstraction of a history of oral condylomata, oral dysplasia and oral tumor viruses will be collected in ATN 114.

 Recruitment is expected to last approximately one year, similar to the same timeframe for ATN 106.

 Enrollment may be terminated earlier at the discretion of the ATN Executive Committee and/or the ATN 114 protocol team should ATN 106 also terminate enrollment early.

 Individuals who have agreed to participate in ATN 106 may be simultaneously approached at any clinic visit, or, for community-based sites, contacted directly for participation in ATN 114.

 Site staff may also contact individuals via phone, e-mail, or any other agreed-upon methods of communication.

 Site staff should try as much as possible to incorporate the study visit into a regularly scheduled clinic visit.
