(secondQuint)ACute and Chronic Effects of Saxagliptin.

 The aim of this pilot study is to compare in patients with impaired glucose tolerance the effects of saxagliptin versus placebo: (i) on glucose metabolism (ii) on vago-sympathetic activity, arterial stiffness and endothelial function.

 A total of 36 patients will be recruited in the department of Endocrinology-Diabetology-Nutrition of Jean VERDIER hospital, AP-HP, Bondy, France.

 The measurements will be performed in the morning 1) at the time of randomisation (Acute ACCES study) and 2) 11-14 weeks after the beginning of saxagliptin or placebo (Chronic ACCES study).

 We will evaluate at fasting and each hour after a standardized breakfast: (i) biological and metabolic parameters.

 Furthermore, an oral glucose tolerance test will be performed at the end of the study.

 (ii) by non-invasive devices arterial stiffness (Sphygmocor(R)), endothelial function (ENDOPAT 2000(R) ), cutaneous microcirculation (laser doppler Perimed (R).

PF 5010) and cardiac autonomic function(task force monitor(R)).

 ACute and Chronic Effects of Saxagliptin@highlight

Glucose ACCES study will explore the acute and long term (12-week treatment) effects of saxagliptin in patients with impaired glucose tolerance during fasting and after a standardised breakfast.

 The investigations will be performed on: - glycemic parameters - on cardiovascular parameters
