(fifthQuint)Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of MDCO-2010 in Patients Undergoing Elective Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery.

 This protocol describes a study of the investigational drug MDCO-2010 as a haemostasis modulator in patients undergoing elective Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery involving a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

 Perioperative bleeding is a serious complication that adversely affects the morbidity and mortality of cardiac surgery.

 To alleviate this complication, prophylactic antifibrinolytic therapies are now widely accepted as a strategy to inhibit excessive fibrinolysis.

 MDCO-2010, a synthetic small molecule, is a direct inhibitor of plasmin and plasma kallikrein.

 Both of these have been implicated with impaired haemostasis.

 In addition, potent inhibition of coagulation factors Xa, XIa and activated Protein C has been demonstrated.

 Thus, MDCO-2010 has the potential to mitigate excessive fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during cardiac surgery involving a cardiopulmonary bypass.

 In particular the latter is supposed to provide additional benefits beyond reducing transfusion requirements.

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that periprocedural infusion of escalating doses of MDCO-2010 is safe and tolerated in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery, to characterize the single dose pharmacokinetics of MDCO-2010, to investigate the effect of MDCO-2010 on pharmacodynamics (biomarkers of fibrinolysis and coagulation parameters), and to investigate the effect on exploratory clinical endpoints of bleeding, transfusion requirements and reexploration.
