(firstQuint)Study of Cetuximab to Treat KRAS Wild Type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

 CMAB009 is a recombinant, human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds specifically to the extracellular domain of EGFR.

 It is composed of the Fv regions of a murine anti-EGFR antibody with human IgG1 heavy and k light chain constant regions and it is expressed by Chinese hamster ovary cells.

 It is a biosimilar of cetuximab (C225, Erbitux(R)) and it is developed by Shanghai Zhangjiang Biotechnology Limited Company and produced by Biomabs.

 Phase I study results suggest that CMAB009 showed well-tolerated safety profile and primary efficacy.

 This multicenter, open-label study was to determine whether adding cetuximab (CMAB009) to irinotecan increased the response rate and prolongs survival in patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) previously treated with fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin.
