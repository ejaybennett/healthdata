(thirdQuint)Breast-Conserving Surgery and Radiation Therapy in Patients With Multiple Ipsilateral Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess the local recurrence (LR) rate with breast-conservation in patients with multiple ipsilateral primary breast cancer (MIBC).

 Secondary - To examine the conversion rate to mastectomy secondary to persistent positive margins; poor cosmesis within the first year of attempting breast-conservation surgery (BCS) or inability to satisfy the radiation dose constraints on the boost to the lumpectomy bed of each site of disease.

 - To assess whether patients who did not undergo re-excision for close margins ( 1 lumpectomy site.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients undergo breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with all lesions resected to negative margins using 1 lumpectomy or 2-3 separate lumpectomy incisions at the discretion of the surgeon.

 Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist based on tumor characteristics.

 Breast-Conserving Surgery and Radiation Therapy in Patients With Multiple Ipsilateral Breast Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Breast-conserving surgery is a less invasive type of surgery for breast cancer and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery.

 Radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells.

 Giving radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies how well breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy work in treating patients with multiple ipsilateral breast cancer
