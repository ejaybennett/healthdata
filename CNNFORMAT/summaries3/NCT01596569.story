(secondQuint)Combined Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Cognitive Treatment in Blast Traumatic Brain Injury.

 The most common blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI)-associated problems are cognitive deficits, such as executive functioning and memory.

 This study evaluates a combined rehabilitation program: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and cognitive therapy for treatment of patients with bTBI.

 TMS is a noninvasive way of stimulating the brain, which is not painful and does not involve any needles or any form of surgery.

 It acts by delivering a magnetic stimulation to a particular brain region.

 Half of the study participants will receive cognitive intervention with active TMS, and a control group will receive cognitive intervention with sham TMS.

 This study takes place in Boston, Massachusetts: at the VA Boston Healthcare System and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

 Combined Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Cognitive Treatment in Blast Traumatic Brain Injury@highlight

This study investigates the efficacy of a novel neurorehabilitation program combining noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS) and cognitive therapy, on cognitive function and quality of life in individuals with blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI).
