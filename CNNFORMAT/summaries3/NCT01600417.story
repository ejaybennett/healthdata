(thirdQuint)Investigation of Lumbo-sacral Instability Using Custom Made Table - a Pilot Study.

 After enrollment in the study patients will complete a set of questionnaire concerning degree, extent and quality of their low back problem.

 Afterwards a lateral conventional radiograph of the lumbar spine with the patient on a custom made positioning table will be taken.

 The table facilitates optimal flexion of the lumbar spine.

 Afterwards sagittal translation and rotation are measured on the flexion-extension radiographs and the radiograph taken on the custom made table.

 Differences between the measurements will be determined.

 Investigation of Lumbo-sacral Instability Using Custom Made Table - a Pilot Study@highlight

The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and validity of conventional radiographs of the lumbo-sacral spine when the patient is lying on a special table which facilitates maximal lumbo-sacral flexion.

 The results gained from the radiographs with the patient on the table will be compared with those gained from standard flexion-extension radiographs of the lumbo-sacral spine.
