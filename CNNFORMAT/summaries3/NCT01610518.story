(fifthQuint)The Glycemic Response Elicited by Beta-glucans of Different Physical Properties and Form.

 The ability of -glucan to lower postprandial glycemic responses has been attributed to the viscosity of the solution in which the fibre is solubilized.

 It has been demonstrated that the viscosity of a -glucan solution increases with the molecular weight (MW) of -glucan polymers, as well as the dose or concentration (C) of those polymers in solution.

 Numerous studies have shown that glycemic response-lowering is strengthened when the C of a -glucan solution of fixed liquid volume is increased by increasing -glucan dose.

 However, the C of a -glucan solution depends on not only the amount of fibre present but also on the solution volume.

 To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the effect of -glucan solutions on glycemic response when C, and thus viscosity, is varied by changing the solution volume but not the -glucan dose.

 Therefore, the investigators will test the effects of altering -glucan solution viscosity by altering solution volume at a fixed amount of -glucan fibre.

 Knowing how to incorporate -glucan into solution so that its physiological benefits are preserved will assist in the development of -glucan-containing functional foods.
