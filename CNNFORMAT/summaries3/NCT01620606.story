(fifthQuint)Managing Childhood Abdominal Pain.

 Functional Abdominal Pain (FAP) affects 10 to 15% of children and has significant social, emotional, and financial costs, but no known organic cause and no accepted medical or behavioral treatment.

 The researchers have conducted studies that provide support for a theoretical model in which cognitive-behavioral and social learning processes (modeling and/or potentially reinforcing responses by parents) may contribute to the maintenance of illness behaviors and functional disability in children with FAP.

 The researchers subsequently tested a social learning and cognitive-behavioral intervention for parent-child dyads which focused on changing these parent behaviors as well as teaching coping skills to children.

 Results support the effectiveness of the intervention and the explanatory value of the theory, demonstrating that parental change is a key element in reducing children's symptoms.

 The proposed study will build on these findings by evaluating a parent-only intervention.

 Furthermore, our experience and that of other investigators indicates that alternative intervention models are needed for wider accessibility to the intervention for families in need.

 While a parent-only format is expected to increase accessibility, we will also evaluate the use of a remote telephone intervention.

 Managing Childhood Abdominal Pain@highlight

Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is a common complaint of childhood, associated with considerable health care costs, disruption of normal activity, emotional distress, and long-term health effects.

 The study will test a treatment approach which, if successful, would substantially change the treatment for FAP and potentially for a wide range of childhood medical problems where parental responses to symptoms contribute to these adverse effects.

 The study would also provide a model which would be much more accessible than traditional face-to-face therapies to a broader range of families in need than are currently served.
