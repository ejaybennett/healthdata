(thirdQuint)A Dose-Ranging Study to Compare Doravirine (MK-1439) Plus TRUVADA Versus Efavirenz Plus TRUVADA in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 Infected Participants (MK-1439-007).

 Part I - Dose-Ranging.

 Part I will evaluate the (1) safety and tolerability and (2) efficacy (antiretroviral activity) of 4 doses of doravirine compared with efavirenz, when each is given in combination with TRUVADA(R) for at least 24 weeks in approximately 200 participants.

 A single dose of doravirine will be selected for further study after all participants complete the Week 24 visit in Part I.

 Participants receiving any dose of doravirine in Part I will be switched to the selected doravirine dose and continue in the study for up to 96 weeks, but will not be randomized to Part II.

 Part II - Selected Dose.

 Part II will be initiated after the doravirine dose has been selected as indicated above for Part 1.

 Approximately 120 additional participants will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to the selected dose of doravirine or efavirenz, each in combination with TRUVADA(R) for 96 weeks of blinded treatment.

 Part II will evaluate the safety of the selected dose compared with efavirenz, particularly with regard to central nervous system (CNS) adverse events.

The hypothesis tested in this study is that doravirine (MK-1439) at the final dose selected is superior to efavirenz, each given in combination with TRUVADA(R), as measured by the percentage of participants with CNS events by Week 8.

 If superiority is established at Week 8, the same hypothesis will be tested for Week 24.
