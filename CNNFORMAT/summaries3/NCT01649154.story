(thirdQuint)Clinical Trial on Harmonic Focus Shears Versus Ligasure Small Jaw and Clamp-and-tie Technique for Total Thyroidectomy.

 A single-blinded prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary referral center.

 A total of 120 patients who required a thyroidectomy for thyroid benign disease, will be randomized to either Harmonic Focus or Ligasure small-Jaw or clamp-and-tie technique during thyroidectomy.

 The operative time (minutes), morbidity rate (%), post-operative blood loss (milliliters), hospital stay (days), post-operative hypocalcemia (%), and cost of thyroidectomy (euros) were compared between the three groups.

 Clinical Trial on Harmonic Focus Shears Versus Ligasure Small Jaw and Clamp-and-tie Technique for Total Thyroidectomy@highlight

The Harmonic Focus and Ligasure small-Jaw are the last device designed for thyroid surgery.

 The aim is to assess: 1.

 decrease of operative time (minutes); 2.

 decrease of post-operative blood loss (milliliters); 3.

 decrease of post-operative stay (days); decrease of post-operative complications (%, hypocalcemia, laringeal nerve demage), compared to traditional dissection in a prospective randomized trial of total thyroidectomy procedures, for benign disease.
