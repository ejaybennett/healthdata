(thirdQuint)Negative Pressure Therapy in Preventing Infection After Surgery in Patients With Colon, Rectal, Pancreatic, or Peritoneal Surface Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine whether negative pressure therapy applied to closed laparotomy incisions can decrease the incidence of incisional surgical site infections in patients undergoing clean-contaminated resections for colorectal, pancreatic, and peritoneal surface malignancies compared to standard post-operative sterile gauze dressings.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive standard sterile dressing (SSD) over their closed laparotomy incision at the conclusion of their surgery.

 ARM II: Patients receive negative pressure therapy (NPT) dressing over their closed laparotomy incision at the conclusion of their surgery.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

The purpose of this research study is to evaluate if a negative-pressure dressing placed over a surgical incision can reduce the risk of developing a surgical site infection compared to a commonly-used sterile gauze incision dressing.

 In this study, the negative-pressure dressing will be compared to a standard post-surgical sterile gauze dressing.

 In this study patients will either receive a negative-pressure dressing or a standard sterile gauze dressing
