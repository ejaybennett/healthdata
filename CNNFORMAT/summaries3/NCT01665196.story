(thirdQuint)18F-FDG PET/CT for IgG4-Related Disease.

 Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a recently defined emerging clinical entity characterized by tissue infiltration by IgG4-positive plasma cells, tissue fibrosclerosis and elevated serum IgG4 concentration.

 The most important feature of IgG4-RD is chronic inflammation with multiple organ involvement.

 However, some organ involvements are difficult to find by ultrasound, CT or MRI.

 18F-FDG PET/CT is a sensitive imaging tool for inflammation.

 In this study, PET/CT were performed in patients with IgG4-RD both before and after glucocorticoid treatment by a single dose of 18F-FDG.

 Visual and semiquantitative method will be employed to assess the PET/CT images.

 The PET/CT image data will be used to establish a diagnostic model as well as assessment criteria for response evaluation of IgG4-RD treatments.

 18F-FDG PET/CT for IgG4-Related Disease@highlight

This is an open-label study to investigate the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography) in evaluation of patients with IgG4-related disease.

 A single dose of 18F-FDG will be intravenously injected into patients with IgG4-related disease before and after treatment.
