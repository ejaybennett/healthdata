(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy of FolateScan (Technetium Tc 99m EC20) in Women With Suspected Ovarian or Endometrial Cancer.

 The study is designed to verify product safety, determine optimal imaging time, gather efficacy data for the radioactive drug product (Technetium Tc 99m EC20), and assay masses for presence of folate receptors, in women with suspected ovarian or endometrial cancer.

 Twelve subjects will be enrolled, with a minimum of five malignant cases, as determined by histopathological evaluation.

 Women with a suspected ovarian or endometrial mass who either 1) have fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sample(s) available for immunohistochemical staining obtained from a previous pathological evaluation or 2) are scheduled for a procedure to obtain tissue for pathological evaluation that can be fixed and paraffin embedded for immunohistochemical staining are eligible for this study.

 The ovarian mass may be either an initial finding, e.

g.

, found at a routine pelvic examination or to investigate symptoms, or the ovarian or endometrial mass may be a finding suspicious of recurrent or residual tumor at follow-up examination after surgical resection of confirmed ovarian or endometrial cancer.

 Patients may not be pregnant or breastfeeding at enrollment.
