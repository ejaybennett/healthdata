(fifthQuint)A Phase II Study of Axitinib in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer Unsuitable for Nephrectomy.

 A-PREDICT is a single arm, single agent, open label, multicentre, phase II study of axitinib in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma of predominant clear cell histology and unsuitable for debulking nephrectomy (as judged by the treating clinician).

 Patients who have provided consent and have satisfied the eligibility criteria will be registered into the trial.

 The starting dose of axitinib will be 5 mg twice daily by mouth, escalating to a maximum of 10mg twice daily by mouth according to tolerability of treatment, for as long as patients are deriving clinical benefit.

 Treatment will be paused for one week prior to percutaneous biopsy of the primary on day 1 week 9.

 Disease progression will be evaluated according to RECIST v1.

1 criteria 8 weeks after commencing treatment, at 8 weekly intervals to 6 months and 3 monthly thereafter.

 Blood and tumour tissue samples will be taken prior to and during therapy to evaluate biomarkers of treatment response.

 Nephrectomy will be carried out on any patient who becomes suitable in the opinion of the treating clinician during the course of the trial.

 Where possible, tissue samples will be taken from resected specimens.

 Response to axitinib in marker lesions will be correlated with changes in biomarkers.

 A Phase II Study of Axitinib in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer Unsuitable for Nephrectomy@highlight

A-PREDICT is a study of axitinib in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma unsuitable for nephrectomy (as judged by the treating clinician) to evaluate efficacy, safety, toxicity and changes in biomarkers during therapy.

 Axitinib will given twice daily by mouth according to tolerability of treatment, for as long as patients are deriving clinical benefit.

 Blood and tumour tissue samples will be taken prior to and during therapy to evaluate biomarkers of treatment response.

 The primary clinical objective of this study is to define the activity of axitinib given to patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma unsuitable for nephrectomy.
