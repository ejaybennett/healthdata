(fifthQuint)High Risk Neuroblastoma Study 1.

 In this protocol the term high-risk neuroblastoma refers to children with either - disseminated disease (INSS stage 4: about 40 to 50% of all neuroblastoma) over the age of one or - INSS stage 2 and 3 disease with amplification of the MycN proto-oncogene Between 10% and 20% of children with stage 3 and occasional patients with stage 2 disease are characterized by amplification of the MycN gene in their tumours.

 This biological characteristic has clearly been shown to be associated with a greater risk of relapse and death from disease progression.

 These patients may benefit from very aggressive treatment and, based on this hypothesis, they are included in this protocol.

 Infants ( to 10 days of continuous infusion in relapsed /refractory patients.

 Hence the HRNBL1/SIOPEN study committee wished to implement this more favorable immunotherapy dosing schedule for the time till the induction question R3 was answered and the HRNBL1/SIOPEN trial may be closed.

 High Risk Neuroblastoma Study 1.

8 of SIOP-Europe (SIOPEN)@highlight

This is a randomized study of the European SIOP Neuroblastoma Group (SIOPEN) in high-risk neuroblastoma (stages 2, 3, 4 and 4s MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, stage 4 MYCN non amplified > 12 months at diagnosis).

 The protocol consists of a rapid, dose intensive induction chemotherapy, peripheral blood stem cell harvest, attempted complete excision of the primary tumour, myeloablative therapy followed by peripheral blood stem cell rescue, radiotherapy to the site of the primary tumour and immunotherapy (R4 randomization - isotretinoin and ch14.

 Patients diagnosed after the closure of R3 randomization will not be R4 randomized.

 For these patients the use of ch14.

18/CHO antibody is recommended without scIL-2 as continuous infusion as standard of care outside of controlled trials.

 ch14.

18/CHO received marketing authorization by EMA in May 2017 (Qarziba (R)).

 In the induction phase, all patients receive Rapid COJEC following the result of the R3 randomization which was closed on June 8th, 2017 after inclusion of 630 patients as planned.

 Following induction treatment peripheral blood stem cell harvest (PBSCH) is performed and complete excision of the primary tumour will be attempted.

 Patients with an inadequate metastatic response to allow BuMel MAT followed by PBSCR at the end of induction should receive 2 TVD (Topotecan, Vincristine, Doxorubicin) cycles.

 After Rapid COJEC induction, localized patients will proceed to consolidation.

 Patients aged 12-18 months at diagnosis, with stage 4 neuroblastoma, no MYCN amplification and without segmental chromosomal alterations (SCAs) are thought to have a good prognosis and will stop treatment after induction therapy and surgery to the primary tumour.

 Consolidation consists of BuMel MAT based on the results of the R1 randomization followed by peripheral blood stem cell rescue (PBSCR) and radiotherapy to the site of the primary tumour.

 The R2 immunotherapy randomization using ch14.

18/CHO as 8 hour infusion on 5 consecutive days ( total dose (100mg/m) with or without aldesleukin (IL-2) alternated with isotretinoin (13-cis-RA) is closed.

 The amended R4 immunotherapy randomization using ch14.

18/CHO as continuous infusion (total dose 100mg/m over 10 days) with or without aldesleukin (IL-2) alternated with isotretinoin (13-cis-RA) has accrued according to plan with results pending awaiting data maturity and DMC approval.
