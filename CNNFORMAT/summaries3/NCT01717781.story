(fifthQuint)Thunderbeat Technology vs Standard Bipolar Electro Surgery in Laparoscopic Radical Hysterectomy and Pelvic Lymphadenectomy for Cervical Cancer.

 Radical abdominal hysterectomy (RAH) with pelvic lymphadenectomy is the standard surgical treatment for early stage cervical carcinoma FIGO stages IA2-IB1-IIA2cm-IIB) submitted to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with complete clinical response could be further reduced using Thunderbeat (an ultrasonic energy device that incises and coagulates by using ultrasonic and bipolar technology ) (Olympus Medical Systems Corp, Tokyo) vs.

 bipolar electrosurgery .

 Saving operative time would mean shorter anesthesia and faster recovery, further improving the safety profile of the laparoscopic approach in the treatment of cervical cancer.

 Secondary endpoints of this comparison are incidence of intra- or postoperative complications (Cardiac, Respiratory, Neurological, Gastrointestinal, Renal, Fever, Wound or other Infection, Lymphocele), estimated blood loss, postoperative pain (evaluated by VAS), days of hospitalization and costs for the health care system.

This prospective randomized pilot study is aimed to verify if the operative time of a LRH with pelvic lymphadenectomy for early stage cervical cancer (FIGO stages IA2-IB1-IIA2cm-IIB) submitted to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with complete clinical response could be reduced using Thunderbeat (an ultrasonic energy device that incises and coagulates by using ultrasonic and bipolar technology ) (Olympus Medical Systems Corp, Tokyo) vs.
