(secondQuint)A Clinical Study of the C8 MediSensors Optical Glucose Monitor.

 This is a prospective, non-randomized, open label study to evaluate the performance of the C8 MediSensors non-invasive Optical Glucose Monitor cent on individuals with diabetes mellitus.

 Capillary blood samples will be obtained throughout a daily study session; the study session may last for up to 12 hours.

 Blood glucose will be measured on a YSI blood glucose analyzer.

 Subjects may adjust food intake and insulin administration so device performance is evaluated across a broad range of glucose concentrations.

 Glucose measurements will be time matched and paired for comparison.

 Skin effects and adverse events will be evaluated.
