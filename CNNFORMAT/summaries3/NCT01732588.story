(fifthQuint)A Comparison of the Bioavailability of OZ439 When Delivered Directly to the Small Intestine, or Via the Oral Route.

 Previous clinical studies with OZ439 have shown variable PK and a food effect.

 One hypothesis is that this may be related to a 'common ion effect' leading to precipitation of the drug as a less soluble hydrochloride salt in the stomach, resulting in variable absorption of the drug.

 This study is designed to investigate the possibility of improving the PK profile by delivering the drug directly to the PSB, thereby bypassing the stomach.

 The study will compare a previously dosed PIB formulation with oral delivery of a nanoparticulate as a caplet formulation.

 The same caplet formulation containing nanoparticulate will be administered to the PSB via the Enterion capsule.

 A Comparison of the Bioavailability of OZ439 When Delivered Directly to the Small Intestine, or Via the Oral Route@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the bioavailability of nanoparticulate OZ439 delivered to the proximal small bowel (PSB) via the Enterion cent capsule relative to oral OZ439 suspension (current "powder in bottle" [PIB]) and oral nanoparticulate OZ439.

 The study will also characterise the plasma concentration time profile of OZ439 when delivered via Enterion capsule to the PSB in comparison with OZ439 PIB formulation delivered orally and nanoparticulate OZ439 delivered orally Safety and tolerability of OZ439 formulations will be determined following delivery to the PSB and administered orally
