(firstQuint)Three Methods for Best PEEP Determination Compared With PEEP Determination Guided by Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network.

 The determination of optimal level of Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory pressure remains elusive and controversial.

 Several approaches with different algorithms exist.

 Among them, Low PEEP algorithm approach and High PEEP algorithm approach.

 These approaches are characterized by a generalized application of certain level of PEEP according to a predefined algorithm.

 However, these algorithms fail to account for inter-individual variations between patients with different diseases and with different severities of the same underlying process.

 Therefore, we advocate for an individualized application of PEEP.

 Whereby, PEEP will be determined individually for each patient based on familiar and well established physiological parameters.
