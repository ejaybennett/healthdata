(thirdQuint)Early RA Vascular Randomised Controlled Study.

 One hundred RA patients with active disease (DAS28 >/=3.

2), duration of symptoms less than 2 years, and are disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug naive will participate in this 1-year prospective, hospital-based, open-label, randomized, controlled trial.

 All participants will receive 1-year tight-control treatment.

 One hundred patients will be randomly assigned to two arms.

 Treatment will be adjusted according to a standardized protocol every 3-monthly aiming at remission defined by the 2011 ACR/EULAR definition (Group 1, n=50, simplified disease activity score [SDAI] 3.

3) or minimal disease activity (Group 2, n=50, DAS28<2.

6).
