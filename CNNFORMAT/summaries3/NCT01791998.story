(thirdQuint)Magnetic Resonance Thermal Image Guided Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy in Treating Patients With Breast Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the procedural success rate of using the Visualase magnetic resonance (MR)-guided laser system to target, access, thermally monitor, and focally ablate MR-visible breast cancer lesions.

 2.

 To obtain preliminary data on ablative success using pathologic assessment for specimen excised subsequent to the ablation.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo MR-thermal image guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) over 1 hour.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-7 days.

This pilot clinical trial studies magnetic resonance thermal image guided laser interstitial thermal therapy in treating patients with breast cancer.

 Magnetic resonance thermal image guided laser interstitial thermal therapy may be able to kill tumor cells by heating up the tumor cells without affecting the surrounding tissue
