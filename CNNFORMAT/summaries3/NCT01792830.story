(fifthQuint)Efficacy and Safety of a Glargine-based Hospital Discharge Algorithm in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Patients.

 Hospital discharge represents a critical time for ensuring a safe transition to the outpatient setting and reducing the need for emergency department visits and re-hospitalization.

 Poor coordination of patient care and education on insulin administration at the time of patient discharge to home may be associated with medical errors that may increase risk of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and hospital readmission.

 No prospective studies have examined the impact of a discharge treatment regimen after cardiac surgery.

 Therefore, this study aims to determine the efficacy and safety of an HbA1c based treatment algorithm in controlling blood glucose (BG) after discharge.

 The total duration of the study is 3 months.

 This study will include diabetic and non-diabetic subjects who participated in the American Diabetes Association (ADA) trial entitled "Intensive Insulin Therapy in Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery.

" The ADA study is a two-arm randomized multicenter, open-label controlled trial aimed to determine if intensive insulin control with a BG target of 100-140mg/dl will reduce perioperative complications compared to a conventional BG control with a target of 141-180 mg/dl in hyperglycemic subjects who undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).

 Treatment recommendations at discharge: - Patients with admission HbA1c 6.

5%, he/she will be diagnosed with diabetes.

 We do not anticipate that a patient without a history of diabetes and with an HbA1c 9% prior to admission: - Discharge on basal bolus regimen at same inpatient total daily insulin dose.

 - Basal insulin (glargine) once daily, at the same time of the day.

 - Rapid-acting insulin (glulisine) before meals.

 - Alternative treatment: If no contraindications to oral agents (i.

e.

, Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and heart failure; metformin and renal failure) restart oral agents in combination to glargine once daily at 80% of total daily hospital dose.

 Efficacy and Safety of a Glargine-based Hospital Discharge Algorithm in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Patients@highlight

Most coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) patients develop high blood sugar while they are in the hospital.

 No studies have shown what the best insulin regimen is for CABG patients with type 2 diabetes is after going home from the hospital.

 Patients with high blood sugar and diabetes after cardiac bypass surgery will be followed for 3 months to look at how well their treatment(s) for diabetes work after discharge.

 Patients with diabetes will be discharged on oral antidiabetic drugs or with insulin glargine injections based on their sugar control.

 Patients with admission HbA1c 9% will be discharged on glargine at 80-100% of the dose used in the hospital in addition to oral antidiabetic drugs or with insulin glargine and insulin glulisine.

 The primary outcome will be a change in HbA1c at 4 and 12 weeks after discharge.
