(fifthQuint)Ventricular Size Involvement in Neuropsychological Outcomes in Pediatric Hydrocephalus.

 The current literature is inconclusive regarding the direct association between large ventricle size and poorer cognitive outcomes.

 This uncertainty stems from relatively few studies, problems with study design (possible confounding factors), varying study populations of hydrocephalus, and conflicting evidence.

 If the association is proven then aggressive strategies must be developed to maximally decrease ventricular size in these children to preserve long-term cognitive functioning.

 However, if the association is disproven then previous reservations for procedures such as Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV) or higher-resistance shunting to prevent overdrainage complications will be further minimized.

 Either finding has a major potential to further improve the quality of life in our pediatric hydrocephalus patients.

 This study is unique as it will include pediatric patients presenting with hydrocephalus from a wide range of etiologies.

 This study is also unique in that we propose to conduct a brief pre-operative neuropsychological examination to act as internal controls along with the outcomes obtained at a more extensive neuropsychological examination at six months after initial hydrocephalus treatment surgery.

 Ventricular Size Involvement in Neuropsychological Outcomes in Pediatric Hydrocephalus@highlight

This multicenter, prospective study of children with hydrocephalus will examine whether or not ventricle size is associated with poor cognitive outcomes.

 It is expected that results will indicate larger ventricular size at 6 months after surgery for the initial treatment of hydrocephalus will relate to poorer cognitive outcomes.

 This study is being conducted by the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (HCRN), a network established to conduct multi-institutional clinical trials on pediatric hydrocephalus.
