(secondQuint)A Randomized Phase 2 Trial of Combining Sipuleucel-T With Immediate vs.

 Delayed CTLA-4 Blockade for Prostate Cancer.

 This is an open-label randomized multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial combining SipT with ipilimumab in patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

 All patients will be treated with standard SipT (Q2wks x 3).

 Patients will be randomized to one of two arms: Arm 1 (Immediate Treatment): Ipilimumab Q3wks x 4 started 1 day following the final dose of SipT (Day 0).

 Arm 2 (Delayed Treatment): Ipilimumab Q3wks x 4 started 3 weeks following the final dose of SipT (Day 0).

 Following this ipilimumab treatment, patients will then be followed monthly for 3 months and then quarterly until disease progression.

 The definition of unacceptable toxicity is grade 3 or higher treatment-related toxicities (NCI CTCAE v4) excluding irAEs.

 The study will assess for the immunogenicity and clinical activity of sequential sipuleucel-T treatment followed by ipilimumab.

 Patients who experience an initial clinical response to ipilimumab followed by subsequent disease progression will be offered reinduction treatment with ipilimumab.

 Delayed CTLA-4 Blockade for Prostate Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to find out what effects taking ipilimumab, as an immediate or delayed treatment, following completion of sipuleucel-T (SipT) treatment, has on patients and their prostate cancer.
