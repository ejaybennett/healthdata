(thirdQuint)Comparison of DBS Targets in Obsessive-compulsive Disorder.

 Deep brain stimulation has been proposed for severe and resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

 This electrical stimulation has been tested on, and shown to be effective at, different targets (subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus & nucleus accumbens).

 However, the efficacies of each target have never been compared directly.

 Therefore, bilateral subthalamic and caudate electrodes will be implanted in severe OCD patients.

 Efficacy of stimulation at the different targets will be assessed using a double-blind randomised crossover design.

 Comparison of DBS Targets in Obsessive-compulsive Disorder@highlight

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been proposed for severe and resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder.

 This electrical stimulation has been tested on, and shown to be effective at, different targets (subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus & nucleus accumbens).

 However, the efficacies of each target have never been compared directly.

 This protocol aims to do so, with the hypothesis that subthalamic (STN) stimulation will be more efficacious.
