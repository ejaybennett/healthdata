(fifthQuint)A Mannequin Study to Assess Various CPR Training Methods Using a Student Population.

 The long term goal of our work is to implement real world CPR training strategies that maximize resuscitation skill retention, and promote willingness to act while addressing major barriers to training including time and cost.

 To accomplish this, the study team will train student volunteers from the University of Pennsylvania using one of three methods: 1) a video-only method with no psychomotor skill practice, 2) a video-only method with psychomotor skill practice on a household object or 3) a video self-instruction (VSI) kit.

 Volunteers will be young, healthy students from the University of Pennsylvania with no CPR Training within the last 24 months.

 The investigators will use the American Heart Association's CPR Anytime Video Self-Instruction Kit which comes equipped with a DVD and inflatable manikin.

 For the groups receiving the Video-Only methods, the investigators will remove the inflatable manikin and train the subjects with the DVD.

 The investigators will randomize the participants to one of the video-only methods or to the VSI kit method of training when they are scheduled for training.

 Immediately following the training, the investigators will conduct a CPR skills test to measure the effectiveness of the training method.

 Three (3) to twelve (12) months post-training the investigators will schedule and conduct an in-person interview with subjects.

 As part of the interview, subjects will be asked to complete a survey measuring their comfort level and willingness to use their CPR skills.

 Subjects will also be asked to complete another CPR Skills test.

Prompt delivery of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can double a victims chance of survival from cardiac arrest (CA), yet it is provided in less than 1/3 of witnessed events.

 Studies indicate that video-based education methods can effectively train bystanders in CPR.

 Using the education and evaluation methods of an existing in-hospital training program, the investigators will assess the CPR skills of students taught with video-only methods, with and without psychomotor skills practice, and compare them to those using a video self-instruction (VSI) kit.
