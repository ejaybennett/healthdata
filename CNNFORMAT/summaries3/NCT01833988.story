(secondQuint)The Summer Camp Study: Blood Glucose Control With a Bi-Hormonal Bionic Endocrine Pancreas.

 The bionic pancreas will be compared to usual care in a crossover design in which each volunteer will serve as his or her own control.

 Each volunteer will be under closed-loop glucose control for five days and usual camp level of diabetes care for five days in random order with a one day washout period in between.

This study will test the hypothesis that a wearable automated bionic pancreas system that automatically delivers both insulin and glucagon can improved glycemic control vs.

 usual care for young people with type 1 diabetes 12-20 in a diabetes camp environment.
