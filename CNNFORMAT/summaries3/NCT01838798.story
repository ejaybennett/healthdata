(fifthQuint)Neuropsychological Impact of Hospitalization on Intubated, Ventilated and Sedated ICU Patients.

 The secondary objectives of this study are: A.

 To study the potential links between cognitive impairment and quality of life 4 months after discharge from the Intensive Care Unit.

 B.

 To study the associations between variables measured during hospitalization.

 Is there "clustering" among certain symptoms during hospitalization? C.

 To study the associations between variables measured at two and four months after ICU discharge.

 Is there clustering among these symptoms? D.

 To study potential risk factors for cognitive problems at 4 months after ICU discharge.

 E.

 If objective C determines the presence of clusters, is the presence / absence of these clusters related to the variables (or clusters of variables) measured during hospitalization? F.

 To study potential risk factors for poor quality of life at 4 months:.

 Neuropsychological Impact of Hospitalization on Intubated, Ventilated and Sedated ICU Patients@highlight

This is a prospective, single-center, pilot, cohort study.

 The first phase of this study is observational and the usual care of patients is maintained during the ICU stay, except for an interview with a psychologist preceding patient discharge.

 A phone interview at 2 months and a visit with a psychologist at four months after ICU discharge are specific to the study.

 The main objective of this study is to make a first estimate of the percentage of patients (CI = +- 10%) with cognitive impairment at four months after ICU discharge.

 The presence / absence of cognitive impairment will be determined by the D2 test.
