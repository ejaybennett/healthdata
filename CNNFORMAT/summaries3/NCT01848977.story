(thirdQuint)Comparison of Two Devices Using Near-infra Red Spectroscopy During a Vascular Occlusion Test.

 Tissue oxygen saturation is non-invasively measured using near-infrared spectroscopy, by two device, INVOS(R)(somanetics Corporation, USA ) and InSpectra cent (Hutchinson Technology, USA).

 InSpectra cent was introduced later than INVOS(R).

 With InSpectra cent , clinicians have used a vascular occlusion test (VOT) to evaluate dynamic changes in tissue oxygen saturation during ischemia and reperfusion, and thus, microcirculatory function.

 There have been little data about VOT using INVOS(R), although it is more popular device.

 We hypothesized that there would be a difference between the values from INVOS(R) and InSpectra cent .

 The aim of this study is to evaluate changes in tissue oxygen saturation in the thenar muscle during VOT using INVOS(R) and comapre it to InSpectra cent in a normal population.

 Comparison of Two Devices Using Near-infra Red Spectroscopy During a Vascular Occlusion Test@highlight

Tissue oxygen saturation is non-invasively measured using near-infrared spectroscopy, by two device, INVOS(R)(somanetics Corporation, USA ) and InSpectra cent (Hutchinson Technology, USA).

 Each probes are attached to both thenar muscles and vascular occlusion test (VOT) is performed.

 The investigators will compare the Invos(R) data to InSpectra cent to investigate whether tissue oxygen saturation values by INVOS(R) can substitute for InSpectra cent .
