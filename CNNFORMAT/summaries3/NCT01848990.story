(thirdQuint)CONSISTENT 1: Metabolic and Safety Outcomes of Hylenex Recombinant (Hyaluronidase Human Injection) Preadministered at CSII Infusion Site in Participants With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM).

 This Phase 4 study is designed to demonstrate noninferiority of pretreatment with Hylenex recombinant in the CSII setting to rapid-acting analog insulin alone with respect to glycemic control as assessed by changes in HbA1c in participants with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.

 Total duration of study treatment is 24 months.

 However, according to the study design, the primary outcome measure is to be assessed at 6 months and an interim analysis is to be completed at 6 months for the secondary outcome measures and adverse events.

 Therefore, data reported in this clinical trials record is for the 6-month interim analysis.

The primary objectives of this study are to compare the difference in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to Month 6 using Hylenex recombinant preadministration in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) versus standard CSII and to evaluate the safety of Hylenex recombinant preadministration, including local tolerability, adverse events, and hypo- and hyperglycemia rates.
