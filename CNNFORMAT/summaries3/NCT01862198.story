(firstQuint)The Usefulness of Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Biliary Drainage With a Newly Designed Hybrid Metallic Stent.

 Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage with a fully covered metallic stent was a safe and effective method in patients with malignant biliary obstructions and had a comparatively long patency duration.

 Nevertheless, the significant rate of distal stent migration cannot be ignored, suggesting the need for a newly designed metallic stent for endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage.
