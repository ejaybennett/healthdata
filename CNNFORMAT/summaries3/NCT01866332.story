 One hundred and forty-eight patients will be randomized to receive either conventional physical therapy, which consist of a combination of manual therapy techniques, general exercises and specific exercises for spinal segmental stabilization (Conventional Physical Therapy Group) or to receive conventional physical therapy plus the addition of the Kinesio Taping in the lumbar spine (Conventional Physical Therapy plus Kinesio Taping), over a period of 5 weeks (10 sessions of treatment).

 Clinical outcomes (pain intensity, disability and global perceived effect ) will be collected at baseline and at 5 weeks, 3 and 6 months after randomization.

 Data will be collected by a blinded examiner who will be unaware about the group allocation.

 All statistical analysis will be conducted following the principles of intention to treat analysis and the between-group differences will be performed using Mixed Linear Models.
