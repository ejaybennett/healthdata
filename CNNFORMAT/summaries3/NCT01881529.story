(firstQuint)A Non-Interventional Pilot Study Assessing Whether Lysyl Oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) is Present in Subjects With Scleroderma.

 Scleroderma is a chronic skin-hardening disease.

 There are two types of scleroderma.

 The first type is called limited cutaneous scleroderma, where disrupted blood flow causes skin discoloration and sometimes patients experience high blood pressure in their arteries.

 The second type is called diffuse cutaneous scleroderma and it is much more aggressive, affecting a larger area of skin causing organ damage.

 This study will determine if the disease is associated with an elevated expression of LOXL2 levels in tissue samples from patients.

 A Non-Interventional Pilot Study Assessing Whether Lysyl Oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) is Present in Subjects With Scleroderma@highlight

To treat patients with scleroderma by blocking the expression of LOXL2.

 The investigators first need to confirm (through observation) that LOXL2 is overexpressed in disease.
