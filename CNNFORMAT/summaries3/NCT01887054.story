(firstQuint)Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Disease.

 This study is a randomized, prospective, single-blinded six-week study in PD patients with freezing of gait (FOG).

 This study will involve 2 study groups: Group A - training group; Group B - no training group/controls.

 Both groups will complete a gait evaluation and neuropsychological testing.

 Group A will also practice an in-home visuospatial task for 30 minutes, 4-6 days per week for six weeks.

 Group B will not complete the in-home tasks.

 Participation in this study is expected to last 6-8 weeks.
