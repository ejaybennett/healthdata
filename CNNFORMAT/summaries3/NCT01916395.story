(thirdQuint)Comparison of Treximet & Imitrex as They Affect the Levels of Inflammatory Markers When the Patient is Actively Having a Migraine Headache.

 Migraine is a neurovascular process involving the brain and related structures.

 Neuroinflammatory substances such as CRP, CGRP, VIP, SP, and prostaglandins are liberated during the migraine.

 Elevation of these markers may be associated with other conditions which contain an inflammatory component such as coronary artery disease.

 VIP is an inflammation and pain transmission, and thus are markers of sensory nociceptive neurons.

 During this study, the subjects will have the following inflammation markers analyzed: C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP), and Substance P (SP).

 Comparison of Treximet & Imitrex as They Affect the Levels of Inflammatory Markers When the Patient is Actively Having a Migraine Headache@highlight

The primary objective is to determine whether inflammatory markers, such as C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP), or Substance P (SP) are reduced in patients having a migraine headache when treated with Imitrex or Treximet.

 The secondary objective is to determine the effects of Imitrex and Treximet on C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in patients with active migraine headaches.
