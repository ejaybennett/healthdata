(secondQuint)Testing Whether Brief Use of a Virtual Reality Device Improves Gait.

 Older adults are at risk for recurrent falls.

 This study will involve a single study session (lasting two hours) in the controlled setting of a research laboratory.

 This study will evaluate whether older adults who have had unintentional falls are willing to enroll in this kind of study, use the device briefly, and undergo research assessments.

 The study will also test whether using the virtual reality device leads to detectable changes in gait, balance, and mobility confidence.

 This study will lay the groundwork for more comprehensive studies in the future that will assess the clinical impact of using the device.

 Twenty-four subjects will be recruited.

 They will include equal numbers of older adults who: (1) have fallen without a significant injury (e.

g.

 only minor contusion, lacerations) or (2) have fallen with a significant injury (e.

g.

 dislocation, strain/sprain, or fracture) which has healed prior to enrollment.

 Each subject will complete baseline measures of gait, balance, and confidence.

 Then she or he will be introduced to the virtual reality device and will use it for a brief period.

 Gait and balance will be tested again, first with the virtual reality device and then, finally, without the virtual reality device.

 The device (GaitAid(R)), developed by co-investigator Yoram Baram, Ph.

D.

, has already been used for the rehabilitation of neurological patients (e.

g.

 Parkinson's Disease).

 The device is a training tool and NOT a continuous walking aid.

 Testing Whether Brief Use of a Virtual Reality Device Improves Gait@highlight

A virtual reality device has already been successfully used for improving gait in adults who have neurological conditions.

 We will evaluate if it is feasible to study the brief use of this device in older adults who have had falls.
