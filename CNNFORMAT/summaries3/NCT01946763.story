(thirdQuint)Does Pre-operative Patients' Education Facilitates Emergence of Anesthesia Following Bariatric Surgery?.

 The purpose of our study is to compare post operative immediate recovery and emergence for educated and non educated morbidly obese patients underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery.

 Elligibles patients are informed and consented by anesthesiologist.

 Patients are randomized in 2 groups (G1: educated, G2:non-educated) Patient of G1 are educated in OR before starting anesthesia.

 This education includes : information about anesthesia emergence, recovery and extubation.

 Anesthesia and education are conducted by the same anesthesiologist.

 All patients are operated by the same surgeon.

 All patients receive same balanced general anesthesia protocol.

 The recovery starts immediately after the end of the procedure, when the patient has BIS 90 and TOF9.

 Recovery assessment and data recording is done by a blinded anesthesiologist.

 Does Pre-operative Patients' Education Facilitates Emergence of Anesthesia Following Bariatric Surgery?@highlight

The recovery and emergences from anesthesia is a critical phase.

 Previous studies focused on pharmological and anesthetics techniques to improve the quality of this stage (duration, complications).

 In this study, our first aim is to test the impact of pre operative education on the post operative recovery for morbidly obese patient underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery.
