(thirdQuint)GPR vs Manual PT for Chronic Neck Pain.

 These study will use two groups: one to receive GPR which is a systematic method of addressing musculoskeletal pain and related functional deficits and the other to receive "usual care" manual PT which will be individualized to the patient's condition.

 Usual care will include techniques commonly used in clinical practice selected by the physical therapist after initial examination.

 After nine weeks of treatment, baseline measures will be re-evaluated.

 After conclusion of the first phase of the study, patients who were randomized to the "usual care" group will cross-over and receive GPR.
