(secondQuint)Anesthesia for Retinopathy of Prematurity.

 60 patients who underwent laser surgery due to retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) were included in the study.

 The sedation group (Group S, n=30), received 1 mg/kg ketamine and 1 mg/kg propofol as a bolus for induction.

 The patients then received an infusion of 100-150 mcg/kg/min propofol and 0.

25mg/kg/h of ketamine for maintenance.

 In the general anesthesia group (Group G, n=30), anesthesia was induced using 8% sevoflurane by inhalation with 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen; endotracheal intubation was facilitated without use of a neuromuscular blocker agent.

 Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (2%) and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen.

 Our primary objective was to evaluate the need for post-operative mechanical ventilation.

 Anesthesia for Retinopathy of Prematurity@highlight

Premature infants experience more respiratory problems after surgical procedures.

 The investigators aimed to compare general anesthesia with sedation on the need for post-operative mechanical ventilation in infants undergoing retinopathy of prematurity surgery.
