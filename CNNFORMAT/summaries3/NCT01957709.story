(firstQuint)Recombinant Interferon Gamma in Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine whether systemic administration of interferon (IFN) gamma (recombinant interferon gamma) will increase class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression in synovial sarcoma (SS) and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL) tumors.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine whether systemic administration of IFN gamma will increase class II MHC expression in SS and MRCL tumors.

 II.

 To examine changes in the immune response to MRCL and SS by examining changes in the immune infiltrates, antibody response and antigen specific T cell response before and after IFN gamma treatment.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive recombinant interferon gamma subcutaneously (SC) every 7 days for 4 weeks before surgery or thrice weekly for 2 weeks before surgery.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks post-surgery.

 Recombinant Interferon Gamma in Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies the effect of recombinant interferon gamma on tissue in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

 Interferon gamma may interfere with the growth of tumor cells.
