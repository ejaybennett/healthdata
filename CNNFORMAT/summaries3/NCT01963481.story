(secondQuint)Exemestane and Cyclophosphamide for Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells.

 Hormone therapy using exemestane may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.

 Low dose cyclophosphamide may also stimulate the white blood cells, including natural killer cells, for instance by decreasing the suppressor (regulatory) T-cells.

 Giving exemestane with cyclophosphamide may be an effective treatment for estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, and HER2-negative stage IV breast cancer.
