(thirdQuint)What Are we Missing? Diagnosing Uterine Adenomyosis Using Ultrasound Elastography.

 Currently benign conditions of the uterus are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed.

 This project will help determine which diagnostic radiology exams are most helpful to the clinician in providing accurate diagnosis.

 In addition, this study will evaluate which exam (MRI vs.

 Ultrasound) patients prefer over another exam.
