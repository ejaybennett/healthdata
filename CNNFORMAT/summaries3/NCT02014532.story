(thirdQuint)Role of Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists in Treatment of Chronic Periodontitis.

 A RCT was carried out to check the efficacy of Montelukast as an adjunct to scaling and root planing.

 The patients were randomised to either test group (SRP + Montelukast) and control group (SRP).

 Clinical parameters were assessed at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks.

 Serum C-reactive protein levels were assessed at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks.

 Role of Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists in Treatment of Chronic Periodontitis@highlight

The adjunctive use of Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist (Montelukast) along with scaling and root planing in patients with chronic periodontitis leads to host inflammatory response modulation and decrease in serum C reactive protein (CRP) levels.

 If proven this will open new vistas in treatment of chronic periodontitis.
