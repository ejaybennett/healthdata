(firstQuint)Intensity of Physical Activity Measured by Activity Monitors in Elderly Persons.

 Activity monitors measure activity in counts.

 The higher the counts, the higher the intensity of the measured activity.

 In this study the count cut off points for low, moderate and high intensity activity will be investigated in a population of elderly people over the age of 70.

 This information will subsequently (in future studies) be used to investigate the physical activity patterns in a population of elderly over the age of 70 who have worn an activity monitor for a duration of 7 days.
