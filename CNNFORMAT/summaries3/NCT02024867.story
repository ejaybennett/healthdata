(secondQuint)Evaluation of 3 Versus 10 Days of Antibiotics in Skin Abscesses After Surgical Drainage.

 Patients age 3 months to 17 years presenting to a pediatric Emergency Department (ED) with an uncomplicated skin abscess that required surgical drainage were randomized to receive 3 or 10 days of oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

 Patients were evaluated 10 to 14 days later to assess for cure.

 Patients were contacted 1 month later to determine if they had developed another skin infection.

 Outcomes were also stratified by methicillin-resistent staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).
