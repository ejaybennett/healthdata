(firstQuint)BMT and High Dose Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide for Chimerism Induction and Renal Allograft Tolerance.

 Transplantation is a good treatment for people with end-stage kidney disease.

 However, there is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it working for a long time.

 Unless a person receiving a kidney from someone else takes drugs that reduce immune function, the kidney will be rejected.

 Those drugs must be continued life-long and cause many issues.

 Therefore, tolerance of the transplanted kidney, without chronic rejection and without the need for permanent immunosuppressive drug treatment, is a highly desirable goal.

 If this can be achieved, it would make "one kidney for life" possible.

 The study treatment includes several days of study medications followed by a kidney and bone marrow transplant.

 After the transplant, the study treatment will continue with a few more doses of study medications and then anti-rejection medication is started.

 After a while, the anti-rejection medication is slowly stopped.

 Researchers will examine blood and tissue samples and try to identify genetic markers for certain conditions like chimerism, response to therapy, and tolerance.

The purpose of this study is to find out if the study treatment will allow people to accept their new kidney and be able to stop taking anti-rejection medications.
