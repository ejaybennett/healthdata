(secondQuint)Impact of Maternal Xylitol Consumption on Mutans Sterptococci.

 Method: Study sample included 60 mother and child pairs with high salivary mutans streptococcus (MS) levels.

 Samples were randomly divided into experimental group (30 pairs) and control group (30 pairs).

 Mothers in the experimental group received xylitol chewing gum treatment three times/day for three months, whereas the controls received fluoride varnish.

 Both groups received oral hygiene instructions, dietary counseling and restorative treatment.

 All children were examined after 6, 12 and 18 months from the initiation of the study to assess caries, plaque and salivary mutans streptococcus (MS) levels.
