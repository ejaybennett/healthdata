(fifthQuint)The NORDSTEN Study - Degenerative Spondylolisthesis.

 Purpose: The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of two principally different surgical methods for treating LDS and to investigate whether predictors will be associated with an intervention-related difference in outcome between the two groups.

 Methods: The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) will be used as primary outcome measure.

 Depending on whether the participants obtain a 30% or more ODI- improvement from before operation to 24 months after the operation, they will be dichotomized in a success group (responders) and in a non-success group (non- responders).

 The primary question is whether the proportion of patients with successful outcome in the DA group is not markedly less than in the DF group, 24 months after operation.

 Investigators have predefined the margin of "markedly less" to be = 0.

15 (15%) which is consistent with the between- group difference Blumenthal et al used in the power analysis in a similar Food and Drug Administration- regulated non- inferiority RCT.

 With this margin it will be necessary to treat 6.

7 patients with fusion in addition to decompression in order to obtain one patient with successful outcome.

 The null hypothesis is that the proportion of patients with a successful outcome in the DF group (nDF) is higher than the proportion in the DA group (nDA) by an amount of at least 0.

15 (): H0: nDF >= nDA + H0 will be tested by forming a 95% CI for the difference of proportions and H0 will be rejected if the upper limit of the confidence interval (CI) is less than 0.

15.

 By rejecting H0, the alternative hypothesis will be accepted: H1: nDF By accepting H1, the conclusion will be that DA is non-inferior DF and hence as good as DF.

 In addition to the main analysis it will be investigated whether the following predictors are associated with a difference in outcome measures 24 months after the operation: 1.

 Treatment group 2.

 Patient age 3.

 Gender 4.

 Comorbidity (ASA group) 5.

 Body Mass Index 6.

 Smoking 7.

 Preoperative ODI score 8.

 Preoperative NRS back pain 9.

 Preoperative NRS leg pain 10.

 Hopkins symptom check list (HSCL-25) 11.

 The magnitude of olistheses and local kyphosis measured on standing x-rays 12.

 Segmental instability verified on flexion/extension x-rays 13.

 Presence of foraminal stenosis in the level of olisthesis 14.

 Orientation of the facet joint in the level of olisthesis 15.

 Amount of facet joint fluid in the level of olisthesis 16.

 Degree of disc degeneration in the level of olisthesis 17.

 Disc height in the level of olisthesis 18.

 Pelvic incidence This will be published in a separate article.

 Sample size: The sample size calculation is based on the hypothesis that the 2-year results for the DA group is as least as good as for the DF group when comparing the proportions of responders in each group.

 The sample size is computing by using the Blackwelder methodology.

 Based on data from the Norwegian Spine Register, the proportion of responders for the whole treatment group is expected to be 0.

70.

 Choosing a type 1 error = 0.

05, power = 0.

80 and = 0.

15 gives a sample size of 116.

 Considering these assumptions and adding 10% for possible dropouts, a total of 128 patients are required in each group.

 Statistical analysis: To determine whether randomization is successful descriptive statistics will be used for comparing baseline characteristics between the groups.

 Differences in the effect measure for the primary outcome (proportions of patients with successful outcome), including the Newcombe hybrid score confidence interval, will be estimated.

 It will be use a mixed model analysis both to evaluate the primary and secondary outcomes, and to evaluate the effect of each efficacy variable over time and between groups (all follow-up measurements from inclusion to two years follow-up will be included).

 In the mixed model patients are not excluded from the analysis of an efficacy variable if the variable is missing at some, but not all, time points after baseline.

 If there are patients with missing data in the primary outcome, sensitivity analyses with different imputation scenarios will be performed.

 The scenarios include all DA patients (with missing data) are responders and none of the DF patients (with missing data) are responders, and vice versa; all DA and all DF patients are responders; all DA and all DF patients are non-responders.

 A significance level of 5% will be used throughout.

 The statistical analysis will be done according to intention to treat principles (ITT).

 A sensitivity analysis will be conducted where patient crossing over from one treatment to another will receive the last score before crossover.

 To recommend DA, both the ITT and the sensitivity analysis are required to show non- inferiority.

 The analysis will be conducted by an independent statistician blinded to the treatments.

 Interim analysis and stopping rules: When 75 patients in each group have completed the 12 months follow- up, the investigators will do an interim analysis.

 Due to ethical considerations the inclusion of patients will be terminated if the analysis reveals one of the following: 1.

 The proportion of patients with successful outcome in the DF group is higher than in the DA group by an amount of 0.

20.

 2.

 The proportion of patients needing reoperation due to any condition in the operated level(s) is statistically significant higher in one of the groups.

 The reporting of the trial will be based on an adapted Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist for reporting non- inferiority trials.

 The NORDSTEN Study - Degenerative Spondylolisthesis@highlight

Lumbar Degenerative Spondylolisthesis (LDS) is a slippage of one vertebra over another caused by degeneration of facet joints, ligaments and intervertebral discs.

 Most patients suffer from symptoms related to spinal stenosis, such as radiating pain to the lower extremities, and typically increased pain in the lower limbs when walking upright and decreased when bending forward.

 There is a moderate grade of evidence for whether patients will achieve better outcome after surgery when decompression is followed by fusion.

 In theory, fusion following decompression should give more stability to the operated level, thus less pain and less progression of the olisthesis.

 On the other hand, fusion procedures, in general, are associated with more severe complications and postoperative mortality than decompression alone.

 In summary, there is still insufficient evidence for performing fusion in addition to decompression for patients with LDS.

 The investigators are planning a trial where the main aim is to detect whether the intervention-related difference in outcome between decompression alone (DA) and decompression followed by fusion with instrumentation (DF) is large enough to justify the use of the fusion procedure.

 The proposed trial is a randomized, controlled, multicentre, non- inferiority trial with two parallel groups, with 15 participating Norwegian hospitals.

 The main analysis will be performed 2 years after surgery with long-term follow-up planned at 5 and 10 years postoperatively.
