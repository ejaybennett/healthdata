(firstQuint)Assessment of a New Closed-loop Algorithm in Type 1 Diabetes (Saddle Point Model Predictive Control : SP-MPC) (PPA).

 Ten patients will be assessed during a closed-loop night and an open-loop night in random order.

 The primary objective is to assess the ability of SP-MPC controler to maintain euglycemia and avoid hypoglycaemia during the night, compared to open loop in type 1 diabetic patients treated by insulin pump.
