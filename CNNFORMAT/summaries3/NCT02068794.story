(thirdQuint)MV-NIS Infected Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of intraperitoneal administration of an Edmonston's strain measles virus genetically engineered to produce sodium iodine symporter (NIS) (measles virus [MV]-NIS) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, delivered by adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC).

 (Phase I) II.

 To assess the 4 month progression free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the tolerability of this regimen.

 (Phase II) II.

 To assess the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 (Phase II) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with MV-NIS versus MSC delivered MV-NIS using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging.

 (Phase II) II.

 To assess viremia, viral replication, and measles virus shedding/persistence following intraperitoneal administration.

 (Phase II) III.

 To assess humoral and cellular immune response to the injected virus.

 (Phase II) IV.

 To assess in a preliminary fashion the development of antitumor immune response.

 (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by phase II study.

 Patients receive oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter intraperitoneally (IP) over 30 minutes on day 1 of course 1 and MV-NIS infected mesenchymal stem cells IP over 30 minutes of subsequent courses.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5 years.

 MV-NIS Infected Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer@highlight

This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (MV-NIS) infected mesenchymal stem cells and to see how well it works in treating patients with ovarian cancer that has come back.

 Mesenchymal stem cells may be able to carry tumor-killing substances directly to ovarian cancer cells.
