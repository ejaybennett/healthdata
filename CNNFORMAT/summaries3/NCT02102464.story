(thirdQuint)Treatment of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction and Dry Eye in Contact Lens Wearers.

 This is a prospective, non-significant risk, open-label, randomized clinical trial of LipiFlow(R) treatment of contact lens wearers with meibomian gland dysfunction and evaporative dry eye.

 All subjects undergo examination to determine study eligibility and to capture the Baseline status.

 Subjects are randomized to receive LipiFlow(R) treatment (Treatment Group) or no LipiFlow(R) treatment (Untreated Control Group).

 The Treatment group is evaluated one month after receiving LipiFlow(R) treatment.

 Study endpoints are evaluated at 3 Months by comparing the Treatment Group to the Untreated Group.

 To facilitate subject recruitment, the Untreated Control group receives Crossover LipiFlow(R) treatment (Crossover Treatment Group) at 3 Months.

 The Crossover Treatment group is evaluated one month after receiving LipiFlow(R) treatment (4 Months visit).
