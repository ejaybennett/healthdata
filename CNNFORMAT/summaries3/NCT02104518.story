(firstQuint)Evaluation of Different G6PD Testing Platforms.

 In this study we propose to evaluate the performance of several G6PD testing platforms.

 We will also determine the concordance between point-of-care G6PD tests and the spectrophotometric gold standard.

 This study will also access the sensitivity and specificity between the point-of-care G6PD tests.

 This study will take place in Indonesia, specifically in the SW Sumba region.

 We will enroll 700 volunteers.
