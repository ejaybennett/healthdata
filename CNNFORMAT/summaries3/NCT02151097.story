(fifthQuint)PRIME - PRostate Imaging for Margin Evaluation.

 This study is a prospective, single-centre feasibility study to evaluate the use of intra-operative Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging (CLI) of prostatectomy specimens to determine margin status.

 Subjects will receive an intravenous injection of 370 Mega Becquerel (MBq) of 18F-choline prior to routine, elective radical prostatectomy.

 The surgery will be performed according to standard-of-care.

 The resected prostatectomy specimens will be imaged using the LightPathTM Imaging System, consisting of a light-tight box containing an ultra-sensitive lens and Electron Multiplying Charged-Coupled Device (EMCCD) camera.

 This study will measure the agreement between margin status of the prostatectomy specimen as determined by CLI and by histopathology (reference method).

 This study will assess feasibility before proceeding to a pivotal study to evaluate the benefits of the LightPathTM Imaging System in clinical practice.

 PRIME - PRostate Imaging for Margin Evaluation@highlight

This study will evaluate the feasibility of using intra-operative Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging (CLI) of prostatectomy specimens to determine tumour margin status.

 The samples will be imaged using the LightPathTM Imaging System which consists of a light-tight box containing an ultra-sensitive lens and radiation-shielded camera.

 This study will measure the correlation between margin status of the WLE specimen and the metastatic status of dissected lymph nodes as determined by the LightPathTM Imaging System and by histopathology.

 This is a pilot study to assess feasibility before proceeding to a pivotal study to evaluate the benefits of the LightPathTM system in clinical practice.
