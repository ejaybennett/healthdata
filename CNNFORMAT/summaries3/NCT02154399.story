(secondQuint)EF5 in Measuring Tumor Hypoxia in Patients With Stage I-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess the frequency and degree of hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

 II.

 Correlate hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with potential serum/plasma markers of hypoxia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

 III.

 Correlate hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with tissue markers of hypoxia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

 IV.

 Correlate hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with tumor angiogenesis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

 V.

 Correlated hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with apoptosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

 VI.

 Measure and characterize tumor perfusion in relationship to hypoxia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

 VII.

 Correlate tumor perfusion to microvessel density in tumor samples in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

 VIII.

 Determine the longevity of EF5 adducts in human lung tumors.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive EF5 intravenously (IV) over 1-2.

5 hours.

 Beginning 24-55 hours later, patients undergo tumor hypoxia measurement using a polarographic needle electrode and intraoperative tumor measurement before undergoing surgical biopsy or resection.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4-6 weeks.

 EF5 in Measuring Tumor Hypoxia in Patients With Stage I-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

This pilot phase II trial studies how well EF5 works in measuring lack of tumor oxygen, hypoxia, in patients with stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer.

 EF5 may be effective in measuring the lack of oxygen in lung tumors and may allow doctors to plan better treatment.
