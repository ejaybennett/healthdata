(thirdQuint)Effect of Dexlansoprazole 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID on Recurrence of Intestinal Metaplasia in Subjects Who Have Achieved Complete Eradication of Barrett's Esophagus With Radiofrequency Ablation.

 The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of 12 months of treatment with dexlansoprazole 60 mg QD or dexlansoprazole 60 mg BID on the recurrence of IM in participants who have achieved complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM) and dysplasia (CED) with RFA.

 The study will enroll approximately 150 participants.

 Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Dexlansoprazole 60 mg once a day and placebo (this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient) once a day - Dexlansoprazole 60 mg twice a day.

 All participants will be asked to take one capsule twice a day at the same time each day throughout the study.

 This randomized, double-blind, multi-center, parallel group trial will be conducted in North America.

 The overall time to participate in this study is up to 13 months.

 Participants will make 5 visits to the clinic, and will undergo a safety follow-up assessment 30 days after the last dose of study drug.
