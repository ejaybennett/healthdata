(secondQuint)Measuring Cardiovascular Stress in Patients on Hemodialysis Study II.

 Specific Aims are as follows: 1.

 Assess the accuracy of a new rule set for CVInsight(R) in predicting intradialytic hypotensive episodes.

 2.

 Assess the comparative predictive accuracy of CVInsight(R) to other measures with regard to intradialytic hypotensive events.

 3.

 Assess estimated dry weight goals by monitoring post-dialytic vascular refill using CVInsight(R) and other measures.

 4.

 Assess hemodialysis(HD)-induced myocardial injury by monitoring the occurrence and frequency of arrhythmias and the levels of cardiac Troponin T.

The overall goal is to evaluate the predictive accuracy of a measure of autoregulatory adequacy derived from CVInsight and compare it with other measures in recognizing hypotensive events during hemodialysis.
