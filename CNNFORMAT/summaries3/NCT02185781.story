(thirdQuint)Phase I Study of Adoptive Immunotherapy With Enriched and Expanded Autologous Natural Killer (NK) Cells for Patients With Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).

 This is an open label, multicenter, phase I study of adoptive immunotherapy with enriched and expanded autologous natural killer (NK) cells for patients with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in complete hematologic remission (CHR) but with persistent/recurrent minimal residual disease (MRD) 60 years or not eligible for other post-CHR treatment modalities.

 The study will investigate the safety and tolerability of a new type of NK-based immunotherapy based on the infusion of escalating doses of ex-vivo expanded autologous NK cells in Ph+ ALL patients.

 A maximum of 6 patients will be enrolled in two different steps.

 No conditioning therapies will be administered before the infusion of the expanded NK cells.

 Patients may receive tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) maintenance.

 Phase I Study of Adoptive Immunotherapy With Enriched and Expanded Autologous Natural Killer (NK) Cells for Patients With Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)@highlight

The present study aims at studying how safe and tolerable a new therapy for patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is.

 This new therapy consists of an immunotherapy, that is an approach focusing on the immune system, and it targets ALL patients in complete remission but who may still have the disease at a cellular level (this is called 'minimal residual disease').

 For any further information, please, discuss with your treating physician.
