(fifthQuint)An Ecological Approach to Addressing Childhood Obesity Issues in Imperial County.

 Our Choice is a partnership between a university-affiliated research institute, a federally qualified health center, and a county public health department.

 We used formative research, advisory committee members' recommendations, and previous research to inform the development of the Our Choice project.

 Our theory-informed multi-sector, multi-level intervention targets improvements in four health behaviors: fruit, vegetable, and water consumption, physical activity, and sleep.

 Intervention partners include 1200 families, a federally qualified health center (including three clinics), 26 early care and education centers, two elementary school districts (and 20 elementary schools), three community recreation centers, and three restaurants.

 Intervention components in all sectors target changes in behaviors, policies, systems, and the social and physical environment.

 Evaluation activities include assessment of the primary outcome, BMI z-score, at baseline, 12- and 18-months post-baseline, and sector evaluations at baseline, 12, and 24-months.

Our Choice is one of three CORD (Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration) studies funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2011 to test multi-sector, multi-level approaches to prevent and control childhood obesity.

 Our Choice is translating evidence-based approaches for modifying behaviors, policies, systems, and environments to promote fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, water consumption, and quality sleep.

 The ultimate goal is to assist Children's Health Insurance Program-eligible children between 2-12 years old attain a healthy weight.

 In addition to site-specific intervention and evaluation activities, Our Choice is working with the University of Houston Evaluation Center to conduct a cross-site evaluation on a set of shared measures.
