 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate anxiety and depression in women with stages I-III breast cancer during the first 8 weeks of doxorubicin-based adjuvant therapy randomized to receive either minocycline (minocycline hydrochloride) or placebo.

 II.

 To evaluate markers of neuro-inflammation as assessed by blood based inflammatory cytokines and C11-choline positron emission tomography (PET) in women with stages I-III breast cancer during the first 8 weeks of doxorubicin-based adjuvant therapy randomized to receive either minocycline or placebo.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 ARM I: Beginning 1 week prior to chemotherapy, patients receive minocycline hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 9 weeks.
