(thirdQuint)Study of the Effects of Pantoprazole on Levels of Prescribed Psychiatric Medications.

 Individuals with psychiatric diagnoses may be predisposed to gastroesophageal reflux disease because of the widespread use of alcohol, cigarettes, and certain psychotropic drugs in this population.

 Consequently, they are often prescribed proton pump inhibitors.

 To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to determine the effects of proton pump inhibitors on plasma levels of psychotropic drugs.

 The present clinical study will assess the effects of pantoprazole on the pharmacokinetics of valproic acid, lithium, and second-generation antipsychotics.

 Study of the Effects of Pantoprazole on Levels of Prescribed Psychiatric Medications@highlight

The purpose of this 9-day study is to determine if: 1.

 Pantoprazole modifies the steady-state plasma concentrations of orally administered psychotropic medications including valproic acid, lithium, and second-generation antipsychotics (i.

e.

, aripiprazole, asenapine, clozapine, lurasidone, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone) 2.

 Serum gastrin levels change within a week of starting or stopping pantoprazole
