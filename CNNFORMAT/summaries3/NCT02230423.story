(secondQuint)Trigeminal Endonasal Perception: A Predictor for Septoplasty Outcome.

 The aim of this study is to find out wether patients with high trigeminal perception threshold (=decreased intranasal sensibility) and low expression of TRP channels of the mucosa suffer more often from impaired nasal breathing after surgery.

 This could lead to the identification of prognostic factors and therefore prevention of nasal surgery with bad outcome.

 Further, differences between patients with empty nose syndrome and asymptomatic patients after extended intranasal surgery, concerning trigeminal perception and TRP channel expression will be investigated.

 Trigeminal Endonasal Perception: A Predictor for Septoplasty Outcome@highlight

This study investigates wether patients with increased trigeminal perception threshold and low expression of TRP channels have more often nasal blockage despite functionally successful nasal surgery (TRP channel = transient receptor potential channel).
