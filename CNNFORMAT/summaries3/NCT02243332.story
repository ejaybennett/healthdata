(thirdQuint)Dynamic Quadriceps Muscle Stimulation for Treatment of Patellofemoral Pain.

 The interventional device will be tested with 20 women aged 18-40 with evidence of patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) and without any co-morbidities that would confound data or contraindications for NMES use.

 All participants will be enrolled at a single site (Developmental Motor Lab at the University of Texas), and all of a single participant's testing will be complete within a single day with no requirement for follow-up or long-term participation.

 Participants will have their gait and quadriceps muscle activation patterns evaluated through four six-minute walk tests (6MWT).

 The first 6MWT will be without a device, second with a device worn but not activated, third with a device activated and stimulating quadriceps musculature, and the fourth without a device.

 Primary Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether electrical stimulation of the vastus medalis (VM) and/or vastus lateralis (VL) to establish coactivation of these muscles during terminal swing phase impacts severity of PFPS symptoms Secondary Objectives: Secondary purposes for this study include evaluating KneeStim and seeing if there is any evidence of proof of concept in two main areas: KneeStim as a therapeutic device that may assist individuals with joint rehabilitation KneeStim's on-board operating system and motion tracking system as an effective way to monitor joint kinematics.

 This pilot study has a prospective, controlled, single-center design.

 Participants and investigators will not be blinded to the treatment.

 Individuals who evaluate the motion-tracking data between VICON and KneeStim will not be informed which data set aligns with which treatment.

 Dynamic Quadriceps Muscle Stimulation for Treatment of Patellofemoral Pain@highlight

The purpose of this small, pilot study is to evaluate a novel device that uses neuromuscular electrical stimulation to assist quadriceps muscles as a user walks.

 This study will involve use of this device on individuals with patellofemoral pain, a relatively common injury among active people, to see if quadriceps stimulation could mitigate disparities in quadriceps activation timing that may indirectly lead to knee pain.
