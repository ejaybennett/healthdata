(thirdQuint)Antimicrobial Stewardship in Pediatric Surgery.

 Many surgeons continue to treat non-perforated or "borderline perforated" appendicitis with postoperative antibiotics despite an evidence-based definition of perforation (in the pediatric surgical literature) and many guidelines and recommendations that specify that no postoperative antibiotics are required.

 Children with perforated appendicitis are also often treated with longer-than-necessary courses of antibiotics.

 Although surgeons may feel that they only prescribe additional doses on occasion, evidence suggests that this behavior occurs in over 50% of children with non-perforated appendicitis.

 These additional doses contribute to a longer length of stay, excess costs to the health care system, and disrupt patient flow.

 Additionally, the patients are exposed to more antibiotics and their potential for adverse effects (such as incorrect dose, incorrect medication, allergic reaction, antimicrobial resistance or c difficile infection).

 Antimicrobial stewardship programs have been successful in pediatrics and adult general surgery in curbing unwarranted antibiotic use, but have never been evaluated in pediatric general surgery.

 Antimicrobial Stewardship in Pediatric Surgery@highlight

Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency in children.

 Non-perforated appendicitis patients do not require antibiotics after appendectomy.

 Although guidelines and recommendations exist to decrease post-operative antibiotic mis-use after appendectomy, surgeons continue to prescribe unwarranted antibiotics.

 The aim of this study is to determine if an Antimicrobial Stewardship Program in Pediatric Surgery will decrease the use of un-warranted antibiotics.
