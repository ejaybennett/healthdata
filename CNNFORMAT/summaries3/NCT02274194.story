(fifthQuint)Nasal and Oronasal Mask in Severe OSA Patients With Nasal Free Airflow of Obstruction.

 After agreement with the written informed consent, 30 volunteers (10 healthy volunteers and 20 patients with severe OSA), male and female, aged > 21 years were recruited in the Sleep Laboratory of Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina (FMUSP).

 The volunteers were evaluated at the Sleep Laboratory (Incor) in two phases.

 First Phase: volunteers were assessed for breathing route awake and asleep (including respiratory events in OSA patients) and were indicated as nasal breathing and oronasal breathing.

 Second phase for OSA patients: two manual full-night CPAP titration with nasal and oronasal masks in a randomized order, 14 days apart.

 Data and fluids were analyzed before and after both titration studies comparing both masks including supine and lateral position during asleep and CPAP titration.

 Third phase for OSA patiens: patients were treated with the best interface found in CPAP titration study during 30 days and patients were assessed for sleep quality, excessive sonolence during the day, airway symptoms, airway defense mechanisms biomarkers (mucociliary clearance, mucus properties, citology, inflammation cytokines and adhesion molecules and others) and serum cytokines and miRNA.

 Nasal and Oronasal Mask in Severe OSA Patients With Nasal Free Airflow of Obstruction@highlight

The obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects between 10% to 25% of the adults.

 Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first choice of treatment in severe OSA.

 However, the adherence to CPAP varies, and the interface between patient and the CPAP may interfere with adherence, comfort and efficiency as well as in sleep variables.

 Objectives: (1) to determine if self-reported airflow route (nasal or oronasal airflow) is the same as the route determined in a laboratory analysis in controls (healthy subjects) and severe OSA patients with nasal free airflow of obstruction during asleep and awake, (2) to compare the effects of nasal and oronasal CPAP titration (randomized order of masks, 14 days apart) on apnoea-hypopnoea index, CPAP level, PSG variables - including analysis for body positioning, the airway defense mechanisms (nasal mucociliary clearance, mucus properties, citology and inflammation in nasal lavage fluid) and systemic effects (serum miRNA expression and cytokines), (3) CPAP adherence after 1 month and 12 months.
