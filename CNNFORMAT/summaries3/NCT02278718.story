(thirdQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of NexoBrid in Children With Thermal Burns Compared the Standard of Care.

 A total of 160 patients will be randomized into NexoBrid and SOC treatment (80 patients per arm).

 Age distribution will be managed as follows: - 40 patients 0-23 months old - 40 patients 24 months-3 years old - 48 patients 4-11 years old - 32 patients 12-17 years old The study will be conducted in two stages.

 In Stage I, 50 children age 4-17 years, hospitalized in burn units, with deep partial thickness burns ranging from 1%-30% TBSA, and who meet the entrance criteria, will be enrolled.

 Upon completion of stage I (once the 50th patient has reached wound closure), an interim analysis will be performed on safety parameters and the results will be blindly evaluated by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).

 If the DSMB does not have any safety concerns, Stage II will commence, this time enrolling children at the aged of 0-17 years according to the study procedures.

 Following the enrollment of a subject to the study and prior to randomization, physicians will define one or more Target Wounds (TWs) per subject according to TWs definition.

 All subjects' DPT and FT burns that fit the specified criteria are intended to receive study treatment per randomized study arm and therefore, must be designated as TWs.

 Prior to eschar removal treatment with NexoBrid or SOC subjects will be medicated with appropriate analgesia and undergo wound cleansing and dressing of all wounds with antibacterial solutions.

 Following wound cleansing and antibacterial treatments, subjects will undergo the eschar removal process as per treatment assignment (NexoBrid or SOC, following randomization).

 Subsequent to eschar removal, all wounds will be assessed and treated in the same manner, in accordance with post-eschar removal wound care strategy.

 Furthermore, subjects will undergo daily assessments (Vital signs (VS) and pain assessments) for one week and weekly assessments thereafter, until wound closure.

 Following wound closure, subjects will be followed up at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and after that, at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months (for a blinded assessment of cosmesis, function and QoL evaluation).

 A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of NexoBrid in Children With Thermal Burns Compared the Standard of Care@highlight

This study will be a two-arms study intending to demonstrate superiority of NexoBrid treatment over SOC in children with thermal burns.

 The study objective is to evaluate the safety and clinical benefit of NexoBrid in hospitalized children (0-17 years) with deep partial and/or full thickness thermal burns of 1-30% TBSA and to compare NexoBrid to standard of care (SOC).
