(thirdQuint)Copper Cu 64 Anti-CEA Monoclonal Antibody M5A PET in Diagnosing Patients With CEA Positive Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the ability of 64Cu labeled M5A antibody (copper Cu 64 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A) to localize CEA positive cancers (such as gastrointestinal, lung, medullary thyroid and breast cancers), as determined by PET imaging.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To characterize the frequency of titer of the human anti-human antibody (HAHA) response to 64Cu labeled M5A antibody.

 II.

 To determine the safety of administration of 64Cu labeled M5A antibody.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive copper Cu 64 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A intravenously (IV) on day 0 and then undergo PET on day 1 and day 2.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months.

 Copper Cu 64 Anti-CEA Monoclonal Antibody M5A PET in Diagnosing Patients With CEA Positive Cancer@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies copper Cu 64 anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monoclonal antibody M5A positron emission tomography (PET) in diagnosing patients with CEA positive cancer.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as copper Cu 64 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A PET, may help find and diagnose CEA positive cancer that may not be detected by standard diagnostic methods.
