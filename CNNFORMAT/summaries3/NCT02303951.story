(firstQuint)Neoadjuvant Vemurafenib + Cobimetinib in Melanoma: NEO-VC.

 Patients with hardly resectable/unresectable limited metastasis in malignant melanoma stages IIIC/IV (AJCC 2010) carrying the BRAF V600 mutation, in order to achieve operability are enrolled in the NEO-VC-study.

 The main aim of this study is to achieve operability in a higher percentage of patients by neoadjuvant treatment through shrinkage of the tumors.

 Patients with operable stage IV disease show an impressive survival benefit with long term (5 y.

) survival rates around 30 %.

 Only a percentage of up to 20 % can presently be treated by complete metastasectomy.

 This percentage may be enlarged by pre-treatment with an efficacious antitumor drug.
