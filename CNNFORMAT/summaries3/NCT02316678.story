(thirdQuint)Patient Attitudes and Preferences for Outcomes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapeutics.

 The investigators will conduct a comparative effectiveness study among Medicare Parts A, B, and D beneficiaries with inflammatory bowel disease.

 The investigators will compare the incidence of severe infection, bowel resection surgery, and death among new users of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies and corticosteroids.

 The investigators will compute propensity scores to describe the propensity for treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs compared to corticosteroids, and will match corticosteroids and anti-tumor necrosis factor drug treated patients on the propensity score.

 Cox regression will be employed to assess the hazard ratio for each of the outcomes.

The investigators will test the hypothesis that that greater efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor (antiTNF) therapy results in reduced need for bowel resection surgery, fewer serious infections, and reduced short term mortality risks, and therefore has a more favorable benefit to harm profile than corticosteroids for inflammatory bowel disease.
