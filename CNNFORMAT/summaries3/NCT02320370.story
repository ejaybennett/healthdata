(secondQuint)Transcranial Electrical Stimulation in the Treatment of Acute Anxiety Induced by Stressful Life Events: A Pilot Study.

 Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel neuromodulation method that has been observed to be promising in treatment of psychiatric disorders such as depression.

 Nevertheless, knowledge related to the treatment of psychological stress and its main symptom, anxiety, is very scarce.

 The investigators examine the efficacy of two different transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) stimulation protocols in the treatment of acute anxiety in an open-label pilot study in patients who have faced severely stressful life events.
