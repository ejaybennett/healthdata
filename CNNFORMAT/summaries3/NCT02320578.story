(thirdQuint)2D Versus 3D Radical Laparoscopic Hysterectomy for Cervical Cancer: a Prospective Randomized Trial.

 Radical abdominal hysterectomy (RAH) with pelvic lymphadenectomy is the standard surgical treatment for early stage cervical carcinoma FIGO stages IA2-IB1-IIA2cm-IIB) submitted to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with complete clinical response could be further reduced using 3D Laparoscopy (Olympus Medical Systems Corp) vs.

 standard laparoscopy.

 Saving operative time would mean shorter anesthesia and faster recovery, further improving the safety profile of the laparoscopic approach in the treatment of cervical cancer.

 Secondary endopoints of this comparison are incidence of intra- or postoperative complications (Cardiac, Respiratory, Neurological, Gastrointestinal, Renal, Fever, Wound or other Infection, Lymphocele), estimated blood loss, days of hospitalization and costs for the health care system.

 2D Versus 3D Radical Laparoscopic Hysterectomy for Cervical Cancer: a Prospective Randomized Trial@highlight

The aim of this prospective randomized pilot study is to verify if the operative time of a Radical abdominal hysterectomy (LRH) with pelvic lymphadenectomy for early stage cervical cancer (FIGO stages IA2-IB1-IIA2cm-IIB) submitted to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with complete clinical response could be further reduced using 3D Laparoscopy (Olympus Medical Systems Corp) versus standard laparoscopy
