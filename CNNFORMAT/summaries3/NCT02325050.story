(firstQuint)A Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Heterologous and Homologous Prime-Boost Ebola Vaccine Regimens in Healthy Participants.

 This study consists of 3 parts: the first and third part with standard doses and the second part with higher doses.

 All parts are randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of MVA-BN-Filo and Ad26.

ZEBOV administered in different doses, sequences and schedules to healthy adult participants.

 The study consists of a screening period of up to 28 days, a vaccination period in which participants will be vaccinated at baseline (Day 1) followed by a boost on Day 15, 29, or 57, and third vaccine 1-year post-prime (3rd vaccination is optional for subjects in groups 1-8).

 The total duration of the study will be about 1 year for participants who wiil receive boost vaccine and about 3 months for participants who will receive placebo and 2 year for participants who will receive a 3rd dose.

 Safety will be monitored during the study.
