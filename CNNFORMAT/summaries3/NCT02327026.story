(thirdQuint)Tracheal Intubation vs.

 Bag-valve-mask Ventilation in Patients With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest _ CAAM STUDY.

 It is a multicenter prospective non-inferiority open randomized controlled trial in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest carried out in physician-staffed emergency medical services.

 The investigators hypothesis is that basic airway management (i.

e.

 bag-valve-mask ventilation) is safe and may avoid the deleterious effects of tracheal intubation including interruption of chest compressions.

 On medical team's arrival at the scene and after verification of participant's eligibility, patients will be enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to either initial bag-valve-mask ventilation or tracheal intubation.

 After the hospital admission, all patients will be intubated whatever the initial airway management.

 Tracheal Intubation vs.

 Bag-valve-mask Ventilation in Patients With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest _ CAAM STUDY@highlight

The aim of this study is to improve the management of patients in cardiac arrest, and this by comparing two initial airway management methods: Tracheal intubation and bag-valve-mask ventilation.

 The survival rate at 28-day with favorable neurological function will be compared in the tracheal intubation group versus the bag-valve-mask group
