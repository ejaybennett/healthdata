(fifthQuint)Stage 1: Marizomib + Bevacizumab in WHO Gr IV GBM; Stage 2: Marizomib Alone; Stage 3: Combination of Marizomib and Bevacizumab.

 One of the few treatment options currently FDA approved for recurrent WHO Grade IV malignant glioma is BEV.

 Additional treatment options are needed for these subjects.

 Published literature indicates that targeting the proteasome in glioma cells has shown significant anti-tumor activity.

 MRZ is a novel, second generation proteasome inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of proteins involved in signal transduction which blocks growth and survival of cancer cells.

 In-vitro studies of multiple glioma cell lines were highly sensitive to MRZ.

 MRZ had relatively little effect on neural stem/progenitor cells suggesting minimal neurotoxicity while significantly affecting both malignant glioma stem cells and glioma cell lines.

 Parts 1 and 2 of this trial have been completed with the Recommended Part 3 (Phase 2) Dose established at 0.

8 mg/m2.

 Part 3 of this trial is enrolling at the MRZ RP2D determined in Phase 1 to assess the combination of MRZ and BEV activity and safety.

 Stage 1: Marizomib + Bevacizumab in WHO Gr IV GBM; Stage 2: Marizomib Alone; Stage 3: Combination of Marizomib and Bevacizumab@highlight

This is a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate a new combination of drugs, marizomib (MRZ) and bevacizumab (BEV; Avastin(R)), for the treatment of WHO Grade IV malignant glioma.

 The study population includes subjects who are in first or second relapse and who have not previously received any bevacizumab or other anti-angiogenic agent or proteasome inhibitor for treatment of malignant glioma.

 Phase 1 evaluates the combination of MRZ and BEV, while Phase 2 evaluates single-agent MRZ.

 Part 3 (Phase 2) includes a combination MRZ using intra-patient dose escalation, and BEV at a fixed dose.
