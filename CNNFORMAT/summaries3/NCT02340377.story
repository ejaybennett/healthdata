(fifthQuint)Pill Study Hyperthermia Device (Heckel HT 3000): Monitoring Core Body Temperature Using Wireless Technology.

 This protocol will allow for the evaluation of a wireless measuring device for core body temperature and a comparison to the data taken with a rectal thermometer, during a Whole Body Hyperthermia (WBH) in various subject populations.

 The primary objective of the proposed study is a potential change from wired core body temperature measurement with a rectal thermometer to an indigestible thermometer with wireless technology.

 The recent standard for measuring core body temperature during WBH procedures is the use of an indwelling rectal thermometer to constantly monitor the temperature for safety and for research reasons.

 Experiences from different clinics and research groups, including ours, show a high drop-out rate of potential study participants and patients, because of the discomfort of self-inserting a rectal thermometer for the treatment in a Whole-Body Hyperthermia.

 A wireless and reliable measuring technology would open this treatment for participants, who are declining their participation due to the indwelling thermometer.

 This device will exit the subject's body via bowel movement 1-5 days following ingestion and will not be reused.

 Due to the proximity of the indwelling thermometer to the surface of the body, the temperature does not reflect the real core body temperature and preliminary data, taking by our group, suggest a significant, but stable difference between core body temperatures measured with an indigestible device, compared to the temperature taken with the rectal probe.

 WBH treatments, currently studied by our group at the University of Arizona, are of mild nature and the constant infra-red heating is stopped, as soon as a patient reaches the rectal temperature of 38.

5 C.

 Due to the fact, that the bodies surface is heated up through the infrared exposure, the investigators assume, that the core body temperature will be lower, compared to the rectal temperature.

 A validation study in 20 subjects therefore is necessary to determine the differences in the measuring methods.

 This is especially important, as the end-point of the treatments is defined by the core body temperature, and different endpoints by switching from one measuring method to the other, without validation, would potentially bias the study results.

 Receiving a treatment in the WBH machine is of non-significant risk and can be compared to e.

g.

 a sauna visit or an intense exercise, in terms of the physiological reaction.

 It is currently studied by our group for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder, PTSD and other chronic illnesses.

 This trial however will not be limited to only include individuals with MDD or PTSD, but will allow for an expanded use in all populations (while still excluding subjects based on safety parameters).

 The investigators will monitor subject's physiological and clinical outcomes (if applicable) from a single Whole Body Hyperthermia treatment in an open fashion (no placebo/control condition).

 This study will include safety assessments several days prior to or same day as the WBH, and include follow-up assessments 1 day and 1 week later.

The primary objective of the proposed study is to determine the use of a wireless method to monitor and record core body temperature during a Whole Body Hyperthermia treatment, compared to an indwelling rectal thermometer.

 This protocol is intended to study the differences between a rectal temperature probe and an approved wireless and indigestible thermometer during a WBH session.

 The current standard in monitoring core body temperature is the usage of an indwelling rectal thermometer.

 Many patients and potential study subjects, however, decline receiving the treatment, due to the discomfort of using this measuring method and a wireless measuring device would open the possibility for those patients to receive a treatment.

 The primary endpoint for example of a treatment for MDD is currently defined with reaching a rectal temperature of 38.

5 C.

 However, due to the proximity of the probe to the body's surface, the core body temperature will vary from the rectal temperature and the comparison between the two methods with a validation of the wireless device is necessary.

 The investigators will monitor subject's physiological outcome from a single Whole Body Hyperthermia treatment in an open fashion (no placebo/control condition).

 This study will include safety assessments 7 days several days prior to or same day as the WBH, and include follow-up assessments 1 day and 1 week later.
