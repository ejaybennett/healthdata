(thirdQuint)Assessment of Myeloid Cell Constitution in the Follicular Fluid of Women Undergoing In-vitro Fertilization.

 The study will be an observational study using discarded material from patients undergoing IVF treatment.

 On the day of ovum pick up, the fluid aspirated from the first follicle in each ovary will be saved and analyzed for cellular content by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis and cytokine and hormone by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).

 In addition, a total of 5cc of blood will be drawn from the patient when introducing the intravenous line for analysis of immune cell composition,hormones and cytokine levels.

 During the whole study number of oocytes retrieved,number of mature oocytes,number of fertilizations,implantation rates and clinical pregnancy rates will be documented as well.

 Assessment of Myeloid Cell Constitution in the Follicular Fluid of Women Undergoing In-vitro Fertilization@highlight

The investigators will study the immune cell subpopulations in follicular fluid of patients undergoing In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment in our clinic.

 The investigators will corelate the presence of immature myeloid cells to the ovarian stimulation response as indicated by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and number of follicles or estradiol level developed on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration.
