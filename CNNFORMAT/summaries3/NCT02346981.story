(fifthQuint)Resistance Training and Post-exercise Blood Pressure in Normotensive Older Women.

 Older (60 years) normotensive and physically inactive women were recruited.

 Women were randomized into training group (TG) or control group (CG) and submitted to 12 weeks of intervention.

 The intervention programs were divided into three phases: initial (first two weeks), intermediate (from week 3 to week 10) and final (last two weeks).

 The TG was submitted to a resistance training program that consisted of eight exercises performed in two sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, three times per week.

 The CG performed a stretching training program for the major muscle groups, in sessions of 30 minutes, twice a week.

 These interventions were maintained during the 12 weeks.

 During initial and final phases subjects of both groups were submitted to two acute experimental sessions: resistance exercise and control, which were performed in random order.

 The resistance exercise session was similar to those performed during the resistance training program (i.

e.

, 7 exercises, 2 sets, 10-15 repetitions).

 In the control session participants remained seated for 40 min.

 Before and after each session the BP parameters were obtained.

 The chronic effect of resistance training on post-exercise BP were assessed by analyzing the changes () in BP after acute experimental sessions at initial and final phases.

 The correlation between acute and chronic responses of blood pressure following resistance training was analyses correlating the acute blood pressure observed in initial phase with the chronic effect of resistance training on rest blood pressure.

 Resistance Training and Post-exercise Blood Pressure in Normotensive Older Women@highlight

The purpose of the present study was to analyze the effect of 12 weeks of resistance training on post-exercise blood pressure (BP) and to to correlate the acute and chronic decrease in blood pressure (BP) following resistance training in normotensive older women.

 Twenty-eight older women were randomly assigned to a training group (TG) or to a control group (CG).

 The TG underwent a resistance training program (8 exercises, 2 sets, 10-15 repetitions), while the CG performed stretching exercises (2 sets, 20 s each, 2 nonconsecutive days/week).

 Both groups performed the intervention for 12 weeks.

 At baseline and after intervention the subjects were submitted to two sessions: resistance exercise session and control session.

 In these sessions, BP was obtained in pre and post-sessions.

 Rest blood pressure were also measure at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention.
