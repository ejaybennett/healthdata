(firstQuint)Predictive Value of Procalcitonin, CRP, Drain Fluid Culture, Il-6 and Tnf- in Anastomotic Leakage.

 To search for a biomarker, which might be able to predict rectal anastomotic leakage before its clinical presentation.

 Serum procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and drain fluid culture, IL-6 and TNF- levels were evaluated in 50 consecutive patients with rectal cancer who underwent low anterior resection with colorectal anastomosis.
