(secondQuint)Pembrolizumab and Epacadostat in Patients With Thymic Carcinoma.

 The amended phase II study of pembrolizumab and epacadostat is for thymic carcinoma patients who recurred after at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.

 The primary endpoint is response rate; secondary endpoints are Progression-Free Survival, Overall Survival and treatment tolerability.

 Responses will be assessed according to RECIST 1.

1; progression-free survival is defined as time between start of treatment and tumor progression or death; survival is the time between start of treatment and death.

 Furthermore exploratory studies will be performed on archival tumor material (PDL-1 expression, next-generation sequencing), and fresh biopsies (culturing; next-generation sequencing).
