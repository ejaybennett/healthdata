(fifthQuint)PeriOcular and INTravitreal Corticosteroids for Uveitic Macular Edema Trial.

 Macular edema is the most common structural complication and leading cause of visual loss in patients with uveitis.

 Regional injections of corticosteroids are the most frequently used treatments specifically for uveitic macular edema but there is a lack of high quality evidence to guide choice of drug (e.

g.

, triamcinolone acetonide, dexamethasone) and route of administration (e.

g.

 periocular, intravitreal).

 The question of how to approach regional treatment of uveitic macular edema is a key question for ophthalmologists treating these patients.

 The Periocular and Intravitreal Corticosteroids for Uveitic Macular Edema (POINT) Trial is a randomized trial designed to compare the relative efficacy of three regional corticosteroids commonly utilized for the initial regional treatment of uveitic macular edema, periocular triamcinolone (Kenalog(R) , Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ), intravitreal triamcinolone (Triesence cent , Alcon Pharmaceuticals, Fort Worth, TX), and the intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex(R), Allergan, Irvine CA) will be conducted by the MUST Research Group clinical centers throughout the U.

S.

 and one each in Australia and the UK.

 After signing informed consent and undergoing eligibility evaluation, eligible patients will be randomized to one of the three study treatments to be administered at the first study visit.

 Randomization is by participant, if both eyes meet eligibility requirements then both eyes receive assigned treatment.

 The design outcome is the percent change in central subfield macular thickness on OCT from baseline to the 8 week visit.

 After assessment of the primary outcome at 8 weeks, second injections and best medical judgment will be used if macular edema has not improved as follows: Eye(s) meeting trial eligibility criteria receive initial injection of assigned treatment at P01 visit.

 Second injection of assigned treatment permitted at 8 week visit for periocular triamcinolone and intravitreal triamcinolone and at 12 week visit for intravitreal dexamethasone if - Eye does not meet the improvement definition (a 20% decrease in central subfield thickness of the macula) or - Eye has a normal central subfield thickness but has cystoid spaces in the 1 mm central subfield or - ME is worse after initial improvement And the following repeat injection criterion are met: cent IOP of 21 or mm Hg and treatment with 3 IOP-lowering agents; Eyes demonstrating no improvement or worsening of ME as measured by the central submacular thickness on OCT (at week 12 for periocular and intravitreal triamcinolone arms and at week 20 for intravitreal dexamethasone arm) are considered primary treatment non-responders.

 PeriOcular and INTravitreal Corticosteroids for Uveitic Macular Edema Trial@highlight

To evaluate the relative efficacy of three commonly utilized regional corticosteroids for the regional treatment of uveitic macular edema: periocular triamcinolone acetonide; intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide; intravitreal dexamethasone implant.

 The primary efficacy measure will be percent change in central subfield thickness as measured by OCT at 8 weeks.

 Participants will continue in the study for 24 weeks in order to evaluate relative effects of the 3 treatment strategies on the duration of treatment effects, requirement for additional injections, and adverse effects.

 Note: The planned sample size for the POINT Trial was 267 subjects.

 On 17 July 2017, with 192 subjects enrolled, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) reviewed the planned interim analysis and recommended that the goals of the trial could be accomplished by completing follow-up of enrolled subjects without the recruitment of additional subjects.

 Per the DSMC recommendations, recruitment was suspended and follow-up of enrolled subjects was completed according to the protocol.
