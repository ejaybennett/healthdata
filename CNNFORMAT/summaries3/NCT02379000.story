(thirdQuint)TTT Versus TTT and Triamcinolone to Decrease Exudation in Choroidal Melanoma After Proton Beam Therapy.

 Proton beam therapy is an eye preserving irradiation modality for uveal melanoma.

 After proton beam therapy tumor related lipid exudation and exudative retinal detachment often increase.

 Therefore vitreoretinal surgery is sometimes required to reattach the retina to protect visual acuity.

 It is known that intravitreally injected triamcinolone and TTT is capable to decrease exudation.

 If there is any advantage in a combined treatment and if it is that effective to possibly avoid vitreoretinal surgery this study will investigate.

 TTT Versus TTT and Triamcinolone to Decrease Exudation in Choroidal Melanoma After Proton Beam Therapy@highlight

Proton beam therapy is a safe irradiation modality for choroidal melanoma.

 But often after irradiation the exudation increases resulting in an exudative retinal detachment requiring vitreoretinal surgery.

 It is known that intravitreally injected triamcinolone and TTT is capable to decrease the exudation.

 If there is any advantage in a combined treatment this study will investigate.
