(secondQuint)IM Olanzapine Versus Haloperidol or Midazolam.

 To address significant knowledge gaps by several means: 1.

 Investigate IM use of sedating drugs within a predominantly Chinese population, to address this void in international literature impacting the management of acute agitation.

 The multi-centre RCT will determine the safety and efficacy of IM olanzapine, in comparison with conventional medicines (haloperidol or midazolam) in a three-arm comparison for the sedation of acutely agitated patients in AEDs.

 Specifically, we aim to determine if administration of IM olanzapine (a)is more effective than sedation with IM haloperidol or IM midazolam alone; (b)is safer than sedation with comparison arms; (c)decreases the amount of subsequent redosing or alternative drugs required; (d)is more favourable than the haloperidol and midazolam arms with respect to safety, efficacy and adverse events.

 2.

 Investigate potential variables leading to AED attendance and/or admission requiring parenteral sedation.

 These may include patient demographic and regular medications and adherence.

 IM Olanzapine Versus Haloperidol or Midazolam@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether IM olanzapine is safer (fewer adverse events) and more effective (shorter time to sedation) than conventional haloperidol or midazolam when used in the management of acute agitation in the emergency.
