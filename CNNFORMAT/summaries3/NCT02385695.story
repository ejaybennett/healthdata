(secondQuint)Study to Evaluate Safety and Effectiveness of Dynamic Stabilization Versus Lumbar Fusion in Treatment of Multilevel Lumbar Disc Degeneration Disease.

 Study aims are: 1.

 To evaluate superiority of Surgical treatment with posterior dynamic stabilization compared to Surgical treatment with internal fixation and fusion in lumbar range of motion; 2.

 To compare Surgical treatment with posterior dynamic stabilization compared to Surgical treatment with internal fixation and fusion in functional outcomes as measured by change in Oswestry Disability Index; 3.

 To compare radiological, clinical, patient-reported and, safety outcomes between the two surgical approaches.
