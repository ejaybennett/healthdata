(fifthQuint)CPAP Effect on Blood Pressure and Arterial Stiffness in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Patients With Resistant Hypertension.

 Obstructive Sleep Apnea is highly prevalent in patients with resistant hypertension and several studies have assessed the effect of CPAP treatment on BP.

 But only few studies have raised data about the effect of CPAP treatment on BP in patients with resistant hypertension.

 Hypertension is moreover associated with increased arterial stiffness, but no data are available in patients with resistant hypertension.

 The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that OSA has a major impact in resistant hypertension, whose effects on BP and arterial stiffness can partially be reversible with CPAP treatment.

 CPAP Effect on Blood Pressure and Arterial Stiffness in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Patients With Resistant Hypertension@highlight

Resistant hypertension is defined as uncontrolled blood pressure (BP 140/90mmHg) despite the current use of three or more antihypertensive drugs at full doses, including a diuretic.

 Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is at high risk for cardiovascular morbidity and is highly prevalent in patients with resistant hypertension.

 The prospective observational POP-ART study will assess the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on BP in patients with resistant hypertension and collect data from usual care.
