(thirdQuint)A Trial of the C-TraC Intervention for Dementia Patients.

 Patients with dementia often experience poor quality transitions from the hospital to the community.

 In response, the investigators developed and piloted the Coordinated-Transitional Care (C-TraC) program--a low-cost, telephone-based intervention designed to improve care coordination and outcomes in hospitalized patients with dementia or other high-risk conditions discharged to community settings.

 A single-blind, prospective, randomized-controlled trial will be used with participants being randomly assigned to receive usual (i.

e.

 standard) care, or usual care plus the C-TraC intervention.

 Outcomes will be assessed via scheduled phone-calls at 14, 30, and 90 days post-hospitalization.

 A 45-day phone call will also be conducted to complete a brief satisfaction survey with the caregiver about their post-hospital experience.

The goal of the project is to conduct a prospective, randomized-controlled clinical trial to determine the extent to which the Coordinated-Transitional Care (C-TraC) program impacts transitional care quality, patient cognition/function, caregiver stress and 30-day rehospitalizations in patients with documented diagnoses of dementia discharged from the hospital to the community.
