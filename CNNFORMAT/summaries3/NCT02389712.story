(thirdQuint)16-week Comparative Effectiveness Trial of Lamotrigine vs.

 Fluoxetine for Bipolar Depression.

 Depression is the predominant prevailing mood state of bipolar disorder and it is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.

 However, in comparison to acute mania, bipolar depression is understudied both from the standpoint of its pathophysiology as well as clinical trials and treatment development.

 Given the lack of evidence-based guidelines, clinicians and participants enter a treatment phase with little guidance.

 The FLAME Study is a 16-week, open randomized comparative effectiveness trial evaluating genomic predictors and biomarkers of response and adverse events to treatment with lamotrigine (n=200) and fluoxetine (n=200) for bipolar I, II and bipolar schizoaffective depressed adults (18-65).

 Participants will be recruited over a 5-year period.

 It is known that functionally significant genetic polymorphisms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic pathways can influence individual differences in repose to specific medications.

 We propose to evaluate the contribution of these pharmacogenomic variations to lamotrigine and fluoxetine treatment response and adverse events.

 We will correlate clinical phenotypes of response and adverse events to treatment with genotype and haplotype variations of drug metabolism, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, (metabolism, storage, release, reuptake), receptor and intracellular signaling-that have been previously implicated to either lamotrigine or fluoxetine.

 These initial steps will be complemented with genome-wide analysis (GWA), pathway analysis and other candidate gene studies.

 Based on our results we aim to develop a translational treatment algorithm of bipolar depression that may help individualized treatment for bipolar depression.

 This algorithm for participants could potentially increase the likelihood of successful treatment interventions, deliver the "right treatment, for the right participant at the right time", and decrease the number of ineffective treatments and/or risk for serious adverse events.

 16-week Comparative Effectiveness Trial of Lamotrigine vs.

 Fluoxetine for Bipolar Depression@highlight

The FLAME Study is a 16-week clinical trial to study treatment with lamotrigine or fluoxetine in bipolar I, II and bipolar schizoaffective depressed adults.

 The purpose of the trial is to have a better understanding of whether individuals with a particular gene type and other inherited biological markers will have a good response to fluoxetine or lamotrigine, or alternatively, would be more likely to have side effects to this medication.
