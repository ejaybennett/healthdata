(fifthQuint)SONOlysis in Prevention of Brain InfaRctions During Internal Carotid Endarterectomy.

 Stroke has been the third most common cause of death in the majority of the developed countries for many years.

 Internal carotid (ICA) stenosis is one of the most common etiological factors of ischemic stroke (IS), causing 10 - 35 % of strokes.

 Stroke risk increases with the increased severity of ICA stenosis and this risk is higher in symptomatic stenoses than in asymptomatic ones.

 Results of the NASCET, ECST and ACAS studies showed that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was a beneficial therapy for patients with a symptomatic ICA stenosis > 50 % and > 70 %, resp.

, and for patients with an asymptomatic ICA stenosis > 60 % and > 85 %, resp.

 Surgical risk of CEA varied between 2 and 15 %.

 However, even clinically silent microembolism can cause microinfarctions presenting with postoperative cognitive deficit.

 Since the 1970s, in vitro and in animal models studies demonstrated acceleration of thrombus dissolution using ultrasound beam.

 Alexandrov et al.

 referred a higher number of early recanalizations in acute stroke patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion treated using systemic thrombolysis in combination with transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring.

 Between 2002 and 2005, three other studies demonstrated potential effect of diagnostic ultrasound on the acceleration of spontaneous or induced recanalization of intracranial arteries.

 There are 2 possible effects of ultrasound on thrombus - [1] mechanical destruction due to vibration of thrombus with acceleration of penetration of fibrinolytics into thrombus and [2] elevation of temperature and stimulation of endothelium with local activation of fibrinolytic system.

 The results of the grant project NR/9487-3/2007 showed that TCD monitoring had a significant effect on activation of fibrinolytic system in healthy volunteers.

 Transcranial Doppler monitoring during CEA is a common diagnostic method being used for the detection of microemboli and changes of blood flow in intracranial stenoses.

 Reduction of periprocedural complications of CEA with TCD monitoring was referred in some studies.

 This reduction of stroke risk should be due to sophisticated indication of shunt implementation, optimization of surgery and anesthesia according to the blood flow changes and detection of microemboli in MCA using a TCD monitoring.

 Another course of the reduction of microinfarctions is the local activation of endogenous fibrinolytic system due to the TCD monitoring (equal to sonothrombolysis in acute stroke studies).

 Recently published SONOBUSTER Trial showed that intraoperative sonolysis reduced both the incidence and the volume of new brain infarctions following CEA.

 These benefits were most evident for larger infarctions (volume 0.

5 mL) and extended beyond the region directly exposed to ultrasonic waves (i.

e.

, the contralateral hemisphere).

 Effect on cognitive function decline was not significant in this study due to a low number of patients.

 STUDY OBJECTIVES The objective of the randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of sonolysis (continual TCD monitoring) using a 2-MHz diagnostic probe with a maximal diagnostic energy on the reduction of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) and brain infarction by the activation of endogenous fibrinolytic system during CEA in patients with 70% symptomatic or asymptomatic stenosis of the ICA.

 The substudy aims to compare the risk of brain infarction detected using magnetic resonance between sonolysis and control group.

 STUDY DESIGN Overview SONOBIRDIE Trial is a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled study designed for a demonstration of the safety and effectiveness of sonolysis (continual TCD monitoring) in reduction of risk of stroke or TIA, brain infarctions and cognitive decline by the sonolysis during CEA in patients with 70% ICA stenosis.

 Expected sample size The sample size is based on an expected 2.

5% absolute risk reduction of stroke or TIA during the 30-day postoperative period in the sonolysis group (estimated prevalence, 1.

5 %) compared to the control group (estimated prevalence, 4 %).

 Pre-study calculations showed that a minimum of 704 patients in each group is needed to reach a significant difference with an alpha value of 0.

05 (two-tailed) and a beta value of 0.

8 assuming that 10 % would be lost to follow-up or refuse to participate in the study (estimated 39 end-points).

 The sample size for substudy is based on an expected 15% reduction of new ischemic lesions on diffusion weighted imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) in the sonolysis group (estimated prevalence, 10 %) compared to the control group (estimated prevalence, 25 %).

 Pre-study calculations showed that a minimum of 124 patients in each group was needed to reach a significant difference with an alpha value of 0.

05 (two-tailed) and a beta value of 0.

8 assuming that 10 % would be lost to follow-up or refuse to participate in the study.

 Test device The transcranial Doppler systems (e.

g.

 DWL Multi-Dop T1, DWL, Sipplingen, Germany) with a diagnostic 2-MHz probe will be used for sonolysis (non-diagnostic TCD Doppler monitoring).

 Sonolysis In patients randomized into sonolysis group, MCA segment in a depth of 55 mm will be continuously monitored during intervention using a diagnostic 2-MHz transcranial Doppler probe with a maximal diagnostic energy (TIC~1.

3), sample volume 10 mm.

 Sham procedure In patients randomized into control group, the TCD probe will be fixed in a required position using a special helmet as in sonolysis group patients, but MCA segment in a depth of 55 mm will be only localized using a diagnostic 2-MHz transcranial Doppler probe with a maximal diagnostic energy and the TCD monitoring will be stopped afterwards.

 Carotid endarterectomy Surgery will be performed in a general or a local anesthesia (decision will be left to the discretion of the operating team) using a cut in front angle of the sternomastoid muscle.

 Common carotid artery (CCA) and later ICA and external carotid artery (ECA) will be cut free.

 Common carotid artery, ICA and ECA will be temporarily closed.

 Using a longitudinal cut of CCA and ICA, atherosclerotic plaque will be visualized.

 Plaque will be withdrawn under the microscopic control and later a suture of arteriotomy will be performed using a monophil non-absorbent fibre 6/0.

 Just before the end of surgery, haemostatic process will be controlled and drainage will be done.

 Surgery will be completed by suture of subcutis and cutis.

 Unfractioned heparin (100 IU/kg bodyweight) will be administered in all patients just before the arteriotomy.

 In the case of the insufficient collateral flow into MCA after clipping of the CCA and ICA, a temporal shunt will be used.

 Antiplatelet therapy (Aggrenox, clopidogrel 75 mg/day or acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day) will be used continuously in all patients.

 Surgeon will be blinded to sonolysis or sham procedure.

 Magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic resonance imaging will be performed in patients enrolled to the substudy.

 Magnetic resonance imaging protocol consists of 4 sequences: 1.

 T2TSE; 2.

 DWI.

 Sequences 1 - 3 will be applied in the same level, they will have the same slice thickness and the same cut number.

 The slice thickness comprises its own cut thickness (5 mm) + distant factor (30 %).

 Standard number of slices will be 19.

 Standard slice level is considered to be a modified level of skull base due to the minimalization of distant artifacts.

 Diffusion weighted sequence shows a middle (average) diffusivity of every point of the examined brain tissue when b value is 500 and 1000.

 This sequence is applied in order to assess hemorrhage (T2*EPI) and to monitor sites of the reduced diffusion (DWI, b=500 and 1000); 3.

 T2 star-weighted gradient-recalled echo (GRE) sequence for detection of bleeding (including microbleeds); 4.

 Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR).

Presence of new infarctions will be evaluated separately in the whole brain, in the territory of the intervened ICA and in the territory of the contralateral ICA.

 New ischemic lesions in the brain are defined as hyperintense lesions on postintervention DWI sequences which were not present on the pretreatment MRI.

 The volume of new brain infarctions will be measured manually.

 Infarct volumes will be calculated as the total hyperintense area in single slices multiplied by an effective slice thickness [(actual slice thickness + distance factor)/interslice gap].

 Ischemic lesions in the brain will be evaluated by two blinded investigators.

 All disagreements will resolved by consensus.

 The third blinded investigator will be involved in a case of a persistent disagreement.

 Clinical examinations Standard physical and neurologic examinations will be performed before CEA, 24 hours, afte30 days and 1 year after CEA.

 Evaluation of the neurologic deficit will be performed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (see Appendix) and modified Rankin scale (see Appendix) before CEA, 24 hours, 30 days and 1 year after CEA.

 Cognitive tests Cognitive testing (Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R), Mini Mental State Examination, Clock Drawing Test, Verbal Fluency Test) will be performed before, 24 hours, 30 days and 1 year after CEA.

 All cognitive tests will be performed by a blinded investigator.

 Randomization Consecutive patients will be assigned to the sonolysis or control group by a computer-generated 1:1 randomization.

 Substudy: Patients with indication to CEA will be assigned to the sonolysis or control group by a computer-generated 1:1 randomization.

 ANALYSIS SETS Efficacy analyses will be performed primary for the intent-to-treat population.

 The secondary analysis will be performed also for per-protocol population.

 The intent-to-treat population will consist of all randomized subjects who signed informed consent.

 The per-protocol population will exclude all subjects in the intent-to-treat population who: 1.

 Have not undergone CEA.

 2.

 Have not received sonolysis during carotid CEA for at least 40 minutes.

 3.

 Have not attended one of the last 3 visits - Visit 3 (24 hours after CEA), Visit 4 (30 days after CEA) and Visit 5 (1 year after CEA) Safety analyses will be performed on all randomized subjects undergoing the carotid intervention.

 Substudy: Efficacy analyses will be performed for both the intent-to-treat population - subjects indicated for CEA, randomized and undergoing procedure and undergoing magnetic resonance imaging before and 24 hours after CEA.

 Safety analyses will be performed on all randomized subjects undergoing the carotid intervention.

 STATISTICAL METHODS All statistical tests will be performed at the Department of Biophysics, Informatics and Biometry, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc.

 The normality of distribution of all proceeded data will be checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test.

 Data with a normal distribution will be reported as the mean standard deviation.

 Parameters not fitting a normal distribution will be presented as the mean, median and interquartile range.

 Categorical variables in the two arms will be compared by Fisher exact test.

 Continuous variables will be compared by the Student t-test for normally distributed values, or the Mann-Whitney U test.

 Spearman correlation coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient will be calculated for the evaluation of interobserver and intraobserver agreements of brain infarction volume measurement.

 Multiple logistic regression analyses will be used to determine the possible predictors of stroke or TIA, cognitive decline, or a new brain infarction.

 All tests will be carried out at an alpha level of significance of 0.

 SONOlysis in Prevention of Brain InfaRctions During Internal Carotid Endarterectomy@highlight

SONOBIRDIE Trial is a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled study designed for a demonstration of the safety and effectiveness of sonolysis (continual transcranial Doppler monitoring) in reduction of risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), brain infarctions and cognitive decline using a 2-MHz diagnostic probe with a maximal diagnostic energy on the reduction of risk of brain infarctions by the activation of endogenous fibrinolytic system during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with 70% symptomatic or asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis.

 The sample size is based on an expected 2.

5% reduction of stroke or TIA during the 30-day postoperative period in the sonolysis group (estimated prevalence, 1.

5 %) compared to the control group (estimated prevalence, 4 %).

 Pre-study calculations showed that a minimum of 704 patients in each group is needed to reach a significant difference with an alpha value of 0.

05 (two-tailed) and a beta value of 0.

8 assuming that 10 % would be lost to follow-up or refuse to participate in the study.

 Consecutive patients will be assigned to the sonolysis or control group by a computer-generated 1:1 randomization.

 In patients randomized into sonolysis group, middle cerebral artery segment in a depth of 55 mm will be continuously monitored during intervention using a diagnostic 2-MHz transcranial Doppler probe with a maximal diagnostic energy.

 In patients randomized into control group, the transcranial Doppler probe will be fixed in a required position using a special helmet as in sonolysis group patients, but middle cerebral artery segment in a depth of 55 mm will be only localized using a diagnostic 2-MHz transcranial Doppler probe with a maximal diagnostic energy and the TCD monitoring will be stopped afterwards.

 Confirmation of the investigators hypothesis that sonothrombolysis is able to activate endogenous fibrinolytic system during CEA with consecutive reduction of stroke or TIA, and the number and volume of brain infarcts, can lead to the increase of the safety of CEA in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis.

 The investigators can presume that up to 50% of patients indicated for CEA can be treated using these methods in the future.
