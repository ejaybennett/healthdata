(thirdQuint)Effect of Liquid Volume and the Amount of Incorporated Gas Into a Carbohydrate/Protein Beverage on Satiety.

 It is not known how the liquid and gas volumes of a liquid foam contribute to its satiating properties and how and if these factors interact.

 The best way to assess these parameter combinations and their interactions is to use a special statistical approach named "Response Surface Methodology" (RSM).

 The current study therefore has a Central Composite Design with 9 foams differing in liquid volume and in ratio of gas to liquid volume (%overrun, which is defined as 100 x gas volume/liquid volume).

 Each subject will be appointed to a single parameter combination and receives this parameter combination twice, separated by a one-week wash-out period.

 On both test days subjects' self-assessment of feelings of satiety and physical discomfort will be recorded during 4 hours post-consumption of the treatment using Electronic Visual Analogue Scale.

 Effect of Liquid Volume and the Amount of Incorporated Gas Into a Carbohydrate/Protein Beverage on Satiety@highlight

Liquid foams can be formed by trapping pockets of gas in a beverage.

 The primary objective of this study is to test the individual contribution, and possible interaction, of the liquid volume and gas to liquid volume ratio (i.

 %overrun (%OR, defined as 100 x [gas volume/liquid volume]) of a beverage to its satiating properties.
