 The investigators will ask questions related to previous screening, diagnostic, and treatment practices as well as barriers experienced in seeking such care.

 The investigators will also explore patients' level of resiliency and coping as predictors of adherence to timely care.

 Furthermore, among immigrants, questions about acculturation and discrimination will be asked.

 Additional measures of socioeconomic status, such as education, income and occupation will also be collected.
