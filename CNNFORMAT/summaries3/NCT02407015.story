(fifthQuint)The Effect of 3D Autostereoscopic Video-game Play on the Visual Fatigue in Children.

 This study will be a prospective blind randomised control trial.

 The participants will be randomised into one study group, with participants playing a game in 3D; and a control group, with participants playing the same game in 2D.

 The study is blind due to the use of an independent assessor, reducing testing bias by ensuring that the tester does not know the randomisation results.

 The known dependant variables are the total horizontal fusional amplitudes at 1/3m and 6m and the independent variable is the use of 2D or 3D game play.

 The Effect of 3D Autostereoscopic Video-game Play on the Visual Fatigue in Children@highlight

This study aims to examine the specific effect that 3D game play has on the control of the eyes horizontal movements.

 It will examine the youngest group of consumers this technology is marketed to, 7 to 11-year-olds and no children under 7 years of age will be recruited to this study as per Nintendo's hardware guidelines, which recommends that children under 7 years of age not play in 3D mode.

 It will examine the effect of playing in 3D for 30 minutes on horizontal fusional amplitudes compared with a control group playing in 2D for 30 minutes.
