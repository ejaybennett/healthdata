(secondQuint)Assistive Device Training in Multiple Sclerosis.

 40 people with Multiple Sclerosis, who routinely use ambulatory assistive devices and have fallen at least once in the past year, will be randomized into two groups.

 One group will receive a 6-week training program in the use of their assistive device; the other group will be wait-listed, and may choose to receive the training after their participation in the study is completed.

 All participants will receive mobility assessments at baseline, 6-8 weeks later, and 3 months after that.

 All participants will record their falls on falls calendars.

 Participants in the training group will receive MRI scans to assess neural connectivity at baseline and after completion of the training program.

 The purpose of the study is to determine whether participation in the training program reduces falls and increases functional mobility when compared to the wait-listed group, and also to determine whether any change in neural connectivity, as assessed by MRI scans, is seen in those who participate in the training.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether a training program in the use of ambulatory assistive devices (such as canes, walkers, etc) can reduce falls and increase functional mobility and neural connectivity in people with Multiple Sclerosis.
