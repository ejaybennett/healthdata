(secondQuint)A Comparison Between the Exoskeleton Hybrid Assistive Limb and Conventional Gait Training Early After Stroke.

 To compare outcome after 4 weeks of gait training with HAL vs.

 4 weeks of conventional gait training as part of a regular inpatient rehabilitation program for hemiparetic patients with severely limited mobility early after stroke.

 Study design: Randomized, controlled study with blinded outcome assessment.

 Conventional gait training is individualized and performed according to current practice (approximately 30-60 minutes/session, 5 days a week) and may include standing, weight shifting, stepping, over ground walking with assistance and/or assistant devices as well as the use of a treadmill and body weight support.

 Conventional gait training is offered to both study groups.

 Training with HAL is performed in 1 session per day, 4 days per week during 4 weeks.

 Time for each session is individualised but does not exceed 60 minutes/session (effective time).

 Training with HAL is performed in combination with body-weight support system and on a treadmill.

 The training program is performed by 2 physiotherapists, who have been trained in the HAL method.

 A Comparison Between the Exoskeleton Hybrid Assistive Limb and Conventional Gait Training Early After Stroke@highlight

Overall aim is to evaluate HAL for gait training early after stroke and the effect of HAL on short- and long-term functioning, disability and health compared to conventional gait training as part of an inpatient rehabilitation program early after stroke.
