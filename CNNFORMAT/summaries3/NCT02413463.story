(firstQuint)Comparison Between Augmented Recession and Posterior Scleral Fixation in Partially Accommodative Esotropia.

 A prospective randomized interventional comparative study in which 50 patients having partially accommodative esotropia will undergo surgical correction of the residual angle as follow: 25 patients will undergo bilateral medial rectus muscle recession for the residual angle for far along with posterior scleral fixation.

 25 patients will undergo bilateral medial rectus muscle recession using the Augmented Formula taking the average of the angle of deviation for far with correction and the angle of deviation for near without correction.

 Prior to surgical intervention, all patients will undergo a complete ophthalmic and orthoptic examination and will be given the full cycloplegic refraction.

 Ocular motility will be analyzed by using the cover/uncover and alternating cover tests and deviation will be measured using the prism cover test with the patient wearing the full cycloplegic correction and viewing an accommodative target requiring near and distance fixation.
