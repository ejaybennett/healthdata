(secondQuint)Caudal Versus Intravenous Dexmedetomidine for Caudal Analgesia in Children.

 Dexmedetomidine is used increasingly in pediatric anesthesia practice to prolong the duration of action of caudal block with a local anesthetic agent.

But which route of administration of dexmedetomidine is the most beneficial remains unknown.

 The investigators performed prospective randomized double-blind study to compare the effects of caudal dexmedetomidine with intravenous dexmedetomidine on postoperative analgesia after caudal bupivacaine in children undergoing infra-umbilical surgery.

 75 children (ASAIorII,aged 1-6 yr) undergoing infra-umbilical surgery were included in this study.

 Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane via a facemask, followed by placement of a laryngeal mask airway.

 Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 2-3% in oxygen-air.

Then,caudal block was applied.

 Patients were randomly assigned in three groups.

 Group B-Dcau (n = 25): Caudal bupivacaine 0.

25% 1ml/kg plus dexmedetomidine 1 mu g/kg and 10 ml normal saline i.

The aim of this prospective randomized double-blind study was to compare the analgesic efficacy and the side effects of dexmedetomidine (1 mu g.

kg-1) co-administered with bupivacaine for caudal analgesia or intravenously in children undergoing infra-umbilical surgery.
