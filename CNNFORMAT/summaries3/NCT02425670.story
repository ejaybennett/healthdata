(fifthQuint)Stem Cell Therapy For Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients.

 Background: Stroke accounts for significant disability and there is need for novel treatment modality which can improve the functional outcome.

 In this randomized clinical trial, investigators proposed to examine stem cell therapy as a potential therapeutic modality.

 Stem cells in animal stroke models have shown reduction in infarct size and improvement in neurological function.

 Only one human clinical trial with intravenous autologous marrow stromal cell therapy of five patients has shown some benefit.

 The primary objective of this phase II study was to explore if there is favourable risk to benefit ratio for autologous bone marrow derived mononuclear stem cell therapy (BMSCs) in patients with acute ischemic stroke to justify a larger phase III trial.

 Methods & Design: The study recruited 120 men and women aged 18-70 years presenting with acute ischemic stroke (7-29 days) and a NIHSS score of 7 and BI 50.

 Following baseline assessment (MRI Brain, Whole Body PET scan, EEG brain, CT scan Brain and clinical examination including National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index (BI), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Glasgow Come Scale (GCS), participants were randomly allocated to two groups: conventional management alone (control group); or conventional management and autologous intravenous BMSCs transplantation (experimental group).

 Bone marrow was aspirated under local anaesthesia and the isolated BMSCs cells injected intravenously within 4 hours.

 The patients were monitored with hemogram & renal/liver function tests, CT scan brain at 36 hrs and clinical examination for a week.

 The patients were followed up to one year with periodic MRI brain at 3 months, 6 months, EEG & PET scan at 6 months and 1 year.

 The primary efficacy outcomes were difference between the two groups in the Modified Barthel index score and modified Rankin Scale score at six-month post-randomisation.

 The secondary efficacy outcomes are: NIHSS score at six-months and 1 year post-randomisation; and the modified Rankin scale score at 3 months and one year post-randomization, and functional status measured by barthel index (in binary scale 60 ) at six months and one year post-randomization.

 Dose response analysis were done by comparing outcomes in patients receiving various doses of bone marrow mononuclear cells.

 Discussion: This phase 2 study was aimed to explore if there is a favourable risk-to-benefit ratio for stem cell therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

 Investigators also planned to examine whether there is justification for phase III trial of autologous bone marrow derived mononuclear stem cell therapy for acute ischemic stroke.

 Stem Cell Therapy For Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with subacute ischemic stroke will benefit from infusion of patient's own bone marrow derived stem cells.

 Primary Hypothesis: Intravenous injection of bone marrow mononuclear cells at a dose of 30 to 500 million in patients with subacute ischemic stroke results in reduction of infarct volume and improvement of neurological function compared to those without the injection.

 Secondary Hypothesis: Patients receiving more than 100 million Bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSC) will have better outcome than those receiving fewer dosages of cells.
