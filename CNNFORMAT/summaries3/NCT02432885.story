(secondQuint)Myocardial Fibrosis Progression in Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy - ACE Inhibitor Therapy Trial.

 Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD/BMD) are diseases characterized by progressive skeletal muscle degeneration and replacement by fibrofatty tissue.

 Data on cardiac involvement (defined as myocardial fibrosis), effect of ACE-inhibitors and specific genetic mutations on myocardial involvement detected by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is lacking.

 The study will include 76 patients with DMD/BMD.

 All patients will be referred to two CMRs for assessment of ventricular function and myocardial fibrosis.

 Patients with myocardial fibrosis and normal left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) will be randomized into two groups, each group receiving ACE-inhibitor treatment or no treatment for cardiomyopathy.

 A genetic profile will be performed in every patient to identify possible mutations related to cardiac involvement.

 Myocardial Fibrosis Progression in Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy - ACE Inhibitor Therapy Trial@highlight

This trial intends to evaluate myocardial Fibrosis progression in Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy, as well the influence of ACE inhibitors in fibrosis progression.

 Additionally, this study aims to determine genetic predictors of cardiac involvement in these dystrophies.
