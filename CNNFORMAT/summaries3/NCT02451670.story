(secondQuint)Reducing Cardiovascular Risk in Adults With Serious Mental Illness.

 This proposal will adapt a point-of-care Electronic Medical Record-based Clinical Decision Support system (Cardiovascular Wizard) to help primary care providers identify, provide appropriate care for, and control Cardiovascular risk factors for patients with Serious Mental Illness.

 Cardiovascular Wizard is designed to educate Primary Care Providers about the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in people with serious mental illness, identify elevated cardiovascular risk factors in patients with serious mental illness, prioritize these cardiovascular risks based on how much improvement in cardiovascular risk a patient would experience if the cardiovascular risk factor was adequately addressed, recommend specific medications and other interventions to decrease each elevated cardiovascular risk factor, and provide this information in an easy-to-understand format for both patients with serious mental illness and their primary care providers.

 For those patients who are on the serious mental illness medications most associated with weight gain, they will be able to work with a psychiatric care manager who, under the supervision of the patient's treating psychiatrist and with the consent of the patient, will switch the serious mental illness medication to one less associated with weight gain.
