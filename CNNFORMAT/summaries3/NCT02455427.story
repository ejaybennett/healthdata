(fifthQuint)Safety of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in the Subacute Phase After Stroke.

 The investigators main goal is to confirm the safety of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) associated with conventional physical therapy, compared to conventional physical therapy associated with sham tDCS, for upper limb rehabilitation in an early phase (72 hours until 6 weeks) after stroke.

 Patients will be randomized to receive one of these two treatments, 3 times per week, for 2 weeks.

 Adverse effects will be monitored during each session.

 The working hypothesis is that conventional physical therapy associated with active tDCS in the subacute phase of ischemic stroke will be as safe as conventional therapy alone.

 The investigators will also preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of active tDCS associated with conventional therapy, compared to conventional therapy alone, in improvement of upper limb motor impairment.

 The investigators secondary goals are: 1) To compare effects of the above mentioned interventions on disability, spasticity and quality of life, in patients at an early stage after stroke ( subacute phase), immediately after treatment and 3 months later.

 The investigators hypothesis is that the association of conventional physical therapy and active tDCS will lead to better outcomes than conventional therapy alone.

 Patients will be assessed before the first session and after the last session of treatment, as well as 3 months after the last session of treatment.

 Preliminary data about structural and functional connectivity will be collected in order to plan future studies related to mechanisms of tDCS in the subacute phase after stroke.

 Safety of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in the Subacute Phase After Stroke@highlight

Stroke is the second cause of death worldwide and represented the first cause of death in Brazil between 2006 and 2010.

 Most patients survive, and there is a need to develop cost-effective rehabilitation strategies to decrease the burden of disability from stroke.

 This study addresses this important issue, by evaluating, in the early phase post-stroke, effects of motor conventional physical therapy associated or not with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).
