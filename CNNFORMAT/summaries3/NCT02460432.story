(firstQuint)Comparison of Drug Eluting Stent and Covered Metal Stent in Malignant Biliary Obstruction (MIRA III).

 In patients with malignant biliary obstruction, endoscopic placement of biliary stents offers similar technical success rates.

 Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP)-guided stent placement has become the preferred approach to palliate malignant biliary obstruction.

 The major mechanisms of self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) occlusion are tumor ingrowth, tumor overgrowth, and epithelial hyperplasia.

 These mechanisms provide the rationale for developing a drug-eluting stent in order to improve stent patency.

 Limited data exist regarding outcomes of paclitaxel-eluting stents in malignant biliary obstruction.

 This study is to prospectively compare the effectiveness and safety of paclitaxel-eluting covered metal stent and covered metal stent for the treatment of malignant biliary obstruction.
