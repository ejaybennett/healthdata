(secondQuint)The Effect of Milk Proteins on Satiety, Food Intake and Metabolic Control (Glycemia) in Early Adulthood.

 1.

 A total of 33 males and females will participate in the study.

 Capillary blood samples will be collected from all participants to measure plasma glucose over a 3.

5 hour postprandial study.

 2.

 Intravenous blood samples will be collected from a subset of 12 (6 males and 6 females) participants for determination of insulin, satiety hormones, acetaminophen (gastric emptying rates), and determination of amino acid profiles.

 The Effect of Milk Proteins on Satiety, Food Intake and Metabolic Control (Glycemia) in Early Adulthood@highlight

The purpose of this study is to develop and test modified milk protein products to determine the effects of amino acids on food intake, satiety, insulin secretion and glucose control by insulin-independent action in healthy adults.
