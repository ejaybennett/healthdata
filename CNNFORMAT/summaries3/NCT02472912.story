(secondQuint)Adalimumab PK Bioequivalence Study to EU and US Sourced Humira.

 This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, 3-way parallel study in 270 healthy adult male and female subjects.

 During this study, the PK bioequivalence of BMO-2, containing 40 mg adalimumab, will be compared to EU licensed Humira(R) (EU-Humira(R) ) (40 mg) and US licensed Humira(R) (US-Humira(R) ) (40 mg).

 Randomization will be stratified by body weight (weight categories of 60.

0-79.

9 kg and 80.

0-95.

0 kg).

 After randomization, subjects will receive one of the following treatments: a single sc injection of 40 mg BMO-2, an equivalent sc injection of EU-Humira(R) (40 mg), or an equivalent sc injection of US-Humira(R) (40 mg).

 Volunteers participation in the study is expected to finish with the follow-up visit, scheduled 70 days after the injection of study drug.
