(fifthQuint)Utilizing Advance Care Planning Videos to Empower Perioperative Cancer Patients and Families.

 Many cancer patients pursue aggressive surgery in the hope of cancer cure or life prolongation.

 However, in doing so, patients and families may avoid advance care planning; they do not discuss specific goals and wishes should disease progress despite surgery.

 Moreover, a subset of patients become critically ill following surgery, and family members must make life-and-death decisions without knowing patient wishes.

 Preoperative advance care planning-facilitating patient and family discussions concerning perioperative goals, hopes, and fears-could empower patients and families to better choose which therapies and procedures they want outside of the initial surgery and for the months following surgery.

 Advance care planning aids exist, but none were developed for or evaluated in a surgical patient population.

 Furthermore, video-based advance care planning tools are an innovative way to better empower patients and families.

 Previous research shows that, with the aid of an advance care planning video, patients and families are more knowledgeable about treatment options and more comfortable with making decisions.

 Moreover, when better educated, these patients and families frequently choose less aggressive therapies.

 However, video-based advance care planning tools have not been developed or tested in a surgical patient population.

 The investigators have developed and now will evaluate a video-based advance care planning aid for cancer patients and families pursing aggressive surgical cancer treatment.

 The investigators hypothesize that, in patients and family members, the video-based decision aid will facilitate better preoperative discussions about advance care planning between the patient and surgeon and decrease anxiety and depression after surgery.

 Utilizing Advance Care Planning Videos to Empower Perioperative Cancer Patients and Families@highlight

Through close engagement with our patient and family member co-investigators, the investigators have developed a video-based advance care planning aid for cancer patients and their family members who are preparing for major surgery.

 In this study, patients are randomized to see either the intervention video (involving advance care planning-related content) or a control video (no advance care planning-related content) prior to surgery.

 The investigators hypothesize that the video will lead to more and better preoperative discussions between the patient and surgeon that are related to advance care planning.

 The investigators also hypothesize that seeing the advance care planning-related video will decrease perioperative anxiety and depression scores.
