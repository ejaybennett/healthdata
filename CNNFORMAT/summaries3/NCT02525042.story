(thirdQuint)Genetic Susceptibility to Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) by Functional Genomics Approach.

 This is a matched case-control study to identify genetic susceptibility factors to Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS).

 Patients and family controls selected from 154 families have been included in genome-wide linkage screening, comprising 440 patients and 904 individuals genotyped using microarrays Affymetrix(R) 250,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs).

 For each locus,families with a LOD score of 0;15 in predefined region were retained.

 In these families will be selected a patient and a healthy control of the same sex, if possible, siblings and of comparable age ( 1 will be identified.

 The expression level of these genes will then be verified by quantitative real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction).

 The positional and functional candidate genes identified due to a differential expression of their transcripts will be fully re-sequenced to search for polymorphisms that may be responsible for a change in their level of expression.

 The investigators expect to study one to three genes per region.

 The re-sequencing will be performed primarily in patients and family controls with a different level of expression of these genes.

 Polymorphisms distributed differently between these two populations will be retained for the rest of the study.

 The re-sequencing of these candidate genes will be spread over a period of 4 months.

The main objective is to identify in the candidate regions of differentially expressed genes by comparing the transcriptome of dendritic cells derived from circulating monocytes between cases and controls.

 Cases and family controls will be matched on the presence of HLA-B27 and depending on haplotype association studies to correlate the differences of gene expression and genetic variations with susceptibility to AS.
