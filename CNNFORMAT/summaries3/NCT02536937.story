(thirdQuint)A Study of the Effects of Renal Impairment on the Pharmacokinetics and Tolerability of Eliglustat Tartrate.

 The total study duration from screening period is approximately 31 days.

 In stage 1, only subjects with severe renal impairment and normal renal function will be enrolled.

 Subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment may be enrolled in stage 2 if the results in subjects with severe renal impairment show a substantial effect of reduced renal function on pharmacokinetics.

Primary Objective: To study the effect of mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of eliglustat.

 Secondary Objective: To assess the tolerability of eliglustat tartrate given as a single dose in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment in comparison with matched subjects with normal renal function.
