(secondQuint)The Effect of Group Treatment for Depression: A Study of Metacognitive Therapy, Mindfulness and Support Groups.

 Metacognitive therapy (MCT) show promising results in alleviating depressive symptoms and reducing relapse of depression.

 However studies of MCT as a group intervention is limited and higher quality studies of the effectiveness of MCT is warranted.

 The present study aim to produce more conclusive evidence on the effect of MCT comparing MCT in groups with both and active control group and mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT), which together with pharmacotherapy is currently one of the preferred treatment choices.

 Currently pharmacotherapy, cognitive therapy and MBCT seem to help 40-58% of the patients efficiently.

 The current studies of MCT indicate that this intervention may help a higher proportion of the patients.
