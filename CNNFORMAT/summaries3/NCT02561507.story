 Perioperative Aspirin Usage Survey@highlight

This is a survey of members of the American College of Surgeons (ACS), to describe and explore current patterns of their decisions about withholding or continuation for patients taking aspirin (ASA) in the perioperative period.

 Secondarily, the survey will also explore surgeons' knowledge about the risks and benefits attending this decision, and about national organizations' recommendations.
