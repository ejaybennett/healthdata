(secondQuint)Effects of the Visual Stimulation on the Motor and Visual Cortex in Migraneurs With and Without Aura.

 A cross sectional study to compare the best approach to migraineurs evaluation.

 For this, healthy individuals, after reading and signing the free and informed consent will be submitted to a single session to obtain the normal neurophysiological endpoints and thus compare with those obtained in individuals with migraineurs volunteers.

 All volunteers (healthy and migraineurs) will be submitted to a neurophysiological evaluation through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG).

 A visual stimulation will be delivered during the assessment of habituation through visual evoked potential volunteers (VEP-habituation) and the following measures will be evaluated before and after visual stimulation: (i) Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP); (ii) Motor Threshold (MT); (iii) Short Interval Cortical Inhibition (SICI); (iv) Intracortical Facilitation (lCF) and (v) Phosphene Threshold (PT).

 Effects of the Visual Stimulation on the Motor and Visual Cortex in Migraneurs With and Without Aura@highlight

The aim of this study is to investigate the motor and visual cortex excitability in response to visual stimulation of migraineurs with and without aura compared to healthy individuals.

 For this purpose, electrical cortical activity of migraineurs will be compared to healthy volunteers.
