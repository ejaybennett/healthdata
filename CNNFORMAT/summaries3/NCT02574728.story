(firstQuint)Sirolimus in Combination With Metronomic Chemotherapy in Children With Recurrent and/or Refractory Solid and CNS Tumors.

 This study aims to learn if the combination of oral sirolimus once daily with celecoxib, and with oral etoposide alternating every 21 days with oral cyclophosphamide (metronomic chemotherapy) is effective in shrinking relapsed or refractory tumors in pediatric participants.

 In addition, this study seeks to learn the length of time this combination can keep the tumor from growing, learn more about the side effects of sirolimus when used in this combination, and to learn if the sirolimus is working by evaluating blood and tumor tissue.
