(fifthQuint)Low Pulse Amplitude Focal ECT (LAP Study).

 Lower amplitude ECT (LAP) has been shown to induce seizures of adequate duration in a single titration session.

 This current study is hypothesized to increase stimulation focality, thus hypothetically minimizing cognitive side effects.

 The central hypothesis is that LAP has significantly less cognitive adverse effects compared to conventional Right Unilateral (RUL) ECT.

 The study will enroll 10 patients recruited from Medical College of Georgia.

 Patients referred to ECT service in the Medical College of Georgia usually occurs from clinical services and private physicians and the study will recruit patients who are clinically indicated to do ECT.

 Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive a course of either RUL LAP ECT, or conventional RUL ECT.

 Low Pulse Amplitude Focal ECT (LAP Study)@highlight

This protocol proposes a pilot randomized clinical trial to examine whether Low Pulse Amplitude Focal ECT (LAP) has a more favorable cognitive profile compared to conventional unilateral ECT and that it has similar effects as traditional ECT in reducing suicidality.

 The study will enroll 10 patients recruited from the Medical College of Georgia (at Georgia Regents University/Augusta University, GRU/AU) as the only site of the study.

 Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive a course of either RUL LAP ECT, or conventional RUL ECT.
