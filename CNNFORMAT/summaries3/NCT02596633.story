(secondQuint)A RCT of Telephone-supported ACT in MS.

 A large proportion of people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) suffer from emotional problems, therefore a large percentage of people with MS would be eligible to take part in a study offering a psychotherapeutic component to address these issues.

 Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been found to be effective for mood problems, and been successfully used in self-help format, but no study has thus-far examined potential for use as an effective intervention in this (MS) population.

 People will MS and low mood will be recruited from a neurology outpatient clinic.

 They will be randomized to either receive treatment as usual, or an ACT self-help book with 8 supportive telephone calls from a trainee clinical psychologist.

 Measures of anxiety, depression, quality of life and physical health will be administered at baseline, post-intervention and six month follow up.

 A sub sample of 10 participants will be interviewed to find out their view on taking part in the study.
