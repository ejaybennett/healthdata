(secondQuint)Vascularity Impact on the Treatment Outcome in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma(VITMPM).

 This is a randomized controlled retrospective study through Examination of paraffin blocks of the patient selected to be included in the study for assessment of the selected vascularity marker of malignant pleural mesothelioma of both types .

 The CD74 (LN2) antibody is intended for qualified laboratories to qualitatively identify by light microscopy the presence of associated antigens in sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections using Immunohistochemistry test methods.
