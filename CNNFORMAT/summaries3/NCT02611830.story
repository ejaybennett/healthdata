(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Vedolizumab Subcutaneously (SC) as Maintenance Therapy in Ulcerative Colitis.

 The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab subcutaneous (vedolizumab SC).

 Vedolizumab SC is being tested to treat people who have moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis.

 This study will look at clinical remission as well as mucosal healing, durable clinical response, durable clinical remission, and corticosteroid free remission in participants with UC who receive vedolizumab SC maintenance therapy after having achieved a clinical response to vedolizumab IV induction therapy.

 The study will enroll approximately 400 patients.

 All participants will enter into a 6 week Induction Phase where they will be administered open-label vedolizumab IV 300 mg via intravenous infusion (IV) at Week 0 (Day 1) and Week 2 (day 15), and will then be assessed for a clinical response at Week 6.

 Participants who achieve a clinical response at Week 6 will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: - Vedolizumab SC 108 mg Q2W and Placebo IV Q8W - Vedolizumab IV 300 mg Q8W and Placebo SC Q2W - Placebo SC Q2W and Placebo IV Q8W Participants who do not achieve a clinical response at Week 6 will not be randomized in to the Maintenance Period, and will receive a third infusion of vedolizumab IV 300 mg at Week 6.

 This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide.

 The overall time to participate in this study is up to 71 weeks.

 Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final visit 18 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

 Participants will also participate in a long-term safety follow-up, by phone, at 6 months after the last dose of study drug.
