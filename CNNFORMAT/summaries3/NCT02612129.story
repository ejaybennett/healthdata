(thirdQuint)Arimoclomol Prospective Study in Patients Diagnosed With NiemannPick Disease Type C.

 A prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled therapeutic study in patients with confirmed diagnosis of NiemannPick disease type C (NPC).

 Patients must either 1) have completed Visit 2 (end of study [EOS]) of the CTORZYNPC001 study or 2) meet the eligibility criteria of this study including a requirement of stable treatment with miglustat for 6 months (if on miglustat therapy) prior to enrolment into the study.

 Aim: The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of arimoclomol (compared to placebo) when it is administered as an add-on therapy to the patient's current prescribed best standard of care; patient's standard of care may, or may not, include miglustat.

 Randomisation: Patients will be randomised to receive placebo or arimoclomol (with an allocation ratio of 1:2).

 Pharmacokinetic evaluation(age below 12): To confirm the selected dose, patients less than 12 years of age will undergo an arimoclomol single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation before randomisation and the start of continuous (multiple dosing) treatment.

 Early Escape Clause: In patients whose disease progression is too severe and/or too fast, the "early escape clause" will allow the Investigator to apply the escape route which implies that the patient can be treated with arimoclomol (as per blinded phase study schedule) and be followed up on an annual basis until arimoclomol has received EU MA or until the analysis of data from the controlled, 12 month blinded phase study period does not support the efficacy and/or safety of arimoclomol.

 Study duration: The duration of the blinded phase study period will be 12 months.

 Following this, all patients will be offered to continue into the extension phase of the study where every patient will receive arimoclomol and be followed up and attend site visits at 18 months and 24 months (after randomisation) and then on an annual basis thereafter.

The extension phase runs until arimoclomol has received Regulatory Approval or until the analysis of data from the controlled, blinded phase 12 month study period does not support the efficacy and/or safety of arimoclomol.
