(firstQuint)Quetiapine for Delirium Prophylaxis in High-risk Critically Ill Patients.

 Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of scheduled quetiapine for delirium prophylaxis in critically ill, trauma/surgical patients identified as high-risk for delirium utilizing a validated prediction model.

 Design: Prospective, open-label, single-center study.

 Setting: Trauma/surgical intensive care unit at an academic medical center.

 Patients: Eighty two adult trauma/surgical patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit and were at high-risk for the development of delirium (PRE-DELIRIC Score 50%, past medical history of dementia, past medical history of alcohol misuse, or past medical history of drug abuse).

 Interventions: Patients were randomized by unit location to receive pharmacologic prophylaxis for delirium (quetiapine 12.

5 mg every 12 hours) or no pharmacologic prophylaxis for delirium within forty-eight hours of admission to the intensive care unit.

 Measurements: The primary end point was the incidence of delirium during admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).

 Secondary end points included time to onset of delirium, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, ICU and hospital mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and adverse events.

 Delirium was assessed using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit.
