(fifthQuint)Effects of Dexmedetomidine on Cough Response and Postoperative Recovery Quality in Patients Undergoing Thyroid Surgery With General Anesthesia.

 Thyroid surgery is a common clinical surgery,the incidence of postoperative coughing is up to 32.

4%.

Coughing response could result in postoperative bleeding,even cause respiratory tract obstruction,affect patients' postoperative recovery .

Dexmedetomidine,an 2 adrenergic agonist,has hypnotic,analgesic, anxiolytic,antisympathetic effects,which could facilitate the sedation of patients while maintaining their consciousness and keep respiration and circulation stable .

For these benefits,dexmedetomidine was widely used for general anesthesia.

However,whether dexmedetomidine can reduce the incidence of postoperative coughing is unclear.

Therefore,the investigators conduct this randomized controlled double-blind trial,to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine on coughing and postoperative recovery quality in patients undergoing tyroid surgery with general anesthesia.

Coughing is a common adverse reaction of thyroid surgery,which could result in postoperative bleeding.

Postoperative bleeding is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication,which could result in acute upper airway obstruction due to neck hematoma and increase the need for re-operation.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether dexmedetomidine can reduce the incidence of postoperative coughing and contribute to postoperative recovery in patients undergoing tyroid surgery with general anesthesia.
