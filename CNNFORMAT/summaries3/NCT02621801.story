(fifthQuint)Evaluation of a Mind-body Education Program to Enhance Resiliency and Reduce Burnout in Residents.

 The investigators adapted the Benson-Henry Institute Stress Management and Resiliency Training Program -- Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (SMART-3RP) to create the SMART-R resident wellness curriculum.

 The actual SMART-3RP is both a clinical program and research intervention.

 The three prongs of the SMART-R include 1) elicitation of the relaxation response through mind-body techniques 2) reducing overall stress reactivity and 3) increasing connectedness to self and others.

 In a waitlist-control design, the SMART-R was implemented into multiple residents programs at Mass General Hospital, NYU Langone Medical Center, and Weill Cornell Medical College.

 The primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the SMART-R in increasing coping skills and reducing stress among residents in the participating programs.

 Participants enrolled will be invited to complete 1) a brief questionnaire before, during (q3months) and after participation in the program (5 questionnaires total).

 The investigators will also collect continuous physiologic data using the Basis Peak Health Tracking device to correlate the physiologic data with self-report measures of stress.

 Additionally, objective indicators of daily workload (page frequency, and quantity of notes authored by a resident during a given period) will help control for residents' schedules and busyness, in evaluating perceived stress, wellbeing and other outcomes.

 Evaluation of a Mind-body Education Program to Enhance Resiliency and Reduce Burnout in Residents@highlight

This prospective, waitlist-control study is evaluating the benefits of a stress management and resiliency training program for residents (SMART-R).

 The primary aim of this study is to determine whether the SMART-R is effective at increasing coping skills and reducing stress among residents, reflected by changes in constructs such as emotional growth, perceived stress, optimism, and coping styles.

 Objective parameters (heart rate, galvanized skin response, sleep duration and quality, exercise and actigraphy) measured with the Basis health tracking device will help correlate objective signs to subjective report of stress.
