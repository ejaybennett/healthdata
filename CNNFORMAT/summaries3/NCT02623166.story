(fifthQuint)Treatment of Pneumonia, Diarrhoea and Fever in Children by Community Health Workers.

 Using indepth interviews, focus group discussions and other qualitative research methods barriers and opportunities for promoting use of ASHAs as a treatment source for diarrhea, pneumonia and fever will be identified.

 An intervention package which includes training of ASHAs and ANMs to treat uncomplicated cases of pneumonia, diarrhea and fever, ensuring they have required supplies, creating awareness in community and monitoring and supervising the treatment provided by them will be implemented in primary health centre areas in Haryana, India.

 ASHAs will treat cases of fast breathing pneumonia with amoxicillin and refer children with danger signs or chest indrawing pneumonia.

 Three rounds of cross sectional surveys will be conducted to ascertain prevalence of morbidity, careseeking and hospitalizations in children aged 2 to 59 months.

The investigators propose to test the feasibility and acceptability of community health workers (ASHAs and ANMs) being able to treat sick children in the community.

 There is a national policy for treatment for children aged 2-59 months with illnesses such as pneumonia, diarrhea and fever by community health workers (CHWs), this policy has not been implemented as yet in Haryana.

 This research will identify barriers and opportunities for use of CHWs as treatment sources.
