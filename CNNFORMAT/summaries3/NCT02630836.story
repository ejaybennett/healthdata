(thirdQuint)Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in Elderly Patients With Hip Fracture.

 Prospective, unicenter, randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-arms blinded assessor phase I-II pilot study.

 Thirty-two (32) elderly patients (70-85 years of age) with type 31A2 y 31A3 fracture of the femur (AO/ASIF (Association for the Study of Internal Fixation) classification) admitted at the emergency room of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona will be randomized 1:1 to one of the two treatment-arms (endomedullary nailing + XCEL-MT-OSTEO-BETA or isolated endomedullary nailing as the standard treatment).

 Once surgically treated, patients will be followed for 12 month with the primary objective of safety.

 Secondary objectives are efficacy through axial tomography and xRay, clinical efficacy and quality of life questionnaire (EUROQOL-5D).
