(firstQuint)Endostar for Locally Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.

 Locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) may be salvaged by intensity modulated-radiotherapy (IMRT), but severe late toxicities become the most common reason of death in IMRT salvaged NPC patients.

 The aim of this phase II randomized controlled study is to address the efficacy of concurrent Endostar (Endostatins) with IMRT to reduce the occurrence of severe late toxicities compared with IMRT alone for locally recurrent NPC patients.
