(fifthQuint)The Influence of Hyaluronic Acid Injection Following Knee Arthroscopy.

 The use of hyaluronic acid is well known as one of the treatment modalities for knee osteoarthritis (OA) .

Arthroscopy is a controversial treatment option for knee OA but in some cases, during knee arthroscopy done for other indication, cartilage damage is noted.

 This cartilage damage may slower the healing and rehabilitation process after knee arthroscopy.

 Therefore we will evaluate the influence of hyaluronic acid injection on the healing and rehabilitation process following knee arthroscopy.

 All patients will be recruited prior to the arthroscopy.

 All patients will sign a concent form.

Patients will be randomly divided to 2 groups which are the 2 arms of this study - treatment group and control group.

 All patient will be examined by a senior orthopedic surgeon and will fill the pre operative questionnaires.

 MRI scan of the operated knee prior for the surgery will be collected and evaluated.

Knee arthroscopy will be performed by 2 senior orthopedic surgeons.

 Data and arthroscopic findings will be collected and documented during surgery.

 2 weeks after surgery patients will be evaluated in the hospitals' outpatients clinic.

 The treatment group will be given a series of 3 injections of Sodium Hyaluronate 1%(ARTHREASE, TM) - one injection per week.

 The control group will be given a series of 3 injections of placebo (BPS - Buffer Phosphate Solution - the buffer solution of the hyaluronic acid regular injections).

 The syringes will be blinded to the patients and the physician.

 questionnaires will be given at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3months and 6 months post operatively.

 The Influence of Hyaluronic Acid Injection Following Knee Arthroscopy@highlight

This is a prospective, double blind randomized controlled trial.

 In this study we will investigate the influence of hyaluronic acid injection to knee after knee arthroscopy, when known or discovered cartilage damage greater than International Cartilage Research Society score (ICRS) grade 2 is found.

 The indication for arthroscopy is not necessarily the cartilage damage.

 A set of 3 consecutive injections will be administered and follow up of physical examination and questionaries will be done.

 Our null hypothesis is that the administration of hyaluronic acid will show decrease pain and quicker rehabilitation and return to normal activity in patients with grade 2 and higher cartilage damage that had gone through knee arthroscopy.
