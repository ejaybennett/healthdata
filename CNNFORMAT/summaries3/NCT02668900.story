(fifthQuint)Decision Support for Adults Facing Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Pulse Generator Replacement.

 Sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to a ventricular arrhythmia is a serious cause of cardiovascular death in Canada.

 The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) can reduce the incidence of SCD in high-risk patients by delivering an internal shock to restore a normal rhythm.

 The life expectancy of an ICD generator is estimated between four and seven years, and must be surgically replaced to ensure ongoing function.

 Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) replacement is becoming increasingly common constituting nearly 40% of all ICD procedures.

 For the most part, ICDs are automatically replaced.

 With every ICD replacement, the net benefit of continued ICD therapy should be assessed individually in view of the procedural risks, inappropriate shocks, psychological risks, changes in health status, and the potential for harm and suffering at end-of-life.

 Some studies have shown that the mortality benefit of an ICD attenuates with advancing age and comorbidities.

 There are many legitimate reasons for declining ICD generator replacement.

 The chronic nature of a cardiac condition and/or the diagnosis of a life-limiting disease since initial implantation may compel a patient to reconsider their health care goals from supporting quantity of life, to prioritizing one of quality.

 This is an important distinction as the ICD can prolong the dying process by delivering shock(s) which can result in pain and discomfort for the patient, and helplessness for witnesses.

 Other patients have reported psychological distress, while others report only truly understanding the effects of living with an ICD after receiving one, possibly leading to changes in treatment preference when they are faced with the decision to replace.

 Also, the replacement procedure includes a substantially greater risk for infection and reoperation as compared to the initial implantation.

 These complexities warrant decision support to prepare patients to make decisions.

 Yet, no means exists to support patients' decision-making in the context of ICD replacement.

 A decision support intervention (including a patient decision aid with decision coaching) was developed using a user-centered design with various stakeholders and potential end-users, which could moderate treatment related uncertainty and prepare patients to make high quality decisions that are informed and based on their personal preferences and values.

 Objectives: 1.

 Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the feasibility of conducting a larger trial.

 2.

 To determine the effect of the decision support intervention for adults faced with ICD replacement on attributes of decision quality and decision-making processes.

The implantable-cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a small medical device used to treat dangerously fast and potentially life-threatening heart rates.

 For patients at risk, the ICD can detect an abnormal rhythm and provide life-saving therapy by delivering a shock.

 ICD therapy has risks and benefits that should be weighed from each patient's perspective.

 An ICD battery needs to be surgically replaced 4 to 7 years to ensure ongoing function.

 At present, the majority of these batteries are automatically changed without eliciting patients' preferences.

 There is a need for a better way to engage with patients.

 Patients want to be involved in their healthcare decisions, yet more than half of patients with an ICD do not know that ICD replacement is optional.

 To ensure that patients are receiving treatment that they value and want, members of the interprofessional team should ensure that treatment decisions align with patients' expectations, values and preferences.

 This rests on the principle of shared decision making in which members of the healthcare team and patients deliberate together to arrive at a decision which best reflects the preferences and values of the patient.

 To facilitate the achievement of this goal, a patient decision aid (PDA) can be used.

 As a result, the investigators developed PDA for ICD replacement.

 The purpose of this feasibility trial is to collect preliminary data to test the feasibility of conducting a larger trial, and to evaluate the PDA for its acceptability and ease of use.

 Eligible and consented participants facing ICD replacement will be randomized to receive the decision aid or to usual care.

 The investigators will assess if this decision aid can improve participants' knowledge on ICD therapy and the replacement surgery, increase patients' perceived involvement in the decision, and determine whether their actual choice reflects their personal values.
