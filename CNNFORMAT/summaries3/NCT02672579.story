(firstQuint)Study of Kids Itch Severity (SKIS).

 There are many diseases that affect children where the primary symptom is pruritus.

 This study aims to validate an age appropriate pediatric version of the ItchyQoL, a pruritus-specific quality of life instrument, and the ItchyQuant, a self-reported itch severity scale, to better understand how pruritus affects the pediatric population.

 These instruments will comprehensively capture the severity and impact of pruritus in children.

 The physicians want to explore the opportunity to integrate patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) as a patient-reported tool in the ambulatory setting.
