(secondQuint)A Study to Investigate the Absorption, Metabolism and Excretion of [14C]ASP8273 in Subjects With Solid Tumors.

 This study consists of two parts (A and B).

 In Part A, eligible subjects will be admitted to the site on day -1 and remain confined at the site until postdosing discharge criteria are met.

 Subjects will receive a single dose of [14C] ASP8273 solution on study day 1.

 Once Part A has been completed, subjects may elect to continue participation in Part B.

 Subjects will receive oral administration of ASP8273 (nonradiolabeled) once daily in 28-day cycles.
