(firstQuint)Ferumoxytol-enhanced Imaging and Mapping in neuroAIDS.

 HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) continue to be prevalent despite effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and have a significant impact on morbidity and quality of life.

 Monocytes/macrophages (M/M) are believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of HAND.

 Neuroimaging HIV research has not focused on assessing M/M-mediated inflammation in the brain.

 Currently, no neuroimaging modality exists that can define the extent of active inflammation due to M/M in HAND either as a clinical diagnostic tool or to assist in defining objective improvement in clinical trials addressing HAND.

 Ferumoxytol is an ultra-small iron oxide MRI contrast agent avidly taken up by circulating M/M.

 The investigators hypothesize that ferumoxytol-based imaging can identify ongoing inflammation due to perivascular M/M which is believed to represent a key pathologic correlate of HAND.

This project will investigate the ability of a novel MRI contrast agent to identify and quantitate ongoing monocyte/macrophage (M/M)-mediated inflammation in the brains of HIV-infected individuals.
