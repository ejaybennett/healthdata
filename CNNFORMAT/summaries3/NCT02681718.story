(thirdQuint)Controlling Hyperglycemia Among Minority Population.

 The CHAMP study will test the efficacy of two interventions designed to decrease uncontrolled hyperglycemia (defined as Hemoglobin-A1C (A1C) at or above 9%) among adults with diabetes.

 Patients from a safety-net hospital will be randomized into three groups: 1) a control group, 2) an intervention providing diabetes self-care text messages, or 3) an intervention using community health workers to provide diabetes education and linkage to care.

 Secondary objectives include increasing diabetes knowledge, improving diabetes self-management, and increasing use of primary care (i.

e.

, make one visit to the physician in 6 months) among the intervention participants.

 A cost-effectiveness analysis will determine the most appropriate way to reduce the burden of uncontrolled diabetes.

 Controlling Hyperglycemia Among Minority Population@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of three approaches in diabetes management: (1) community health worker (CHW) education; (2) text messaging; and (3) usual hospital-based care.

 The goal is to determine the most cost-effective method of diabetes management among an economically-disadvantaged, minority population.
