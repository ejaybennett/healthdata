(fifthQuint)The Use of Tranexamic Acid to Reduce Blood Loss in Acetabular Surgery.

 In this study, investigators plan to prospectively determine the effect of tranexamic acid on blood loss and outcome after surgery to the acetabulum.

 Patients will be randomized into two groups.

 In this study, investigators plan to administer a 10mg/kg dose within 30 minutes of surgery followed by a 10mg/kg infusion over a 4hr period to the treatment group (for patients weighting over 100kg, a weight of 100kg will be used for the dose calculation).

 The control group will receive equal volumes of and rates of normal saline.

 Research Questions: 1.

 Do patients undergoing acetabular ORIF who receive tranexamic acid have a reduced risk of allogenic blood transfusion as compared to patients who receive placebo? 2.

 Do patients undergoing acetabular ORIF who receive tranexamic acid have reduced peri-operative blood loss as compared to patients who receive placebo? 3.

 Do patients undergoing acetabular ORIF who receive tranexamic acid have a higher risk for thromboembolic events than patients who receive placebo? 4.

 Do patients undergoing acetabular ORIF who receive tranexamic acid have a reduced risk of wound complications (prolonged wound drainage, return to the OR within 30 days, infection)? 5.

 Is the use of tranexamic acid cost effective relative to the use of allogenic blood transfusion as a blood loss management strategy in acetabular ORIF?.

 The Use of Tranexamic Acid to Reduce Blood Loss in Acetabular Surgery@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if patients undergoing acetabular ORIF (open reduction with internal fixation) who receive tranexamic acid have a reduced risk of allogenic blood transfusion, perioperative blood loss, wound complication and higher risk for thromboembolic events compared to patients who receive placebo.

 Investigators want to determine the cost-effectiveness related to allogenic blood transfusion as a blood loss management strategy in acetabular open reduction internal fixation (ORIF).

 Orthopaedic surgery carries with it a significant risk for blood loss.

 Current management of perioperative blood loss is the use of allogenic blood transfusion.

 Allogenic blood transfusion carries with it a risk for HIV and Hepatitis C as well as multiple adverse reactions.

 There have been significant efforts to reduce the use of allogenic blood transfusion in orthopaedic surgery.

 Tranexamic acid, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, has been used in management of blood during surgery.

 In order to determine the impact of tranexamic acid in reducing blood loss among patients undergoing acetabular ORIF, investigators will conduct a prospective randomized study.

 Patients undergoing acetabular surgery will be screened for this study.

 Patients will be then randomized to placebo or tranexamic acid which will be administered during and after surgery.

 The following data will be collected: patient characteristics, surgery information, blood loss, blood transfusions, wound complication within 30 days of surgery, and cost.
