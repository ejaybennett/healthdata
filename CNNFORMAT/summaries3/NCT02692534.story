(fifthQuint)Cocaine Use and Outcomes of General Anesthesia.

 Patients with a history of cocaine abuse in the past year who are scheduled to undergo surgery at Parkland Hospital will be asked to provide a urine sample for a screening toxicology test on the day of surgery.

 Patients will also be asked to fill out a questionnaire with questions pertaining to their drug use history.

 The remaining aspects of perioperative care, including the general anesthetic technique, will be standardized for all patients and will not differ from the standard of care.

 The anesthesia faculty, resident, or CRNA will identify patients and obtain consent and ask the patient to fill out the questionnaire.

 This prospective study is intended to enroll 300 cocaine positive and negative patients over a 2 year period.

 Blood samples will be collected for analysis of inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers including C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, and cardiac troponin T (cTnT).

 After induction of general anesthesia and postoperative day 1, the inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers (troponin T) will be measured.

 Subjects will be followed for adverse intraoperative cardiovascular events that are defined in two ways: 1) Proportion of total anesthesia duration that mean arterial pressure (MAP) 110 and 2) Proportion of total anesthesia duration that heart rate (HR) 100.

 Adverse postoperative cardiovascular events will be defined in two ways: 1) Increase in the postoperative troponin value compared to the patient's baseline preoperative troponin value and 2) Postoperative myocardial infarction, stroke, or death.

 Cocaine Use and Outcomes of General Anesthesia@highlight

In this prospective study, investigators plan to evaluate the outcome of general anesthesia in the context of patients with a positive cocaine urine test.

 Patients with a positive urine cocaine test who do not appear acutely toxic and have normal vital signs may not have an increased rate of perioperative complications during elective surgery compared to similar patients with negative urine cocaine screening tests.

 Patients who are chronic cocaine users may have a higher anesthetic requirement.
