(secondQuint)A Study to Compare Fluticasone /Formoterol Breath Actuated Inhaler (BAI) and Ultibro in Subjects With Fixed Airflow Obstruction and Elevated Eosinophils.

 The study is designed to provide efficacy and safety data for the use of fluticasone/formoterol Breath actuated inhaler in subjects with the characteristics of fixed airflow obstruction and elevated eosinophils.

 These patients have typically been excluded from previous Flutiform pMDI asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) trials; for example in asthma studies, patients with a smoking history of 10 pack years or more have been excluded, conversely in COPD studies patients with any prior history of asthma have been excluded.

 It is expected that the data from this study will provide a greater understanding of the effects of fluticasone/formoterol in this patient population.
