(secondQuint)Pulmonary Embolism in Pregnancy: Biomarkers and Clinical Predictive Models.

 To account for all women meeting the study eligibility criteria, this study utilized a combined prospective and retrospective arm.

 Pregnant women who underwent diagnostic imaging to evaluate for suspected PE at our institution were prospectively enrolled from February 2014 to August 2015.

 Both d-dimer and BNP serum levels were drawn, and a MWS was assigned.

 All pregnant women diagnosed with a PE that underwent diagnostic imaging and had a d-dimer level drawn from January 2009 to June 2014 were retrospectively enrolled.

 Patient electronic records were used to apply the MWS and analyze their risk.

Objective: To evaluate whether trimester specific d-dimer levels and brain natriuretic protein (BNP), along with the modified Wells score (MWS), is a useful risk stratification tool to exclude pregnant women at low-risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) from diagnostic imaging with radiation exposure.
