(fifthQuint)Tobacco Cessation Training Program in Spanish-speaking Countries.

 Tobacco cessation training programs to treat tobacco dependence have measureable effects on patients' smoking.

 Tobacco consumption in low and middle income countries is increasing, but these countries usually lack measures to face the epidemic, including tobacco cessation training programs addressed to their health professionals and organizations.

 Based on a previous online training program for hospital workers in Spain, the Fruitful Study aims are twofold: 1.

 to adapt the course to the reality of 3 Spanish-speaking low and middle income countries (Bolivia, Guatemala, and Paraguay) and; 2.

 to evaluate the effectiveness of the program among the participant hospitals and workers.

 Investigators use a mixed methods design with a pre-post evaluation (quantitative approach) and in-depth interviews and focus groups (qualitative approach).

 The main outcomes will be: 1.

 participants' attitudes, knowledge and behaviors before and after the training and 2.

 the level of implementation of tobacco control policies within the hospitals before and after the training.

 The theoretical framework for this project includes Card's adapting model and Roger's diffusion of innovations model.

 This study will show whether it is possible to adapt an online course to the reality of developing countries.

 In addition, investigator will measure whether an online program will produce changes in tobacco control policies at the organizational level and increase the level of knowledge, attitudes and perception in tobacco cessation at participants' level.

 Tobacco Cessation Training Program in Spanish-speaking Countries@highlight

This project is responsive to the identified gap of lack of tobacco cessation training programs in Latin American & Caribbean countries.

 Currently, smoking rates in the Latin American and Caribbean region are high, and previous surveys show that health professionals do not have enough skills to help smokers to quit.

 In consequence, in absence of trained health professionals, many smokers who visit health care services are under-treated.

 The Fruitful Project aims to adapt an original on-line course developed in Spain to the reality of the three Latin American countries (Bolivia, Guatemala and Paraguay) and disseminate evidence-based tobacco cessation interventions among health care professionals.
