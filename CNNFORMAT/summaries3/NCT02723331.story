(thirdQuint)Perioperative Therapy for Resectable and Borderline-Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma With Molecular Correlates.

 Patients in both cohorts will receive a total of 3 cycles of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine, followed by re-staging CT scan, if re-staging CT does not show evidence of metastatic disease.

 Patients will receive SBRT and definitive surgical resection.

 Subsequently, patients will receive 3 cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine.

 Each cycle of combination chemotherapy will be a total of 4 weeks.

 Patients will be evaluated for response at completion of the 3 cycles of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy with CT scans of chest, abdomen and pelvis.

 Patients will undergo surveillance CT scan at 3-month intervals until evidence of disease progression.

The objective of this study is to estimate the R0 resection rate in patients with Resectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (R-PDAC) as well as those with Resectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (BR-PDAC) independently in response to neoadjuvant sequential therapy of combination nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine followed by stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).
