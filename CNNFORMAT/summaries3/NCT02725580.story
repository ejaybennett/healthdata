 The proposed clinical trial is the first human, open-label, single dose study of self-complementary AAV9 carrying the CLN6 gene under the control of a hybrid CMV enhancer/chicken--actin promoter (scAAV9.

 All twelve patients will receive a dose equivalent to (1.

5 x10^13 vg).

 This will be administered premixed with 2.

5 mL of the contrast Omnipaque cent at a concentration of 180 mgI/mL of the contrast via a 10 mL syringe and a Spinal Needle.

 If no clinically significant improvement without toxicity is observed, the possibility of adding an additional escalation cohort at a higher dose will be discussed with the FDA, DSMB and relevant oversight regulatory agencies.

The proposed clinical trial is the first human, open-label, single dose study of self-complementary AAV9 carrying the CLN6 gene delivered one-time intrathecally inserted by a lumbar puncture into Batten CLN6 Disease subjects.

 One cohort of patients with Batten CLN6 Disease, with confirmed diagnosis, will undergo gene transfer.

 A minimum of twelve patients will be enrolled into the cohort.
