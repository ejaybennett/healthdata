(firstQuint)Belinostat Therapy With Zidovudine for Adult T-Cell Leukemia-Lymphoma.

 ATLL is an aggressive malignancy caused by HTLV-1.

 ATLL cannot be cured by conventional chemotherapy thus urging the development of new therapeutic strategies.

 HDAC inhibitors are broadly active anti-neoplastic agents that can be exploited for the treatment of ATLL as it has been demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of HDACs promotes acetylation of nucleosomes and chromatin unwinding at the HTLV-1 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), which results in transcription of the viral genome.

 Belinostat, a potent pan HDAC inhibitor, causes H3 subunit acetylation and induces HTLV-1 Tax expression in cultured ATLL cells resulting in dose-dependent apoptosis.

 Further, Belinostat blocks constitutive expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B), and increases apoptosis in the presence of AZT.

 - This is an open-label, single arm, phase II study of zidovudine (AZT) and Belinostat, as consolidation therapy with optional interferon-alfa-2b (IFN-alfa-2b) or pegylated interferon-alfa-2b (PEG-IFN-alfa-2b).

 For subjects receiving interferon therapy at baseline, the corresponding interferon, IFN-alfa-2b at 5 million IU daily or PEG-IFN-alfa-2b at 1.

5 1/2g/kg once weekly, may be continued.

 Subjects will receive up to 8 cycles of Belinostat combined with AZT (as consolidation) followed by AZT-based maintenance therapy ( IFN-alfa) for at least 6 more months.

 - Subjects will be restaged at the end of Belinostat Cycle 3(-7 days), Belinostat Cycle 8(-14 days), end of Month 9(14 days) and end of Month 12 (14 days) post-Belinostat during AZT-based maintenance treatment.

 Subjects who have progression of disease at any of these time points will be taken off study treatment.

 At the end of Cycle 3 (of Belinostat), subjects who achieve a molecular complete response or maintain a clinical stable response may continue on the study.

 - At the end of Cycle 8 (i.

e.

 completion of Belinostat), subjects who achieve or maintain a complete molecular response (CMR) with no evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) will continue to receive AZT (IFN-alfa).

 Subjects with MRD with no clinical evidence of disease progression nor clinical evidence of ATLL may also continue to receive AZT ( IFN-alfa) OR be removed from treatment at the discretion of the Investigator.

 - At the end of Month 9, subjects who maintain/achieve CR with no evidence of MRD will continue to receive AZT ( IFN-alfa) for 3 more months, to Month 12.

 Those with MRD (without clinical evidence of disease progression or clinical evidence of ATLL) may also continue to receive AZT ( IFN-alfa) for 3 more months to Month 12 OR be removed from the study at the discretion of the Investigator.

 - Up to 20 subjects are expected to be enrolled.

 Correlative evaluations will also be performed at specified visits.

The investigators propose to use Belinostat in combination with AZT as consolidation therapy for the treatment of ATLL.
