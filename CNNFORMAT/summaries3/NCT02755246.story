(firstQuint)Polyamine-enriched Diet in Healthy Older Adults With Subjective Cognitive Decline.

 Memory abilities are known to decline during aging, a process that is accelerated in pathological conditions like subjective, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), all of which are a growing public-health concern with devastating effects.

 Polyamines supplementation and corresponding up-regulation of autophagy (i.

e.

, cellular protein degradation pathways) may be a key target of intervention against age-related memory decline.

 The study will investigate whether a polyamine-enriched dietary supplementation (through capsule intake) could provide positive effects on the cognitive function of elderly individuals (60-80 years old) with subjective cognitive decline.
