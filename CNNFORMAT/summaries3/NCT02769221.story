(secondQuint)Intubation Success Rate_Rigid Video Stylet Vs Video Laryngoscope.

 Video laryngoscope and lightwand are widely used at endotracheal intubation in cervical spine patients.

 Video laryngoscope is useful because of identification of anatomic structure around the oral cavity and vocal cord.

 Rigid video stylet resemble lightwand, but it has a video at the end of stylet.

 So rigid video stylet is useful at confirmation of vocal cord.
