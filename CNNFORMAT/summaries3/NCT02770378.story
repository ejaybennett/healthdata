(secondQuint)A Proof-of-concept Clinical Trial Assessing the Safety of the Coordinated Undermining of Survival Paths by 9 Repurposed Drugs Combined With Metronomic Temozolomide (CUSP9v3 Treatment Protocol) for Recurrent Glioblastoma.

 A proof-of-concept clinical trial assessing the safety of the coordinated undermining of survival paths by 9 repurposed drugs (aprepitant, auranofin, captopril, celecoxib, disulfiram, itraconazole, minocycline, ritonavir and sertraline) combined with metronomic temozolomide (CUSP9v3 treatment protocol) for recurrent glioblastoma.

 This is a phase I study for subjects of 18 years and older with glioblastoma that has relapsed after radiation and chemotherapy, as confirmed by histology and MRI.

 A total of 10 patients will be treated with the CUSP9v3 treatment protocol.

 This is a monocentric trial: all patients will be treated at Ulm University Hospital.
