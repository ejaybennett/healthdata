(thirdQuint)A Phase 2b Study of SPI-1005 to Reduce the Incidence, Severity, and Duration of Acute Noise Induced Hearing Loss.

 Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety and efficacy study of oral SPI-1005 in adults with Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL).

 All recruited subjects will have their severity of NIHL determined before the start of SPI-1005 treatment using otoscopy, tympanometry and audiometry.

 Subjects with >15 and </= 40 decibel (dB) NIHL will be enrolled and randomized to either placebo or SPI-1005.

 Patients will be dosed with either placebo or SPI-1005 for 7 days, beginning 1 day before an acute NIHL.

 Patients will have audiometry and Words In Noise Testing (WINT) before and immediately after a calibrated sound challenge (CSC).

 The CSC involves listening to 4 hours of pre-recorded music (100 dBA SPL) through insert earphones.

 The CSC induces a slight acute NIHL.

 Follow-up audiometry and WINT will be performed at 1 and 7 days post-CSC.

 A total of four clinic visits will be required over 10-14 days.

 A Phase 2b Study of SPI-1005 to Reduce the Incidence, Severity, and Duration of Acute Noise Induced Hearing Loss@highlight

SPI-1005 is a novel oral drug that contains a glutathione peroxidase mimetic (ebselen) that will be tested in subjects with a history of NIHL at risk for additional NIHL.

 The goal of this multi-center Phase 2b study is to determine whether SPI-1005 is effective in reducing an acute NIHL in this affected population.

 In this Phase 2b study subjects with prior NIHL will be enrolled and exposed to a calibrated sound challenge (CSC) that induces a slight acute NIHL.
