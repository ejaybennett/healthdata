(fifthQuint)Child Follow-up Until 2 Years.

 This is an existing on-going prospective birth cohort of children born to the pregnant women who had fetal growth assessed during pregnancy.

 In this cohort an expected 10% of pregnant women will be exposed to malaria while the remaining will be free of malaria.

 Their offspring are already followed up for growth monitoring from birth until 2 years of age with anthropometric measurements including weight, length, arm and head circumference at each scheduled visit.

 The investigator would like to enhance the sensitivity of the study outcomes with minimal risk for the child by proposing the following anthropometric and screening tests, nutrition questionnaire, and neurodevelopment assessment.

 In addition a prospective cohort of children born after study approval will be followed on both protocols.

 The additional measure include: - Body fat composition (at birth, and monthly up to 4 months unless weight 8kg) - Triceps and subscapular skinfold (at 1 and 2 years) - Anemia, malaria and soil-transmitted helminths screening (every 3 months in first 12 months and 6-monthly 1-2 years) - Buccal swab (at 1 and 2 years) - Neurodevelopment (every 6 months) - Food questionnaire (at 1 and 2 years).

 Child Follow-up Until 2 Years@highlight

The purpose of this study is to measure the impact of maternal malaria on child growth in the two first years of life in relation to fetal growth.

 This study is following a birth cohort of children born to pregnant women enrolled in the study "Impact of malaria infection in pregnancy on fetal and newborn growth" (protocol OXTREC 14 08 and Mahidol 2009-003-01).

 In this cohort growth monitoring is conducted until 2 years of age using routine anthropometric measurements such as weight, length, arm and head circumference.

 A few additional tests will enhance the sensitivity of the study outcomes with minimal risk.

 These tests will include anthropometry, screening, nutrition questionnaire and neurodevelopmental assessment.
