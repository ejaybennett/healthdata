(fifthQuint)Trial of a Novel Brief Intervention on Health Behaviors for Youth With Chronic Medical Conditions.

 The proposed project is a randomized control trial to assess the efficacy of an SBIRT model tailored to youth with chronic medical conditions.

 This trial is being built into a larger, longitudinal cohort study to assess whether a set of brief, substance specific questions can accurately predict adolescent substance use outcomes when compared to more lengthy, criterion standard assessment questions, in cross-sectional and prospective analysis.

 The first component of the project will consist of pre-testing an assessment battery and brief electronic intervention with a small sample of 14-17 year old youth.

 In the second component the investigators will randomize consented eligible participants into intervention or control arms of the study and administer the 1) Baseline Assessment Battery and the 2) Brief Intervention OR Treatment as Usual (TAU).

 In the third component the investigators will follow up with all participants at 6 and then 12 months after study entry to reassess rates of substance use through follow up assessment batteries.

 At baseline, the investigators will also attempt to enroll parents of all participants who are present at the time of enrollment.

 The investigators will separately consent and administer a brief assessment battery to parents to assess their knowledge and attitudes around substance use, as well as opinions and attitudes regarding other health and risk behaviors.

 Trial of a Novel Brief Intervention on Health Behaviors for Youth With Chronic Medical Conditions@highlight

The primary goal of this project is to develop a tailored screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) model for youth with chronic medical conditions (YCMC) for delivery at point of care during a routine healthcare visit, through conducting a rigorous randomized control trial among adolescent patients with type 1 diabetes (TID) or rheumatologic conditions.

 The secondary goal is to assess the attitudes and knowledge of parents of these same adolescents, to explore links between parent beliefs and adolescent behavior around substance use.
