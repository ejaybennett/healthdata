(fifthQuint)Sugammadex vs.

 Placebo to Prevent Residual Neuromuscular Block in the Post--Anesthesia Care Unit.

 The Investigators plan to enroll 300 patients undergoing surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation will be recruited and consent will be obtained.

 The subjects will be randomized preoperatively to receive in the OR following the procedure and prior to extubation either sugammadex (Group 1, n=150 patients) or placebo (Group 2, n=150 patients).

 In all patients, intraoperative surgical and anesthetic management will follow the usual clinical routine at the two enrolling institutions.

 Once surgery is finished, emergence from anesthesia will occur as per usual clinical routine until the clinician determines that the patient is ready for tracheal extubation.

 Once the decision to extubate the trachea is made, the patient will receive intravenously either sugammadex 2 mg/kg or placebo in a blinded manner.

 The patient's trachea will be then extubated, and postoperative anesthetic care will proceed as per usual routine.

 Patients will then be transferred to the PACU for postoperative care and recovery.

 (This methodology will ensure that all 300 patients will receive at least the current standard of clinical care.

 Of the 300 patients, 50% of them (n=150 patients) may benefit from the administration of sugammadex, which may decrease the incidence of residual neuromuscular block.

) 1.

 The ExSpiron will be placed on the patients' chest prior to extubation.

 ExSpiron data will be collected starting prior to tracheal extubation, during transport from OR to PACU, and in PACU.

 2.

 Patient care staff will be blinded to the ExSpiron numerical and trending data for MV, TV and RR, but the respiratory trace will be displayed to demonstrate that the ExSpiron is functioning.

 Of note, the gain on the trace is variable so the size of the breath visualized on the screen is not correlated to the volume of the breath.

 This will maintain blinding of the patient care staff.

 3.

 TOF Monitoring with an objective monitor (TOF--Watch or StimPod) will be used in all patients once the decision to extubate the patients' trachea is made.

 The monitoring will continue in the PACU until full recovery (TOF=1.

0) is documented.

 Monitoring will be performed as per usual clinical routine via surface ECG electrodes.

 In the PACU, the current amplitude will be decreased to 30---40 mA, current intensities that are used routinely for patient care in other centers and that do not result in patient discomfort.

 4.

 Patient care staff will be blinded to TOF data.

 Only the investigator assigned to the PACU data retrieval will know the results of TOF Monitoring.

 5.

 Patient care should follow standard hospital protocol.

 6.

 Physiologic monitoring and clinical assessment data will be recorded as per standard protocol in the PACU.

 7.

 All other therapies and medications including oxygen, CPAP, opioids and sedatives will be delivered in accordance with standard of care.

 8.

 Doses and times of all medications (such as opioids, sedatives, etc.

) or respiratory interventions (such as albuterol, respiratory treatment, suctioning, high flow oxygen, CPAP, BiPAP, etc.

) will be recorded throughout the entire perioperative period (pre---op, OR, PACU).

 9.

 Pain scores based on a standard analog scale (1---10) will be recorded.

 These will be obtained per standard clinical practice.

 10.

 Arterial or venous blood gas values and Chest x---rays taken in the OR or PACU will be recorded when obtained as part of standard care.

 B.

 Study Procedures 1.

 Screening and Recruitment: Study personnel will review the surgery schedule to identify appropriate and eligible patients.

 Eligible patients will be informed about the study and the study will be explained to them or their parent, guardian or legal representative.

 They will be able to ask questions.

 If they would like to participate, written informed consent will be obtained.

 2.

 Randomization: Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: administration of sugammadex (n=150) vs.

 placebo (n=150) prior to tracheal extubation in the OR.

 3.

 Prior to Procedure (in the OR or preoperative area): I.

 For RVM monitoring, ExSpiron PadSet will be placed on the patient's thorax (see Appendix A for placement instructions).

 Deviations from standard placement will be documented.

 Once in the OR the ExSpiron will be connected and the ExSpiron will be synchronized to the ventilator.

 ii.

 For TOF monitoring, skin ECG electrodes will be placed along the ulnar nerve on the volar forearm, as per routine clinical protocol.

 Visual or tactile intraoperative monitoring of neuromuscular block level will be performed according to the clinicians' usual routine.

 At the end of surgery, once the clinician has determined that recovery of neuromuscular block is adequate for maintenance of spontaneous ventilation, the TOF will be determined objectively (it will be measured with the currently available monitor, TOF---Watch or StimPod), and then the patient's trachea will be extubated, as per usual clinical routine.

 In 150 of the 300 patients, a dose of sugammadex (2 mg/kg) will be administered, and then routine TOF measurements will be made in the PACU.

 8.

 Assessment of Subject Safety and Data Safety Monitoring Plan: All patients will be followed by one of the study investigators to ensure there are no complications associated with sugammadex administration (flushing, tachycardia, hypotension, etc).

 There are no expected complications of RVM monitoring.

 There are no expected complications associated with TOF monitoring, and in fact, such monitoring has been shown to improve patient safety by decreasing postoperative CREs and other complications.

 Sugammadex vs.

 Placebo to Prevent Residual Neuromuscular Block in the Post--Anesthesia Care Unit@highlight

The Primary objective of this study is to determine whether patients who receive sugammadex immediately after tracheal extubation will exhibit a decrease in the incidence of postoperative residual paralysis and an associated decrease in the incidence of postoperative respiratory depression (which can precede critical respiratory events, CRE).

 The Secondary objectives are to: a) determine whether patients receiving sugammadex will have a normal TOF ratio (>0.

90) indicative of full neuromuscular recovery in the PACU; and b) to improve patient safety by documenting whether postoperative respiratory depression (decreased MV below 80% and 40% of predicted MV as assessed by a Respiratory Volume Monitor) is due to opioid administration vs.

 postoperative residual neuromuscular block (by comparing postoperative VAS scores and total opioid administered).
