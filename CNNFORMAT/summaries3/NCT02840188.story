(thirdQuint)Young Goalkeeper's Fracture: Radiographic Findings.

 Distal forearm or radius fractures in young goalkeepers have been named "the young goalkeeper's fracture" in the literature.

 While catching the soccer ball the child suffers a distal forearm fracture due to axial forces to the immature bone of the child.

 These goalkeeper's fractures on radiographs may be subtle or difficult to discriminate from normal radiographs.

 Retrospective study for the evaluation of radiographs of the forearm from 2005 - 2016 of children with history of catching a ball.

 Two radiologist are blinded for history, age, name and findings on final reports.

 First reading without measurement of distal tilt angle, second reading with measurement of distal tilt angle and after consensus meeting.

 Questionnaire: prospectively all patients with goalkeeper's fracture will answer a questionnaire concerning circumstances and risks during the accident.

 Young Goalkeeper's Fracture: Radiographic Findings@highlight

The aim of this project is to evaluate retrospectively goalkeeper's fractures in children using the children fracture classification and to evaluate the distal radius tilt angle of the growth plate on plain radiographs of the forearm.

 Patients positive for goalkeeper's fracture will prospectively answer a questionnaire concerning risk factors and circumstances during the injury.
