(firstQuint)Implantation of the Venus P-Valve in the Pulmonic Position in Patients With Native Outflow Tracts.

 This study evaluates the implantation of the Venus P-Valve cent for the treatment of patients with an incompetent pulmonic valve, which causes blood to flow back from the pulmonary artery into the right heart ventricle during pumping of the heart (pulmonary regurgitation).

 Patients with and without narrowing (stenosis) of the right ventricular outflow tract will be included.

 The purpose of this protocol is to assess the safety and performance of Venus P-Valve cent implantation.

 Post-procedure, a clinical visit will be scheduled at 30 days, 6 month, 12 months, and annually thereafter to 3 years.

 Population: Patients12 years with a body weight of 30kg, with significant pulmonary regurgitation (3+) with or without right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stenosis (mean Doppler gradient 35mmHg) with native right ventricular outflow tracts.
