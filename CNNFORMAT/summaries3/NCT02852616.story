(fifthQuint)Trajectories of Psychopathology in Response to NET.

 Participants will be recruited through the Center of Excellence for Psychotraumatology, University of Konstanz, with focus on refugees.

 All of them (approx.

 100) will receive a structured interview and a detailed diagnosis.

 The interview includes questions about sociodemography, traumatic events, PTSD and depression symptomatology.

 Individuals with a PTSD diagnosis (up to 30) will be offered a Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET).

 Irrespective of treatment and diagnosis, respondents are asked to participate in monthly telephone interviews assessing trauma-related and emotional distress and changes in life.

 Interviews assessing PTSD, depression symptoms and emotional distress will be conducted 6 and 12 months after the initial interview.

 In addition, participants receiving NET will rate their PTSD symptoms and functionality prior to each therapy session.

 Trajectories of Psychopathology in Response to NET@highlight

Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) has been proven to be effective in the treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and trauma-related depression in more than a dozen controlled clinical trials.

 Symptom reduction was greatest during long-term follow-ups after the completion of the therapy.

 In the current study, we will investigate the progression of PTSD symptoms and emotional stress before, during and after therapy.

 After a semi-structured interview all participants will be asked to report in monthly telephone interviews their core symptoms.

 Structured interviews after 6 and 12 months are used to validate the outcome.

 A convenience sample of individuals with a PTSD will be offered participation in the study.
