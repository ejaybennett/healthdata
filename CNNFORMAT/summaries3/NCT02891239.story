(thirdQuint)785nm Picosecond Laser for Treatment of Benign Pigmented Lesions.

 This study is a prospective clinical study to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the PicoWay device for benign pigmented lesion treatment.

 Up to a total of 60 healthy candidates, who are seeking treatment/clearance of benign pigmented lesions, will be enrolled at up to 3 participating study sites.

 Subjects will receive up to eight (8) PicoWay treatments at 115 (6-16) week's intervals.

 Prior to each consecutive treatment, the investigator will decide, based on degree of clearance assessment, should the subject undergo additional treatment or proceed to the 8-weeks follow-up (FU) visit with no more treatments.
