(secondQuint)A Study of AbGn-107 in Patients With Gastric, Colorectal, or Pancreatic Cancer.

 AbGn-107 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) which targets an antigen (AG7 antigen) present in gastric, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer.

 This study is a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design with cohort expansion.

 AbGn-107 will be administered every 28 days in patients with chemo-refractory locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic gastric, colorectal or pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

 The primary objectives of this study are to define the safety profile and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, the immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy.
