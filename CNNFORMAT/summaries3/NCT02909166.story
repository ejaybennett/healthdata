(firstQuint)Role of ALiskiren, a Direct Renin Inhibitor, in Preventing Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With a Pacemaker; RALF.

.

 The aim of the study is to find out the effect of a direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, in reduction of AF with patients who have a pacemaker due to sinus node disease and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

 Hypothesis is that there is a possibility to reduce atrial remodeling due to AF and also to enhance atrial reverse remodeling with aliskiren.

 The effect of aliskiren to total AF burden will be evaluated from the pacemaker's memory storage.

 The main purpose of the study is to find new and safe drug treatments targeting to reduce AF recurrences and related complications in pacemaker patients.

 Also the aim is to evaluate the feasibility of a modern and highly sophisticated pacemaker system in the evaluation of drug treatment with AF reduction.
