(secondQuint)The Effect of a Low Glycemic Load Diet on Hormonal Markers Associated With Acne.

 The objectives of this randomized controlled trial are to investigate the impact of a low glycemic index/load eating plan on endocrine aspects of acne.

 Specifically, this study will examine changes in blood biochemical markers of acne among adults with acne following a modified carbohydrate (low glycemic index/load) eating plan or their usual eating plan for two weeks.

 An external sponsor, Nutrisystem(R), will provide some low glycemic index/load foods to the study participants randomized to the intervention group for two weeks.

 Study outcomes include changes in glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, insulin-like growth factor-1, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 concentrations.
