(fifthQuint)Acupuncture for Women With Stable Angina.

 The investigators are conducting a pilot study aimed at gathering feasibility, acceptability, and effect size data for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effect of acupuncture on anginal symptoms in women.

 The investigators long term goal is pain and symptom management resulting in improved functional status and quality of life for women with stable angina.

 This study will include 26 community dwelling women with a medically confirmed diagnosis of stable angina, whose pain and associated symptoms have not been completely controlled with guideline-directed medical management.

 The investigators will use a randomized attention control design with 13 women assigned to initial acupuncture and 13 to control.

 Participants in the experimental group will receive a standardized acupuncture point prescription two treatments per week, for 5 weeks.

 The attention control group will receive non-pain related video health education over 5 weeks equal to the approximate 10 hours of treatment for the acupuncture group.

This pilot study aims to determine if it is possible to perform acupuncture on women diagnosed with stable angina who have symptoms.

 The investigators want to determine if acupuncture reduces the pain and other symptoms of angina.

 The investigators also want to examine whether this study is acceptable to the participants, and by carrying out this study the investigators will be able to tell how many participants they will need in a future larger study to further test acupuncture to reduce the symptoms of angina in women.
