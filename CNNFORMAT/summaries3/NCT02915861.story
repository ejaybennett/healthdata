(fifthQuint)Eschar Investigations in Scrub Typhus.

 Scrub typhus patients will be recruited into the scrub typhus patient (EXP) arm of the study.

 There will be 3 sub-groups: - EXPa (n=12) will have blood and non-invasive eschar samples collected (consent to study, declined biopsy).

 - EXPb (n=12) will have blood, non-invasive eschar samples, and an eschar biopsy collected (consent to study, draining lymph node (LN) inaccessible).

 - EXPc (n=12) will have blood, non-invasive eschar samples, eschar biopsy, and LN FNA collected (consent to study, draining LN accessible).

 Samples will be collected at baseline (all) and 2 weeks (blood only).

 Control participants will be recruited into the scrub typhus control.

 - EXC (n=12) are healthy individuals, attending hospital for elective/minor surgery or treatment of minor skin injury, and normally reside in a scrub typhus endemic region.

 Blood and a skin sample will be collected at baseline only.

 Eschar Investigations in Scrub Typhus@highlight

This is an observational study of patients with scrub typhus (rapid diagnostic test/quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RDT/qPCR) positive) and an inoculation eschar present on examination, recruited from Chiangrai Prachanukroh Hospital, North of Thailand.

 In this study, we aim to: - Investigate relevant pathogen dissemination dynamics, early innate immune response, and pathogen-host interactions in scrub typhus using a minimal set of easily accessible samples; the inoculation eschar (crust or biopsy), whole blood and - where possible - a lymph node fine-needle aspiration (FNA).

 - Determine the potential use of the inoculation eschar for improving early diagnostics and assessing the diversity of human pathogenic strains; by evaluating non-invasive swabs and scrapings, as well as biopsies for molecular diagnostics templates.

 - Dissect the underlying patho-biology associated with the inoculation eschar and in a subgroup, including the draining lymph node; by defining the spectrum of infected cells via microscopy and double-immune labeling; by determining cytokine and RNA gene expression profiles in blood peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) and eschar samples.
