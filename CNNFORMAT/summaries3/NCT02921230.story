(secondQuint)Trial Comparing ELUVIA Versus Bare Metal Stent in Treatment of Superficial Femoral and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery.

 The EMINENT study is a prospective, multi-center study confirming the superior effectiveness of the ELUVIA stent versus Self-Expanding Bare Nitinol Stents in the treatment of lesions 30-140 mm long located in the femoropopliteal arteries in subjects with symptoms classified as Rutherford categories 2-4.

 The study is a 2:1 randomized (ELUVIA vs Self-Expanding Bare Nitinol Stents), controlled, single-blind, superiority trial (RCT).

 The objective of the study is to confirm the superior effectiveness of the ELUVIA Drug-Eluting Vascular Stent System (ELUVIA Stent) for treating Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery (PPA) lesions up to 140 mm in length when compared against bare metal stents, and collect additional data including health economics data.
