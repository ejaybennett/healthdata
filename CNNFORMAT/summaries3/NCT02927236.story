(fifthQuint)Theta-Burst Stimulation as a Treatment for Reducing Cocaine Use.

 Objectives: Illicit drug use affects tens of millions of Americans and costs nearly $200 billion annually in health care costs and lost productivity.

 Cocaine dependence accounts for 25% of reported lifetime drug dependence though few successfully abstain with treatment.

 For efforts toward positive long-term outcomes, it is imperative to identify risk factors of poor outcomes, specialized treatments, neural mechanisms that change with treatment, and predictive measures of treatment outcomes.

 Substance abusers are known to have dysregulation in cue reactivity, reward processing, executive control, and intrinsic network connectivity.

 Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has proven effective at reducing drug craving in nicotine, alcohol, and cocaine users.

 Here, intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), a type a NIBS, delivered to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is implemented to modulate substance abuse related circuit dysregulations and assess effectiveness of iTBS in promoting abstinence.

 Study population: Recruitment from the Baltimore, Maryland area will take place for this protocol.

 For the Pilot, 20 cocaine dependent (CD) individuals will be recruited.

 For the Clinical Trial, 50 healthy adults (HC) and 100 CD individuals will be recruited.

 All of the HC group will receive both active- and sham-iTBS in a within-subject crossover design.

 Half of the CD group will receive active-iTBS and half will receive sham-iTBS.

 The Clinical Trial groups will be matched on demographic measures (e.

g.

, age, IQ, sex).

 Design: The Pilot is designed to be a tolerability pilot where iTBS parameters are assessed in CD participants.

 The first half of the Pilot participants will be inpatient (for initial close observations) and the second half will be outpatient (closely reflecting the clinical trial).

 Throughout the Pilot, clinical measures will be collected and participants closely monitored.

 The general outline for the Clinical Trial is to characterize the treatment cohort (vs.

 HC) and assess effectiveness of iTBS over the left dlPFC in reducing cocaine use.

 The iTBS intervention consists of 30 sessions over a 2-week (10 treatment days) period as an add-on to a treatment-as-usual, contingency management.

 Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, neural measures of cue reactivity, reward processing, executive control, intrinsic network connectivity along with cardiac measures will be collected to identify differences between CD and HC participants at baseline.

 In CD participants, neural and cardiac measure along with cocaine use will be tracked longitudinally to assess changes with treatment.

 Contingency management will continue for 13 weeks and a 3-month follow-up will be scheduled.

 The Clinical Trial includes 39 visits.

 Outcome parameters: Two main comparisons are of interest.

 First, baseline differences in neural and cardiac measures between CD and HC participants will be identified.

 CD participants are expected to show dysregulations in these functions, relative to HC participants.

 Second, neural plasticity related to these functions due to iTBS treatment and reduction in cocaine use will be measured.

 The active-iTBS intervention is expected to be effective in reducing cocaine use, relative to the sham-iTBS intervention.

 Normalization of circuit dysregulation is hypothesized to be associated with reduction of cocaine use.

 Overall, the current protocol is designed to test whether iTBS to left dlPFC is efficacious in reducing cocaine use.

 Theta-Burst Stimulation as a Treatment for Reducing Cocaine Use@highlight

Background: More effective treatments for people with cocaine use disorder are needed.

 Researchers want to understand the parts of the brain involved in the disorder.

 Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) stimulates parts of the brain.

 A form of TMS called intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) may help reduce cocaine use.

 Researchers want to learn how the brain might change with treatment.

 Objectives: To test if iTBS can reduce cocaine use.

 Also, to learn how cocaine changes the heart and the brain.

 Eligibility: Healthy, right-handed adults ages 18-60 who do or do not have cocaine use disorder.

 Design: Participants will be screened with: - Questionnaires - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood and urine tests - Alcohol breath tests In the pilot study, 10 participants with cocaine use disorder will have 10 treatment days over 2 weeks.

 Half will be inpatient and half will be outpatient.

 They will have 2 follow-up visits.

 Treatment includes: - iTBS: A coil is placed on the head.

 A brief electrical current passes through the coil.

 They view cocaine-related images during each session.

 Sessions are videotaped.

 - Repeat of screening tests - In the main study, participants will be randomly assigned to have either real or fake iTBS.

 - Participants with cocaine use disorder will join an incentive program to quit.

 - Participants will have 39 visits over 6 months.

 These include: - Repeat of screening tests - MRIs at 5 visits: Participants lie on a table that slides into a cylinder that takes pictures of the brain.

 They respond to images while in the scanner.

 - iTBS at 10 visits (5 days a week for 2 weeks) Participants will be contacted throughout the study to discuss iTBS treatment and drug use.
