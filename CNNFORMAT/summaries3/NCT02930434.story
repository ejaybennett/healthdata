(thirdQuint)Effects of Antarctic Environment on Vitamin D Status and Health Risk Biomarkers of Its Inhabitants.

 The present study consists of an initial cross-sectional evaluation of VD status and specific health biomarkers in inhabitants of Chilean Antarctica, followed by a randomized controlled trial evaluating two acceptable approaches of vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol 600 IU daily vs.

 25000 IU weekly) in Antarctic inhabitants.
