(firstQuint)Unravel MGUS (Monoclonal Gammopathy of Unknown Significance).

 Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) is a common haematological condition.

 It is characterised by proliferation of a B lymphocyte clone and it's associated antibody (paraprotein).

 In most cases there are no clinical symptoms, however, in a small number of individuals there may be an interaction of the paraprotein with a molecule expressed by the body (self antigen).

 This can have effects on the normal function of this molecule and/or cause disease.

 The study aims to investigate the functional consequences of paraprotein production in MGUS.
