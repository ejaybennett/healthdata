(fifthQuint)Dialogue Around Respiratory Illness Treatment.

 Antibiotic prescribing for childhood ARTIs, including acute otitis media (AOM), sinusitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory infection (URI), and pharyngitis is common in the United States.

 An estimated 31.

7 million visits for respiratory conditions result in antibiotic prescriptions annually, accounting for >70% of outpatient visits during which antibiotics are prescribed to children.

 Current national levels of antibiotic prescribing for ARTIs appear excessive given the estimated prevalence of these infections caused by bacterial pathogens in children.

 While a number of studies in the early 2000's indicated that inappropriate antibiotic prescribing may have peaked in the 1990's these declining prescribing rates were primarily driven by decreased rates of office visits for ARTIs and decreased prescribing for cases where antibiotics are rarely needed (i.

e.

, acute nasopharyngitis, laryngitis, URI, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, and influenza).

 For patients presenting with presumed bacterial ARTIs (i.

e.

, AOM, sinusitis, Group A Streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis, and non-viral pneumonia), overall prescribing rates remained stable during the decade spanning 1995 to 2006 while second-line antibiotic prescribing increased.

 This has occurred despite the recent development of treatment guidelines outlining first- and second-line alternative treatments for bacterial ARTIs.

 Between 1995 and 2006, prescription rates of azithromycin (a second-line agent) for ARTIs increased almost 9-fold for children 5 years-old, azithromycin and fluoroquinolone prescription rates increased approximately 6- and 5-fold, respectively.

 During this same time period, use of amoxicillin, the first-line agent for most ARTIs, decreased by 37% for children 5 years-old with ARTIs.

 Furthermore, it is widely accepted that episodes of bronchitis and URI in children are caused by viral pathogens and that antibiotic treatment does not alter the course of those diseases or prevent future bacterial infections.

 Overuse of antibiotics for such conditions contributes to increased resistance among many strains of bacteria that commonly cause ARTIs, posing risks at both the individual and community levels.

 The large number of annual visits for pediatric ARTIs and the frequency of antibiotic prescribing during those visits make ARTIs an important target for efforts to reduce antibiotic overuse.

 Dialogue Around Respiratory Illness Treatment@highlight

Unwarranted use of antibiotics for pediatric acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) and use of second-line, broad spectrum antibiotics for bacterial ARTIs has contributed to the rapid development of resistance in many strains of bacteria.

 Provider-parent communication during pediatric visits for ARTIs strongly influence antibiotic prescribing rates.

 The overall goal of this study is to develop and test a distance learning quality improvement (QI) program called Dialogue Around Respiratory Illness Treatment - DART.

 The DART program aims to improve provider communication practices and treatment decisions during pediatric ARTI visits, with the ultimate goal being to decrease rates of antibiotic prescribing for these illnesses in children.
