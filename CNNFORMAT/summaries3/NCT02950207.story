(secondQuint)Prospective Observational Study of Antitumor Activity Correlation Between Hormonal Therapy and Expression miRNA100.

 The potential role of miRNAs will be studied as a predictor of hormone sensitivity in hormone-positive breast carcinomas.

 The miRNA100 obtained on biopsy will be compared with the expression levels of those obtained from the surgically removed tumor, in order to assess the possible modulation of miRNA100 following hormonal treatment.

Mono-centric, observational, prospective study, designed for pts with diagnosis of hormone-positive breast cancer to evaluate the correlation between the response to hormonal treatment indicated by the reduction of the level of Ki67 and miRNA100 in two groups of patients
