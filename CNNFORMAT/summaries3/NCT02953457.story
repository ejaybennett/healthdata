(fifthQuint)Olaparib, Durvalumab, and Tremelimumab in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Cancer With BRCA1 or BRCA2 Mutation.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the safety and toxicity of the combination of PARP inhibitor olaparib with anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab and anti-CTLA4 antibody tremelimumab.

 (Phase I) II.

 To assess the impact of the combination of olaparib with durvalumab and tremelimumab on progression free survival (PFS) rates.

 (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the impact of the combination of olaparib with durvalumab and tremelimumab on anti-tumor immune responses in patients with recurrent platinum sensitive or resistant or refractory epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who carry a germline and/or somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and/or a homologous recombination deficiency (HRD).

 II.

 To assess the impact of the combination of olaparib with durvalumab and tremelimumab on PFS and overall survival (OS) in patients with recurrent platinum sensitive or resistant or refractory epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who carry a germline and/or somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and/or a HRD.

 OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of olaparib followed by a phase II study.

 Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID), and tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on day 1.

 Treatment with olaparib continues for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Treatment with tremelimumab repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses and treatment with durvalumab repeats every 4 weeks for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, and every 2 months thereafter.

 Olaparib, Durvalumab, and Tremelimumab in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Cancer With BRCA1 or BRCA2 Mutation@highlight

This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of olaparib when give together with durvalumab and tremelimumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic mutation that has come back or has not responded to treatment.

 Drugs, such as olaparib, may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and kill tumors cells with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, may help stimulate the immune system in different ways to attack and stop tumor cells from growing.

 Giving olaparib with durvalumab and tremelimumab may work better in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.
