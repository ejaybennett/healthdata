(fifthQuint)High Flow Nasal Cannulae Oxygen Therapy in Respiratory Insufficiency Patients.

 1.

 To confirm HFNC used in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency oxygen therapy than the general nasal catheter oxygen and the difference between what better.

 2.

 We set up a point of research in the tertiary hospitals, secondary hospitals and primary hospitals to explore the different levels of HFNC in the application of the efficacy of the hospital there are differences and what is better.

 To further clarify the promotion of HFNC to secondary hospitals and primary hospitals have no meaning.

 3.

 Patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency who required long-term oxygen therapy were randomized to a randomized, controlled, multicentre clinical trial of HFNC with nasal oxygen therapy.

 Analysis and comparison of HFNC and general nasal catheter oxygen in the treatment of chronic respiratory insufficiency there is no difference, HFNC in different grades of hospital use is consistent.

 4.

 Research methods: 4.

1 Subjects: Chronic respiratory insufficiency required long-term oxygen therapy to Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital and multi-center hospital patients.

 4.

2 Study sample size: 100 samples were collected from each of the three test centers.

 Of which 150 cases of nasal oxygen therapy, HFNC 150 cases.

 High Flow Nasal Cannulae Oxygen Therapy in Respiratory Insufficiency Patients@highlight

Chronic respiratory insufficiency in patients with advanced disease to the late treatment depends mainly on mechanical ventilation and other high intensity respiratory support therapy.

 Strengthen the stability of chronic respiratory insufficiency intervention can reduce the frequency and extent of acute disease, saving medical resources.

High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), as a new non-invasive oxygen therapy system, has gradually become a weapon of respiratory support therapy.

 There is little research on the role of HFNC in oxygen therapy for chronic respiratory insufficiency.

 Our previous studies have found the potential value of HFNC in chronic respiratory insufficiency.

 The aim of this project is to promote the use of HFNC in the t reatment of chronic respiratory insufficiency in HFRS in Shanghai first, second and third grade hospitals in an effort to confirm that HFNC can improve the prognosis of patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency compared with nasal oxygen therapy.
