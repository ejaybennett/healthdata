(secondQuint)Peginterferon Alfa-2b Treatment in HBeAg(+) Chronic Hepatitis b Patients Based on Interferon Gene Mutation and Receptor Detection.

 Patients with e antigen positive chronic hepatitis b were enrolled in the study.

 Age, sex, symptoms (e.

g.

, fever, fatigue, poor appetite, jaundice) were recorded in the study.

 We also observed the laboratory test results including the levels of white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), platelet (PLT), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA; detection of gene mutation (IFNA2 p.

Ala120Thr), levels of interferon receptor (IFNAR2).

 Peginterferon Alfa-2b Treatment in HBeAg(+) Chronic Hepatitis b Patients Based on Interferon Gene Mutation and Receptor Detection@highlight

The study is to observe the anti-HBV therapeutic effects of peginterferon alfa-2b in chronic hepatitis b patients with e antigen positive based on the detection of interferon gene mutation (IFNA2 p.

Ala120Thr) and interferon receptor (IFNAR2) detection.
