(fifthQuint)Concurrent Dabrafenib and Trametinib With Sterotactic Radiation in Patients With BRAF Mutation-Positive Malignant Melanoma and Brain Metastases.

 The purpose of this study is to find out the effects of giving dabrafenib in combination with trametinib continuously with stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS) has on melanoma and brain metastases.

 Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) is a non-surgical radiation therapy used to treat tumours of the brain.

 It can deliver precisely targeted radiation.

 Currently SRS alone is the usual treatment for patients with up to 4 brain lesions.

 This study will include 2 groups 1) patients with 1-4 brain lesions treated with SRS concurrently with dabrafenib and trametinib and 2) patients with 5-10 brain lesions treated with SRS concurrently with dabrafenib and trametinib.

Dabrafenib and trametinib are drugs that are usually given for the treatment of melanoma.

 Combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib have also been studied and when used together have shown to increase tumour shrinkage in animals compared to either drug alone.

 Dabrafenib and trametinib have also shown potential to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier when given together and have an effect on brain metastases.

 Giving these drugs at the same time and then giving brain stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may also be preferred in patients with brain metastases
