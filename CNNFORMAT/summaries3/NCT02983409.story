(thirdQuint)Analysis the Relationship Between the Abdomen CT and Outcomes in Acute Urinary Stone Patients.

 Gennerally, non-contrast abdominal computerized tomography is a choice of diagnosis for a ureter stone patient.

There was no known well of efficacy of CT for predicting the outcomes in ureter stone patient in ED.

 Hypothesis of this study are some findings of non-contrast CT may be helpful to predict the clinical outcomes of pain severity (multidose of painkiller), admission and revisit to ED within 5 days after discharge.

 Investigators analyzed multiple variables including age, sex, initial clinical findings, and various CT findings to assess their association with outcomes; multidose of painkiller in ED, admission at ED and revisit to ED within 5 days.

 Analysis the Relationship Between the Abdomen CT and Outcomes in Acute Urinary Stone Patients@highlight

This is an observational study based on retrospectively collected data of ureter stone patients between 2011 and 2014.

 Aim of study is to determine radiologic findings of non-contrast abdominal computerized tomography as predicting clinical outcomes of suspect ureter stone patients in emergency department (ED).
