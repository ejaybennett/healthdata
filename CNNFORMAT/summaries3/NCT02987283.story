(secondQuint)Evaluating Accuracy of Breath Sound Recordings and STOP-Bang Screening For Obstructive Sleep Apnea While Awake.

 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a breathing disorder with numerous health effects including a greater risk of peri-operative anesthetic complications.

 Numerous screening tools exist but are not without limitations.

 Diagnostic overnight sleep studies are resource-intensive and difficult to obtain in the short time period between pre-operative clinic assessment and the day of surgery.

 This project aims to test the diagnostic performance of a new screening technology, Awake-OSA, for screening of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

 "Awake-OSA" uses a small external microphone placed on the neck, to record and analyze tracheal breath sounds at the bedside while the patient is awake.

 Using polysomnography (PSG) as a gold standard, the investigators will compare Awake-OSA (breath sound recording) and the STOP-Bang screening questionnaire in their ability to accurately identify patients with OSA, as well as classify OSA in terms of severity.

 Early, point-of-care diagnosis has the potential to provide a low-cost, convenient alternative to traditional screening questionnaires and enable more selective use of PSG.

 Our goal is to improve peri-operative patient safety while improving use of resources and streamlining patient care.

The investigators will perform a diagnostic accuracy study comparing tracheal breath sound recordings in awake individuals to the STOP-Bang screening questionnaire, using the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) score determined by polysomnography as the gold standard.
