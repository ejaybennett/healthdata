(secondQuint)Ketamine vs Hydromorphone.

 The study will be a head to head observational study of patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery.

 The methods of intraoperative anesthesiology will be Ketamine or Narcotic.

 Both are FDA approved methods of delivering anesthesia.

 The amount of narcotics a patient receives is part of the medical record post-operatively will be followed from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) through to discharge.

 The amount of narcotics needed to control the patient's pain (converted to morphine equivalent units) and pain scores (a hospital standard measure) will be collected for 48 hours for the study, or until discharge, whichever occurs sooner.

 The conversion to a morphine equivalent unit allows investigators to compare different narcotics the patient may receive in a more standardized way.

 The results will be analyzed and compared between the two groups.

 Ketamine vs Hydromorphone@highlight

This study will help to determine if investigators can minimize narcotic use in laparoscopic gastric bypass patients while maintaining adequate pain control.

 This will allow investigators to minimize the negative side effects of narcotics which is a goal in this population.
