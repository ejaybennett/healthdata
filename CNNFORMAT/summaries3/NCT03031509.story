(firstQuint)Treatment of Nonunion of Limb Fracture With Human Amniotic Epithelial CellshAECs.

 In this study, patients of nonunion after limb fracture will be treated with human amniotic epithelial cells.

 Clinical and radiological assessment is performed.

 hAECs developing from the epiblast as early as 8 days after fertilization, recent data reported indicate that hAECs possess proper osteogenic differentiation potential and a localized modulatory influence on the early tissue remodeling process, making these cells a promising stem cell source for bone regeneration after fractures.
