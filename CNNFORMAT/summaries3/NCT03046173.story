(secondQuint)Concentrated Growth Factors Applied in Maxillary Sinus Floor Elevation Via a Lateral Window Approach.

 Maxillary sinus floor elevation via a lateral window approach is the most effective method of overcoming the shortage of bone mass deficiency in atrophic maxillary posterior region.

 Bone transplantation is considered to be a prerequisite for the success of maxillary sinus floor elevation.

 Platelet-rich plasma and platelet-rich fibrin have been used to accelerate bone formation, regeneration, and repair.

 However, few in-depth studies are reported on the effects of concentrated growth factors on new bone formation.
