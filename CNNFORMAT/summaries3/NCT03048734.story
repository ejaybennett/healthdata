(fifthQuint)Nocturnal Hypertension and Nocturia in African American Men.

 AIMS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF PILOT DATA Determine: 1.

 The feasibility of Southern California registry as an effective measure to recruit African American men to participate in a new research program.

 2.

 If men will comply with the study procedures including Actigraphy and ambulatory blood pressure monitors.

 3.

 The within subject coefficient of variation for repeated measures of nocturnal blood pressure by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, vertical activity at night by Actigraphy monitors.

 4.

 Whether the ambulatory Blood pressure itself affects the sleep pattern on Actigraphy.

 5.

 Nocturnal systolic blood pressure and nocturnal vertical activity are higher in men with self-reported nocturia 2 at night than in men with no reported nocturia.

 Purpose: Obtain key pilot data to show feasibility and document the reproducibility of the proposed measurements.

 Nocturnal Hypertension and Nocturia in African American Men@highlight

This study to obtain pilot data on Nocturnal Hypertension and Nocturia.

 In Dr.

 Victor's current NIH grant (Cut Your Pressure Too: The LA Barbershop Blood Pressure Study) the results show that uncontrolled systolic hypertension is independent determinantal of nocturia in African American men.

 We now went to pursue this correlation by designing a new NIH grant Proposal to determine whether replacing short acting with long acting drugs and dosing them at bed time rather than in the morning will: A.

 Lower the systolic Blood pressure during sleep B.

 Improve Nocturia and results in better sleep quality.

 The results suggest that short acting hydrochlorothiazide may contribute to nocturia in some patients.
