(secondQuint)Prostatic Artery Embolization (PAE) for Treatment of Signs and Symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Using Bead Block Microspheres.

 This pilot study will be a single center, open labeled, non-randomized feasibility study to evaluate the initial safety of PAE for the treatment of symptomatic bladder outlet obstruction.

 30 adult male subjects will be enrolled in this study.

 If eligible patients will undergo the prostate artery embolization procedure in the Interventional Radiology department.

 An angiogram of the prostate arteries will be done.

 Small beads called Bead Block microspheres will be injected into the prostate artery to slow blood flow to the prostate in the hope of providing relief with minimal side effects and complications, for lower urinary tract symptoms caused by BPH.

 After the procedure the patient will be followed at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post procedure.
