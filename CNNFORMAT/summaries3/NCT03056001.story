(secondQuint)Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Doxorubicin and Pembrolizumab for Sarcoma.

 The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and toxicity profile of doxorubicin and pembrolizumab in previously treated or untreated subjects with unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.

 The secondary objectives are to assess overall survival, and response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival (PFS) with this regimen using RECIST 1.

1 criteria.

 The exploratory objectives are to assess PFS, overall response rate, duration of response, and disease control rate using the immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) criteria, evaluate the correlation between PD-L1 expression levels and antitumor activity of MK-3475, investigate other biomarkers that may correlate with tumor responses, and evaluate differences in tumor tissue characteristics in biopsies taken during or post-treatment with MK-3475 versus baseline.
