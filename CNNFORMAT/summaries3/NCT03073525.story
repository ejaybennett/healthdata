(secondQuint)Trial of Atezolizumab and Vigil for Advanced Gynecological Cancers (A Companion Study to CL-PTL-119).

 This is a randomized, open label intra-patient crossover study of Vigil, the checkpoint inhibitor Atezolizumab and the combination of the two agents, in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, or other gynecological cancers (i.

e.

, cervical, uterine).

 Eligible patients will be randomized to receive two cycles of Vigil alone or two cycles of atezolizumab alone, followed by combination treatment with the two agents.

 This study is intended as a companion study to protocol CL-PTL-119, A Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Phase 3 trial of Vigil Engineered Autologous Tumor Cell Immunotherapy in Subjects with Stage IIIb-IV Ovarian Cancer in Clinical Complete Response following Surgery and Primary Chemotherapy, otherwise known as the VITAL study.

 Patients who have tumor harvested at surgery and Vigil successfully manufactured, but then are ineligible for randomization onto the VITAL study or previously randomized to placebo, will be offered the opportunity to participate in this protocol.

 Subjects enrolled will either be: cent Patients with recurrent disease, undergoing a standard surgical procedure (e.

g.

 surgical debulking, palliative resection, malignant ascites or others) will have tumor procured for manufacture of Vigil.

 OR - Patients with ovarian cancer who failed to meet the eligibility criteria for Protocol CL-PTL-119 because of failure to achieve a complete clinical response following primary debulking surgery and standard paclitaxel/carboplatin therapy, OR - Patients who fail to meet the eligibility criteria for Protocol CL-PTL-119 because of a histologic diagnosis of another gynecological cancer (i.

e.

, cervical, uterine) and not ovarian cancer.

 OR cent Patients who were randomized on Protocol CL-PTL 119 and were subsequently unblinded at recurrence and were assigned to the placebo arm.
