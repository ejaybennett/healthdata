(thirdQuint)Utilizing Protein During Weight Loss to Impact Physical Function.

 The study will use a 3-group design in 225 obese (BMI 30-45 kg/m2), older (65-79 years) men and women at risk for disability (SPPB 10) who will undergo a 6-month weight loss intervention followed by a 12-month follow-up phase to test the overall hypothesis that a higher protein (1.

2 g/kg body wt/d) / lower carbohydrate (CHO) diet during a 6-month weight loss intervention improves physical function compared with an isocaloric lower protein (the current Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), 0.

8 g/kg body wt/d) / higher CHO diet, and whether continuing a higher protein / lower CHO diet for 12-months following weight loss will result in better maintenance of improved physical function.

 All participants will undergo a 6-month weight loss intervention involving caloric restriction and supervised exercise followed by 12 months of follow-up with randomization to one of three groups (n=75/group): 1) Lower protein / higher CHO diet for the 6-month weight loss phase only (RecProt); 2) Higher protein / lower CHO diet for the 6-month weight loss phase only (6-mo HiProt); or 3) Higher protein / lower CHO diet for the 6-month weight loss and 12-month follow-up phases (18-mo HiProt).

 Physical function (primary aim) will be assessed by the expanded Short Physical Performance Battery (primary outcome) and lower extremity muscle strength and power at baseline, 6-, 12- and 18-months.

 Weight loss maintenance and body composition (secondary aim) will be assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT) at baseline, 6- and 18-months.

 Bone mineral density (DXA) and cardiometabolic risk factors will also be measured at baseline, 6- and 18-months.

 Utilizing Protein During Weight Loss to Impact Physical Function@highlight

This study will evaluate the effects of diet composition (i.

e.

, amount of protein and carbohydrate) during a 6-month weight loss intervention and 12-months of follow-up on physical function, muscle mass, and weight loss maintenance in obese older adults.

 Participants will receive either a protein or carbohydrate supplement along with a behavioral weight loss intervention.
