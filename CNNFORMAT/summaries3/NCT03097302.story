(firstQuint)Tomographic Analysis of Anterior, Posterior, Total Corneal Refractive Power Changes After Laser-assisted Keratotomy.

 This study investigated patients' eyes with low to moderate total corneal refractive power determined with Scheimpflug tomography (Pentacam HR) after penetrating femtosecond laser-assisted keratotomy (pFLAK) and laser lens surgery.

 The anterior corneal astigmatism, posterior corneal astigmatism and total corneal refractive power were determined before, 1 month and 3 months after lens surgery.

 Vector analysis according to the Alpins' method was used to calculate surgically induced astigmatism (SIA).
