(thirdQuint)Preoxygenation Optimisation in Obese Patients.

 This study will be designed as followed : Patients will be randomized in 2 groups : - Preoxygenation during 4 minutes with High Flow Nasal Cannula (60l/min FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) = 1) before orotracheal intubation after crash induction.

 The device will be maintained in place throughout the intubation procedure in order to achieve apnoeic oxygenation.

 - Or Preoxygenation during 4 minutes with Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) with Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) + 10 cm H2O and Inspiratory Airway Positive Airway Pressure (IPAP) + 25, meaning a 15cm H2O pressure support.

 The facial mask with be removed after before crash induction enabling laryngoscopic vision.

 Preoxygenation Optimisation in Obese Patients@highlight

Oro-tracheal intubation in operating room in obese patients with BMI > 35kg/m2 remains a critical event.

 The aim of this study is to determine whether Nasal High Flow Therapy by nasal cannula Optiflow(R) is more efficient than the BIPAP preoxygenation before orotracheal intubation after crash induction in obese patients
