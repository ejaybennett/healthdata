 Efficacy of the CO-OP Approach With Brazilian Children With Developmental Coordination Disorder@highlight

Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) have difficulties performing daily activities which reflects negatively on participation, impacting their lives.

 To date, there are a number of interventions to improve performance of these children on activities they want or need to.

 In Brazil, there is little research on the efficacy of such approaches.

 Our main objective was to start a set of studies to examine the effects of the Cognitive Orientation to Daily Occupational Performance Approach (CO-OP Approach) protocol on occupational performance and satisfaction of Brazilian children who have DCD; to examine whether children were able to transfer strategies and skills learned during CO-OP to untrained goals.
