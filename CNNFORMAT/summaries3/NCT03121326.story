(secondQuint)The Study of Sarcopenia and Aging Biomarkers by the Metabolomics.

 Metabolomics is the emerging platform technology to address the complexity of a living system.

 In translational research, metabolomics approaches may enable the detection of multiple disease risk factors and interactions, disease progression, and response of patients to a particular therapy with or without side effects.

 Metabolomics may provide comprehensive information and improve diagnosis and prognosis which are particularly promising in human complex degenerative diseases.

 The investigators use Metabolomics to explore the biomarkers of the sarcopenia and aging of the senior adults.
