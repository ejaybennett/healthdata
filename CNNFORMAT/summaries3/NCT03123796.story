(secondQuint)Effects of Proton Pump Inhibitors on Kidney Transplant Recipients.

 Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is frequent among renal transplant recipients due to the common use of glucocorticoids in immunosuppresive regimens after transplantation.

 Reduced kidney functions and hypomagnesemia with the use of PPIs have been reported in various patient populations.

 However, few studies examined the effects of PPIs on kidney transplant recipients.

 Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of PPI and/or histamine H2 receptor antagonist use on serum magnesium levels, allograft functions and survival in kidney transplant recipients.
