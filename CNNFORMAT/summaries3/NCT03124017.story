(thirdQuint)Electronic Alert System for Improving Thromboprophylaxis in Hospitalized Medical Patients.

 The use of thromboprophylaxis among acutely ill hospitalized medical patients remains inconsistent.

 The present study aims to improve the use of appropriate thromboprophylaxis by implementing a computer-based alert system combined with a Geneva Risk Score calculation tool in the electronic patient chart and order entry system.

 Consecutive acutely ill medical patients without indication for therapeutic anticoagulation or ongoing therapeutic anticoagulant treatment admitted to the medical wards of the University Hospital Bern, Switzerland, will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the alert group in which an alert and the Geneva Risk Score calculation tool will be issued in the electronic patient chart or to the control group in which no alert will be issued.

 The primary endpoint is the rate of appropriate thromboprophylaxis during hospital stay.

The investigators aim to investigate whether a computer-based alert system in the electronic patient chart and order entry system using the Geneva Risk Score as clinical decision support tool to estimate the risk of venous thromboembolism improves the rate of appropriate thromboprophylaxis among hospitalized medical patients.
