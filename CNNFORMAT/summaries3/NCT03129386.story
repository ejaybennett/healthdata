(firstQuint)Defining the Normal Range for Maximal Sniff Diaphragm Thickening Fraction.

 Diaphragm dysfunction is associated with poor clinical outcomes in critically ill patients but is difficult to diagnose.

 Traditionally, diaphragm function is measured by evaluating inspiratory muscle strength via maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP).

 However, this technique relies on a volitional maximal effort and can be challenging for patients to perform.

 An alternative to measuring inspiratory muscle strength is the sniff inspiratory pressure approach.

 During short, sharp sniffs, the diaphragm is maximally activated.

 Currently, there are no reported values of the normal range of maximal diaphragm thickness during a sniff maneuver.

 This study will define the normal range of values for sniff maximal diaphragm thickening fraction, maximal thickening against an occluded airway, and diaphragm thickening during resting tidal breathing in healthy subjects.

This study is investigating the normal range of maximal diaphragm thickness during a sniff inspiratory manoeuvre using ultrasound in healthy subjects stratified by age and gender.
