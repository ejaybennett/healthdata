(fifthQuint)Resistance Exercise in Woman With Primary Sjrgen Syndrome.

.

 Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease that affects the exocrine glands and less frequently the internal organs, presenting intense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration mainly in the epithelium of the involved tissues, leading to the destruction and loss of the secretory function.

 SS can manifest itself in isolation, without association with other diseases, in this situation it is called Primary Sjogren's Syndrome (PSS), being considered the second most common autoimmune rheumatic disease, prevalent in women (9: 1).

 The inflammatory process can affect any organ, resulting in a generally severe clinical condition, and may involve the musculoskeletal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, hematological, vascular, dermatological, renal and neurological systems, leading to an evident decline of the physical functions with decrease in aerobic capacity, muscular strength, joint mobility and static balance, as well as psychological and social deficit.

 Patients with PSS also present a marked physiological characteristic with a high level of fatigue.

 Thus, resistance exercise becomes a non-drug strategy, aiming to improve musculoskeletal fitness, allowing the execution of daily activities with more independence, autonomy and safety, while influencing the patient's functional fitness.

 The aim of the present study is to analyze the effectiveness of resistance exercise in daily motor behavior and functional fitness in women with Primary Sjogren's Syndrome.

 After the use of actigraphy for 15 days, equipment that measures the level of daily physical activity, and evaluation of functional fitness, volunteers underwent a supervised resistance exercise program for 16 weeks.

 The following muscular clusters were exerted: latissimus dorsi, deltoid, pectoralis major , triceps brachialis, biceps brachialis, quadriceps, hamstring, thigh adductor muscles, thigh abductor muscles and gastrocnemius.

 The subjects performed in each exercise 3 sets of 10 maximum repetitions.

 The training sessions were held twice a week.

@highlight

To analyze the effectiveness of 16-week resistance exercise in daily motor behavior and functional fitness in women with Primary Sjogren's Syndrome.

 The present study presents as hypothesis that a supervised resistance exercise program is effective and safe in improving the functional fitness and quality of life of patients with Primary Sjogren's Syndrome, making them more physically active, contributing positively to the capacity to perform daily life activities as household and / or professional tasks.
