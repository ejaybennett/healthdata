 Mechanisms of Anxiety and Depression Study@highlight

Eligible participants will come in for three separate visits in which they will be interviewed, perform a variety of tasks, and undergo a non-invasive MRI scan.

 The investigators anticipate that (1) participants with anxiety and depression will likely perform differently than the healthy controls on cognitive tasks, (2) participants with anxiety and depression will likely show differences in brain functionality compared to the healthy controls, and (3) depression and anxiety likely share some underlying mechanisms.
