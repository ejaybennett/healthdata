(fifthQuint)Apatinib Combined With Paclitaxol as Second Line Therapy for Advanced Gastric Cancer.

.

 Gastric cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and most patients are diagnozed at advanced stage in China.

 Peritoneal metastasis is the most common metastatic site.

 For gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis, chemotherapy can bring survival benefit versus best sportive care.

 Paclitaxol is the standard second line chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer patients.

 Apatinib mesylate is a small-molecule vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

 It has been approved as third-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma in China.

 This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib combined with paclitaxol versus placebo combined with paclitaxol in advanced gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma patients with peritoneal metastasis.
