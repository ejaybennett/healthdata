(fifthQuint)Comparison of Propofol and Sevoflurane as Maintaining Anesthetics During General Anesthesia of Cesarean Section.

 General anaesthesia is mostly performed for emergency grade 1 caesarean section and due to a lack of time to apply a neuraxial anaesthesia technique.

 Rapid sequence induction using propofol and rocuronium should become the standard for general anaesthesia in the obstetric patient.

 Both sevoflurane and propofol are considered to be appropriate for the maintenance of general anaesthesia during caesarean section.

 However, effects of these two anesthetics on maternal and fetal outcomes after caesarean section haven't been compared directly in the past.

 And for most anaesthesiologists, the clinical experience with general anaesthesia for caesarean section is very low.

 This study is to compare the effects of sevoflurane and propofol as maintenance of general anesthesia.

 Comparison of Propofol and Sevoflurane as Maintaining Anesthetics During General Anesthesia of Cesarean Section@highlight

Sevoflurane and propofol are the most popular drug choices for maintenance of general anaesthesia for caesarean section.

 However, effects of these two anesthetics on maternal and fetal outcomes after caesarean section haven't been compared directly.

 The aim of this study is to compare the effects of sevoflurane and propofol as maintenance of general anesthesia, and to try to determine which anesthetic is better for maternal and fetal outcomes after caesarean section.
