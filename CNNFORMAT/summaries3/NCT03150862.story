(secondQuint)A Study Assessing BGB-290 With Radiation and/or Temozolomide (TMZ) in Subjects With Newly Diagnosed or Recurrent Glioblastoma.

 An open-label, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of BGB-290 in combination with radiation therapy (RT) and/or TMZ with 2 arms and a potential third arm.

 In dose escalation/Phase 1b, BGB-290 will be combined with RT (Arm A) or RT and TMZ (Arm B) in subjects with newly diagnosed unmethylated glioblastoma (GB), or BGB-290 will be combined with TMZ in subjects with methylated or unmethylated recurrent/refractory GB (Arm C).

 The dose expansion/Phase 2 phase will enroll up to 4 cohorts: subjects with newly diagnosed unmethylated GB in Arm A and Arm B, and 2 potential cohorts of subjects with unmethylated and methylated recurrent/refractory GB in Arm C.

 Subjects in dose expansion may continue treatment in the absence of safety concerns and disease progression.
