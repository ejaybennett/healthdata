(firstQuint)A Study to Measure the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) and Ultraviolet-A Protection Factor (UVAPF) of Four Developmental Sunscreen Formulations.

 This study consist of two steps.

 Step 1: determination of the SPF of the test products which will be performed as a single-center, randomized, evaluator blind, intra-individual comparison, no treatment and positive controlled clinical study as per ISO24444:2010.

 And Step 2: determination of the UVAPF of the test products which will be performed as a single center, open-label, negative and positive controlled technical test as per ISO24443:2012 (using test plates for assessing UV transmittance of four developmental sunscreens).
