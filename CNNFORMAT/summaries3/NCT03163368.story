(thirdQuint)Dose Escalation Trial of Neoadjuvant Radiosurgery for the Treatment of Metastatic Brain Tumors.

 Radiosurgery is a non-surgical radiation therapy that can deliver targeted radiation to small brain tumors.

 Radiosurgery is considered to be part of standard of care.

 Typically for standard of care, radiosurgery is given after a patient has healed from neurosurgery, in an attempt to destroy any cancer cells that may be left after surgery.

 Patients who agree to participate in this research study will receive radiosurgery before their neurosurgery.

 The timing of radiosurgery (pre-operatively) and the dosing to determine the safest dose is considered experimental.

 By giving radiation the typical way, after surgery, a larger area of the brain must be covered, which means healthy brain tissue also receives radiation, whereas radiation before surgery will specifically target the tumor.

 Dose Escalation Trial of Neoadjuvant Radiosurgery for the Treatment of Metastatic Brain Tumors@highlight

The purpose of this study is to study if giving radiation to a brain tumor (a procedure called radiosurgery) before neurosurgery (surgery to remove the tumor) will help to keep brain tissue healthy, while possibly eliminating the need to return for radiation once a patient has healed from neurosurgery.

 This study will also seek the best radiation dose on a brain tumor based on how well the radiation therapy works and asses the side-effects.
