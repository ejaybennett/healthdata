(firstQuint)Different Lugol's Solution Concentration for Image Quality of Esophageal Lesions in Chromoendoscopy With Iodine Staining.

 Chromoendoscopy using Lugol's solution is effective for the detection of early esophageal squamous neoplasia.

 However, this modality may cause severe chest pain and discomfort owing to mucosal irritation.

 This study was to test whether a lower concentration of Lugol's solution can provide satisfied image quality of early esophageal squamous neoplasia and has lower mucosal irritation.
