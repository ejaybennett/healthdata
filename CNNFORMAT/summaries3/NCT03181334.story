(fifthQuint)The C-SPAN Coalition: Colorectal Cancer Screening and Navigation.

 Several coalition partners will be involved in identification of eligible patients.

 They include the Dallas Fort Worth Hospital Coalition Foundation (DFW-HCF), John Peter Smith (JPS) Health Network, the University of Texas Southwestern, Moncrief Cancer Institute (UTSW-MCI), and other hospitals and providers identified by UTSW-MCI outreach personnel.

 A preliminary aggregate report from all coalition databases suggests 900,000 patients may be identified for screening evaluation.

 Data compilation and management will be centralized at UTSW-MCI using administrative claims data to assess screening rates while individually identifying patients not up-to-date with screening.

 Using a tiered approach, multiple data sources will be queried to identify all 50-74 year olds residing within the service area who are potentially eligible for program inclusion.

 Data sources will include: 1.

 The existing database of JPS patients who are part of a previous CRC screening study (STU 082012-086) 2.

 The Moncrief Cancer Institute Breast Screening and Patient Navigation (BSPAN) program database 3.

 UT Southwestern electronic medical record system (EPIC) 4.

 DFW-HCF patient discharge database The majority of patients will be identified by the DFW Hospital Coalition Foundation.

 Moncrief Cancer Institute will be accessing data from DFW-HCF through a Secure File Transfer Protocol which facilitates data access and data transfer over a Secure Shell data stream.

 Patient datasets provided by other hospitals, outpatient facilities and providers in the C-SPAN program area will be obtained through data use agreements.

 Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be applied prior to data transfer.

 All such datasets will be transferred through secure, data encrypted transfer systems data encrypted universal serial bus (USB) drives.

 Data required for inviting patients to screening and follow-up provided by coalition partners will be imported into the study tracking database.

 The tracking database facilitates the day to day program activities and associated data collection, maintaining work lists of patients who have been mailed fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kits and are due for a follow up phone reminder to complete and return the test.

 The database also accepts updated patient results, such as FIT and colonoscopy test results.

 Procedures: The screening outreach team will be responsible for sending out all invitation letters, tracking results, and facilitating follow up for patients with normal and abnormal FIT tests.

 Included with the invitation letter, will be a FIT kit, containing a 1-sample Polymedco OC Sensor FIT, simplified English/Spanish instructions on performing the test, educational information about CRC screening and a return mailer with prepaid postage.

 Completing the test will not require any dietary or medication restrictions for the patient.

 Screen eligible individuals will be randomized to 1 of 5 study arms across 3 conditions and mailed the appropriate screening invitation letter as described below.

 1.

 Condition 1 (Pure Control): - Letter I: Participants assigned to the control condition will receive a FIT kit and the standard invitation letter to participate in free screening.

 2.

 Condition 2 (Time Guideline): - Letter II: Participants will receive a FIT kit and invitation letter to participate in free screening with a request that they complete the test and mail back within 1-week.

 - Letter III: Participants will receive a FIT kit and invitation letter to participate in free screening with a request that they complete the test and mail back within 3-weeks.

 3.

 Condition 3 (Time Guideline + Incentive): - Letter IV: Participants will receive a FIT kit and invitation letter to participate in free screening requesting that they complete the test and mail back within 1-week for a "higher" monetary incentive or within 3 weeks for a "lower" (half of the higher) monetary incentive.

 - Letter V: Participants will receive a FIT kit and invitation letter to participate in free screening requesting that they complete the test and mail back within 1-week for a "higher" (same as lower in Branch IV) or within 3 weeks for a "lower" (half of the higher) monetary incentive.

 Patients invited to participate in screening will receive automated telephone calls at the time of invitation.

 "Live" reminder phone calls will begin at three weeks post invitation for those patients not yet returning a test kit.

 Bilingual (English/Spanish) program staff will use standardized scripts when completing these calls.

 Patients receiving a normal test result will receive a personal letter confirming this with invitations to complete a repeat screening in subsequent year(s).

 Patients receiving an abnormal FIT result will be navigated to complete a diagnostic colonoscopy with an in-county coalition partner.

 These patients will be contacted by the screening team to be scheduled for pre-operative appointment, after which the patient will then be scheduled for a colonoscopy.

 The study team's goal will be to schedule and complete colonoscopies within 8 weeks of the abnormal FIT result.

 All results and recommendations will also be communicated with both the patient and primary care provider via mail within one week of receiving the result.

 Patients identified with colorectal cancer will be navigated to a treatment consultation visit with a surgical or medical oncology clinic, if the diagnosing colonoscopist has not already scheduled this follow-up appointment.

 The study team's goal will be for patients to be scheduled for this first consultation visit within one week of the CRC diagnosis.

 Patients will receive reminder phone calls for these visits at both five days and two days prior to the scheduled appointment.

 Navigation for consultation and colonoscopy will be centralized at UTSW-MCI, however, patients requiring diagnostic and treatment procedures will be scheduled within their county of residence whenever possible.

 The C-SPAN Coalition: Colorectal Cancer Screening and Navigation@highlight

Participants will be mailed an invitation to complete CRC screening along with a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kit, containing a 1-sample "Polymedco Over the Counter (OC) Sensor FIT", simplified English/Spanish instructions on performing the test, educational information about colorectal cancer screening and a return mailer with prepaid postage.

 Processes that will be used to promote screening completion include automated and "live" phone call reminders to encourage completion of FIT testing.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 5 study arms across 3 conditions, described below: 1.

 Condition 1 (Pure Control): - Branch I: Participants assigned to the control condition will receive a FIT kit and the standard invitation letter to participate in free screening.

 2.

 Condition 2 (Time Restriction): - Branch II: Participants will receive a FIT kit and invitation letter to participate in free screening with a 1-week time restriction.

 - Branch III: Participants will receive a FIT kit and invitation letter to participate in free screening with a 3-week time restriction.

 3.

 Condition 3 (Time Restriction + Incentive): - Branch IV: Participants will receive a FIT kit and invitation letter to participate in free screening requesting they return the kit within 1-week for a "higher" monetary incentive or within 3 weeks for a "lower" (half of the higher) monetary incentive.

 - Branch V: Participants will receive a FIT kit and invitation letter to participate in free screening requesting they return the kit within 1-week for a "higher" (same as lower in Branch IV) monetary incentive or within 3 weeks for a "lower" (half of the higher) monetary incentive.

 Participants with a normal test result will receive a personal letter confirming this with invitations to complete a repeat screening in subsequent year(s).

 Participants receiving an abnormal FIT result will be navigated to complete a diagnostic colonoscopy.

 Participants continuing in the screening program in subsequent years will receive letters emphasizing the importance of repeat screening to prevent adverse CRC outcomes.
