(firstQuint)Predictive Impact of MMP2 and MMP9 Levels for Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer Treated With Anti-angiogenic Agents.

 The objective is to analyze the predictive impact of circulating MMP2 and MMP9 on the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic kidney cancer treated with anti-angiogenic agents (Sunitinib or Pazopanib) in comparison with two untreated cohorts (localized or oligometastatic cancer).

 Prospective monocenter, open-label study In the frame of disease management blood samples will be collected at different times of follow-up regarding disease status (localized, oligometastatic and metastatic) and tissue samples will be collected for patients scheduled for surgery.
