(fifthQuint)Evaluation of a New Organization for Collecting Pre-chemotherapy Session Information.

 Compare the two arms of the study in terms of: A.

 each element contributing to the primary criterium; B.

 the quality of chemotherapy related care; C.

 logistics; D.

 patient satisfaction with respect to support for chemotherapy care; E.

 the feasibility and acceptability of the organization by patients will be assessed by the rate of optimal use of toxicity collection tools and patient satisfaction rates relative to the tool (experimental arm) F.

 Comparison of the overall cost of care in both arms and estimated cost of the strategy.

 Evaluation of a New Organization for Collecting Pre-chemotherapy Session Information@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to compare an experimental organization for chemotherapy session planning based on early, standardized, and prioritized means of data transmission via secure e-mail (laboratory results) and the use of a smart phone (for clinical toxicity data) compared to the regular organization, in terms of the rate of prescriptions of chemotherapy prepared at the latest the day before a session and then administered in full (over a 6-month observation period) among colorectal cancer patients in need of cancer treatment in an outpatient setting.
