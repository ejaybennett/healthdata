(secondQuint)Novel Meal Service Improves Nutritional Intake.

 The investigators performed a quasi experimental study at medical (Gastroenterology) and surgical (Gynecology, Urology, Orthopedics) wards.

 Patients were offered TMS (July 2015 - May 2016; n=326) or FfC meal service (after stepwise introduction per ward from January 2016 - December 2016; n=311).

 Primary outcome was the mean percentage of protein and energy intake relative to requirements, between patients receiving TMS and those receiving FfC, on the first and fourth day of full oral intake.

 Patient satisfaction comprised rating of the experienced quality of the food and the meal service and by means of a validated questionnaire.
