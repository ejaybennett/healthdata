(firstQuint)Glucose Metabolism in Different PCOS Phenotypes.

 In detail an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted in women with the PCOS defined by the Rotterdam and the NIH-criteria, as well as in healthy control subjects.

 In addition 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Imaging was used for the assessment of the ectopic lipid content in the liver, heart and skeletal muscle.

 The aim of the present study was to compare the glucose metabolism and the ectopic lipid conent in the liver, heart and muscle between women with the PCOS defined by the NIH-criteria, Rotterdam-criteria and healthy control subjects.
