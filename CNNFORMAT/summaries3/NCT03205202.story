(fifthQuint)Cataract and AMD in a Trial of a Multivitamin and Cocoa Extract.

 COSMOS-Eye is an ancillary study of cataract and AMD utilizing resources and data from the COcoa-Supplement and Multivitamins Outcomes Study (COSMOS), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial of a high-quality cocoa extract supplement (Mars Symbioscience) and Centrum Silver multivitamin (Pfizer) in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among 12,000 women aged 65 years and 6,000 men aged 60 years.

 Women will be recruited among active Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Extension Study participants, and men will be recruited among non-randomized respondents to the VITamin D and OmegA-3 Trial (VITAL).

 Women who responded but were not randomized into VITAL will also be included as well as other women and men who express interest in research being conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

 Participants will take three pills each day: two capsules that contain either cocoa extract or cocoa extract placebo, and one tablet that contains either multivitamin or multivitamin placebo.

 Participants will receive their study pills in convenient calendar packs via U.

S.

 mail.

 Participants also will be asked to complete short mailed questionnaires each year.

 The questionnaires ask about health; lifestyle habits, such as diet, physical activity, and smoking; use of medications and dietary supplements; family history of illness and new medical diagnoses including cataract and AMD.

 Participants who report cataract or AMD will be asked to provide contact information for their eye doctor(s) as well as written consent to obtain the medical records.

 Eye doctors will be contacted by mail and asked to complete a cataract (or AMD) questionnaire or, alternatively, forward a complete copy of the patient's medical records pertaining to the diagnosis.

 Cataract and AMD in a Trial of a Multivitamin and Cocoa Extract@highlight

COSMOS-Eye is an ancillary study of the COcoa-Supplement and Multivitamins Outcomes Study (COSMOS; NCT02422745).

 COSMOS is a randomized clinical trial of cocoa extract supplement (containing a total of 600 mg/d flavanols, including 80 mg (-)-epicatechins), and a standard multivitamin supplement to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer among men aged 60 years and older and women aged 65 years and older.

 This ancillary study is being conducted among participants in COSMOS and will examine whether the cocoa extract supplement or the multivitamin supplement reduces the risk of cataract and AMD, two leading causes of visual impairment in US men and women.
