(firstQuint)Efficacy of the Canabrava/s Pupil Expansion Device in Cataract Surgery With Small Pupils: The First 30 Cases.

 In this consecutive case series, 30 eyes of 29 patients underwent cataract surgery using a new disposable small-pupil expansion device, Canabrava's Ring (AJL Ophthalmic, Spain).

 It is the first iris expansion ring produced with indents that do not align with each other in the superior and inferior regions, resulting in a small vertical length (0.

4mm) that minimizes risk of endothelial contact.

 All eyes had poorly preoperatively dilated pupils of less than 5mm.

 Fifteen eyes had significant infective or traumatic pathology preoperatively.

 Vertical and horizontal pupil diameters were evaluated pre-, intra- and 1 month postoperatively, and were used to calculate pupil circumference.

 Intraoperative and postoperative pupil circumference comprised the primary outcomes of interest.
