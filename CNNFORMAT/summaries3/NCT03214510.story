(fifthQuint)Trial of Thoracic Epidural Analgesia Versus Four-Quadrant Transversus Abdominus Plane Block in Oncologic Open Liver Surgery.

 Study Groups: If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups.

 This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

 You will have an equal chance of being in either group.

 - If you are in Group 1, you will receive transversus abdominus plane block.

 - If you are in Group 2, you will receive epidural pain management.

 Length of Study Participation: Researchers want to provide the best pain control possible.

 If at any time you are having intolerable side effects or if the medication is not working, the pain medication or epidural insertion will be switched to other methods.

 Your participation in the pain medication part of the study will be over after Day 6, or at the time of discharge from the hospital if sooner than Day 6.

 Your participation in the recovery questionnaire part of the study will be over after Month 6.

 Group 1: For the transversus abdominus plane block, after anesthesia is started and you are asleep, a long-acting (2-3 day) local anesthetic medicine will be injected in 4 areas of your belly wall to numb the nerves that supply the area of your incision/wound.

 Ultrasound imaging will be used to safely direct the injections to the proper location.

 After surgery, your doctor will monitor your pain levels and will give you additional oral and intravenous (IV) drugs as needed to keep you comfortable.

 You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

 Group 2: Epidural pain management will be given through a catheter (small tube) inserted into the space between the covering of your spinal cord and the cord itself.

 This catheter is passed into the epidural space through a small needle.

 This area is full of fluid and is called the epidural region.

 The catheter will be placed before your surgery, either in the holding area or in the operating room by the doctor who gives your anesthesia.

 After surgery, your doctor will monitor your pain levels and will give you additional oral drugs and drugs by vein as needed to keep you comfortable.

 You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

 Your blood pressure will be checked as often as the doctor thinks is needed, and you will be closely monitored when you begin to sit up, stand up, and walk after surgery.

 Both Groups: You will sign a separate consent form that explains the surgery and its risks in detail.

 You will also sign a separate consent for the catheter placement.

 After Surgery: After your surgery, you will recover in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU).

 You will have a physical exam to check your recovery.

 Your vital signs will also be measured.

 You will be asked how you are feeling.

 Your doctor(s) will decide whether you will go from the PACU to an overnight recovery suite or will be moved to a regular post-surgical recovery floor room, where your recovery will be watched.

 If you are in Group 2, your epidural will be checked every day to make sure that it is working and that there are no problems with the area around your epidural site.

 A nurse will also check during each shift (about every 8-10 hours) to see how well you are able to move and how the epidural is affecting your feeling in the area it is supposed to be working in.

 In both groups, you will be asked to rate your level of pain on a scale of 0-10.

 When you first come out of surgery, this pain rating will happen about every hour.

 When you get to your room (overnight recovery or surgical floor), it will happen about every 4 hours.

 You can use your call bell to let a nurse know if your pain is intolerable between the nurse's routine checks.

 Questionnaires: Before your surgery, you will fill out questionnaires about pain and your quality of life.

 The surgery team will also check your strength, balance and thinking.

 These questionnaires and tests should take about 15 minutes to complete.

 Every other day after surgery (Day 1 through Day 6), you will also be asked to fill out questionnaires about your recovery and any side effects and symptoms you may be having from the pain medication.

 This will take about 10 minutes each time.

 While you are in the hospital, you will be asked to answer some questions that will measure how quickly you recover from the sedation used during your surgery.

 Each shift (about every 8-10 hours), a nurse will ask you questions to find out how quickly you are recovering from anesthesia.

 After you are discharged from the hospital, when you return for scheduled clinic visits within the first 8 weeks after surgery, researchers will again check your strength, balance and thinking.

 This should take about 10 minutes to complete per visit.

 Participation in this study will not increase the number of postoperative visits that are scheduled.

 Researchers will also ask you to complete questionnaires about your recovery and quality of life every other week for 6 weeks and then monthly for 4 months.

 You will complete these questionnaires for the final time at Month 6.

 These can be done verbally at the time of clinic visits, over the phone, electronically by email, or on a smartphone or computer.

 These will take about 10 minutes each time.

 Trial of Thoracic Epidural Analgesia Versus Four-Quadrant Transversus Abdominus Plane Block in Oncologic Open Liver Surgery@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the quality of recovery for patients who receive different standard pain control treatments after surgery on the liver.

 Researchers want to learn which method helps people to recover more completely and more quickly after surgery.

 The 2 kinds of pain control are epidural pain management and transversus abdominus plane (abdominal) block.

 This is an investigational study.

 Epidural pain management and transversus abdominus plane block are FDA approved and commercially available.

 Comparing the pain management treatments is being done for research purposes.

 Up to 96 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
