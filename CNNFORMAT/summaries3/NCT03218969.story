(thirdQuint)Treatment of Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) Augmentation With Ecopipam, a D1 Specific Antagonist.

 This is a double-blind, exploratory proof of concept, cross-over trial of the D1 antagonist ecopipam for subjects with augmented Restless legs syndrome (RLS).

 Investigators will recruit 10 subjects taking dopamine agonists for RLS who are currently experiencing augmentation.

 The goal is to have 8 completers.

 There is no power analysis as this is an exploratory study and there is no previous data on treatment of augmentation.

 "Meaningful improvement" is not even established.

 A safety analysis will be done after 5 subjects have been enrolled.

 Duration of study and is based mostly on contracted drug availability for this pilot study.

This is an exploratory, double blinded cross-over study of the D1 antagonist ecopipam treat patients currently having dopamine agonist induced augmentation in restless legs syndrome.

 Each arm is 6 weeks composed of an unforced titration up to 100mg/day separated by a 2-week wash-out period.

 Efficacy points will include the IRLS, augmentation scales, sleep scales, clinical impressions and fatigue/mood scales.
