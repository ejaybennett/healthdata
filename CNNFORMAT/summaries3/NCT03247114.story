(secondQuint)fMRI of Hypothalamic Responses to Glucose, Fructose, Sucrose and Sucralose.

 The hypothalamus is known to be important for control of feeding behaviour as well as the regulation of temperature.

 Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive method, which detects transient haemodynamic changes in the brain, using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal differences.

 In order to investigate the role of hypothalamic neural activity in response to different sweeteners, fMRI will be performed before, during and after ingestion of 300 ml plain water or 300 ml water containing 50 g glucose, 50 g fructose, 50 g sucrose or 0.

33 g sucralose (high intensity sweetener not providing energy).

 All beverages will be consumed at 22 C.

 The study uses a randomized cross-over design in 16 healthy male subjects with a normal body weight.

 There will be an interval of at least one week between the five occasions.

 Blood Oxygen Level Dependent signal intensity of the hypothalamus will be continuously measured for 21 minutes (5 minutes baseline, 4 minutes during drinking and 12 minutes after drinking).

The study will consist of five occasions with one week in between.

 BOLD signal intensity of the hypothalamus will be measured using fMRI.

 Measurements will be done before and after drinking 300 ml plain water (reference) or water to which different sweeteners will be added.
