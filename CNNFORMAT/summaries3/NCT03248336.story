(secondQuint)Objective Assessment of Disparity Vergence After Treatment of Symptomatic CI in Children.

 30 participants with normal binocular vision and 30 with CI will be recruited for this prospective study.

 All participants with CI will be treated with 12 weeks of office-based vergence/accommodative therapy.

 The primary outcome measure will be the average peak velocity for 4 symmetrical convergence steps.

 Other objective outcome measures of disparity vergence will be time to peak velocity, latency, and accuracy.

 Changes in clinical measures [near point of convergence (NPC), positive fusional vergence at near (PFV)] and symptoms will be evaluated.

 Objective Assessment of Disparity Vergence After Treatment of Symptomatic CI in Children@highlight

This study is designed to evaluate changes in objective measures of disparity vergence after office-based vergence/accommodative therapy (OBVAT) for convergence insufficiency (CI) in children 12-17 years old.
