(thirdQuint)A Randomized Parallel Study for Simulated Internal Jugular Vein Cannulation Using Simple Needle Guide Device.

 This was a prospective, randomized, parallel trial using phantom simulating internal jugular vein.

 After informed consent all subjects will be randomized to insert needle for internal jugular vein cannulation of phantom using ultrasound approach with or without this device.

 Video camera will record all procedure process and ultrasound image in real time.

 Researchers blinded to the study aim measured outcome variables based on recorded images.

 A Randomized Parallel Study for Simulated Internal Jugular Vein Cannulation Using Simple Needle Guide Device@highlight

Two-dimensional ultrasound guided approach does not guarantee first attempt success on internal jugular vein cannulation.

 New attachable device recently was developed for accurate needle insertion when ultrasound is used.

 Our randomized parallel simulation study will examine whether this device will improve the first attempt success rate when ultrasound guided internal jugular vein catheterization of simulated internal jugular vein.
