(thirdQuint)Laparoscopic Tubal Preservation Surgery.

 All surgically-treated ectopic pregnancies in women aged 20 and above between 01 January 2009 and 31 December 2016 were identified.

 Cases receiving laparoscopic salpingostomy or laparoscopic salpingotomy were extracted from the database, patient characteristics and surgical outcomes (changes of serum-hcg, presence of persistent ectopic pregnancy and subsequent management, subsequent pregnancy) were reviewed from their medical records.

 Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were employed to predict the presence of persistent ectopic pregnancy after laparoscopic tubal preservation surgery.

Traditionally, salpingectomy has been the standard procedure for managing ectopic pregnancy.

 We would like to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic tubal preservation surgery in treating ectopic pregnancies (salpingostomy or salpingotomy) while preserving the fertility outcome of the patients, as well as to identify the factors predicting the presence of persistent ectopic pregnancy after the surgery.
