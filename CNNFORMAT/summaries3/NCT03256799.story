(firstQuint)Evaluation of Ivacaftor in Patients Using Ataluren for Nonsense Mutations.

 In about 10% of patients with CF, the defect in the gene is known as a stop mutation.

 This mutation truncates the cystic fibrosis transductive regulator (CFTR) protein production by introducing a premature stop in the messenger RNA (mRNA), this type of mutation is known as a stop mutation.

 Ataluren is a novel, oral drug that promotes this gene to work effectively and readthrough that premature "stop sign".

 It is hypothesized that ivacaftor may increase the efficacy of ataluren by activating a specific protein that may not be functioning properly.

The purpose of this study is to explore the combination of ataluren and ivacaftor as a treatment for patients with a specific cystic fibrosis mutation
