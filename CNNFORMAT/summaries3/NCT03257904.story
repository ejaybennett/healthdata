(fifthQuint)iNtrAcranial PreSsurE in ICU Intensive Care (ICU) (SynapseICU).

 Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is the most common neuromonitoring modality used in neurocritical care (NCCU) around the world.

 Uncertainties remain around intracranial pressure monitoring both in traumatic and non-traumatic brain injury, and variation in clinical practice of intracranial pressure monitoring monitoring exists between neurocritical care units.

 The objectives of the study will explore intracranial pressure monitoring variation in practice to prioritise uncertainties in the clinical management of critical care patients with acute brain injury and support further collaborative hypotheses-based prospective studies.

 Sample Size: This international prospective observational study aims to recruit >5000 patients in coma after acute traumatic and non-traumatic brain damage admitted to >200 Intensive Care Units.

 Inclusion Criteria: - Acute brain injury (ABI) admitted to ICU following: 1.

 Hemorrhagic stroke, including intracerebral hematoma and subarachnoid haemorrhage, 2.

 Traumatic brain injury (penetrating and non-penetrating).

 - Age >18 years old - Motor score of the Glasgow Coma Scale on admission to ICU <6 Exclusion Criteria: - Acute brain injury due to causes other than the one specified in the inclusion criteria.

 - Age <18 years old - Motor score of the Glasgow Coma Scale on admission to ICU = 6 Outcome measures: Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended at 6 months Endpoint: The primary endpoint of the study is the exploration of the effect size of the variation in clinical practice around intracranial pressure monitoring in acute brain injury patients.

 Screening and recruitment: 12 weeks at each centre.

 Follow-up: outcome measures will be collected at 6 months.

 Duration of study: 2 years.

 The SYNAPSE-ICU study is partly funded by ESICM (ESICM Trials Group Portfolio).
