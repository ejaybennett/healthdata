(fifthQuint)Smart After-Care in Patients With Prostate Cancer.

 After-care is a process targeted towards restoration or maintenance of the physical, mental, intellectual and social abilities of an individual affected by cancer.

 Internet-and mobile-based lifestyle intervention have emerged as potential modalities to complement and increase accessibility to after-care.

 In order to meet the growing need for after-care services, we developed a Smart after-care system that will assess the efficacy of a web-based smartphone-enabled intervention.

 The system provided specialized tools on after-care of prostate cancer including information on nutrition, physical activity, medication adherence, and mobile device that can connect to the smartphone.

 Patients with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy will be screened for having adequate musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary function.

The study design is a randomized controlled trial.

 The patients were randomly assigned to intervention or usual care groups.

 Intervention patients received Smart After-Care management for 3 months.

 Primary endpoint was an increase in patients' physical function as assessed using 2 minute walking test.

 Secondary endpoints included improvement in muscle strength, short physical performance battery, body composition, and health-related quality of life.
