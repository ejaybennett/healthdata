(fifthQuint)Recovery Housing and Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome.

 Aims To conduct a randomized, controlled trial of abstinence-contingent recovery housing delivered with or without intensive day treatment among individuals exiting residential opioid detoxification.

 Design Random assignment to one of three conditions: recovery housing alone (RH), abstinence-contingent recovery housing with reinforcement-based treatment RBT (RH + RBT) or usual care (UC).

 RH and RH + RBT participants received 12 weeks of paid recovery housing contingent upon drug abstinence.

 RH + RBT participants also received 26 weeks of RBT, initiated concurrently with recovery housing.

 Assessments were conducted at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment enrollment.

 Setting Out-patient drug-free substance abuse treatment program in Baltimore, Maryland.

 Participants Patients (n = 243) who completed medication-assisted opioid detoxification.

 Measurements Primary outcome was drug abstinence (opioid- and cocaine-negative urine and no self-reported opioid or cocaine use in the previous 30 days).

 Secondary outcomes included abstinence at all time-points (1, 3 and 6 months), days in recovery housing and employment.

 Recovery Housing and Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome@highlight

Reinforcement-Based Therapy (RBT) is an intensive outpatient substance abuse treatment that includes relapse prevention skills training, goal setting, help with finding employment and abstinence-contingent rent payment for recovery housing in the community.

 It is meant to provide motivation for continued abstinence while enhancing social stability.

 In this study, treatment was offered to inner city opiate and cocaine users immediately following a brief medically-supported residential detoxification.

 Previous research had shown that RBT produces 3- month outcomes superior to those for patients who are referred to outpatient treatment in the community.

 The present study compared outcomes for patients (N = 243) randomly assigned to receive abstinence-contingent recovery housing with (full RBT) or without additional intensive counseling or to receive usual care referral to outpatient treatment following detoxification.

 Outcomes were similar at 3- and 6-month follow-ups for those who received recovery housing with (full RBT) and without additional counseling and both these treatments were superior to usual care referral.

 Study findings support the efficacy of post-detoxification recovery housing with or without counseling for opiate and cocaine users.
