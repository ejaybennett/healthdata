(firstQuint)CDK 4/6 Inhibitor, LEE011 (Ribociclib), in Combination With Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy at Varying Duration for ER-positive Breast Cancer.

 This research study is a Phase II clinical trial.

 Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease.

 "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

 This research study is a Pilot Study of two different doses, which is the first time investigators are examining this study drug at the different dosage, for early breast cancer.

 There is no placebo in this study.

 The FDA (the U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration) has approved ribociclib in combination with aromatase inhibitors as a treatment option for advanced/metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer.

 In this research study, The investigators are comparing the safety and efficacy of ribociclib given at two different doses given on different schedules during a period of 28 days.

 Ribociclib is a drug designed to block certain proteins called cyclin-dependent protein kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6).

 These proteins are needed for cells to divide and may also control the ability of certain cancers to grow.

 The investigators believe that ribociclib may stop the participant cancer cells from growing and dividing by blocking these CDK4/6 proteins.
