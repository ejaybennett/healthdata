(firstQuint)Integrated Coronary Imaging Registry.

 The coronary images of selective angiography and optical coherence tomography with FFR(Fractional Flow Reserve) values of the intermediate lesions (50-70% stenosis) will be prospectively registered.

 The patients with intermediate lesions after CT angiography and invasive coronary angiography will be screened, and optical coherence tomography, FFR and selective CT angiography will be performed.

 The coronary images and FFR values will be registered, and the patients will be followed-up up to 2 years to investigate the adverse clinical events.
