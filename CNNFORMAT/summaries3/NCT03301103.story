(fifthQuint)PTM202 and Modulation of Host Resistance to Diarrheagenic E.

 Coli.

 The APA12/PANTER study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel intervention study of 3 weeks in 72 healthy adults.

 The study will include 2 arms; PTM202 and placebo.

 Subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual pattern of physical activity and their habitual food intake, but to standardize their dietary calcium intake.

 After an overnight fast, subjects will be orally infected with a live, but attenuated, diarrheagenic E.

 coli (strain E1392-75-2A; collection NIZO food research; dose 1E10 CFU (at study day 14).

 At study day 14, 15 and 16 subjects will receive either placebo or PTM202, a dietary formula containing dried bovine colostrum and dried whole egg.

 Before and after the diarrheagenic E.

 coli challenge an online diary will be kept to record information on stool consistency, frequency, severity of symptoms and mediation intake.

 At various time points before and after diarrheagenic E.

 coli challenge stool samples will be collected.

 The main study parameters are Stool consistency (Bristol Stool Scale reported by the subjects in the online diary, and Percentage of fecal wet weight (% determined by freeze-drying).

 Secondary study parameters are: Stool frequency (Stools per day reported by the subjects in the online diary), Total fecal wet weight (fecal weight in g/day), and the incidence and severity of Gastro-intestinal symptoms (Gastro-intestinal Symptom Rating Scale reported by the subjects in the online diary).
