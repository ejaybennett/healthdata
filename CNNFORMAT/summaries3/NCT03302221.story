(firstQuint)Doppler Ultrasonography Assessed Vascular Changes During Anesthesia Induction.

 The investigators designed a study to assess whether there were any blood flow indexes change during anesthesia induction with doppler ultrasonography.

The indexes include Arterial Diameter,Peak Systolic Velocity,End Diastolic Velocity,Resistive Index,Pulsatility Index,Systolic/End Diastolic Ratio,Time AverageMean Velocity and Blood Flow.
