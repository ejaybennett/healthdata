(secondQuint)AZD1775 Continued Access Study to Assess Safety and Tolerability for Patients Enrolled in AZD1775 Clinical Pharmacology Studies.

 This is an open-label, non-randomised study designed to provide continued access to AZD1775 for eligible patients with advanced solid tumours who have previously completed an AZD1775 clinical pharmacology study and to investigate the safety of a once daily monotherapy regimen of AZD1775 in patients with advanced solid tumours.

 All patients who completed 1 of the parent clinical pharmacology studies are eligible for this study after a washout period of at least 4 days (minimum duration defined in the parent study protocol) and meet the eligibility criteria specified in this protocol.

 Patients who discontinue early from the parent study will be considered by the Sponsor and treating physician on a case-by-case basis.

 During the study, patients will continue to receive AZD1775 as long as they are benefiting from treatment in the Investigator's opinion and do not meet any other discontinuation criteria.
