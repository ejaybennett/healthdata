(firstQuint)Evaluation of Long-Term Clinical Acceptability and Satisfaction With the IC-8 Intraocular Lens.

 This will be a prospective, multi-center, non-interventional study in up to 80 patients previously implanted with an IC-8 IOL contralaterally or bilaterally under the protocol ACU-P14-029 at up to nine clinical sites within Europe.

 The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the long-term clinical acceptability and overall satisfaction in patients implanted with the IC-8 IOL.

 The primary study endpoint is binocular target-corrected near visual acuity (TCNVA) of 20/32 or better in 85% or more patients at least 12 months post-implantation.

 The secondary study endpoint is overall satisfaction with postoperative vision in 85% or more patients reporting either satisfied or very satisfied at least 12 months post-implantation.
