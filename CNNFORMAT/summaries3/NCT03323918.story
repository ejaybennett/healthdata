(fifthQuint)ImPACT Intervention for Children With ASD.

 Previous research has shown that parent-implemented interventions are effective in improving the social skills of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

 With the present project we want to investigate the brain activity changes that are at the basis of the changes observed in the children's behaviour.

 More specifically, we will assess the effect of Project ImPACT, a parent-implemented intervention, which teaches parents techniques to stimulate the social-communicative abilities of their children.

 The intervention is suitable for preschoolers with a diagnosis of ASD and consists of 18 sessions of maximum 2 hours each, one session per week, delivered by trained therapists of the home guidance services in Flanders.

 Children with a diagnosis of ASD (or children who are suspected of ASD) between 1,5 and 4 years old and their parents will participate in the study.

 They will be randomly assigned to the ImPACT intervention or treatment as usual.

 We will assess the effect of the intervention on the children's social-communicative abilities, and on the neural and biological correlates of these abilities.

 The families will be invited to come to the Faculty of Psychology and Pedagogical Sciences at three time points: before the start of the intervention, immediately after the end of the intervention (which is expected to last 18 weeks) and 12 weeks after the end of the intervention.

 ImPACT Intervention for Children With ASD@highlight

This randomised-controlled trial will assess the effect of an early intervention on the social-communicative abilities and brain activity of preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

 The childrens social-communicative abilities and the related brain activity will be evaluated at three time points: before the start of the intervention (pre-intervention), immediately after its conclusion (post-intervention) and several weeks after its conclusion (follow-up).
