(fifthQuint)Phase 2a Study to Evaluate PRS-080 in Anemic Chronic Kidney Disease Patients.

 This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose, pilot Phase 2a study in anemic stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients requiring hemodialysis.

 Eligible patients will undergo screening assessments and PRS-080#22-DP will be administered by intravenous infusion.

 The study will consist of 2 dose cohorts of 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg body weight with 6 patients in each cohort.

 Using a standard 4+2 design, 4 patients in each cohort will be randomized to PRS-080#022-DP and 2 patients in each cohort will be randomized to placebo.

 The decision to escalate the dose will be based on an interim analysis of clinical and laboratory safety as well on a comparison with pharmacokinetic data.

 Safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics as well as potential immunogenicity will be investigated.

 Phase 2a Study to Evaluate PRS-080 in Anemic Chronic Kidney Disease Patients@highlight

Anticalin(R) proteins are engineered human proteins that are able to bind specific target molecules.

 The Anticalin PRS-080#022-DP to be investigated in this study is directed against hepcidin and is intended for the treatment of anemia of chronic disease.

 This pilot Phase 2a study shall investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of repeated administrations of PRS-080#022-DP in anemic stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing hemodialysis.
