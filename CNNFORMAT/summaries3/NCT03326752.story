(secondQuint)Phase 1b DV281 With an Anti-PD-1 Inhibitor in NSCLC.

 Pre-clinical studies support the proposed dosing schema to be tested and a potential benefit of the combination of inhaled DV281 with an approved anti-PD-1 inhibitor for subjects with advanced NSCLC.

 This study (DV9-NSC-01) is designed for establishing an immunologically optimal RP2D for inhaled DV281 in combination with an approved anti-PD-1 inhibitor.

 This trial, studying the potential to enhance the efficacy of an approved anti-PD-1 inhibitor in subjects with advanced NSCLC, addresses an unmet need for NSCLC patients having tumors that do not respond or do not respond adequately to anti-PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy.
