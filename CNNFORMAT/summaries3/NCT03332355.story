(thirdQuint)Procaspase Activating Compound-1 (PAC-1) in the Treatment of Advanced Malignancies - Component 2.

 PAC-1 in combination with temozolomide (Component 2): after the MTD is established for single agent PAC-1 in Component 1, a modified-Fibonacci dose-escalation 3+3 design starts in Component 2, at a PAC-1 dose one level lower than the MTD of PAC-1 established in the single agent PAC-1 component (i.

e.

, Component 1) and 150 mg/m2 dose of temozolomide given for the 5 days starting at day 8 of cycle 1 in cohorts of 3-6 patients.

 The combination cohort that reaches MTD will expanded to at least 9 patients, similar to the PAC-1 alone cohort at MTD.

 For all dose cohorts, pharmacokinetics of PAC-1 will be assessed following doses administered on days 1 and 11 of the first cycle.

 Temozolomide pharmacokinetics will be performed on Day 11 of the first cycle.

The primary objectives of this study are to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of PAC-1 in combination with temozolomide in patients with high grade glioma: glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or anaplastic astrocytoma after progression following standard first line therapy (Component 2), by evaluation of toxicity and tolerability.
