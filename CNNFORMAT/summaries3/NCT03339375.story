(firstQuint)The Effect of Esophageal Doppler Guided Goal-directed Hemodynamic Therapy in Severe Trauma Patients.

 Goal directed fluid therapy becomes issue for enhanced recovery after surgery.

 In goal directed therapy, dynamic parameters, like stroke volume and cardiac output, is important.

 Esophageal Doppler is one of device which provides dymanic parameters.

 In severe trauma cases, the effect of goal directed therapy is not known yet.

 So the aim of this study is comparing the results of goal directed therapy using esophageal Doppler and conventional fluid therapy.
