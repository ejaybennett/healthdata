(fifthQuint)Effects of Tai-chi Programme on Mobility of People With Dementia.

 Four community health centres that provide dementia care services were recruited through convenience sampling.

 Each was viewed as one cluster and was randomized to either the Tai-chi or the control group, based on computer-generated random numbers prepared by an independent statistician.

 Participants allocated to the Tai-chi group took part in the 16-week 10-step simplified Tai-chi programme, which was derived from the traditional Yang style and has been proven to be effective in enhancing older people's balance and mobility.

 Each week, the dyads attended two 1-hour sessions of centre-based Tai-chi training and practised at least three 30-minute Tai-chi sessions at home.

 Additional measures targeted cognitively impaired people were implemented to promote engagement, including the adoption of multiple sensory cues, slow and relaxed practice, a dyadic approach, and positive emotional motivation techniques.

 Participants allocated to the control group took part in group recreational activities such as watching movies or listening to music, which was organized by the community centres with similar frequency and duration of the Tai-chi sessions that were organized for the Tai-chi group.

 The control group participants were instructed to continue their usual lifestyles and levels of physical activity.

 Effects of Tai-chi Programme on Mobility of People With Dementia@highlight

This study evaluates the feasibility and the preliminary effects of a simplified 10-step Tai-chi programme (a dyadic approach) on the mobility performance of people with mild to moderate dementia.

 Four community health centres were recruited and each was randomised to either the intervention group (Tai-chi) or the control group.

 Tai-chi group received a 16-week 10-step simplified Tai-chi training programme in which additional measures were implemented to enhance participants' engagement.

 The control group took part in group recreational activities organized by the community centres.

 It was hypothesized that the Tai-chi group would outperform the control group regarding their mobility performance.
