(thirdQuint)Impact of Changes in Muscle Secretome in the Remission of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Induced by Bariatric Surgery.

 Bariatric surgery is recognized as a therapeutic modality of type 2 diabetes.

 The mechanisms of this remission of diabetes remain poorly understood.

 The aim of our research is to characterize the changes in muscle secretome induced by bariatric surgery and to determine their role in improving the insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle and insulin secretion by the B cell responsible for the remission of diabetes.

 This prospective study will be carried out in insulin-resistant diabetic patients or not in whom blood and muscle samples will be carried out before and after bariatric surgery.
