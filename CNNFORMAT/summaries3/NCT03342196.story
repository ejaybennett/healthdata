(fifthQuint)Thiotepa Plus Fludarabine+ Melphalan as the Preparative Regime for Alternative Donor Transplantation.

 Primary Objective: To assess the effectiveness of Thiotepa, Fludarabine, and Melphalan in alternative donor transplants as measured by leukemia free survival.

 Secondary Objective: To assess the 1- year OS, Relapse, TRM, aGVHD and cGVHD rates and the rates of neutrophil and platelet engraftment.

 Study Design This is a Phase II study of Thiotepa, Fludarabine, and Melphalan in alternative donor transplants.

 Subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability (including adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinical/laboratory assessments) using a continuous monitoring approach.

 Subjects will be followed for up to 1 year or until progression of disease, relapse, or death.

 Thiotepa Plus Fludarabine+ Melphalan as the Preparative Regime for Alternative Donor Transplantation@highlight

In the United States, thiotepa has been utilized in reduced intensity conditioning regimens for alternative donor courses (double umbilical cord blood transplant (dUCBT) and haplo-identical transplants).

 The hypothesis is that thiotepa at a dose of 10mg/kg, in combination with melphalan (100mg/m2) and fludarabine (160mg/m2) as a reduced intensity conditioning regimen for alternative donor transplant is safe and effective in patients with hematologic malignancies.

 Given that this regimen has been investigated extensively, and the current study proposes to confirm those previous observations with a small modification (melphalan dose reduction due to previous mucositis rates with higher doses), this will be a phase II study designed to measure disease-free-survival.
