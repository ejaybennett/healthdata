(secondQuint)A Nurse Led Patient Management Programme to Improve Outcomes in Gout.

 There is evidence from other chronic diseases that nurse led care in addition to standard of care ameliorates outcomes.

 In gout the primary target is the serum uric acid level (SUA).

 We intend to demonstrate the superiority of a structured nurse led patient management programme over standard of care in a randomized controlled study.

 The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients reaching the target SUA level at 6 months follow-up.
