(thirdQuint)Participation in Occupations and Perception of Quality of Life, Comparing Adults With and Without PTSD.

 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder has been known to severely impair participation in everyday activities such as work, recreation and social participation.

 In turn, these impairments can diminish quality of life.

 However, the relationship between PTSD, functioning and quality of life remains incompletely understood.

 Since achieving full participation in daily activities is the main goal of occupational therapy, and since quality of life is a primary treatment success measure, it is important to fully understand the relationship between PTSD, participation and quality of life.

 Various studies show that dissociation affects different body functions that manage and monitor mental functioning.

 Since quality of life is a subjective measure that relies on one's ability to mentally represent himself and others it is important to tack into consideration the way that dissociation affects the relationships described above.

 The research contains 4 Questionnaires that will be filed out by the participants and the data from the Questionnaires will be analyzed and compared.
