(fifthQuint)Modular Prevention Bundle for Non-ventilator-associated Hospital-acquired Pneumonia (nvHAP).

 Work package 1 (WP1): Design nvHAP-Bundle The goal is developing a prevention bundle for nvHAP in an interdisciplinary and inter-professional "nvHAP-Bundle Group" consisting of experts in hospital epidemiology, nursing care and physiotherapy.

 The elements of the nvHAP-bundle are chosen based on 1) the existing, although scarce, scientific literature about nvHAP prevention measures and 2) the presumed feasibility and effectiveness of prevention measures.

 Feasibility is evaluated in interviews with involved healthcare providers and is an important dimension for inclusion of the prevention measure in the bundle.

 The bundle will also include assessments to evaluate every patient's need for certain respective prevention measure, if necessary.

 Work package 2 (WP2): Implementation of nvHAP-bundle The implementation strategy will first be "tested" in one pilot-ward (break-through method) as part of the development of the intervention.

 The nvHAP-bundle will be implemented in the 6 departments and their related wards with considerable nvHAP rates.

 As the study takes place in only one hospital with close proximity of wards, the risk of contamination is high.

 Therefore, the investigators plan to employ a stepped wedged study design approach (Figure 1) with sequential randomization of the departments to start the intervention (implementation of nvHAP-bundle).

 This also allows optimal coaching of the implementation during a one-month active implementation phase.

 Participants are all patients of the respective wards attributed to the 10 included departments.

 Work package 3 (WP3): Evaluation of nvHAP-bundle concerning effectiveness to prevent nvHAP - Primary outcome variable: NvHAP rate (nvHAP/patient discharge or death) - Secondary outcome variables: In-hospital mortality rate (death/patient discharge or death) and length of stay NvHAP is defined according to Hospitals in Europe Link for Infection Control through Surveillance/Improving Patient Safety in Europe (HELICS/IPSE) case definition which was adopted also for the European and Swiss point prevalence studies of healthcare associated infections.

14, 15 NvHAP-rate is calculated by Episode of nvHAP per patient discharge or death.

 In-hospital mortality rate is defined as mortality during current hospitalization per patient discharge or death.

 Length of stay is defined as duration of current hospitalization in days.

 Sample size calculation assumed an nvHAP-rate of 1.

7% of patients (derived from coding data and after applying a correction factor, a factor that adjusts for coded Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP) and miscoded nvHAP and community acquired pneumonia) and a 30% reduction of nvHAP-rate caused by the intervention based on existing published literature.

 The investigators calculated that approximately 18'000 patients must be enrolled in the study to achieve statistical power of 80% with a two-sided significance level of 0.

05.

 Expected duration is 12 months for control and intervention phase each.

 The difference of the nvHAP rate, mortality rate and length of stay between control patients and patients after implementation of nvHAP-bundle is evaluated.

 Work package 4 (WP4): Evaluation of adherence to nvHAP-Bundle elements - Evaluation of documented prevention measures in electronic patient records (EPR) - Direct non-participatory observations - If appropriate: Questionnaires and/or interviews For prevention measures that are documented in each patient's EPR, adherence is evaluated by extracting data from EPR.

 Direct observations of the execution of prevention measures are applied to assess quality of execution and for measures that are not documented in patient records.

 By these two methods adherence rates are assessed, defined as: correctly applied prevention measure per patient/moment qualifying for prevention measure.

 Work package 5 (WP5): Evaluation of the implementation strategy The investigators plan to assess the implementation procedure by interviews and/or questionnaires.

 Interviews will be conducted with involved healthcare providers, with the study and implementation team, and with key persons from the hospital leadership to identify barriers and facilitators for adherence and describe the overall success of the intervention.

 The investigators will prospectively analyze the implementation strategy through regular interviews with key individuals, before, during, and following implementation of the nvHAP intervention.

 Further, key individuals who champion the implementation of the nvHAP bundle in each department will be invited to keep a journal of activities undertaken relevant to implementation.

 At the conclusion of the project, these journals will be analyzed as a means of indirect observation, following qualitative content analysis.

 Modular Prevention Bundle for Non-ventilator-associated Hospital-acquired Pneumonia (nvHAP)@highlight

This project aims to design, implement and evaluate a modular bundle of prevention measures for non-ventilator-associated hospital-acquired pneumonia (nvHAP).

 It is a single-center project, taking place at the University Hospital in Zurich (UHZ).

 For effectivity reasons, only departments and their related wards with a substantial nvHAP rate (nvHAP/patient discharge or death) will be included.

 Intermediate care wards (IMC) will be included, intensive care units (ICU) will be excluded.

 The five work packages (WP) are: 1.

 Design bundle of prevention measures for nvHAP - The nvHAP-bundle 2.

 Implementation of nvHAP-bundle 3.

 Evaluation of nvHAP-bundle concerning effectiveness to prevent nvHAP 4.

 Evaluation of adherence to nvHAP-Bundle elements 5.

 Evaluation of implementation strategy, i.

e.

 satisfaction, protocol fidelity, and sustainability For this project, the investigators work with the theoretical conception that interventions are composed of 'core components' (the central and crucial elements of the intervention) and an 'adaptable periphery' (the features of the intervention that can be adapted to the specific context to which it is being implemented).

 During WP1 of this project, the investigators will work together with experts to establish the core technical components of the nvHAP-Bundle.

 In WP2, the investigators will collaborate with frontline providers during a series of Implementation learning laboratories, and support them in developing unique implementation plans adapted to their local contexts, representing the adaptable periphery of the intervention.

 The five dimensions of the Consolidation framework for implementation Research (CFIR) framework will serve as a theoretical guide to describe the implementation strategy.

 Implementation will happen according to the principals of change management
