(secondQuint)PDMS Outcome After Intensive Care, Organdysfunction and Monitoring.

 The close monitoring of patients after cardiac surgery is regarded as standard.

 However, little is currently known about the influence on patient-related outcome parameters.

 Recently it has already been shown that intraoperative variability of blood pressure during heart surgery has a postoperative effect on 30-day mortality.

 The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate the effects of different hemodynamic measurements and management after cardiac surgery on patient-specific outcome parameters.

The objective of the explorative registry study is to investigate outcome parameters in the routine treatment of patients who are monitored after heart surgery for either short or long-term treatment in the intensive care unit for close monitoring of blood pressure.
