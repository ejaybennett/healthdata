(thirdQuint)Safety Study of BMX-001 (Radio-protector) in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Anal Cancer.

 In this Phase 1 study, the investigators will conduct a dose-escalation study of the combination of BMX-001 with standard radiation therapy (RT) and concurrent 5-fluorouracil (5FU)/mitomycin in newly diagnosed Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ASCC) patients.

 The dose escalation will be a Rolling-6 design, which is an efficient phase I trial design, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BMX-001 in combination with concurrent 5FU/mitomycin and RT.

 Subjects will be administered BMX-001 subcutaneously first as a loading dose at least 2 hours before the initiation of chemoradiation and then at a maintenance dose (50% of the loading dose) twice a week for up to seven weeks.

 Based on Rolling-6 design (1), cohorts of 2-6 patients are concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, beginning with 0.

1 mg/kg, until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined.

 The average number of subjects required for this Phase 1 is estimated to be 20, and the maximum estimated to be 24.

 The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is the highest dose level at which 1 out of 6 subjects experienced DLT.

 If no DLT has been identified at the highest dose proposed (loading dose of 0.

6 mg/kg followed by 0.

3 mg/kg twice per week) this will be accepted as the MTD.

 In order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BMX-001 in combination with current chemoradiation, blood samples will be drawn for analysis.

 Blood will be drawn for PK on the following days: Day 1 (before and after loading dose), Day 8, Day 22 and Day 36.

 Measures will be obtained at approximately the following times: -1 to 0 hour (before loading dose), 30 minutes after the drug is given, 4 hours post-dose, and 24 hours post-dose.

 Rectal, GI, and GU symptoms will be measured on the day of screening, weekly during RT, 1 months, 4 months and 10 months after the completion of RT.

 Perianal skin will be assessed weekly during RT, 1 month, 4 months, and 10 months after completion of RT.

 Further follow up will be per standard of care.

In this Phase 1 study, the investigators will conduct a dose-escalation study of the combination of BMX-001 with standard radiation therapy (RT) and concurrent 5-fluorouracil (5FU)/mitomycin in newly diagnosed Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ASCC) patients.

 The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BMX-001 in ASCC patients receiving RT and concurrent 5FU/mitomycin chemotherapy.
