(fifthQuint)Study in Chinese Healthy Adults to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics on ZSP1601, and the Effect of Food on ZSP1601 Pharmacokinetics.

 The study is a randomized, double-blind phase 1 trial including 3 parts: single ascending dose(SAD) part,multiple ascending dose(MAD) part and postprandial pharmacokinetics part.

The primary aims of the study as below: Evaluating the safety and tolerance of single and multiple dose of ZSP1601 in healthy volunteers.

 Evaluating the fasting and postprandial pharmacokinetic parameters of ZSP1601 in healthy volunteers.

 Eligible participants will be admitted to the trial center on Day -1.

 Subjects will be randomly assigned to either experimental groups or placebo groups, according to a randomisation schedule in a (4:1) ratio (8 in per experimental group).

 Subjects in SAD will receive 25,50,100,200,300,450,600 mg once daily respectively.

Each dose will be administrated after assurance of safety for the former dose.

 Subjects in MAD will be given a dose from SAD once daily for 7days.

The treatment in food effect consists of 2 periods,and subjects will receive 300mg on fasting and postprandial states respectively.

 There will be a 7-day wash out period between treatment periods.

To monitor AEs,record abnormalities (12-lead ECG,Vital signs,Physical examination,Clinical Laboratory),and detect the pharmacokinetics of ZSP1601.

This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of escalating single- and multiple-oral doses of ZSP1601 on fasted condition, and characterize PK of ZSP1601 on an empty stomach (fasted condition) and following a high fat, high calorie meal (fed condition) in a 2-period, 2-sequence manner.

 The study will be conducted in 3 parts (Ascending single dose, multiple dose and food effect).

 Participants will receive either ZSP1601 or placebo .
