(fifthQuint)Web-based Weight Loss Intervention.

 23andMe aims to recruit 91,227 adults to participate in a web-based weight loss intervention.

 Primary aims include: a.

) to confirm whether AG/GG individuals at MTIF3 rs1885988 lose more weight on lifestyle interventions; and b.

) to test the performance of a randomized controlled trial vs.

 self-selection study design in terms of weight loss, drop-outs, and adherence.

 Secondary (exploratory) analyses will focus on discovery of genetic and non-genetic predictors of weight loss success overall, and examination of potential interactions by intervention type.

 Web-administered intervention content, videos, and forums will be surfaced to participants every two weeks, and self-reported surveys will be surfaced weekly for the active intervention duration.

 Web-based Weight Loss Intervention@highlight

Excess weight is a major risk factor underlying leading causes of death globally, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers.

 Among participants assigned to the same lifestyle intervention arms in prior weight loss randomized controlled trials, large inter-individual differences in weight loss success have been observed, ranging from >50lbs of weight loss to >10lbs of weight gain.

 Both genetic and non-genetic factors underlying differential adherence and weight loss success are poorly understood.
