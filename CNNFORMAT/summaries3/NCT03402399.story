(firstQuint)Defining the Molecular Risk in Israeli Patients With Secondary Compared to Primary Myelofibrosis.

 Main inclusion criteria: 1.

 Diagnosis of PMF, post PV MF or post ET MF according to the WHO 2008 classification 2.

 Age 18 years 3.

 Concurrent participation in clinical trials will be allowed.

 Efficacy assessments will be evaluated by: HMR mutations rate, specific HMR mutations, disease duration, presence of splenomegaly, cytogenetic risk, DIPPS, IPSS, ET survival score and PV survival score.

 The primary efficacy parameter to be assessed will be HMR mutation rate.
