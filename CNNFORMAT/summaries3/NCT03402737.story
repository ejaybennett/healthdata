(secondQuint)SBRT + Cyclophosphamide for Inoperable, Recurrent H&N.

 The standard treatment in inoperable locally or regionally recurrent head and neck cancer is palliative systemic therapy.

 This therapy remains without realistic chances of cure.

 Fractionated high-dose local or regional re-irradiation is mostly given in a 6-7 weeks scheme.

 Using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), high radiotherapy doses can be given in a short time span.

 Severe late adverse events have been reported using SBRT but seem less frequent than in patients re-treated with conventional schedules.

 A possible solution to be able to administer higher doses is combining SBRT with dose painting, thus giving these high doses on small subvolumes only.

 Addition of concomitant therapy to reirradiation may further improve outcomes due to radiosensitization and direct cytotoxicity.

 Therefore the investigator aims to combine high doses with concomitant therapy in the proposed study.

 The immunomodulatory effect caused by radiation has been demonstrated both in animal models and clinical trials and leads to an enhanced local control as well as to eradication of distant metastasis.

 This so-called abscopal effect is reached through a systemic immune response evoked by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by the dying tumor-cells, also called immunogenic cell death (ICD).

 The investigator hypothesizes that an abscopal effect could be present for patients presenting locoregional recurrent disease with asymptomatic distant metastases, thereby offering at least symptom control at the primary site while palliative systemic treatment could be postponed.

 The proposed protocol focuses on patients with bad prognosis, as determined by a short timespan between primary therapy and recurrence (defined as 6-24 months after the end of the primary radiotherapy).

 It would bring the practical advantage of only 2-3 patient visits for the radiotherapy instead of 30-35 visits over 6-7 weeks.

 This shorter treatment schedule is expected to result in a direct gain in quality-of-life due to locoregional symptom control.

 It can also be expected that rescue systemic therapy will be postponed to a later stage of disease development, thereby prolonging overall survival.

 The combination with systemic agents that are involved in immunogenic cell death bear the potential to result in a higher number of patients with longer periods of disease control and survival.

 The current standard of care, i.

 the combined systemic treatment with cisplatin - 5-fluorouracil - cetuximab can be used as a rescue regimen in case of therapy failure.

 In that sense, better overall survival from time of diagnosis of the index locoregional recurrent disease is expected.
