(thirdQuint)Indications and Interest of US-guided Synovial Biopsies Performed in Clinical Practice.

 In this study, the investigators will collect all the synovial biopsies performed in clinical practice in 18 Rheumatology Unit throughout France.

 All the participants received a standardized training on US-guided synovial biopsies.

 For each biopsy, the indications, clinical presentation, procedure (length, tolerance), biopsy results (Pathology, bacteriology, etc .
