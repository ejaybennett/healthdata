(secondQuint)Comparison of Pain of Two Different Methods in Uterine Artery Embolization.

 Uterine artery embolization(UAE) is a minimally invasive treatment alternative to hysterectomy and myomectomy in symptomatic fibroids.

 However, post-procedural pain after UAE remains a major problem.

 The non-spherical polyvinyl alcohol particle and tri-acryl gelatin microsphere are two embolic materials used for UAE.

Therefore, the aim of study is to compare pain intensity and inflammation after uterine artery embolization using non-spherical polyvinyl alcohol particles or tris-acryl gelatin microsphere in patients with symptomatic fibroids.
