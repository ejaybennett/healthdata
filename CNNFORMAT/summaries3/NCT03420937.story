(thirdQuint)Deep Neuromuscular Block During General Anaesthesia in Robotic Surgery.

 Adequate muscle relaxation during general anaesthesia is crucial for easy, uncomplicated and safe laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery.

 Perfect abdominal wall relaxation facilitates surgical working conditions, which makes surgery safer, faster and easier to perform.

 Besides this indirect advantage, there could be obvious benefit for patients.

 This is a result of decreased negative pathophysiological consequences of an increased intraabdominal pressure (capnoperitoneum) on important organ systems (cardiovascular, breathing system, kidneys etc.

) Complete muscle relaxation during general anaesthesia can be achieved by using higher doses of rocuronium (non-depolarizing aminosteroid muscle relaxant) and special anaesthetic technique called deep neuromuscular block (DNMB).

 The primary focus of the project is to test the potential advantages of DNMB compared to standard relaxation technique.

 Safe and efficient use of NMBA is an important precondition in restoring a patients full muscle strength at the end of anaesthesia, to prevent effects of residual block.

 Modern practice of anaesthesia offers an option for complete and immediate rocuronium induced block reversal by using its specific antagonist - sugammadex.

 Combination of DNMB approach and sugammadex reversal also provide potential benefits for perioperative course and patient recovery after surgery.

 Secondary objective of the project is to verify this facts.

The aim of this project is to show, whether the use of the deep neuromuscular block in certain laparoscopic robot-assisted surgery can positively influence main physiological functions compared to the use of standard neuromuscular block.

 Secondary outcome is to find out whether the targeted specific reversal of neuromuscular block by sugammadex improves and fastens the post-operative recovery of the patients.
