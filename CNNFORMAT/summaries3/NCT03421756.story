(secondQuint)Stem Cell Transplant in Patients With Severe Sickle Cell Disease.

 Stem cell transplantation recipients will be given Alemtuzumab, which is a non-myeloablative pre-transplant conditioning regimen.

 This non-myeloablative therapy uses doses of chemotherapy and radiation to weaken (but not destroy) the patients bone marrow and immune system, while still allowing their body to accept the donor's stem cells.

 Alemtuzumab will be given 7 days prior to stem cell infusion at 0.

03 mg/kg IV, 6 days prior to stem cell infusion at 0.

1 mg/kg IV, and 5 thru 3 days prior to stem cell infusion at 0.

3 mg/kg IV.
