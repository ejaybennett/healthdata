(secondQuint)To Compare the Efficacy of Surgery Followed by Sunitinib With Surgery Followed by Imatinib in GIST Patients With Progression on Imatinib.

.

 Primary Endpoint: To evaluate the progression free survival of the patients with progression receiving surgery followed by sunitinib therapy comparing with surgery followed by imatinib Secondary Endpoint:To evaluate the overall survival of the patients with progression receiving surgery followed by sunitinib therapy comparing with surgery followed by imatinib the relationship of c-kit secondary mutation and progression free survival of surgery followed by TKI therapy the safety and tolerability of the two therapy.

 Statistics:All the statistical analysis is performed using SPSS version 20.

0 (IBM corporation, United States).

 Pearson's chi-squared test was used to compare categorical variables.

 PFS and OS analyses were estimated with Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test and multivariable analyses were performed to assess survival difference.

 A two sided p-value of <0.

05 was considered statistically significant.
