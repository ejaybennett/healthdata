 For the prospective arm of the registry a physician will have already selected the APT procedure for the treatment of pulmonary embolism.

 The APT treatment and follow-up assessments are per clinical judgement and institutional standard of care which may vary at each clinical site.

 For the retrospective arm of the registry the investigators will gather data from consecutive cases of individuals who received the APT treatment for pulmonary embolism.

 Specific baseline, treatment, and long-term health information is collected and de-identified.
