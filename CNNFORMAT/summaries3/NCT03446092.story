(firstQuint)Mindfulness for People With Incurable Cancer.

 It can be hard to come to terms with living with a life limiting condition such as incurable cancer and individuals are at risk of experiencing high levels of psychological distress, which can often be overlooked when the focus is on managing physical symptoms.

 Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to be helpful in reducing distress for people with cancer generally.

 This pilot study will use an established mindfulness programme called mindfulness for health with people with cancer which is incurable to see if this type of intervention is acceptable and useful for this group of people.
