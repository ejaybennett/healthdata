(thirdQuint)Changes in the Hypotalamic-pituitary Region of Patients With Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity.

 This longitudinal prospective study in overweight and obese patients aims to identify and characterize new morphological and quantitative MRI parameters of pituitary gland and sellar region assessed by texture analysis with a specific software (ImageJ(C)).

 These parameters will be correlated them to hypothalamic-pituitary-peripheral axis function, metabolism and body composition.

 Data will be detected at baseline and at 3 years follow-up to quantitatively identify the different pituitary MRI patterns in 3 groups: 1.

 patients without weight modifies 2.

 patients with weight loss obtain through diet and lifestyle changes 3.

 patients with weight loss obtained through bariatric surgery.

This study aims to identify new morphological and quantitative magnetic imaging parameters of pituitary gland and sellar region in overweight and obese patient at baseline and after 3 years, dividing patients in 3 groups (weight loss through diet and lifestyle changes, weight loss through bariatric surgery, no weight loss)
