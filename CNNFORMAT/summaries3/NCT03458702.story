(thirdQuint)The Effects of Emotional Exposure on State Anxiety.

 Rest or acute exercise can decrease state anxiety, with some evidence showing acute exercise to prevent elevations in anxiety after exposure to emotional stimuli.

 The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of an acute YogaFit session on state anxiety, heart rate, and measures of heart rate variability (HRV) to determine whether yoga provides short-term protection against emotional stimuli.

 Both time-domain and frequency-domain measures of HRV were assessed.

 Forty healthy, female college students completed a thirty-min session of YogaFit along with a time-matched seated rest condition on separate days.

 After each condition, participants viewed 30 min of emotional picture stimuli.

 State anxiety, HR, and HRV were assessed baseline, post-condition, and post-exposure to emotional stimuli.

 The Effects of Emotional Exposure on State Anxiety@highlight

In summary, state anxiety scores indicate that both YogaFit and seated rest were effective at acutely reducing state anxiety post-condition, but not at preventing an induced anxiety responses post-exposure.

 However, physiological measures indicate a healthy adaptive response to YogaFit and rest both post-condition and post-exposure.
