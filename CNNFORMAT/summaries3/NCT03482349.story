(secondQuint)RCT Comparing Robotically-Assisted vs.

 Manually-Executed Total Knee Arthroplasties.

 Although total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an effective treatment for end-stage knee arthritis, improvements in surgical technique remain a necessity.

 Contemporary designs have bolstered durability, but longer life expectancies have placed an even greater emphasis on survivorship.

 Additionally, patient satisfaction remains an issue.

 A prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) is proposed to compare robotically-assisted versus manually executed primary (TKAs).

 This study is designed to address the major short-term clinically important issues between the two types of procedures with special emphasis on functional outcome.

 Patients will be randomized to receive either a robotically-assisted or a manually-executed primary TKA.

 RCT Comparing Robotically-Assisted vs.

 Manually-Executed Total Knee Arthroplasties@highlight

This study will explore if there are any difference in functional outcomes between two different surgical procedures for total knee replacement: robot-assisted versus manually-executed total knee arthroplasty.
