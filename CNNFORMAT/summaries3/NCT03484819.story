(fifthQuint)Copanlisib and Nivolumab in Treating Participants With Recurrent or Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma or Primary Mediastinal Large B-cell Lymphoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete response rate (CR) plus partial response rate (PR) (ORR = CR + PR) of the combination of copanlisib (copanlisib hydrochloride) and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the safety of the combination of nivolumab and copanlisib hydrochloride in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL and PMBCL.

 II.

 To determine the progression free survival, duration of response, complete response rate and overall survival of the combination of copanlisib hydrochloride and nivolumab in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and PMBCL.

 CORRELATIVE STUDY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To characterize the effects of the copanlisib hydrochloride and nivolumab combination regimen on tumor cells, tumor microenvironment and the immune response in relapsed/refractory DLBCL and PMBCL.

 II.

 To assess predictors of response of the combination in relapsed/refractory DLBCL and PMBCL.

 OUTLINE: Participants receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8 and 15.

 Participants also receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of courses 1 to 8 and on day 1 of subsequent courses.

 Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for up to 100 days.

 Copanlisib and Nivolumab in Treating Participants With Recurrent or Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma or Primary Mediastinal Large B-cell Lymphoma@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well copanlisib and nivolumab work in treating participants with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma that has come back or does not responded to the treatment.

 Copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

 Giving copanlisib and nivolumab may work better in treating participants with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.
