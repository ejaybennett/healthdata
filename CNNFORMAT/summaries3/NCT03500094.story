(secondQuint)Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Efficacy of Migalastat in Pediatric Subjects (Aged 12 to <18 Years).

 This is a Phase 3b, open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of migalastat treatment in pediatric subjects 12 to <18 years of age and at least 45 kg (99 pounds) with Fabry disease and with amenable GLA mutations.

 Subjects must be either naive to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or have stopped ERT at least 6 months before screening.

 The study will consist of a screening period lasting at least 14 days and up to 30 days, a 12 month treatment period, and a 30-day safety follow-up period, for a total of up to approximately 14 months.

 Subjects will be randomly assigned 1:1:1 to 1 of 3 PK sampling groups using interactive response technology (IRT).

 Four blood samples for determination of migalastat concentrations in plasma will be collected on any 1 day during the first 2 weeks of study drug administration and again at Months 6 and 12.
