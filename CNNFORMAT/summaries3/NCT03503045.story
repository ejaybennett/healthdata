(firstQuint)The Rates of Overtreatment and Deintensification of Antidiabetic and Antihypertensive Medications in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus.

 Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic diseases which lead to serious public health problems and a significant economic burden worldwide.

 The prevalence of diabetes in elderly patients is very high and is predicted to increase dramatically.

 Prior studies have generally been concerned with the inadequate treatment of diabetes however, over the last few years the overtreatment of diabetes has also come to the fore.

 Unfortunately, there are very few data worldwide and no data in Turkey about the overtreatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.

 This study aimed to assess the rates and predictors of overtreatment and undertreatment of glycemia and blood pressure in older adults with T2DM.

 Treatment deintensification or intensification by the physicians were also investigated.
