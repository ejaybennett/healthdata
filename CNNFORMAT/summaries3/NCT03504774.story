(fifthQuint)Food Allergen OIT for Shrimp, Milk or Cashew.

 The site will enroll 72 participants, ages 12 to 55 years with an allergy to either milk, cashew, or shrimp determined by DBPCFC, allergy history, clinical symptoms, food-allergen (FA)-specific IgE levels, and skin prick test (SPT).

 OIT treatment groups will be milk (n=24), cashew (n=24), or shrimp (n=24).

 The subject's allergen will be introduced in a Dose Escalation Day at week 1.

 All cohorts will undergo an updosing regimen starting at 5 mg allergen, with dose escalation every 2 weeks to reach a 300 mg dose at week 21, after which they will be maintained at that dose for 3 weeks.

 At the conclusion of the maintenance phase (Week 24), participants will undergo DBPCFC to determine desensitization.

 Participants that pass their food challenge with no or mild objective reactions to up to a cumulative 1044 mg of the FA allergen in their OIT at the end of this phase (primary outcome) will be considered desensitized and have successfully met the primary endpoint.

 Participants then will continue in the study by undergoing a withdrawal from OIT for 6 weeks to examine mechanisms underlying sustained unresponsiveness (SU) which will be defined as a participant's passing a DBPCFC with no or mild objective reaction to up to a cumulative 1044 mg of the FA allergen in their OIT at week 30.

 Participants will be followed for additional 8 weeks to reach the end of study phase (Week 38).

 There will be an opportunity to continue withdrawal every 6-8 weeks until week 52 to be able to study the ability to maintain SU over a relatively longer term.

 Each subject is planned to be enrolled in the active phase of the study for at least 38 weeks.

 There will be opportunity to continue in the study till week 52 with in clinic follow up visits every 6-8 weeks.

 Food Allergen OIT for Shrimp, Milk or Cashew@highlight

A prospective Phase 2, single-center, single-allergen OIT in milk or cashew or shrimp in participants with proven allergies to either milk or cashew or shrimp, respectively.

 OIT treatment groups will be milk, cashew, or shrimp.

 After determining their specific food allergen (cashew, milk, or shrimp), subjects will undergo a dose escalation day to reach 5 mg allergen, after which they will return to the clinic every 2 weeks to escalate their allergen dose to reach a 300 mg dose at week 21.

 Participants then will be maintained at that dose for 3 weeks (Maintenance Phase).

 Participants that pass a Double Blind-Placebo Controlled-Food Challenge (DBPCFC) at the end of their maintenance period (week 21) will be declared desensitized and will continue in the study for 6 more weeks to examine mechanisms underlying sustained unresponsiveness (SU) by a second DBPCFC at week 30.

 Participants then will be followed for additional 8 weeks to reach the end of study phase (Week 38).
