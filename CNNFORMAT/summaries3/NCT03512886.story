(fifthQuint)The Effect of Multiple-Task Training in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis.

 Patients with MS between 0-1,5 score according to the Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) will be included in the study.

 The balance, mobility, upper extremity performance, the cognitive function will be evaluated twice.

 The study was designed as a prospective, randomized controlled study.

 The patients will be randomly assigned to three groups, the "multi-task training (MT)" group, the "single task training (ST)" group, and "control" group.

 The training will be twice a week for 6 weeks.

 Statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS software version 15 (SPSS Inc.

 Chicago, IL, USA).

 The pre-training and post-training measurements of groups will be compared with the Wilcoxon Test.

 The significance level was set at p< 0.

 The Effect of Multiple-Task Training in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis@highlight

The Activities of Daily Living requires the ability to perform multiple activities at the same time, not just the motor or cognitive activity.

 When many tasks are performed at the same time, the attention capacity is effectively used and attention is shared according to the difficulty and priority of the tasks.

 There is evidence that patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) have reduced performance during multitasking.

 In this study, the investigators aim to investigate the effect of multitasking training on balance, mobility, upper extremity performance and cognitive functions in patients with MS.
