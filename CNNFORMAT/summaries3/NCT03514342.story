(thirdQuint)The Effects of Horner's Syndrome Developing After Interscalene Brachial Plexus Block on Autonomic Nervous Activity.

 Stellate ganglia provide sympathetic fibers to the heart.

 Ipsilateral stellate ganglion block accompanied by interscalene brachial plexus block causes Horner's syndrome presenting with miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis.

 The extent of Horner's syndrome can be represented by the difference in pupil diameter between bilateral eyes.

 Cardiac autonomic nervous activity affected by stellate ganglion block can be measured by calculation of heart rate variability parameters.

 The Effects of Horner's Syndrome Developing After Interscalene Brachial Plexus Block on Autonomic Nervous Activity@highlight

This study evaluates the effects of Horner's syndrome on cardiac autonomic nervous activity after interscalene brachial plexus block.

 Cardiac autonomic nervous activity and bilateral pupil diameters will be measured in a scotopic light condition, 30 minutes after interscalene brachial plexus block under ultrasound guidance.
