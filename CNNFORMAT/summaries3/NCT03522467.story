(secondQuint)Cannabis Oil for Pain Effectiveness.

 Over a 1-2 year period, 40 cancer patients experiencing poorly controlled pain will be enrolled in to a prospective single-arm cohort study, in which they will receive an orally administered cannabis oil formulation as an add-on therapy to current treatment regimens.

 Subjects entering the acute study phase will be titrated to a tolerated dose at which a sustained pain response is reached, and may subsequently enter a 12 week chronic phase during which safety and durability of pain response will be assessed at their stable dose.
