(thirdQuint)Immunogenicity and Safety of Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine (TDV) Co-administered With an Hepatitis A Virus Vaccine.

 The vaccine tested in this study is TDV.

 TDV co-administered with HAV vaccine will be tested to assess immunogenicity and safety in healthy participants in non-endemic area(s) for dengue and HAV.

 The study will enroll approximately 900 patients.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups-which will remain undisclosed to the observer.

 Participants will be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to receive: - Group 1: HAV vaccine (IM) and placebo (SC), co-administered at Day 1 (Month 0 [M0]); placebo (SC) administered at Day 90 (Month 3 [M3]) - Group 2: TDV (SC) and placebo (IM), co-administered at Day 1 (Month 0 [M0]); TDV (SC) administered at Day 90(Month 3 [M3]) - Group 3: TDV (SC) and HAV vaccine (IM), co-administered at Day 1 (Month 0 [M0]); TDV (SC) administered at Day 90 (Month 3 [M3]) This multi-center trial will be conducted in United Kingdom.

 The overall time to participate in this study is 270 days.

 Participants will have multiple visits to the clinic with a 6-months follow up after the last study administration, including a final visit at Day 270.

 Immunogenicity and Safety of Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine (TDV) Co-administered With an Hepatitis A Virus Vaccine@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of the concomitant administration of TDV (subcutaneous [SC] injection) and of hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine (intramuscular [IM] injection) in healthy participants aged 18 to 60 years living in country(ies) non-endemic for both dengue and hepatitis.
