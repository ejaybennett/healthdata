(thirdQuint)Estimation of Glomerular Filtration Flow in Patients of Resuscitation Under Extra-bodily Assistance.

 Extracorporeal assistance is recommended for patients with a potentially reversible acute risk of life that does not respond to conventional treatments.

 Hypoxic refractory syndromes, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, are referred to as veno-venous ECMO (for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) (ECMO VV), whereas terminal cardiac dysfunctions require veno-arterial ECMO (VA ECMO).

 recovery of function (cardiotropic intoxication), or in the most severe cases, pending transplantation or long-term assistance.

 This is a qualified pilot study, as it is the first one interested in evaluating the quality of the GFR estimate of the two estimation equations (CKD-EPI and Cockcroft formula) by relative to the measured clearance of creatinine, a method that can be performed routinely in intensive care, for resuscitation patients under veno-arterial or veno-venous ECMO.

The aim of the study will be to evaluate the quality of the GFR estimate of the two estimation equations (CKD-EPI and Cockcroft's formula) against the measured clearance of creatinine, which can be performed routinely in intensive care.

 To determine the proportion of patients with ARC under ECMO VV or VA and determine changes in renal vascular resistance index as a function of GFR level in patients with pulsatile cardiac output.
