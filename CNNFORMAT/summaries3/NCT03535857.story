(secondQuint)Effectiveness of Bilateral PTNS Compared to Unilateral PTNS for the Treatment of Overactive Bladder/Urge Incontinence.

 Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is an accepted treatment for overactive bladder that can be accomplished in the office with minimal side effects.

 It is currently carried out by stimulating one of the posterior tibial nerves unilaterally.

 The aim of this study is to determine whether bilateral percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation is more effective than unilateral stimulation.

 Patients with a diagnosis of overactive bladder who have previously failed lifestyle changes and/or pharmacologic therapy will be offered percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation.

 Enrolled patients will be randomized into two groups.

 The control group will receive the traditional unilateral treatment of PTNS.

 The intervention group will receive bilateral PTNS treatment.

 Intervention success will be measured by improvement in overactive bladder symptoms assessed by improvement in the scores on the overactive bladder questionnaire symptoms bother and decrease in number of voids, nocturia episodes and incontinence episodes as reported in the voiding diary.
