(fifthQuint)Self-management Intervention to Improve Adolescents' Asthma Control.

 We have developed a theory-driven self-management intervention for children and young people which addresses the barriers to successful self-management, which were identified in our earlier study.

 The intervention will engage asthmatic teenagers and their peers, and will be delivered in two components.

 The first component includes a theatre workshop for all children aged 11-13 years in London secondary schools.

 The aim of this component is to raise awareness of asthma in schools among peers.

 The second component is a series of four self-management workshops for children with asthma.

 The aim of this component is to teach children about asthma, using interactive role plays and games.

 The main topics will include asthma general knowledge and understanding; GP communication; asthma triggers and symptoms; medication and emergency response; and self-management techniques and goal setting.

 Self-management Intervention to Improve Adolescents' Asthma Control@highlight

Approximately 1.

1 million children and young people in the United Kingdom (UK) are living with asthma, making it the most common chronic disease in children in the UK.

 Our recent observational study found that poor asthma control, poor medication adherence, and a poor understanding of asthma were key unmet needs of secondary school children.

 Following the findings from our earlier study, we have developed a preliminary theory-based multi-faceted intervention, aimed at improving asthma self-management and control in young people.
