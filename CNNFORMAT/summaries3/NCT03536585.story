(thirdQuint)Multi-polar RF and PEMF for Treatment of Vaginal Laxity and Mons Pubis and Labia for Improvement of Skin Laxity.

 Traditional non-surgical treatments to treat vaginal looseness include Kegel exercises or pelvic floor therapy with electrical stimulation of the vaginal muscles to promote muscle strength but may not be all that effective.

 Surgery is also used to tighten the vaginal canal and reduce the size of the mons pubis and the outer labial lips but can be associated with surgical complications.

 Development of new technologies to address these concerns is warranted.

 Mutil-polar radiofrequency (RF) therapy to treat stress incontinence (attributed to looseness of the muscles that control the ability to hold urine) and looseness of the facial and neck skin has been used with success and minimal risk.

 The addition of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) energy to multi-polar RF therapy has also been shown to improve the results of the RF therapy.

 RF therapy has already been reported to be successful in vaginal tightening.

 This study will investigate whether adding PEMF to RF therapy is safe and efficacious for the treatment of vaginal loosenss.

 In addition, this study will also investigate whether RF and PEMF energy treatment will improve the looseness of the mons pubis and labia.

 Multi-polar RF and PEMF for Treatment of Vaginal Laxity and Mons Pubis and Labia for Improvement of Skin Laxity@highlight

The study evaluates the use of multi-polar radiofrequency (RF) and pulsed electro-magnetic fields (PEMF) energies for the treatment of vaginal looseness and for the treatment of the mons pubis and labia for skin tightening.

 All subjects will receive a total of three internal and three external treatments at four week intervals.

 Subjects will be followed up at one and four months after treatment is complete.
