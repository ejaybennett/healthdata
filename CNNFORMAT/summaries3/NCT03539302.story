(thirdQuint)INhalation of Flecainide to Convert Recent Onset SympTomatic Atrial Fibrillation to siNus rhyThm (INSTANT).

 Subjects eligible to participate in the study must provide written informed consent (IC) before randomization or any study- specific procedures.

 The study consists of 2 parts (PART A and PART B) as described below: PART A: has an open-label, randomized, multicenter design to evaluate the feasibility of administration of inhaled flecainide in two dosing regimens.

 Subjects are randomized at a 1:1 ratio to a single (N = 10) or repeat (N = 10) dose regimen.

 PART B: has a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter design to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of inhaled flecainide against matched placebo in the two dosing regimens.

 Subjects are randomized at a 1:1 ratio to a single or repeat dose regimen.

 Within each dose regimen, subjects are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either inhaled flecainide or matched placebo.

 Randomization yields the following 4 groups: - Single dose inhaled flecainide (N = 30) - Single dose matched placebo (N = 15) - Repeat dose inhaled flecainide (N = 30) - Repeat dose matched placebo (N = 15) Randomization, for both Part A and Part B, is stratified by duration of the presenting AF episode ( 1 h up to 24 hours; > 24h up to 48h).

 Once study regimen is allocated, the subject will self-administer the study treatment and inhalation regimen.

 If at 30 minutes after initiation of dosing, no conversion to SR is observed, the Investigator may offer the subject another appropriate therapy.

 Discharge is left up to the discretion of the treating physician but no less than 240 min after initiation of dosing.

 Heart rhythm will be confirmed with event recorder in follow up.

 An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible for monitoring safety during the study.

The study consists of 2 parts (Part A and Part B).

 Part A has an open-label, randomized, multi center design to evaluate the feasibility of administration of inhaled flecainide in two dosing regimens.

 Part B has a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, multi center design to evaluate the safety (including tolerability) and efficacy of inhaled flecainide compared to matched placebo in two dosing regimens.
