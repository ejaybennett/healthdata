(fifthQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Butylphthalide for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients Receiving Intravenous Thrombolysis or Endovascular Treatment.

 This trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo parallel controlled, multiple-center trial.

 A total of approximately 500 patients (Age18years) within 6 hours of symptom onset of acute ischemic stroke, who shows NIHSS from 4-25 points and intend to be treated with iv-rtPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy will be enrolled.

 Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two groups after offering informed content, meanwhile all the use of drugs are before intravascular treatment: 1) one group will receive Butylphthalide and Sodium Chloride Injection 100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days, then take Butylphthalide Soft Capsules 0.

2g triple/day for the rest 15th to 90th day therapy; 2) the other group will receive Butylphthalide Placebo Injection 100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days and then take Butylphthalide Placebo Soft Capsules 0.

2g triple/day for the rest 15th to 90th day therapy.

 The primary objective is to evaluate the recovery of neurological deficits in acute ischemic stroke(AIS)patients who take dl-NBP after receiving iv-rtPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy.

 The study consists of four visits including the day of randomization, 2 days after the first injection, 14 days when the injection therapy is done, and 30, 60 and 90 days when the oral therapy is finished.

 Demographic information, symptoms and signs, laboratory test, neuro-imaging assessment neurological function rating scale will be recorded during the program.

 The recovery of neurological deficits will be assessed by the difference of the 90 days NIHSS to the baseline NIHSS.

 The trial is anticipated to last from June 2018 to June 2019 with 500 subjects recruited form 15 centers in China.

 All the related investigative organization and individuals will obey the Declaration of Helsinki and Chinese Good Clinical Practice standard.

 A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study.

 The trial has been approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics Committee(EC) in Being Tiantan hospital, Capital Medical University.

 Efficacy and Safety of Butylphthalide for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients Receiving Intravenous Thrombolysis or Endovascular Treatment@highlight

Butylphthalide, as a well-known neuroprotective medication, is a family of compounds initially isolated from the seeds of Apium graveolens Linn, of which active ingredient is dl-3-N-butylphthalide (dl-NBP).

 With the significant effects of reducing the cerebral ischemic damage and eventually improving patients' clinical outcomes, by the potential mechanisms of promoting microcirculation, as well as releasing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and poststroke inflammation, dl-NBP has been widely applied in acute ischemic stroke as an anti-ischemic drug in China since 2002.

 While with the evolution of using iv.

 recombinant tissue plasminogen activator(rtPA )and mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke(AIS)patients, it is still undefined whether combination therapy with dl-NBP could enhance the curative effect.

 The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the recovery of neurological deficits in AIS patients who receive iv-rtPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy with the a 3-month regimen of Butylphthalide and Sodium Chloride Injection 100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days and Butylphthalide Soft Capsules 0.

2g triple/day for the rest 15th to 90th day therapy versus a 3-month regimen of Butylphthalide Placebo Injection 100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days and followed by Butylphthalide Placebo Soft Capsules 0.

2g triple/day for the rest 15th to 90th day therapy.
