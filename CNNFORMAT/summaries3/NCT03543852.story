(fifthQuint)SurvivorLink Scalability.

 Interventions for caregivers and pediatric cancer survivors are needed to improve patient-centered care, minimize late effects and promote overall well-being.

 The purpose of this research is to assess the impact of the SurvivorLink system on implementation and adherence to cancer care and late effects visits/screening.

 This research projects proposes to develop a standardized process by which to implement SurvivorLink, a personal electronic health record and education system, designed to promote survivor care, within pediatric cancer clinics.

 This study will use a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation, clustered randomized, waitlist control design to evaluate the impact of SurvivorLink on patient health behavior and quality of life outcomes and understand its delivery among 20 pediatric cancer survivor clinics.

 The researchers will test the effectiveness of SurvivorLink on 1 year follow-up and completed screenings through a clustered randomized waitlist-control trial: ten clinics will administer the intervention to study participants and the other ten clinics will be a wait-list control group where study participants receive usual care.

 The study will evaluate the impact of SurvivorLink on patient survivor care visit attendance and risk-based surveillance tests, caregiver's patient activation, survivor's and caregiver's quality of life and self-efficacy to manage a chronic condition.

 This study is the first comprehensive, effectiveness-implementation study to evaluate the impact of an electronic personal health record (with care plan) and education system for pediatric cancer survivors and their caregivers.

 SurvivorLink Scalability@highlight

Previous research suggests that children and adolescents with cancer are at heightened risk of late effects that can occur months or years after cancer treatment, yet little is known about programs that increase their return for follow-up cancer care and late effects surveillance.

 This study will evaluate the impact of an electronic personal health record and education system, SurvivorLink, for pediatric cancer survivors and their caregivers.

 The researchers will develop a standardized intervention and training for the SurvivorLink trial, followed by conducting a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation, clustered randomized, waitlist control trial to evaluate the impact of SurvivorLink on pediatric cancer patients' one year follow-up visits and completion of screening tests.

 The study will also assess the impact of SurvivorLink on caregiver's patient activation, survivor's and caregiver's quality of life, and self-efficacy to manage a chronic condition.

 This study will provide the evidence base about the effects of the system to improve follow-up care for children and adolescents with cancer and best practices for implementation for pediatric cancer centers.
