(firstQuint)Swan-Ganz Continuous Cardiac Output Thermodilutioon Cather (Swan-Ganz CCOmbo V) for Obtaining an Optimal Depth of Right Internal Jugular Venous Catheter.

 Patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were studied.

Determine the optimal insertion depth of right internal jugular vein catheter using Swan-Ganz Continuous Cardiac Output Thermodilutioon Cather (Swan-Ganz CCOmbo V).

The investigators measure the distance between the insertion point and the junction between right atrium and superior vena cava using Swan-Ganz CCOmbo V.
