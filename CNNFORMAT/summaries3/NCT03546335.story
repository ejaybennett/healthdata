(secondQuint)Zr-89 Cimzia PET Imaging Rheumatoid Arthritis.

 This is a single center exploratory imaging study investigating the initial application of 89Zr-DFO-CZP PET in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

 Patients with active symptoms of RA or signs on physical exam will be invited to participate for PET imaging.

 Study 1 is a dose finding study that will involve a single 89Zr-DFO-CZP PET scan acquired ~24 hours following a single administration of the radiopharmaceutical.

 The first 2 patients will receive 1 mCi of 89Zr-DFO-CZP.

 Subsequent groups of two patients will receive 0.

5 mCi decrease or increase dose (up to 2 mCi) to determine the acceptable optimal imaging dose.
