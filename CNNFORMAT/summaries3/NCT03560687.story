 Secondary Objectives are - Changes in blood chemistry and biochemical tests between pre- and post-intervention - Evaluate the tolerability and compliance of supplementation with Sucrosomal Iron - Reduction in the number of transfusions and blood bags used - Quality of life (6MWT) of patients at 30 days post-intervention - Evaluation of cost-effectiveness between faramcoloigca supplementation and riasparmaito money for the order and administration of blood products.
