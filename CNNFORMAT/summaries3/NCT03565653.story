(fifthQuint)The Effects of Dietary Salt on Post-exercise Hypotension.

 Recently released blood pressure guidelines from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology are expected to raise the prevalence of hypertension in America from ~33% to ~46%.

 A single bout of aerobic exercise produces a prolonged period (up to 24 hours) of lowered blood pressure (post-exercise hypotension; PEH).

 Repeated bouts of aerobic exercise results in maintenance of lowered blood pressure, leading to recommendations of aerobic exercise for improvement of blood pressure status.

 However, more than 90% of Americans consume more sodium in their diets than is recommended.

 This is alarming, as excess dietary sodium intake expands plasma fluid volume, which may in turn attenuate the reduction in BP following exercise.

 Therefore, the objective of this project is to determine the effects of high dietary sodium intake on PEH.

 The investigators hypothesize that, compared to a recommended sodium diet, a high salt diet will attenuate post-exercise hypotension.

 The Effects of Dietary Salt on Post-exercise Hypotension@highlight

The new American Heart Association (AHA) blood pressure guidelines are expected to raise the prevalence of high blood pressure to ~46% in the United States.

 One recommendation for lowering blood pressure is aerobic exercise, which produces a period of lowered blood pressure (post-exercise hypotension; PEH) that lasts up to 24 hours.

 It is believed that PEH may be responsible for the observations of lowered blood pressure following initiation of exercise.

 However, most Americans eat too much salt, which expands plasma volume and may prevent PEH, rending aerobic exercise ineffective in improving blood pressure status.
