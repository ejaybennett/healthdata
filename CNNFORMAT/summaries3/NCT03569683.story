(thirdQuint)Comparison Between Laser, Synthetic Gel and Herbal Gel as Topical Agents After Gum Surgery.

 Low-level laser therapy applied to soft tissues stimulates specific metabolic processes in healing wounds.

 Major changes observed in wounds treated with low-level laser therapy(LLLT) include increased healthy granulation tissue formation with early epithelization, increased fibroblast proliferation and matrix synthesis.

 Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide gel and it has many properties that make it a potentially ideal molecule for assisting in wound healing by inducing early granulation tissue formation, inhibiting inflammation, providing epithelial turnover and also aiding in connective tissue angiogenesis.

 Hiora gel is a herbal astringent gel which helps in wound healing, reduces inflammation and also alleviates pain.
