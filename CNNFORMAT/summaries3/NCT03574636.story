(thirdQuint)Optical Coherence Tomography Compared With Intravascular Ultrasound to Guide High-speed Rotational Before Stent Implantation in the Treatment of Moderate-to-severe Calcified Lesion in Coronary Artery.

 This study will recruit 375 subjects with moderate-to-severe calcified lesion in coronary arteries 2.

50 mm to 4.

0 mm in diameter and 15 mm to 70 mm in length (by visual estimate) in no more than 15 research centers in China.

 All participants met the inclusion criteria will be 1:1:1 randomly assigned to OCT guidance, IVUS guidance, or angiography-guided stent implantation.

 OCT subgroup study: OCT will be performed in the first 66 consecutive patients enrolled in the study who may come from OCT guidance, IVUS guidance or angiography guidance.
