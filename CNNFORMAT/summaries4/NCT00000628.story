(fifthQuint)A Pharmacokinetic Study of L-697,661 Alone and in Combination With Zidovudine.

 L-697,661 is a newly identified compound that inhibits HIV replication (reproduction and growth) in cell culture.

 It works together with AZT against HIV.

 Part 1: Twelve patients are randomly assigned to one of two groups.

 Group 1 patients receive AZT for 7 days, followed by AZT plus L-697,661 with food for 56 days.

 Group 2 patients receive no drug for 7 days, followed by L-697,661 with food for 56 days.

 Antipyrine is administered 1 hour prior to study drug on days 8, 22, and 35.

 Part 2: Fifteen patients receive L-697,661 with food, for 8 weeks.

 Therapy with L-697,661 may be extended beyond 8 weeks for up to 24 weeks.
