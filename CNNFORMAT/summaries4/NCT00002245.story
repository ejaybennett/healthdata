(thirdQuint)A Study of the Effects of Amprenavir, a Protease Inhibitor, on Carbohydrate and Fat Metabolism in HIV-Infected Patients.

 This single-site study uses an open-label, single-arm design to evaluate the effects of APV, a protease inhibitor (PI), plus concurrent nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) ABC and 3TC on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in non-diabetic, HIV-1 infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy.

 Treatment duration is 24 weeks, and patients serve as their own controls.

 The combination therapy is evaluated for safety, tolerability, efficacy, and effects on body composition.

 The proportion of patients who attain plasma HIV RNA below the lower limit of quantitation of the Roche Amplicor (less than 400 copies/ml) and Ultrasensitive (less than 50 copies/ml) is measured at 24 weeks after starting therapy with APV plus ABC plus 3TC.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a 3-drug anti-HIV regimen, amprenavir (APV) plus abacavir (ABC) plus lamivudine (3TC), on the way carbohydrates (sugars) and fats are metabolized (processed by the body) in HIV-infected patients who have received little or no previous anti-HIV drug therapy.
