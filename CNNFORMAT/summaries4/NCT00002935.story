(thirdQuint)Photodynamic Therapy in Treating Patients With Early Esophageal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) using porfimer sodium (Photofrin) and controlled uniform laser light in patients with carcinoma in situ in Barrett's esophagus or severe dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus.

 II.

 Evaluate the safety of the treatment on this patient.

 OUTLINE: This is a noncomparative study.

 PDT consists of IV porfimer sodium followed 40-50 hours later by laser red light delivered by optic fibers passed through the biopsy channel of an endoscope.

 Retreatment, if necessary, consists of up to 3 injections at least 30 days apart and up to 6 laser light treatments, with a maximum of 2 following each injection.

 Patients are followed monthly for 4 months, and then periodically for at least 5 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Photodynamic Therapy in Treating Patients With Early Esophageal Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses light and drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to light to kill tumor cells.

 This may be an effective treatment for esophageal cancer.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy in treating patients with Barrett's esophagus who have in situ esophageal cancer.
