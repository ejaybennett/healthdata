(secondQuint)Interleukin-12 in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Hodgkin's Disease.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the response rate of interleukin-12 in previously treated patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease.

 II.

 To determine the in vivo regulatory effect of interleukin-12 on Fas lingand (FasL) expression on patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes.

 OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease characteristics: low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (follicular small cleaved, follicular mixed, small lymphocytic, and variants) versus intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (follicular large, diffuse large, diffuse mixed, immunoblastic, peripheral T-cell, and mantle cell) versus Hodgkin's disease.

 Patients receive interleukin-12 subcutaneously twice a week.

 Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-105 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Interleukin-12 in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Hodgkin's Disease@highlight

Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-12 in treating patients with previously treated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease.

 Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill lymphoma cells.
