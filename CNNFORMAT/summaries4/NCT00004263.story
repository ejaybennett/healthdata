(thirdQuint)Cytarabine and UCN-01 in Treating Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the maximum tolerated dose of cytarabine when combined with UCN-01 in patients with refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.

 II.

 Determine the dose limiting toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of this regimen in these patients.

 III.

 Assess the antileukemia effect of this regimen in this patient population.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of cytarabine.

 Patients receive cytarabine IV over 24 hours on days 1-4 of each course.

 Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 24 hours on days 2-4 of course 1 and over 36 hours beginning on day 2 of subsequent courses.

 Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a maximum of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cytarabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 UCN-01 may make cancer cells more sensitive to cytarabine.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of cytarabine and UCN-01 in treating patients who have refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.
