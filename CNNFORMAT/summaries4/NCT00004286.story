(secondQuint)Phase III Multicenter Double Blind Controlled Trial of Human Immune Globulin Therapy in Previously Untreated Patients With Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Neuropathy.

 PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a double blind, randomized, controlled study.

 Patients receive either intravenous human immune globulin (IVIG) or placebo infused at a rate of 40 mL/hr, increasing every 30 min to a maximum of 100 mL/hr daily over 6 to 8 hours for 2 days.

 Patients not receiving additional treatment are released from study.

 Patients are evaluated on days 10, 21, and 43.
