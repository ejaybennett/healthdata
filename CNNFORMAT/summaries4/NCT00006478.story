(thirdQuint)Vaccine Therapy Following Chemotherapy and Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the humoral and cellular immune responses in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with autologous lymphoma-derived idiotype vaccine with keyhole limpet hemocyanin plus sargramostim (GM-CSF).

 - Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients in the post-transplant setting.

 - Determine the changes in quantitative bcl-2 in the blood and bone marrow of these patients before and at various times after the series of idiotype vaccines.

 OUTLINE: Vaccinations begin at day 100 or up to 6 months after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

 Patients receive autologous lymphoma-derived idiotype vaccine plus keyhole limpet hemocyanin subcutaneously (SC) on day 1.

 Sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC is administered on days 1-4.

 Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 4 doses, followed 12 weeks later by the fifth and final dose.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Vaccine Therapy Following Chemotherapy and Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@highlight

RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.

 Vaccine therapy may be an effective treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy following chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
