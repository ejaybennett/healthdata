(thirdQuint)Isolated Hepatic Perfusion With Melphalan in Treating Patients With Primary Unresectable Liver Cancer or Liver Metastases.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine response rate, duration of response, and patterns of recurrence in patients with primary or metastatic, unresectable cancers of the liver after treatment with isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan.

 - Determine the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: Patients who are otherwise eligible undergo an exploratory laparotomy of the peritoneal cavity.

 Patients with peritoneal seeding, unresectable extrahepatic metastases, or unresectable pathologically-involved lymph nodes outside area of portahepatis do not receive treatment.

 Remaining patients receive isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan.

 Liver perfusion proceeds for 1 hour.

 Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 4 months until disease progression.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 67 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Giving drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan works in treating patients with primary unresectable liver cancer or liver metastases.
