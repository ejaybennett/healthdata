(thirdQuint)Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma or Metastatic Kidney Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CD40-ligand when combined with fixed-dose flt3 ligand in patients with metastatic melanoma or renal cell cancer.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CD40-ligand.

 Patients receive fixed-dose flt3 ligand subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 1-14 and CD40-ligand SC daily on days 12-16.

 Treatment continues every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

 Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of CD40-ligand until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 Patients with progressive disease after 2 courses may be eligible to receive high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) standard therapy.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5 patients were accrued for this study.

 Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma or Metastatic Kidney Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as flt3L and CD40-ligand use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing.

 Biological therapy may be an effective treatment for metastatic melanoma and metastatic kidney cancer.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of flt3L combined with CD40-ligand in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma or metastatic kidney cancer.
