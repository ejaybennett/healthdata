(thirdQuint)SCH 66336 With or Without Gemcitabine Followed by Surgery Compared With Surgery Alone in Treating Patients With Primary Liver Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the biologic activity and toxicity of neoadjuvant SCH 66336 with or without gemcitabine followed by surgical resection vs surgical resection alone in patients with resectable primary liver cancer.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study.

 Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms.

 Arm I: Patients receive neoadjuvant oral SCH 66336 twice daily for 14 days followed by surgical resection.

 Arm II: Patients receive neoadjuvant oral SCH 66336 twice daily for 14 days and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 2 weeks followed by surgical resection.

 Arm III: Patients undergo surgical resection.

 Patients receive no neoadjuvant therapy prior to resection.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients (10 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of SCH 66336 with or without gemcitabine followed by surgery with that of surgery alone in treating patients who have primary liver cancer.
