(secondQuint)VNP40101M in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of VNP40101M in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas.

 - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the anti-tumor effects of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 15 minutes on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of VNP40101M until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
