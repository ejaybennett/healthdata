(secondQuint)Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Endometrial Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of erlotinib, in terms of response rate and duration of stable disease, in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic carcinoma of the endometrium.

 - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the time to progression and duration of response in patients treated with this drug.

 - Correlate objective tumor response with levels of epidermal growth factor receptor expression in patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

 Patients with complete or partial response or stable disease are also followed every 3 months until relapse or death.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.

 Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Endometrial Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as erlotinib may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of the tumor.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of erlotinib in treating patients who have locally advanced and/or metastatic endometrial cancer.
