(secondQuint)Infrared Coagulation in Preventing Anal Cancer in Patients With HIV Who Have Anal Neoplasia.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the recurrence rate of high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia in the anal canal of HIV-positive patients treated with infrared coagulation.

 - Determine the time to recurrence and time to progression in patients treated with this procedure.

 - Determine the toxicity of this procedure in these patients.

 - Correlate CD4/CD8 count and HIV viral load with outcome in patients treated with this procedure.

 - Correlate outcome with human papilloma virus subtype in patients treated with this procedure.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot, multicenter study.

 Patients undergo treatment with an infrared coagulator in direct contact with the lesion for 1.

5 seconds and necrotic tissue is then debrided.

 Treatment repeats to the level of the submucosal vessels under colposcopic guidance.

 A repeat biopsy is performed at 3 months to assess treatment success.

 Patients with incompletely treated lesions receive 1 more treatment.

 Up to 3 lesions are treated during each visit in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients complete questionnaires regarding anal pain and discomfort at baseline, at 4 weeks, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.

RATIONALE: Infrared coagulation may be effective in preventing the development of anal cancer in patients who have anal neoplasia.

 PURPOSE: Pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of infrared coagulation in preventing anal cancer in HIV-positive patients who have high-grade anal neoplasia.
