(secondQuint)Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in Individuals With Severe Mental Illness.

 A significant proportion of people with SMI who are treated within the public sector also suffer from PTSD.

 Evidence suggests that these individuals often receive inadequate mental health services because effective treatments have not been explored.

 This study will develop and implement a CBT treatment that is designed specifically for the SMI/PTSD population.

 In the first year of the study, a treatment manual and a CBT treatment model, including education, social skills training, and exposure therapy, will be developed.

 In the following two years, the treatment program will be tested in individuals with SMI and PTSD.

 Scale ratings, self-report checklists, and daily logs of behavior will be used to assess PTSD symptoms.

 Scale ratings and self-report surveys will also be used to measure hostility, functional status, depression and schizophrenia symptoms, and satisfaction with the study.

 Assessments will be made throughout the study.
