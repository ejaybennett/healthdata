(thirdQuint)High-Dose Intravenous Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (Kidney Cancer) That Has Not Responded to Previous Low-Dose Intravenous or Subcutaneous Interleukin-2.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate (complete, partial, and minor) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who failed prior low-dose intravenous or subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) when treated with high-dose intravenous IL-2.

 - Determine the overall survival, disease-free survival, and time to progression in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

 Patients receive high-dose interleukin-2 IV every 8 hours for 15 doses followed 7-10 days later by another 15 doses (course 1).

 Patients are assesed for response 2 months after initiation of treatment.

 Patients with responding or stable disease receive a second course of therapy.

 Patients with an ongoing response receive subsequent courses of treatment in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 6 months for survival.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.

 High-Dose Intravenous Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (Kidney Cancer) That Has Not Responded to Previous Low-Dose Intravenous or Subcutaneous Interleukin-2@highlight

RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well high-dose intravenous interleukin-2 works in treating patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that has not responded to previous low-dose intravenous or subcutaneous interleukin-2.
