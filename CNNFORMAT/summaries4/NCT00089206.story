(secondQuint)Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor immune response in patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma treated with vaccine comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Montanide ISA-51.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive vaccine comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Montanide ISA-51 on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, and 43.

 Patients undergo removal of the lymph node draining the vaccination site on day 22 to assess immune response.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 29 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery.
