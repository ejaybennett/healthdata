(thirdQuint)Laparoscopic Approach to Cancer of the Endometrium.

 This phase III international, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial is an equivalence study with the hypothesis is that Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH) is associated with equivalent disease-free survival when compared to the standard treatment of Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH) for women with apparent Stage I endometrial cancer.

 The secondary hypotheses are: - TLH is associated with equivalent or improved Quality of Life (QoL) at 6 months; - TLH is associated with reduced treatment-related morbidity; - TLH is associated with shorter hospital stay; - TLH is associated with less analgesic consumption; - TLH is cost effective; - TLH is associated with improved pelvic floor function.

The primary objective of this study is to assess disease-free survival at 4.

5 years postoperatively for women with apparent Stage 1 endometrial cancer, comparing patients who are randomised to receive Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH) and patients who are randomised to receive Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH).
