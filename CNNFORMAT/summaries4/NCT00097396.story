(thirdQuint)Safety, Tolerability & Immunogenicity of the Recombinant Plague Vaccine rF1V.

 The Phase 1 clinical trial is designed as an open-label, single-center, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a two-dose regimen of rF1V in healthy volunteers at four dose-levels (20 ug, 40 ug, 80 ug and 160 ug rF1V) in four sequential cohorts.

 The protocol was amended 26 January 2006 to recruit volunteers from Cohort 4 to participate in an Extension.

 Cohort 4 Extension volunteers will receive a third vaccination at day E-0.

 Day E-0 (-1) should not exceed Day 240 of the Phase 1 study.

 Safety, Tolerability & Immunogenicity of the Recombinant Plague Vaccine rF1V@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a two-dose schedule of the recombinant plague vaccine rF1V in healthy volunteers when given as an intramuscular (IM) injection at four ascending dose-levels.

 The purpose of the Cohort 4 Extension is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a third intramuscular (IM) dose of 160 ug rF1V in healthy volunteers who have previously been vaccinated with the same concentration of rF1V vaccine.
