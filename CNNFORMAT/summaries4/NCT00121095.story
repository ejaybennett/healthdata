(secondQuint)Study of Samarium Sm-153 Lexidronam Combined With Docetaxel for Patients With Prostate Cancer.

 The principal objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and anti-tumor effects of a novel bone-targeted regimen consisting of Samarium Sm-153 lexidronam combined with docetaxel and prednisone.

 This present study design permits evaluation of the clinical activity of combining two distinct agents that have shown benefit for the treatment of patients with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer and bone metastases.

 It enables assessment of potential synergistic interactions between a cytotoxic chemotherapy agent and a bone-targeting radioisotope agent in the setting of a bone-targeted therapy.
