The purpose of this intervention is to find out whether intravaginal treatment with a gel containing an antibiotic (metronidazole), compared to a similar placebo gel (without antibiotic), can reduce the frequency of bacterial vaginosis, a common vaginal infection among African women who are HIV uninfected or HIV infected.

 The study will also determine the effect of these vaginal gels on genitourinary symptoms.
