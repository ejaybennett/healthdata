(fifthQuint)Positronic Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging in Post Radiation Evaluation of Head and Neck Tumours (PET PREVENT Trial).

 PET-Fluorodeoxyglucose scanning is an imaging test based on the increased uptake of radiolabelled glucose by tumour cells.

 PET might detect neck tumours better than other imaging tests.

 This is a cohort study in which patients with N2 N3 squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck undergo a PET and a CT scan at baseline and then post-radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

 Then, they undergo neck dissection surgery.

 The PET and CT results are compared with the presence or absence of tumours in the neck nodes.

 If PET is sufficiently accurate in predicting the presence or absence of tumours in the neck nodes, then a neck dissection could be avoided.

 Positronic Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging in Post Radiation Evaluation of Head and Neck Tumours (PET PREVENT Trial)@highlight

The purpose of this trial is to determine the ability of positron emission tomography (PET) to detect residual cancer in neck lymph nodes of patients following curative treatment with radiation therapy for squamous cell cancer arising in the head and neck.

 Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) undergo treatment of curative intent; patients who are node positive (N2 N3 stages) undergo standard management which includes post-radiation planned neck dissection but two thirds of patients end up not having evidence of residual disease in neck dissection specimens; these patients could have avoided surgery.

 However, currently used standard tests, like computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot reliably predict who is post-radiation disease free.
