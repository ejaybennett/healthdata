(firstQuint)Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of ATL-104 in Oral Mucositis.

 Mucositis is a serious side effect of cancer therapy and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant (PBSCT) which requires appropriate and effective management.

 Mucositis is a condition in which there is inflammation and ulceration of the mouth, throat and gut caused by damage to the mucosal barrier induced by chemo- and radiotherapy.

 Symptoms include pain, nausea, abdominal cramping, and vomiting.

 This study will investigate whether ATL-104, when administered as a swallowable mouthwash, is safe and well tolerated in patients undergoing PBSCT and to investigate its potential to reduce the level of severity of mucositis associated with PBSCT.
