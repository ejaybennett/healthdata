(fifthQuint)Vein-Coronary Atherosclerosis And Rosiglitazone After Bypass Surgery: The VICTORY Trial.

 STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective multicenter randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial assessing the efficacy and safety of rosiglitazone in the prevention of atherosclerosis progression in vein grafts and native coronary arteries of diabetic patients.

 Stable diabetic patients with previous coronary bypass surgery ( 1 year 10 years) will be screened.

 After baseline evaluation, all eligible patients will undergo baseline coronary angiogram.

 IVUS will be performed in a segment length of at least 40 mm in a SVG suitable for IVUS analysis and in a segment length of at least 20 mm in the anastomosed native coronary artery corresponding to the SVG chosen.

 Following the IVUS procedure, patients will be randomized to either rosiglitazone treatment or to placebo in addition to their standard clinical care.

 Study drug will be titrated over an 8-week period up to a dose of 8 mg/day (or to maximum tolerated dose).

 The patients will receive the study drug or the placebo for 50-54 weeks in a double-blind manner.

 At the beginning and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months of treatment, patients will be subjected to a set of morphological, physiological and metabolic evaluations.

 At the final visit (12 months), patients will also be submitted to IVUS and angiography.

 Vein-Coronary Atherosclerosis And Rosiglitazone After Bypass Surgery: The VICTORY Trial@highlight

HYPOTHESES - Rosiglitazone in diabetic patients with previous coronary bypass surgery may prevent or slow the progression of atherosclerosis in SVGs and native coronary arteries.

 - Rosiglitazone has favorable effects on adipose tissue distribution variables as well as on thrombosis, pro-inflammatory, and lipid profiles in diabetic patients after coronary bypass artery surgery.

 - Rosiglitazone therapy influences favorably metabolism and clinical outcomes in diabetic patients after coronary artery bypass surgery.

 OBJECTIVES - PRIMARY To assess the efficacy of rosiglitazone to reduce atherosclerosis progression in vein grafts in diabetic patients after coronary bypass surgery by using IVUS imaging after a 12 mo follow-up.

 - SECONDARY - To prospectively compare the secondary IVUS endpoints.

 - To prospectively compare the angiographic endpoints.

 - To prospectively compare the metabolic risk factor endpoints.

 - To prospectively compare the body composition and distribution endpoints.

 - To prospectively compare the clinical outcomes of rosiglitazone versus standard care using composite endpoints.
