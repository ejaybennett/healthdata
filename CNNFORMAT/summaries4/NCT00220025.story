(firstQuint)Narrowband UVB Light Therapy to Patients With Dark Skin Types Who Have 10% of Their Body Involved With Psoriasis Vulgaris.

.

 Two groups of patients, having 10% of their body surface area involved with psoriasis vulgaris, will receive narrowband phototherapy.

 One group will have skin type I-IV, or light skin and the second group will have dark skin, or type V-VI.

 All patients will receive phototherapy, with narrowband UVB, three times a week for six weeks, or a total of 18 treatments.

 6mm punch skin biopsies will be done prior to starting therapy and at the completion of the study.

 Clinical assessments and photography will be done parallel to the skin biopsies.

 Results (clinically and histologically) of both groups will be compared.
