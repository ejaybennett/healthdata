(fifthQuint)Pyridoxine in Preventing Hand-Foot Syndrome in Patients Who Are Receiving Liposomal Doxorubicin for Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the efficacy of pyridoxine vs placebo in preventing palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) in patients receiving doxorubicin HCl liposome for recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cavity cancer, metastatic breast cancer, or advanced endometrial cancer.

 - Compare quality of life in patients treated with these regimens.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study.

 Patients are stratified according to cancer type (ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cavity cancer vs breast cancer vs endometrial cancer).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV 40mg/m2 over 1 hour on day 1 and oral pyridoxine 100 mg twice daily on days 1-28.

 - Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV 40mg/m2 over 1 hour on day 1 and oral placebo 100 mg twice daily on days 1-28.

 In both arms, treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients who develop grade 2-3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia despite dose reduction of doxorubicin HCl liposome are unblinded and removed from the study (for patients in arm I) OR receive oral pyridoxine twice daily beginning day 1 of the next planned therapy (for patients in arm II).

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline and after every third course of therapy.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 6 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Pyridoxine in Preventing Hand-Foot Syndrome in Patients Who Are Receiving Liposomal Doxorubicin for Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) may prevent or lessen hand-foot syndrome caused by chemotherapy.

 It is not yet known whether pyridoxine is more effective than a placebo in preventing hand-foot syndrome.

 PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying pyridoxine to see how well it works compared to a placebo in preventing hand-foot syndrome in patients who are receiving liposomal doxorubicin for recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, metastatic breast cancer, or advanced endometrial cancer.
