(secondQuint)Spinal Anesthesia With Articaine and Lidocaine for Outpatient Surgery.

.

 The ideal spinal anesthesia in day-case surgery is characterized by a short onset of sensory and motor blockade, and a rapid recovery after the operation.

 Short-acting local-anesthetics are used frequently in this setting.

 Lidocaine is one of the agents that is used most frequently.

 It has been associated with an increased incidence of Transient Neurological Symptoms (TNS).

 Articaine is another agent that is being used more often and is said to act faster and shorter than lidocaine.

 We will compare spinal anesthesia with lidocaine and articaine in a randomized double-blind clinical trial.

 Endpoint are: - onset of sensory and motor block - recovery from sensory and motor block - time to micturition - patient satisfaction - complications.

 Spinal Anesthesia With Articaine and Lidocaine for Outpatient Surgery.

@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare two short-acting local anesthetics, articaine and lidocaine, for spinal anesthesia in day-case surgery.

 The onset time of the sensory- and motor block, recovery time until discharge and complications will be studied.
