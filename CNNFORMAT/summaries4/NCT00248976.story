(fifthQuint)Improving Health Behavior and Outcomes After Angioplasty.

 1.

 To determine whether patients who receive the net-present value intervention have more improvements in their risk factor profile than those in the control group at two years.

 2.

 To determine whether the net-present value intervention will enable patients to sustain behavioral change over the long-term.

 3.

 To determine whether the net-present value intervention will improve overall functional status and prevent further disability.

 The long-term objective of this study is to determine whether a net-present value approach for motivation behavior change is effective in reducing risk factors, improving treatment outcomes, and enhancing quality of life among a high-risk group of patients.

 Improving Health Behavior and Outcomes After Angioplasty@highlight

The objective of this randomized trials is to evaluate, among coronary artery disease patients who have just had either angioplasty or stents, whether a novel intervention based on feedback of individualized risk profiles framed as the opportunity to reduce one's biological age is more effective after two years in reducing mortality and major cardiovascular morbidity (specifically, myocardial infarction, stroke, class II-IV angina, and severe ischemia) than the standard risk reduction approach, which is framed as one's opportunity to reduce future risk.

 The novel strategy is based on the theory of net-present value and is tested in coronary artery disease patients who have a high risk of adverse outcomes by two years.
