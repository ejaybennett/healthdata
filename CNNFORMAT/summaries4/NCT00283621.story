 The use of hematopoietic growth factors have been shown to reduce neutropenic complications and red cell transfusion requirements associated with chemotherapy.

 This trial will study the combination of pegfilgrastim and darbepoetin alfa administered once per cycle of chemotherapy.

 Prior experience with growth factors in this setting provides historical data for comparison of safety and activity of these newer longer acting growth factors in reducing the incidence of febrile neutropenia requiring antibiotics and anemia requiring transfusions.

 The once dosing per cycle would simplify the patient management and would improve patient convenience and compliance.
