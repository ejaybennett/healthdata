(thirdQuint)Early Alimentation Following Colorectal Surgery.

 Following intestinal surgery, the classical protocol indicates the use of a naso-gastric tube and starvation more or less prolonged of the patient dependent of surgeon's view.

 Decision to feed the patient is based on gas and feces reappearance after surgery.

 However, prolonged starvation might be uncomfortable for the patient as well as increasing his hospitalization stay.

 Moreover, delayed feeding effect on anastomosis and wound healing is controversial and naso-gastric tube use is known to be uncomfortable and may generate secondary adverse events.

 Some studies in opened surgery observed that early alimentation was beneficial against post-surgery mortality, infection risk and anastomosis dehiscence.

 In addition, early feeding seemed to decrease patient hospitalisation stay.

 In order to conduct this study, patients having a colorectal surgery will be randomly attributed to the nil per os group, which is based on the reappearance of a functional intestinal transit, or to the experimental group, which will begin alimentation 12 hours after colorectal surgery.

 Early Alimentation Following Colorectal Surgery@highlight

This study wants to address the question of whether or not oral alimentation should be begun early in patients following colorectal surgery compared to the classical diet which depends on reappearance of functional intestinal transit.

 Early oral alimentation following colorectal surgery may decrease hospitalisation stay duration.
