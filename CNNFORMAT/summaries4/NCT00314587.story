(firstQuint)Treatment of Unstable Both-Bone Midshaft Forearm Fractures in Children.

 Children who arrive at the emergency unit with an unstable both-bone midshaft forearm fracture will be asked to join the trial.

 If the fracture will be unstable during reposition in the operating room, a randomization between 1 or 2 ESIN will be done.

 The aftertreatment will be the same for both groups: above elbow plaster for 3 weeks.

 Outpatient clinic visits till a follow-up of 9 months.

 During these visits we will investigate: consolidation and dislocation on X-ray, function of both arms, complaints in daily living and complications.
