(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Safety Study of Magnesium Iron Hydroxycarbonate for the Reduction of High Blood Phosphate in Hemodialysis Patients.

 High levels of phosphate in the blood are linked with serious effects, due to calcium imbalances (high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone disease, formation of calcium deposits in the body, and blood-vessel disease).

 Current guidelines indicate that blood phosphorus levels should be maintained between 1.

13 to 1.

78 mmol/L in patients who receive hemodialysis.

 This study is designed to investigate magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate's ability to lower and control patients' blood phosphate to the recommended levels and compare the average blood phosphate, calcium, calcium-phosphate product, PTH and magnesium concentrations and overall safety with placebo (or "dummy") tablets.

 Efficacy and Safety Study of Magnesium Iron Hydroxycarbonate for the Reduction of High Blood Phosphate in Hemodialysis Patients@highlight

Magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate is a phosphate binder that absorbs phosphate from food, reducing the amount that the body can absorb.

 The purpose of this study it to look at how effective and safe Magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate is in controlling levels of phosphate in the blood in patients who receive hemodialysis.
