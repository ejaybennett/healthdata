(thirdQuint)Efficacy of Shoulder Mobilisation Versus Conventional Immobilisation for Nonsurgically Proximal Humerus Fracture.

 Methods: We randomly assigned 74 patients with impacted nonsurgically treated proximal humerus fracture to receive early passive mobilisation or conventional-treatment.

 The primary outcome was functional assessment of the shoulder (Constant score) at 3 months.

 Secondary outcomes were functional assessment at 6 weeks and at 6 months, change in pain (on a visual analogue scale) and passive range of motion.

 Efficacy of Shoulder Mobilisation Versus Conventional Immobilisation for Nonsurgically Proximal Humerus Fracture@highlight

Background: Nonsurgical proximal humerus fracture is common, causing prolonged disability, for which the time to begin rehabilitation is not well determined.

 We assessed the feasibility and efficacy of early (within 3 days'after fracture) mobilisation of the shoulder compared with conventional 3-week immobilization followed by physiotherapy.
