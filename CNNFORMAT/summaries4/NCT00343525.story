(thirdQuint)Repeat-Dose Study of Bavituximab in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C.

 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a world wide public health concern and is the most common chronic bloodborne infection in the United States and the leading indication for liver transplantation.

 Laboratory and animal studies have demonstrated that bavituximab binds viruses and virally infected cells and prolongs survival in lethally infected animals.

 This study will examine the safety and tolerability of bavituximab when administered as multiple infusions to patients with chronic HCV infection.

 Groups of patients will be treated with escalating doses of bavituximab twice weekly for 2 weeks and followed for 12 weeks.
