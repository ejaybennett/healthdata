(firstQuint)A Randomized Phase I Study of a Hepatitis B Antigen Combined With IMP321.

 In each cohort, 8 subjects will receive the hepatitis B antigen (10 mu g) with IMP321 at one dose, 2 subjects will receive the reference hepatitis B antigen (10 mu g) alone with physiological saline and 2 subjects will receive the commercial vaccine Engerix B(R) (20 mu g).

 Engerix B(R) will be administered intramuscularly.

 The other treatments will be administered subcutaneously.

 The four successive cohorts of volunteers will be: Cohort A: - 8 subjects treated by hepatitis B antigen (10 mu g HbsAg, subtype adw, without alum) with IMP321 (3 mu g), - 2 subjects treated by hepatitis B antigen (10 mu g HbsAg, subtype adw, without alum) with physiological saline, - 2 subjects treated by the commercial hepatitis vaccine Engerix B(R) (20 mu g HBsAg with alum).

 If the tolerability of this cohort is acceptable, the following cohort will be done.

 Cohort B: - 8 subjects treated by hepatitis B antigen (10 mu g HbsAg, subtype adw, without alum) with IMP321 (10 mu g), - 2 subjects treated by hepatitis B antigen (10 mu g HbsAg, subtype adw, without alum) with Physiological saline, - 2 subjects treated by the commercial hepatitis vaccine Engerix B(R) (20 mu g HBsAg with alum).

 If the tolerability of this cohort is acceptable, the following cohort will be done.

 Cohort C: - 8 subjects treated by hepatitis B antigen (10 mu g HbsAg, subtype adw, without alum) with IMP321 (30 mu g), - 2 subjects treated by hepatitis B antigen (10 mu g HbsAg, subtype adw, without alum) with physiological saline, - 2 subjects treated by the commercial hepatitis vaccine Engerix B(R) (20 mu g HBsAg with alum).

 If the tolerability of this cohort is acceptable, the following cohort will be done.

 Cohort D: - 8 subjects treated by hepatitis B antigen (10 mu g HbsAg, subtype adw, without alum) with IMP321 (100 mu g), - 2 subjects treated by hepatitis B antigen (10 mu g HbsAg, subtype adw, without alum) with physiological saline - 2 subjects treated by the commercial hepatitis vaccine Engerix B(R) (20 mu g HBsAg with alum).

 Blood samples will be collected on the morning of days 1, 29, 36, 57 and 85 for pharmacodynamic evaluation.

 Monitoring for the occurrence of adverse events (AE), changes in physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration), electrocardiograms (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry, haematology, urinalysis) will be performed before and after each dose of the study drug to assess safety and tolerability.

 A Randomized Phase I Study of a Hepatitis B Antigen Combined With IMP321@highlight

This is a single centre, three single administrations (Days 1, 29 and 57) at increasing doses of IMP321 (3, 10, 30 and 100 mu g) in four cohorts of 12 subjects, single blind, randomized study.
