(thirdQuint)Comparison of Acular LS With Lotemax to Prevent Inflammation After Cataract Surgery and Intraocular Lens Implantation.

 Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) which, when administered systemically, has demonstrated analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyretic activity.

 The mechanism of its action is thought to be due to its ability to inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis (cyclo-oxigenase inhibitors).

 However, they leave the lipoxygenase pathway free to generate leukotrienes.

 This pharmacodynamic activity has been speculated as a reason why NSAIDs produce less ocular side effects than corticosteroids.

 It has been widely used in ophthalmology.

 In 1987, Flach1 published its effectiveness in the treatment of aphakic and pseudophakic macular edema.

 Its efficacy after cataract surgery has been shown2 and it has been compared to topical steroids after extra-capsular cataract extraction3,4,5 and phacoemulsification6,7.

 It has been used as analgesic after radial keratotomy(RK)8,9, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK)10 and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK)11 The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the NSAID ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution 0.

 Comparison of Acular LS With Lotemax to Prevent Inflammation After Cataract Surgery and Intraocular Lens Implantation@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of Acular LS(R) and Lotemax(R) in the prevention of inflammation in the eye after cataract surgery.

 Acular LS is made by Allergan, Inc.

 It is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use following cataract surgery.

 Lotemax is made by Bausch & Lomb.
