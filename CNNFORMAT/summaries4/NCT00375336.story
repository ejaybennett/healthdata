(thirdQuint)Risk Factors Associated With Calcification of the Aortic Valve.

 Cardiovascular disease, mainly coronary artery disease, causes more than one half of deaths in the developed countries.

 Only recently, calcific aortic valve disease, was proved to belong to the family of atherosclerosis.

 It is associated with higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the cause of which is not entirely clear.

 The link to significant coronary artery disease, probably, is of highest importance.

 We compare groups of patients with coronary artery disease and calcific stenotic, sclerotic or intact aortic valve.

 The aim is to assess and compare their risk profile to verify our hypothesis that, within significant coronary artery disease, calcific aortic valve identifies a subgroup of patients with higher cardiovascular risk, assessed by endothelial dysfunction and the two year follow-up of cardiovascular events on optimally set treatment.

 Further, we study the possible association of valvular calcification and calcium metabolism in patients with normal kidney function.

 Risk Factors Associated With Calcification of the Aortic Valve@highlight

The purpose of this study is - to determine the degree of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in calcific aortic valve disease associated with coronary artery disease(CAD).

 - to determine whether there is relationship between calcium metabolism and calcific aortic valve disease associated with CAD.
