(secondQuint)Risk Adapted Therapy Optimization for Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive Non-Hodgkin-Lymphoma.

 Initial Cytoreduction is performed with DHAP- protocol using dexamethasone, cytarabine and cisplatin followed by high dose chemotherapy with treosulfan, etoposide and cisplatin (TEC) an autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation(aPBSCT).

 In case of only partial remission a second identical high dose chemotherapy and aPBSCT follows.

 Patients with primary refractory disease or early relapse within 6 months should receive a allogenous stem cell transplantation.

 For Patients with CD 20 positive B-cell lymphoma the chemotherapy regiments DHAP and TEC are combined with rituximab.
