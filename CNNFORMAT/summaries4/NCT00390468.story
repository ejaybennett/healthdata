(secondQuint)Tandutinib in Treating Patients With Progressive Prostate Cancer and Bone Metastases.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the time to progression in patients with progressive androgen-independent prostate cancer with bone metastases treated with tandutinib.

 Secondary - Determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline rate by 50% (PSA response), using the PSA Working Group Criteria, in patients treated with this regimen .

 - Evaluate modulation of bone pain and bone markers in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the objective tumor response by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) criteria in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral tandutinib twice daily on days 1-28.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Bone pain is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of course 3, and at disease progression.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Tandutinib in Treating Patients With Progressive Prostate Cancer and Bone Metastases@highlight

RATIONALE: Tandutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well tandutinib works in treating patients with progressive prostate cancer and bone metastases.
