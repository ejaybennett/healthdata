(fifthQuint)Clobetasol Versus Pimecrolimus for Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus.

 Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic cutaneous disorder affecting approximately one in seventy women.

 Presenting symptoms may include intense pruritis, pain, burning, and severe dyspareunia.

 The typical lesions of LS are white plaques and papules, often with areas of echymosis, excoriation, and ulceration.

 Often, LS causes destruction of the vulva architecture.

 In addition, 4-6% percent of women with LS will develop vulvar carcinoma.

 The histopathologic changes of LS are distinctive and make biopsy a very useful diagnostic tool.

 While there is no known cure for LS, the current gold standard treatment is ultra-potent corticosteroids.

 When properly administered, topical ultra-potent corticosteroids help to resolve the symptoms of pruritis and burning and can prevent further vulvar scarring.

 In addition, proper treatment reverses the underlying histopathologic changes of LS, and preliminary data shows that the risk of malignant transformation also declines.

 Although treatment with topical corticosteroids is effective, topical corticosteroids have serious local and systemic side effects, including dermal thinning, skin atrophy, superimposed fungal infections, rebound dermatitis, and adrenal insufficiency.

 Pimecrolimus cream 1% (Elidel(R), Novartis Pharmaceutical) is a topical calcineurin inhibitor that binds to macrophilin-12 and inhibits cytokine synthesis by T lymphocytes.

 Elidel has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.

 In theory, as Elidel inhibits T lymphocytes, it should effectively treat lichen sclerosus.

 In addition, as Elidel does not inhibit keratinocytes, or affect collagen synthesis, it does not cause dermal atrophy.

 Therefore, Elidel may be an effective and safer alternative treatment for LS.

 This study is designed to compare the effectiveness and safety of Elidel 1% cream versus an ultra-potent corticosteroid (clobetasol 0.

05% cream) for the treatment for vulvar LS.

 Clobetasol Versus Pimecrolimus for Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus@highlight

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a skin condition of the external genitals (vulva) of women.

 LS causes vulvar itching, pain, and burning.

 In addition, LS causes scarring of the vulva which may cause significant sexual dysfunction or pain.

 Lastly, 4-6% of women with LS will develop vulvar cancer.

 The current "gold standard" treatment for lichen sclerosus is ultra-potent topical corticosteroids.

 When properly administered, topical ultra-potent corticosteroids help to resolve the symptoms of itching and burning and can prevent further vulvar scarring.

 In addition, proper treatment reverses the underlying inflammation of LS, and preliminary data shows that the risk of cancer also declines.

 While effective, topical corticosteroids have serious local and systemic side effects that include thinning of the skin, superimposed fungal infections, and suppression of the adrenal gland.

 Elidel 1% cream is a new type of medication that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of eczema.

 In theory, Elidel should also treat LS without the serious side effects that accompany corticosteroids.

 Therefore, this study is designed to compare the effectiveness and safety of a topical corticosteroid (clobetasol) versus Elidel 1% cream for the treatment of LS.
