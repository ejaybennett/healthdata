(secondQuint)Impact of a Computerized Guidelines on the Management of Hypertension and Diabetes.

 Existing computer-based ordering systems for physicians provide drug-centred checks but offer little assistance for optimizing the overall patient-centred treatment strategy.

 The ASTI project aims : 1.

 to design a guideline-based decision support system for diabetic and/or hypertensive patients, to help general practitioners : 1.

 to carry out procedures (clinical and biological tests) according to guidelines (the recommended procedure at the recommended moment), and to get a synthetic view of all the elements they need to follow-up the patient 2.

 to avoid prescription errors and to improve compliance with therapeutic guidelines.

 The " critic mode " operates as a background process and corrects the physician's prescription on the basis of automatically triggered elementary rules that account for isolated guideline recommendations.

 The " guided mode " directs the physician to the best treatment by browsing a comprehensive guideline knowledge base represented as a decision tree.

 2.

 To measure the impact of ASTI when it is implemented with an electronic medical record system.

 We adopt a randomized design, with the practice as the unit of randomization.

 Impact of a Computerized Guidelines on the Management of Hypertension and Diabetes@highlight

The purpose is to determine wether an electronic decision support system based on national guidelines is effective to improve the follow-up and the treatment of two conditions: hypertension and diabetes, in primary care practices.
