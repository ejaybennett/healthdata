(secondQuint)Intraocular Pressure Accuracy and Variability of the Barraquer Tonometer.

 Intraocular pressure will be checked using four different methods of tonometry.

 These four methods will include Tonopen, Goldmann applanation tonometry, Schiotz tonometry, and Barraquer tonometer.

 The data will then be compared to determine the reliability and accuracy of the Barraquer tonometer.
