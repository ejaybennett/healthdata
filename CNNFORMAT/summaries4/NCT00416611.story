(secondQuint)IMPlementation of gUideLines for the Management of Arterial hypertenSION.

 The IMPULSION Study.

 Physicians from 20 hospitals and 40 health centres (primary health care settings) were trained to implement guidelines in treating arterial hypertension.

 There will be a baseline recording of patients with arterial hypertension and then physicians will have to complete a one page form (by ticking pre-specified boxes) about the baseline status of the patients and will have to report the measures they took to improve awareness, treatment, and effective control of arterial hypertension.

 After a six month effort, physicians will have to complete the same form at study completion.

 Previous training of physicians and the fact that they will have to report their success in treating hypertension will hopefully contribute to an increase in number of hypertensive patients at blood pressure target, and will minimise the target organ damage.

 The estimated reduction in coronary heart disease risk will be evaluated by a comparison of this risk (as evaluated by a risk engine, i.

e.

 PROCAM) at study completion with that of baseline.

 The IMPULSION Study@highlight

The objective of this protocol is to improve awareness, treatment, and control of arterial hypertension, within primary prevention of target organ damage, by implementing guidelines, after training of the participating physicians.
