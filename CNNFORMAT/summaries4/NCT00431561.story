(secondQuint)Phase IIb Clinical Trial With TGF-2 Antisense Compound AP 12009 for Recurrent or Refractory High-grade Glioma.

 The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of two doses of AP 12009 and standard chemotherapy in adult patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma [AA], WHO grade III; or glioblastoma [GBM], WHO grade IV).

 AP 12009 is a phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide specific for the mRNA of human transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGF-beta2).

 The growth factor TGF-beta plays a key role in malignant progression of various tumors by inducing proliferation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis and escape from immunosurveillance.

 It has been shown that in a number of tumor types the degree of TGF-beta production strongly correlates with tumor grade and stage.

 In patients with high-grade glioma, the TGF-beta2 overexpression is associated with disease stage, clinical prognosis and the immunodeficient state of the patients.

In this multinational dose finding Phase IIb study the efficacy and safety of two doses of AP 12009 compared to standard chemotherapy (temozolomide or PCV) is investigated in adult patients with confirmed recurrent high-grade glioma.
