(secondQuint)Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation by Minimal Invasive Surgery.

 Atrial fibrillation is a major health problem.

Despite adequate treatment of underlying heart disease, rhythm control is unsuccessful in almost half of patients, also in patients with lone atrial fibrillation.

If patients remain highly symptomatic, a non-pharmacological approach may be considered including pulmonary vein isolation and Cox maze III surgery.

 Maze III surgery has high succes rates, however it includes major cardiac surgery with substantial risk of complications.

 New surgical strategies for symptomatic lone atrial fibrillation focus on minimal invasive off-pump procedures omitting cardiopulmonary bypass (and thus lowering the complication rate), while taking advantage of an easier approach to the ablation site and a shorter procedure time.

 Epicardial surgical ablation isolating pulmonary veins by high intensity focused ultrasound performed off-pump by Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS)may be a promising treatment option.

 In this pilot study, we aim to study the feasibility of this new surgical ablation approach in patients with lone atrial fibrillation.

The purpose of this study is to determine the feasability of a new epicardial and minimal invasive ablation technique of the left atrium isolating the pulmonary veins for prevention of atrial fibrillation recurrences in patients with antiarrhythmic drug refractory lone atrial fibrillation.
