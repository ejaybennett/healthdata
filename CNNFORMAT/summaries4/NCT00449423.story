(firstQuint)Metabolic Modulation as Treatment in Acute Heart Failure.

 Acute heart failure is a serious disease that despite modern therapies carries a high mortality.

 Inotropic drugs improve patient status but yield a higher risk of death.

 Previous studies have shown that myocardial contractility improves when glucose fermentation is up regulated and decreases when Free Fatty Acids are high.

 In a placebo-controlled design we wish to shift myocardial substrate metabolism towards increased glucose uptake and utilization and measure hemodynamics and biochemical markers of metabolism and prognosis.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether metabolic modulation improves hemodynamics and outcome in acute heart failure
