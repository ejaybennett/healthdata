(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Using GlucoSat Technology For Non-Invasive Glucose Measurement.

 Primary Endpoint Parameter cent Primary study endpoint will be to establish the safety of using the GlucoSat technology as a non-invasive glucose level measurement technology.

 Safety will be established by paucity of adverse events.

 Adverse Events occurrence will be documented throughout the study.

 Secondary Endpoint Parameters Efficacy of the GlucoSat technology will be assessed by: - Proving the accuracy and precision of the GlucoSat technology by comparing the glucose level measured by the GlucoSat device to the glucose level observed by any certified for clinics invasive device.

 Inter device variability should be within 15%.

 - Patient satisfaction questionnaire.

 - Physician satisfaction will be assessed by questionnaire.
