(secondQuint)Dasatinib in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the progression-free survival at 12 weeks in patients with stage IIIB or IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with dasatinib.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the rate of response in patients treated with this drug.

 II.

 Examine the relationship between clinical response to this drug and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutational status, EGFR copy number, and pSrc expression levels in pre-treatment tumor biopsies.

 III.

 Determine the toxicity of this drug.

 OUTLINE: Patients received oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-21.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Previously obtained paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples are analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for epidermal growth factor receptor and by immunohistochemistry for pSrc expression.

 Dasatinib in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 This phase II trial is studying how well dasatinib works in treating patients with stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.
