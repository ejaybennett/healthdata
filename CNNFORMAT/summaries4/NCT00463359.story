(thirdQuint)A Pilot Study of the Treatment of Facial Nodular and Nodulocystic Basal Cell Carcinoma With Double Curettage and Cautery Followed by Application of Imiquimod to the Base.

 Basal Cell Carcinomas (BCC) are the commonest form of skin cancer in the white population.

 The face is where they most frequently occur and the nodular BCCs are the commonest type.

 Curettage and cautery/electrodessication (C&C) has been an established way of management of nodular BCCs for years, being a simple surgical procedure readily performed in outpatient clinics with good aesthetic results and high cure rates.

 The purpose of this study is to determine recurrence rates of nodular BCCs on the face removed with C&C followed by application of Imiquimod cream to the base and further to achieve lower recurrence rates than after treatment with C&C alone.

 Imiquimod is an immune response modifier with anti-tumour effects already licensed for the treatment of superficial BCCs in the UK.
