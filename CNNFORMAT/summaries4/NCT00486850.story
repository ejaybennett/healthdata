(fifthQuint)Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV) Versus Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) In Preterm Infants With Respiratory Distress.

 Respiratory management: SIMV group: Infants randomized to SIMV will be maintained on SIMV per standard unit protocol.

 Infant can be progressively weaned and extubated to NCPAP if infant meets the minimum criteria for extubation.

 Caffeine will be administered around the time of extubation.

 NIPPV group: Extubated to NIPPV within 120 minutes of birth if the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is less than 0.

60 after the first dose of surfactant.

 Caffeine will be administered around the time of extubation.

 Infant can be reintubated if clinical parameters necessitate mechanical ventilation.

 NIPPV may be discontinued when patients are weaned to a positive end expiratory pressure of 5 cmsH20 with back up rate -error of 0.

05).

 An additional 10 patients (10%) will be allowed for to accommodate for dropouts.

 Primary Endpoint: Analyses of the primary endpoint will be based on intention to treat (ITT) analysis of all randomized, eligible subjects.

 Statistical analyses will be performed by using Student's t test for continuous normally distributed variables and with the Wilcoxon rank sum test for non-parametric variables.

 Comparison of proportions and analysis of categorical variables will be performed using 2-tailed Fisher's exact test and logistic regression analysis.

 A p value of < 0.

05 will be considered statistically significant.

 Secondary Endpoints: The secondary efficacy analyses will be performed using the ITT population.

 The following secondary variables that will be analyzed include need for additional doses of surfactant, duration of mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen, days on nasal CPAP, postnatal steroid use for BPD, growth (weight on day 28 and 36 weeks PMA, and/or discharge) and length of hospital stay.

 A p-value of less than 0.

05 will be considered significant for testing the effect of each factor.

 A multiple regression analysis may be employed as required if confounding effects are identified within the study (e.

g.

, gestational age, race, center, antenatal or postnatal steroid use).

 Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV) Versus Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) In Preterm Infants With Respiratory Distress@highlight

Title of Study: A Prospective, Randomized, Multicenter Trial Comparing Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV) vs.

 Early Extubation to Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) after Surfactant Treatment in Preterm Infants with Respiratory Distress Treatment Period (Planned): 7 days Objectives: To compare the impact of early extubation [within 120 minutes of birth to Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV group) vs.

 Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV group) on the incidence of mechanical ventilation via endotracheal tube at 7 days of age in 26 to 29 + 6 weeks gestation premature infants with respiratory distress treated with intratracheal Curosurf (poractant alpha) within 60 minutes of birth.

 Secondary objectives include evaluation of overall clinical outcomes at 7 days, 28 days, and 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) and/or at discharge, complications, safety, and adverse events.
