(thirdQuint)Topical Tazarotene in Treating Patients With Basal Cell Skin Cancer and Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome on the Face.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether topical tazarotene, administered over a period of 18 months as a chemopreventive agent, reduces the incidence of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) on treated skin in patients with basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS).

 - Expand and refine chemopreventive strategies in patients with BCNS who are at high risk for the development of BCCs.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

 Patients apply topical tazarotene cream to the face once daily for 18 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

 Topical Tazarotene in Treating Patients With Basal Cell Skin Cancer and Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome on the Face@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as tazarotene, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying topical tazarotene to see how well it works in treating patients with basal cell skin cancer and basal cell nevus syndrome on the face.
