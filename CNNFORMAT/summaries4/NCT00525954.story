(thirdQuint)PLASMA 2 Trial: Examination of Once Daily (QD) Dosing of A-002 In Subjects With Stable Coronary Artery Disease.

 A-002 represents a novel therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD).

 Through the inhibition of activity A-002 may provide multifunctional activity directed against key facets of the disease process, namely a) inflammation, b) atherogenic lipid profiles and c) the atherosclerotic process.

 Non-clinical and clinical data from recent studies have demonstrated the benefit of early and aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk.

 Recent clinical studies have provided a strong association between levels and cardiovascular event risk.

 The proposed Phase 2 clinical pharmacology study (Study No.

 AN-CVD-2222) will examine the effects of 2 different doses of A-002 compared with placebo, on enzyme levels and activity after 8 weeks of treatment.

 In addition, the effect of treatment on inflammatory markers of cardiovascular risk (C-reactive protein [CRP]), lipid levels and lipoprotein subclasses and other soluble biomarkers (e.

g.

, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, TNF, MCP-1 etc) will also be assessed.

The study will be conducted at up to 25 U.

S.

 centers and will be a double-blind randomized parallel group placebo controlled study among subjects with stable coronary artery disease (CAD).

 Subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo tablets or one of 2 orally active doses of A-002.

 The duration of study drug therapy will be 8 weeks.
