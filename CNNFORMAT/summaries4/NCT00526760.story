(firstQuint)Long-term Clinical Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Dexmedetomidine in ICU Subjects.

 According to the current dexmedetomidine indication, the duration of dexmedetomidine administration is limited within 24 hours.

 However, there is a strong demand from the medical specialists for continued administration of dexmedetomidine in excess of 24 hours in the medical practice because a large number of patients require sedation for more than 24 hours in ICU.

 To meet such clinical demand, it was planned to conduct a phase III long-term administration study of dexmedetomidine to obtain the approval on the infusion of dexmedetomidine for more than 24 hours.
