(thirdQuint)Clinical Trial of Vincristine vs.

 Prednisolone for Treatment of Complicated Hemangiomas.

 Infants with large hemangiomas are often treated systemically with oral steroids (Prednisolone) to prevent complications.

 The best treatment for hemangiomas is not known and there are no medications approved by the FDA for treatment of hemangiomas.

 Also, the best method to measure the response of hemangioma to treatment is not known.

 Patients enrolling on this study will be randomly assigned to receive either daily Prednisolone by mouth or weekly Vincristine in a vein.

 Response to treatment will be monitored by clinical exams every two weeks and by an MRI at study entry and six and twelve weeks later.

 Patients with evidence of progressive disease (larger hemangiomas) on the week 6 MRI will be switched to the other drug to complete a total of 12 weeks of therapy.

 Side effects of each medication will be monitored closely determined from histories, physical exams, blood tests and other studies as necessary.

 Participation in this study will last up to 12 weeks and follow up for protocol.

 Clinical Trial of Vincristine vs.

 Prednisolone for Treatment of Complicated Hemangiomas@highlight

The goal of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Prednisolone and Vincristine for treatment of large, complicated infantile hemangiomas.

 The diagnostic, therapeutic and response criteria experimentally determined in this study will be used as a framework for future infantile hemangioma studies.
