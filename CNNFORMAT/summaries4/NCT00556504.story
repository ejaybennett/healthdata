(thirdQuint)The Effects of Adding TCM-700C on the Standard Combination Treatment for Patients With Genotype 1 Hepatitis C Infection.

 This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, Phase 2 study to evaluate the effects of adding a Chinese formulation (TCM-700C) on the standard combination treatment for patients with Genotype 1 hepatitis C infection.

 Patients were screened within 4 weeks before receive the first study drug dose.

 Eligible patients at baseline were stratified according to baseline HCV RNA (800,000 IU/ml vs >800,000 IU/ml) and randomized with an equal chance to receive either TCM-700C or placebo as an add-on to the combination drug therapy.

 The combination drug therapy was peginterferon -2b (PEG-INTRON(R), Schering-Plough) 1.

5 micrograms/kg once weekly injection for 48 weeks plus oral ribavirin (REBETOL(R), Shering-Plough) 1000mg-1200mg daily for 48 weeks.

 The add-on treatment of TCM-700C or placebo was given 2 tablets thrice daily for 48 weeks.

 During the 48 week treatment period and 24 week untreated follow-up, patients were assessed at regular intervals for safety and efficacy at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and then every 8 weeks thereafter until study completion.

 Patients who prematurely discontinued test drug therapy had laboratory examination re-taken on the week patient was discontinued from study.

 The Effects of Adding TCM-700C on the Standard Combination Treatment for Patients With Genotype 1 Hepatitis C Infection@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of TCM-700C as an add-on treatment to the combination drug therapy (Peginterferon -2b plus Ribavirin) for patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infections.

 This will be demonstrated by a higher sustained virologic response rate, defined as the absence of detectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after the termination of combinational drug treatment, compared with the placebo add-on.
