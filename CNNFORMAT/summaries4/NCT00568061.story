(secondQuint)Nitric Oxide in Myocardial Infarction Size.

 The purpose of the trial is to assess whether or not inhaled nitric oxide can decrease myocardial infarction (MI) size as a fraction of left ventricular (LV) size at 48-72 hours in patients presenting with an ST segment elevation MI who undergo successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

 The primary endpoint for this study will be myocardial infarction size as a fraction of left ventricular size at 48-72 hours as measured by contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI.
