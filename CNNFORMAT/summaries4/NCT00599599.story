(secondQuint)Stress-Reducing Interventions in HIV+ Patients: Pilot.

 HIV+ patients will be randomized to receive either PE therapy (up to 18 possible sessions) or weekly symptom monitoring (described below) and will complete measures of PTSD, adherence, and QOL pre- and post-intervention and at 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments.

 Secondary analyses will examine the impact of the intervention on disorders commonly comorbid with PTSD (i.

e.

, anxiety, mood, and substance abuse/dependence disorders).
