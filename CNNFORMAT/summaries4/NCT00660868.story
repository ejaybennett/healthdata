(secondQuint)Is Pentoxifylline Able to Improve Olfactory Sensitivity?.

 Olfactory signal processing is conducted by a G-protein linked increase of intracellular concentration of adenosine 3,5-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP).

 In the cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) cAMP is degraded by phosphodiesterase 1C2 (PDE1C2).

 Inhibition of PDE1C2 could result in an increased response of OSN to chemical stimuli.

 Aim of the present prospective post-marketing surveillance study was to investigate the impact of pentoxifylline, an unspecific phosphodieasterase inhibitor, on olfactory function.

 Is Pentoxifylline Able to Improve Olfactory Sensitivity?@highlight

Signal processing in the olfactory neuron could be influenced by inhibition of enzymes like phosphodiesterase.

 Pentoxifylline is a unspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor.

 The hypothesis is that pentoxifylline could lead to increased sensitivity to odors.
