(fifthQuint)Bioavailability of Golden Rice Carotenoids in Humans.

 Recently, scientists have genetically engineered "golden rice" that contains 1.

6 ug ss-carotene in a gram of dry rice (12).

 Since the vitamin A equivalency varies from 2 ug (oil dose) to 27 ug (vegetable) carotene to 1 retinol equivalent and the equivalency is matrix dependent, it is necessary to know what the vitamin A equivalency of golden rice beta-carotene is.

 The determination of the absorption and conversion of golden rice beta-carotene is of importance for designing food programs in many rice-eating regions of the world, where vitamin A deficiency is common.

 To evaluate the absorption and intestinal conversion of rice beta-carotene after an acute dose of golden rice, an intrinsically labeled Golden Rice with a labeled reference dose of vitamin A are used.

 We propose to conduct a pilot study on the US adults with normal vitamin A status (n = 15).

 The specific aims of this pilot study are: 1.

 To determine ss-carotene response kinetics following a meal of golden rice with 0, 5, or 10 g fat (butter); 2.

 To determine retinol kinetics from the golden rice and from the labeled vitamin A dose; 3.

 To determine vitamin A value of golden rice ss-carotene in adults with normal vitamin A status.

 The determination of the absorption and conversion of golden rice ss-carotene is of importance for designing food programs in many rice-eating regions of the world, where vitamin A deficiency is common.

 Bioavailability of Golden Rice Carotenoids in Humans@highlight

This investigation protocol uses an isotope reference method to evaluate bioavailability of ss-C in rice and its bioconversion to vitamin A.

 A well-nourished population will be fed hydroponically grown Golden Rice containing ~ 1 mg of -carotene at day 8 after a reference dose of vitamin A at day 1.

 The blood samples will be collected up to 33 days after the doses.

 The absorption kinetics will be determined by tracking both vitamin A and -carotene in human serum.

 Blood responses to Golden Rice -carotene will be determined and evaluated.

 The vitamin A value of Golden Rice can thus be quantitatively determined.
