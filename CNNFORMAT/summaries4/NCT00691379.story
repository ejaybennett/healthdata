(thirdQuint)Weekly Paclitaxel/Carboplatin/Bevacizumab as First Line Therapy for Triple Negative Breast Cancer.

 Breast cancer with absent or low expression of hormone receptors and HER2 (triple negative) does not respond to hormonal or biological therapy with trastuzumab.

 However, triple negative breast cancers are highly sensitive to chemotherapy.

 The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin administered on a weekly basis is active and well tolerated.

 Recently, initial therapy of metastatic breast cancer with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival, as compared with paclitaxel alone.

This study will evaluate the efficacy of weekly paclitaxel-carboplatin combination plus bevacizumab as first line treatment in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.

 Furthermore, the efficacy of the combination therapy will be correlated with the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in this population
