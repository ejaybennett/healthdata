 In diabetic patients, frequent reminders by the medical professionals on the need for adherence to Life Style Modification (LSM) and drugs will improve the compliance.

 SMS may be an effective and cheap tool of communication.

 Improved compliance is likely to result in better glycaemic control.

 Patients in the SMS group will get SMS once in 3 days as a reminder.

 Patients will be reviewed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months from the date of randomization Fasting and 2hr postprandial glucose and HbA1c will be tested during each visit.

 "Information Technology Methodology for Patient Motivation in Diabetes Management.

"@highlight

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder requiring lifestyle modification and medicines, adherence to which has to be practised on a daily basis.

 Motivation of patients to adhere to treatment is difficult in clinical practice.

 It is well documented that majority of patients do not reach the glycaemic targets even in the centres of excellence.

 Regular short service messages (SMS) through cell phones could have a positive effect on behaviour and adherence to life style changes and compliance to drugs.

 It may be practical and feasible to use information technology as an effective and simple tool for motivating patients to adhere to the prescribed treatment regimen.

 In diabetic patients, frequent reminders regarding the need for adherence to LSM and drugs by the medical professionals will improve the compliance.
