(thirdQuint)Long-Term Follow-Up of Patients Who Have Participated in Children's Oncology Group Studies.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To develop a mechanism for tracking and retaining patients enrolled on Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols.

 II.

 To maintain regular, lifetime contact with patients in order to obtain current identification and contact information, and self/parent-reported health status.

 III.

 To locate patients who are lost-to-follow-up for COG (or Legacy Group) protocols targeted for follow-up by the Long-Term Follow-Up Center (LTFC).

 IV.

 To provide current patient contact information and self/parent-reported health status updates to the COG Statistics and Data Center (SDC) and to each patient's COG institution.

 V.

 To facilitate collection of protocol-specific outcome data through collaboration with the COG Late Effects Committee, the SDC, and the member institutions.

 VI.

 To collect cumulative therapeutic exposure data (via therapeutic summaries completed online by treating institutions) on patients completing active therapy.

 OUTLINE: This is an umbrella protocol for all long-term follow-up at COG institutions.

 Approximately 6 months after completion of therapy patients receive a mailed packet introducing the Long-Term Follow-Up Center (LTFC) and containing information related to their individualized, protocol-specific follow-up guidelines.

 Patients are asked to complete a patient response form, verify information provided in packet, update contact information, and complete a Health Status Update Form.

 The Health Status Update Form is a brief document including questions about current health status, disease status, and cancer therapy received since the last mailing.

 Patients receive protocol-specific automatic reminders, and may respond by use of postage prepaid envelopes, email, or 24-hour toll-free telephone number.

 Long-Term Follow-Up of Patients Who Have Participated in Children's Oncology Group Studies@highlight

This clinical trial keeps track of and collects follow-up information from patients who are currently enrolled on or have participated in a Children's Oncology Group study.

 Developing a way to keep track of patients who have participated in Children's Oncology Group studies may allow doctors learn more about the long-term effects of cancer treatment and help them reduce problems related to treatment and improve patient quality of life.
