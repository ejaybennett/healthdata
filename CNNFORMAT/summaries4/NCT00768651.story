(fifthQuint)Incretin Effect and Use After Clinical Islet Transplantation.

 This is a single centre non-randomized pilot study.

 Subjects will be recruited from the current cohort of islet transplant recipients at the University of Alberta.

 The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether the combination of sitagliptin and pantoprazole can restore insulin independence in previously insulin independent islet transplant recipients experiencing early graft dysfunction.

 The study will also evaluate the safety of the combination drug therapy.

 Incretin Effect and Use After Clinical Islet Transplantation@highlight

We aim to study if the administration of medications to increase the secretion of hormones from the intestines can improve glycemic control, reduce insulin use and promote -cell regeneration/expansion in subjects with type 1 diabetes following islet transplantation who are back using small doses of insulin because of early graft dysfunction.

 We believe that the results will enable us to understand whether these drugs could be useful in islet transplant recipients, particularly if glycemic control deteriorates.
