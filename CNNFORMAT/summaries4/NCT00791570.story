(secondQuint)Anti-VEGFR Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Neovascular Maculopathy.

 VEGF receptor 1 and 2 are essential targets to pathogenic angiogenesis, and we identified that peptides derived from these receptors significantly induce the effective tumor specific CTL response in vitro and vivo.

 According to these findings, in this trial, we evaluate the safety, immunological and clinical response of those peptides.

 Patients will be vaccinated once a week for 12 weeks.

 On each vaccination day, VEGFR1 peptide (1mg) and VEGFR2 peptide (1mg) mixed with Montanide ISA 51 will be administered by subcutaneous injection.

 In the study, our primary aim is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of these peptide vaccine.

 The second aim is evaluate the immunological and clinical response of this vaccine therapy.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and time to progression of HLA-A*2402 or A*0201 restricted epitope peptides VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 in patients with Neovascular Maculopathy, including Age Related Macular Degeneration
