(secondQuint)Lipids of the Human Tear Film and Their Effect on Tear Stability.

 Subjects with meibomian gland dysfunction undergo expression of the meibomian gland secretion prior to beginning treatment with either oral doxycycline or topical azithromycin solution.

 Doxycycline is dosed at 100 mg bid; topical azithromycin is delivered once per day as a 1% solution.

 Treatment with doxycycline is for two months; treatment with topical azithromycin is for one month.

 Following treatment, meibomian glands are again expressed and the lipids measured by spectroscopy (FTIR, MALDI-TOF, NMR)for characterization of structure and function.

 Analysis for presence of doxcycline or azithromycin is also performed.

 Changes in lipid parameters are correlated with clinical signs and symptoms of disease.

 Lipids of the Human Tear Film and Their Effect on Tear Stability@highlight

This prospective, randomized, comparative clinical trial evaluates the effect of either oral doxycycline, oral essential fatty acid, or topical azithromycin to modify the secretions of the meibomian gland in subjects with meibomian gland dysfunction and/or dry eye disease.
