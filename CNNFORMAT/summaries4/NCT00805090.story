An open-label, single-dose study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of DIC075V in subjects with mild or moderate chronic renal insufficiency and in patients with mild chronic hepatic impairment compared.

 Additionally, the healthy adult volunteers will participate in a randomized, open-label, crossover study in which they will receive Sporanox(R) to compare the safety and pharmacokinetics of HPCD when administered in DIC075V compared to Sporanox(R).
