(secondQuint)Effect of Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) and Weight-Bearing on Bone in Spinal Cord Injury (SCI).

 This pilot project aims to evaluate PTH with weight-bearing in a group of individuals with chronic SCI and loss of bone mass in their lower extremities.

 A convenience sample of 12 people with SCI will be enrolled into a 6 month study assessing the effects of a weight-bearing regime plus daily PTH (Forteo 20ug sc) on BMD and bone markers.

 Subjects will be evaluated at 3 and 6 months after initiating treatment with measurement of bone density as well as bone markers of formation and resorption.

 An optional extension to 12 months will be offered to all subjects.

 Effect of Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) and Weight-Bearing on Bone in Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)@highlight

Individuals with spinal cord injury sustain significant loss of bone mass in their lower extremities (20-40% or more).

 This study evaluates the ability of PTH and weight-bearing, two interventions that build bone, to increase bone mass in this population.
