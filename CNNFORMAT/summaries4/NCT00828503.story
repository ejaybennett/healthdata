(fifthQuint)Certican (Everolimus) Against Cytomegalovirus Disease in Renal Transplant Patients.

 DESIGN / PHASE Prospective, single-center, randomized, parallel group, controlled, phase II study.

 PATIENTS / GROUPS 40 patients in 2 groups 20 patients per group Randomization ratio 1:1, no stratification INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG Oral MED 1: Certican(R) initial dose: 1,5-3 mg day target trough level: 3-8 ng/mL (first levels will be performed after 3 days and then adjusted until - according to the judgment of the clinical investigator - a stable degree of immunosuppression is reached; thereafter Certican(R) trough levels will be performed at the scheduled appointments) COMPARATIVE DRUG No therapy (add-on design CONCOMITANT MEDICATION Allowed The concomitant immunosuppressive medication will be adjusted to the additional administration of Certican(R).

 For example, if the patient already receives cyclosporine A or tacrolimus, this will be adjusted, according to the current recommendations4 at the judgment of the clinical investigator TOLERABILITY / SAFETY ENDPOINTS: Rejection Hematocrit Platelet count WBC count Wound healing disorders Blood lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides) Infections (other than CMV) PHARMACOKINETIC / PHARMACODYNAMIC ENDPOINTS Certican(R) (everolimus) trough levels STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY Primary Endpoint: CMV-load (copies/mL) Null and alternative hypotheses: H0 Treatment with Certican(R) (everolimus) in combination with valcyte(R) (valganciclovir) or cymevene(R) (ganciclovir) is equal to valcyte(R) (valganciclovir) or cymevene(R) (ganciclovir) alone in reducing the CMV-load in renal transplant patients with CMV-disease H1: Treatment with Certican(R) (everolimus) in combination with valcyte(R) (valganciclovir) or cymevene(R) (ganciclovir) is superior to valcyte(R) (valganciclovir) or cymevene(R) (ganciclovir) in reducing CMV load (copies/mL) in renal transplant patients with CMV-disease Type-I and -II errors - power.

 Main analysis set Per-protocol (efficacy) and intention to treat (ITT) for safety Other endpoints Bonferroni corrected t-tests will be performed for CMV-copies/mL at each time point of the follow-up period.

 The time to copies 600 will also be analyzed by a t-test.

 All other secondary endpoints and subgroup analysis will be performed in explorative intention (descriptive statistics).

 Certican (Everolimus) Against Cytomegalovirus Disease in Renal Transplant Patients@highlight

A prospective, randomized safety and efficacy study of Certican(R) as add-on therapy against CMV disease in renal transplant recipients OBJECTIVES: Primary Objective: To demonstrate efficacy of Certican(R) as add-on therapy against CMV disease in comparison to either valcyte(R) (valganciclovir) or cymevene(R) (ganciclovir) alone, evaluated by quantitative measurement of CMV-DNA with PCR from the blood (qCMV-PCR) Secondary Objectives: To assess safety and tolerability of Certican(R) in patients with CMV- disease To study the effects of Certican(R) treatment on quality of life
