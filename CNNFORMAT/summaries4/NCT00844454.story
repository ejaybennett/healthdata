(secondQuint)Multi-pronged Ethanol Ablation and Radiofrequency Ablation of Early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 Patients with early-stage (single tumor no more than 5 cm or up to 3 tumors each no more than 3 cm in size) primary hepatocellular carcinoma will be randomized into two percutaneous ablation treatment arms, including radiofrequency ablation and multi-pronged ethanol ablation.

 The local treatment responses, complications,and long-term disease-free survivals and overall survivals are analyzed.

 Multi-pronged Ethanol Ablation and Radiofrequency Ablation of Early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of percutaneous ethanol ablation using a multi-pronged needle (QFEA) with that of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
