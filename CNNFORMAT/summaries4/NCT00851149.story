(secondQuint)Pro-inflammatory Cytokines in Blood From Orthopedic Surgery Compared to Abdominal Aneurysm Repair.

 Patient (n= 10) scheduled for total hip replacement or hemiprosthesis and patient (n=10) scheduled for abdominal aortic surgery.

 Primary outcome: Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-) and complement activation (C3a) in blood samples collected from surgery field.

 Comparison between the 2 groups.

 Secondary outcome: Haemoglobin, Trc, INR in blood samples and plasma will be analysed and compared between the 2 groups.

 Pro-inflammatory Cytokines in Blood From Orthopedic Surgery Compared to Abdominal Aneurysm Repair@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate the contents in blood sampled from surgery site during hip replacement compared with blood sampled from abdominal aortic surgery.

 Is there any difference in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-), complement activation (C3a)?
