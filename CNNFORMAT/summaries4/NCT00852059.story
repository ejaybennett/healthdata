(secondQuint)Adherence to Stimulant Treatment in Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Patients (ASTA).

 The study is designed as a prospective, multi-centric, open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial.

 ADHD-children and adolescents of both sexes, 6-17 of age, effectively treated with stimulants are recruited in two centres.

 Over a naturalistic run-in phase of four weeks adherence to medication taken before randomisation is measured.

 In the subsequent controlled clinical trial 50% of the participants are randomized to extended release (ER) methylphenidate (Medikinet retard(R)) applied with breakfast, 50% are randomized to immediate release (IR) methylphenidate (Medikinet(R)) in the morning and 3-4 h later (clinical trial).

 To optimize ecological validity, no double-dummy technique is applied; the allocation to either study arm is non-blinded.

 According to the power calculation 106 patients will be randomized.

 The total duration of the study is 18 months.

 Starting with a run-in visit, each eligible patient is observed in the naturalistic run-in phase for four weeks.

 Subsequently, patients participate 100 days in the clinical trial starting with a baseline visit, an in between-visit and a final visit.

 Medical care is provided in the routine program of both study centres.

 To record the adherence, medication events are counted by Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS).
