(firstQuint)A Study to Determine the Efficacy of Lenalidomide Versus Investigator's Choice in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL).

 This research study is for patients who have relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma following treatment such as radiotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or radioimmunotherapy.

 Currently, there is no clearly recommended standard treatment in this population.

 Chemotherapy agents such as gemcitabine, cytarabine, chlorambucil, fludarabine, or the immunotherapeutic agent, rituximab, may be proposed.

 Thus, the aim is to search for new treatments that may improve the prognosis of patients with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.

 The present clinical study aims at determining if lenalidomide is safe and active in patients with mantle cell lymphoma who are refractory to their treatment or have relapsed once, twice or three times.

 Enrollment goal was met on March 7th 2013 and thus enrollment was stopped.
