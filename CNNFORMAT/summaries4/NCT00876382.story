(fifthQuint)Community Oncology Setting Disease Outcomes of Sorafenib (Nexavar) Use in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.

 Recently, a number of targeted agents have demonstrated single-agent activity in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.

 Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF, resulted in an improvement in median progression-free survival when compared to placebo in a prospective, randomized trial.

 More recently, the multitargeted agents sorafenib and sunitinib have been approved for use in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.

 Both have proven superior to previous interferon and other standard treatment; however it is not clear how these drugs should be used in the treatment sequence.

 With roughly 80% of cancer patients receiving their oncology care in the community setting, we are proposing a review and evaluation of at least 200 advanced renal cell carcinoma patients.

 Community Oncology Setting Disease Outcomes of Sorafenib (Nexavar) Use in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma@highlight

A retrospective medical record abstraction study of at least 200 advanced renal cell carcinoma patients treated in the following settings: - Patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with Sorafenib (Nexavar) as second-line therapy after Sunitinib (Sutent) or Bevacizumab (Avastin) for first-line therapy (about 100 patients) - Patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with Sorafenib (Nexavar) as first-line therapy followed by Sunitinib (Sutent) as second-line therapy (about 100 patients)
