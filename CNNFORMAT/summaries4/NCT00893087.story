(thirdQuint)Comparison of Pressure-, Flow- and Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assistance (NAVA)-Triggering in Pediatric and Neonatal Ventilatory Care.

 Asynchrony means that the timing of support given by the ventilator is different from patients own breathing pattern.

 Asynchrony during ventilatory care may increase the risk for complications, make the weaning more difficult and may affect the survival rates.

 In this study we will compare two currently used methods pressure- and flow-triggering with a neurally adjusted ventilatory assist in synchronization of the ventilator support with patients own efforts.

 Comparison of Pressure-, Flow- and Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assistance (NAVA)-Triggering in Pediatric and Neonatal Ventilatory Care@highlight

The purpose of this study is to study whether neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) provides advantages over current methods in detecting patients own breathing efforts in pediatric and neonatal ventilatory care.

 Our study hypothesis is that NAVA-technology is more accurate than currently used methods in detecting and assisting spontaneous breathing in children, and thus the patient-ventilator synchrony will improve.
