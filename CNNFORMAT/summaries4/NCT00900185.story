(thirdQuint)Study of a Polymorphism in Patients With Prostate Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the incidence of the D104N COL18A1 polymorphism in patients with prostate cancer.

 Secondary - Determine the incidence of this polymorphism in African-American patients with prostate cancer.

 OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, multicenter study.

 DNA is extracted from preexisting serum samples and polymerase chain reaction is performed to determine the genotype pattern.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients and 250 healthy participants will be accrued for this study.

 Study of a Polymorphism in Patients With Prostate Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer and from healthy participants in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA.

 PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at blood samples from patients with prostate cancer and from healthy participants to identify a polymorphism that may help in the study of prostate cancer.
