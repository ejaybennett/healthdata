(thirdQuint)Transition From Hospital to Home in Solid Organ Transplant (SOT).

 Parents of children that have received a heart, kidney or liver transplant will be asked to participate in this protocol.

 Involvement in this study involves completion of questionnaires prior to the child being discharged from the hospital.

 Three weeks after discharge, there will also be a follow-up phone call to complete more questionnaires.

 Readiness for hospital discharge is a under-investigated topic in pediatric solid organ transplant patients, despite the increasing number of pediatric patients undergoing transplant surgery.

 Results from this study will be used to develop an intervention program to promote readiness for hospital discharge in parents of children who receive a solid organ transplant.
