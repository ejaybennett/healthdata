(firstQuint)Autofluorescence in Uveitic and Diabetic Macular Edema.

 After macular pigment measuring we will perform fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography.

 any associations of macular pigment distribution and fundus autofluorescence with macular anatomic features are analyzed.

 primary outcome measure is the macular pigment distribution in patients with altered fundus autofluorescence.

 Furthermore we will compare the findings between diabetic and inflammatory edema.

The aim of this study is to determine whether fundus autofluorescence and macular pigment distribution in inflammatory and diabetic macular edema are altered.
