(firstQuint)EBL Versus EBL and Propranolol for the Prevention of Variceal Rebleeding in Pts With Previous Variceal Treatment.

 Both propranolol and endoscopic band ligation (EBL) are effective for prevention of variceal rebleeding.

 Recently several studies compared the efficacy of EBL alone and with a combination of propranolol and EBL.

 However, the results of recent studies showed discrepancy.

 In addition, most of all recent studies included patients without previous endoscopic treatment for varices.

 This study is performed to compare the efficacy and safety of EBL alone and EBL combined with propranolol in patients who were previously performed endoscopic variceal treatment.
