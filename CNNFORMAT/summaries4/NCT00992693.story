(thirdQuint)Treatment of Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers With Intravenous Ribavirin in Military Treatment Facilities.

 Department of Defense operations have resulted in the deployment of personnel to areas endemic for Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF): Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) or Lassa Fever.

 Unfortunately, beyond supportive care, there is no approved therapy for treating either infection.

 Previous studies with intravenous (IV) Ribavirin have shown IV Ribavirin as a promising treatment for both infections.

 This study will provide experience in U.

S.

 Department of Defense associated treatment facilities in the use of IV Ribavirin for the experimental treatment of viral hemorrhagic fevers primarily among U.

S.

 Service personnel deployed to disease-endemic areas.

 The rationale for conducting the study is a) to allow the DoD to gain experience in treating VHF b) to offer this experimental but promising therapy to patients with probable or suspected VHF c) to collect safety data while obtaining experience using Ribavirin.

 Treatment of Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers With Intravenous Ribavirin in Military Treatment Facilities@highlight

This is a Phase 2 study of the safety and efficacy of Intravenous (IV) Ribavirin in treating patients presenting with a probable or suspected case of viral hemorrhagic fever (either Crimean Congo or Lassa Fever) at a military medical treatment hospital.

 All patients will be treated with a 10 day course of IV Ribavirin if they meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.
