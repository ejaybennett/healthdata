(thirdQuint)Physiological Effects of Yogurt With Bb12 in Subjects With GI Symptoms Strointestinal Symptoms.

 In previous preliminary study we have shown that daily consumption of a probiotic yogurt drink containing probiotic bacteria (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12) and inulin significantly accelerate colonic transit time in non-patients population with functional bowel symptoms.

 In this study we investigate the physiologic effect(s) of yogurt with the same bacteria and inulin on gastrointestinal function by assessing its effect on the whole gut and segmental transit time using SmartPill cent - a recently introduced device of measuring intestinal transit time.

 The proposed study will provide additional information on the effect on the whole gut transit as well as on other segments of the GI tract (stomach and small bowel).

 Assessment of transit time in the proposed study will be done following 10 to 14 days of the probiotic yogurt consumption.

Hypothesis: - Daily consumption of yogurt containing probiotic bacteria (Bb12) and inulin will significantly decrease whole gut and intestinal segmental transit time - The effect of accelerating intestinal transit will be associated with other GI physiology parameters including stool frequency and stool consistency.
