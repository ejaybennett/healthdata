(secondQuint)Drug-Eluting Balloon Catheters and the Treatment of Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease.

 This is an open-labeled multicenter study to investigate plasma levels and catheter tolerability following application of paclitaxel-coated balloon catheter angioplasty in patients with stenotic or occluded femoro-popliteal arteries due to atherosclerosis.

 Safety will be assessed by changes in blood cell (leukocytes, neutrophils and thrombocytes) counts, and changes in serum biochemistry parameters.

 Tolerability will be assessed by adverse event occurences related to the paclitaxel-coating and/or device by the investigator.

 Drug-Eluting Balloon Catheters and the Treatment of Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine plasma levels of paclitaxel and catheter tolerability subsequent to treating patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) with paclitaxel-coated balloon catheters.
