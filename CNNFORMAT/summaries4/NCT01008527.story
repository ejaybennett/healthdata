(thirdQuint)Phase I Oncovir Poly IC:LC and NY-ESO-1/gp100.

 Antibodies such as CP 870,893 are chemicals made by immune cells naturally found in the human body.

 CP 870,893 was produced in cells grown from a hamster but is fully human in composition.

 The vaccine contains peptides (pieces) from two different proteins called NY-ESO-1 and gp100.

 Each one is made by 50-100% of melanomas.

 These proteins can be recognized by the immune system.

 They will be injected under the skin of the participant's thigh in combination with, or without an oil-based substance, called "Montanide ISA 51 VG".

 The Montanide ISA 51 VG is an adjuvant or "assistant" which stimulates the body's immune system.

 The peptides in the vaccine, the Montanide ISA 51 VG, the Oncovir poly IC:LC and the CP 870,893 antibody are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but the FDA is permitting their use in this study.

 It is believed that the CP 870,893 and the Oncovir poly IC:LC will boost the body's immune response against the melanoma vaccine, although this vaccine has not been proven to help the patient's melanoma.

The purpose of this study is to determine what side effects CP 870,893 may cause when given with an immune stimulant called Oncovir poly IC:LC along with a melanoma vaccine.

 The CP 870,893, the Oncovir poly IC:LC and the melanoma vaccine are investigational drugs that have not been combined in patients before, and that have not been approved for sale by the Food and Drug Administration.

 The Oncovir poly IC:LC is intended to stimulate the body's immune system.
