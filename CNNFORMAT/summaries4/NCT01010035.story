(fifthQuint)Cholesterol Metabolism and Lipid Transfer in Diabetes.

 Hypercholesterolemia is not typical of type 2 diabetes mellitus dyslipidemia, but alterations in LDL may occur related to atherogenesis.

Cholesterol exist in two main forms in organism: free cholesterol and the esterified cholesterol.

 An artificial model to study this two forms of cholesterol is the use of LDL-like nanoemulsion doubly labeled with 14C-cholesteryl esters and 3H- cholesterol.

 This nanoemulsion is made without protein and when in the intravascular compartment it is able to acquires apolipoproteins from others lipoproteins, such apos A's, C's and E.

 This model allowed us to use the nanoemulsion particle as a probe to study the lipoproteins receptor binding and the cholesterol esterification process.

 Cholesterol Metabolism and Lipid Transfer in Diabetes@highlight

The diabetic dyslipidemia is one of the most important risk factor in the development of coronary artery disease.

 The low density lipoprotein (LDL)-like nanoemulsions is being used to study the clearance of cholesteryl ester and free cholesterol from intravascular in patients with advanced coronary artery disease and it was shown a higher removal of free cholesterol and higher deposit in vases of this patients.

 The aim of this study is to analyze the plasma kinetics of both forms of cholesterol(free ad esterified) in type 2 diabetes patients without a previous history of cardiovascular disease.
