(secondQuint)Relative Effectiveness and Adverse Effects of Cervical Manipulation, Mobilisation and the Activator Instrument in Patients With Sub-acute Non-specific Neck Pain: a Pragmatic Randomised Trial.

 Neck pain is a common disorder.

 About 70% of adults will experience neck pain during their lifetime.

 After low back pain, neck pain is the most common reason patients give for seeking chiropractic care, and the second most common reason for the use of spinal manipulation.

 Usually, the underlying cause of neck pain is non-specific and cannot be related to a particular pathology as a cause of the presenting symptoms.

 Due to the uncertainty of the results obtained in the limited number of studies of manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain, further studies are needed to compare the different therapies available for neck pain.

 Participants in the study were treated as they would normally be with the exception of the type of spinal manipulation.

 There were three groups: a manipulation group, a mobilisation group, and an Activator instrument group.
