(secondQuint)Comparison of Digital Electronic Stethoscope to Computed Tomography (CT) Angiography in Detection of Coronary Artery Disease.

 The CardioSond is a completely noninvasive medical device which detects heart sounds and murmurs using ultrasensitive acoustic technology.

 The CardioSond produces a flow micro bruit score which is used to determine the likelihood of coronary artery disease.

 The CardioSond exam will be given to patients who agree to participate in the study upon signing of an informed consent form and prior to the administration of beta blocker agents and / or vasodilators as part of the normal cardiac CT angiography protocol.

 CardioSond data will be sent to an independent acoustic core lab which will determine data quality and produce a flow micro bruit score.

 CT angiography data will be analyzed by staff at North Shore University Hospital.

 A data review panel lead my the principal investigator will examine the results of both the CardioSond and CT angiography data to determine the accuracy of the CardioSond in detecting CAD in the study population at large and in specific patient subgroups.

The study is designed to evaluate the predictive diagnostic accuracy of SonoMedica's CardioSond digital electronic stethoscope in the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients without known disease who are referred to cardiac computed tomography angiography (CT scans).
