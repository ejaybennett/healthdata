(thirdQuint)Biomarkers in Predicting Response in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer Treated on GOG-0172 or GOG-0182.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate ERCC1 tumor expression, as measured by IHC, as a predictor of progression-free and overall survival of patients with advanced ovarian epithelial cancer.

 Secondary - To correlate ERCC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (C8092A and codon 118) with ERCC1 tumor expression.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Blood and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples are analyzed for ERCC1 tumor expression by IHC and single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 It may also help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

 PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers in predicting response in patients with advanced ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.
