(thirdQuint)Complement Regulatory Proteins Expression and Clinical Response in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Patients Treated With Rituximab.

 Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, is a new alternative treatment for patients with severe immune diseases and resistance to conventional treatment.

 One of the mechanisms of action of this drug is the complement-mediated lysis.

 Most RA patients respond well to rituximab treatment, however, some are refractory and mechanism of this non-response is still unclear.

 The role of CD55 and CD59 protein and its overexpression as a mechanism of resistance to rituximab treatment in lymphoma patients have been investigated.

 However, there has not been studied a correlation between the intensity of expression of these regulatory molecules on B cells of RA patients and resistance to treatment with Rituximab.

There is a correlation between the CD55, CD59, CD35 and CD46 expression on B lymphocytes of patients before and after treatment with rituximab and the level of depletion and repopulation time for these cells.

 The theoretical rationale of the study assumes that the correlation, if any, will be a negative correlation.

 However, the hypothesis of positive correlation (two-tailed test) will also be tested.
