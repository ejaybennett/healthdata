(thirdQuint)Relation Between Aldosterone and Cardiac Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction.

 After myocardial infarction, the evolution toward cardiac failure is generally linked to a progressive worsening of cardiac dysfunction and remodeling.

 Cardiac remodeling is largely the consequence of myocardial injury due to myocardial infarction, although other parameters including age, arterial hypertension, etc.

 may also represent important predictors.

 Aldosterone blood levels measured within the first hours of admission for myocardial infarction is associated with increased rates of adverse outcomes.

 Aldosterone acts on wound healing and fibrosis processes in the myocardium as well as on systemic volemia.

 Relation Between Aldosterone and Cardiac Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction@highlight

This study aims to determine whether aldosterone blood levels are predictive of cardiac remodeling at 6 months following myocardial infarction with ST elevation (STEMI), independently of conventional predictive factors (size of myocardial infarction, age, hypertension, etc.

) in revascularized patients during the acute phase of MI.
