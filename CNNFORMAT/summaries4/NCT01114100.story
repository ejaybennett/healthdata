(secondQuint)The Effects of Treatment With Sertraline for Noncardiac Chest Pain.

 Noncardiac chest pain remains an important problem in clinical cardiology.

 Often, panic disorder and/or depression are the underlying cause.

 However, this is largely underdiagnosed.

 There are no clear existing treatment strategies/methods for this specific patient population.

 In our double blind, placebo controlled care as usual versus sertraline study, we want to investigate whether intervention is more effective as care as usual for diminishing chest pain, and also if sertraline is more effective in this specific population compared to placebo.
