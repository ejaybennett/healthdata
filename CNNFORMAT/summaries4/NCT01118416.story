(secondQuint)Risk Reduction Intervention for Vulnerable Young Adult Males.

 This study is a randomized clinical trial.

 A sample of 300 non-treatment seeking YMSM (ages 18-24) who report risky sex and club drug use in the past 90 days are being enrolled using active and passive community-based recruitment strategies in NYC.

 After baseline assessment, participants are being randomly assigned to one of two study arms: a Brief Risk Reduction Intervention Condition - a four session MET intervention piloted for feasibility and acceptability among YMSM, designed to increase readiness to change club drug use and unprotected sex; or an Education Comparison Condition - four sessions of facilitated education regarding the effects of club drugs and unprotected sex.

 Participants undergo follow-up assessments 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after baseline.
