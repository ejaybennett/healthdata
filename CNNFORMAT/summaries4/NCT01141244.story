(fifthQuint)Temsirolimus, Irinotecan Hydrochloride, and Temozolomide in Treating Younger Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule of temsirolimus administered in combination with irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) and temozolomide every three weeks to children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.

 II.

 To define and describe the toxicities of the combination of temsirolimus, irinotecan and temozolomide administered on this schedule.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of the combination of temsirolimus, irinotecan, and temozolomide within the confines of a Phase 1 study.

 II.

 To collect preliminary data regarding the biologic effects of temsirolimus on proteins involved in signaling pathways of interest in pediatric solid tumors.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study, dose-escalation study of temsirolimus.

 Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 or on days 1, 8, and 15 and temozolomide orally (PO) and irinotecan hydrochloride PO on days 1-5.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.

 Temsirolimus, Irinotecan Hydrochloride, and Temozolomide in Treating Younger Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of temsirolimus when given together with irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide in treating younger patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.

 Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving temsirolimus with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.
