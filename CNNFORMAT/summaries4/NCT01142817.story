(fifthQuint)Metabolic and Psychological Changes Associated With Menopause Among Women With HIV.

 Treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in substantial improvement in survival among women living with HIV in the United States, many of whom have entered or will soon enter the menopause transition.

 Significant changes are seen across the menopause transition among women without HIV including increased abdominal fat and waist circumference, reduced muscle mass, and changes in lipids, glucose metabolism and bone density.

 HIV and potentially ART use have been associated with similar manifestations such as reduced bone density, changes in lipid and glucose metabolism, and body composition, though little is known regarding how the virus may influence or exacerbate such changes across the menopause transition.

 In addition to metabolic factors, menopause has been associated with changes in mood state, decreased quality of life, and presence of vasomotor symptoms among women without HIV.

 Psychosocial indices, such as depression and decreased quality of life are common among women with HIV, and may manifest or worsen during the menopause transition.

 However, research investigating the presence and acuity of these symptoms among women with HIV during menopause is limited.

 Metabolic and Psychological Changes Associated With Menopause Among Women With HIV@highlight

This study will investigate the prevalence and extent of both metabolic and psychosocial changes associated with the menopause transition over 1 year among women with HIV compared to women without HIV of similar age, weight, menstrual status, and ethnic background.

 It is hypothesized that HIV positive women will demonstrate increased abdominal fat, abnormal cholesterol and blood sugar levels, reduced bone density, and greater psychosocial challenges than HIV negative women during the menopause transition.
