(fifthQuint)Safety, Tolerability, Ascending Dose and Dose Frequency Study of rhHNS Via an IDDD in MPS IIIA Patients.

 Sanfilippo syndrome, or Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) III, is a rare lysosomal storage disease (LSD) caused by loss in activity of 1 of 4 enzymes necessary for degradation of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) heparan sulfate (HS) in lysosomes.

 MPS IIIA results from deficiency of the enzyme heparan N-sulfatase (sulfamidase).

 In the absence of this enzyme, intermediates of the HS degradation process accumulate in the lysosomes of neurons and glial cells, with lesser accumulation outside the brain.

 MPS IIIA symptoms arise on average at 7 months of age, with the average age of diagnosis at 4.

5 years for the majority of patients.

 Patients present a wide spectrum and severity of clinical symptoms.

 The central nervous system (CNS) is the most severely affected organ system in patients with MPS IIIA, evidenced by deficits in language development, motor skills, and intellectual development.

 In addition, there are abnormal behaviors including but not limited to aggression and excess motor activity/hyperactivity that contribute to disturbances in sleep.

Overall, individuals with MPS IIIA have a marked developmental delay and significantly reduced lifespan of 15 years of age on average.

 No effective, disease-modifying therapies are currently approved as treatments for this devastating and disabling disease.

 Shire Human Genetic Therapies (Shire HGT) is developing a sulfamidase enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)rhHNS for patients with MPS IIIA.

 rhHNS is being administered into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via an surgically implanted intrathecal drug delivery device (IDDD), because when administered intravenously (IV) it does not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB).

 This study is a multicenter, multiple-dose, dose escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of up to 3 dose levels (10mg,45mg and 90mg monthly for 6 months) of rhHNS administered via an IDDD in patients with Sanfilippo syndrome Type A ages greater than or equal to 3 years of age.

 Patients who have completed all study requirements in this study will be invited to participate in an open-label extension study that will be designed to evaluate long term safety and clinical outcomes of intrathecal administration of rhHNS.

 Safety, Tolerability, Ascending Dose and Dose Frequency Study of rhHNS Via an IDDD in MPS IIIA Patients@highlight

Sanfilippo syndrome, or Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) III, is a rare lysosomal storage disease (LSD) caused by loss in activity of 1 of 4 enzymes necessary for degradation of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) heparan sulfate (HS) in lysosomes.

 The central nervous system (CNS) is the most severely affected organ system in patients with MPS IIIA.

 In these patients abnormal behaviors include, but are not limited to, aggression and excess motor activity/hyperactivity that contribute to disturbances in sleep.

Overall, individuals with MPS IIIA have a marked developmental delay and significantly reduced lifespan of 15 years of age on average.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of rhHNS via ascending doses administered via an a surgically implanted intrathecal drug delivery device (IDDD) intrathecal (IT) route once monthly for 6 months in patients with MPS IIIA.
