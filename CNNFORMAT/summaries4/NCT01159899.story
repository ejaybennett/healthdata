(fifthQuint)Transplantation of Bone Marrow Stem Cells Stimulated by Proteins Scaffold to Heal Defects Articular Cartilage of the Knee.

 Before the implantation of the mesenchymal stem cells, a knee arthroscopy procedure is made for the debridement of the meniscal and cartilage lesions, with microperforation and abrasion, preparation of the osteochondral defect to receive the transplantation, patellar lateral release if necessary.

 Then, the investigators use a fresh non-culture expanded autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal mononuclear stem cells, stimulated with a protein matrix and mixed in a collagen hydroxyapatite scaffold.

 This cellular paste is transplanted in the prepared defect, under arthroscopy, with injection of platelet rich plasma.

 Transplantation of Bone Marrow Stem Cells Stimulated by Proteins Scaffold to Heal Defects Articular Cartilage of the Knee@highlight

The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous transplantation, under arthroscopy, of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal stem cells, using, with a cell separator, a fresh non-culture expanded Autologous Bone Marrow derived Mesenchymal Stem, mixed and activated with proteins scaffold in patient with Knee cartilage defects and osteoarthritis.

 Based on extensive preclinical investigations, the technology of using freshly isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells mixed with proteins seems safe and most effective for a one-step correction of cartilage defect and restoration of the osteochondral complex, because the same mixture can generate cartilage in the vasculature-free knee joint, and bone in the environment of bone defects.
