(firstQuint)Chemoradiation With Gemcitabine in Combination With Panitumumab for Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.

 This is a phase I/II, multi-center dose escalation study.

 Phase I: Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 per dose level until the MTD of panitumumab has been established.

 Phase II: Up to approximately 56 patients will be treated at the MTD level of panitumumab as established in the phase I part of the study.

 Based on the historic data of patients with pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine based chemoradiation, we aim to increase the number of patients who are alive and progression free at 7 months from the historical value of 50% to 70% with the combination treatment of chemoradiation plus panitumumab.
