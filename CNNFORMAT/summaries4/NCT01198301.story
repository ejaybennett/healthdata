(firstQuint)Gene Expression Profiling of Metastatic Breast Cancer Predict the Therapeutic Response to Chemotherapy.

 1.

 Metastatic breast cancer tissue is obtained from core needle biopsies pretreatment and is flash frozen and stored at -70 until processing.

 2.

 After patients received docetaxel combination thiotepa for two cycles, response is assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor Group (RECIST) guidelines.

 Degree of response is used to divide the cancers into two groups-sensitive and resistant tumours.

 3.

 The gene expression in metastatic breast cancer tissue sample is detected by microarray to screen gene markers that are differently expressed between groups 4.

 Statistical analysis is performed using unsupervised hierarchical cluster.

The investigators want to develop a gene expression profile the for prediction the chemotherapeutic response of patients with metastatic breast cancer.
