(fifthQuint)The Influence of Exercise on Mental Health After Discharge From Hospital.

 Research has indicated that participation in a regular exercise program is an effective intervention to maintain and enhance cognitive and physical function in older individuals.

Despite good evidence regarding the positive effects of exercise, a sedentary or inactive lifestyle is common among people over 65 years of old, especially among persons with chronic diseases.

 Research shows that good mental health and physical capacity is of vital importance for living independently in the community and we know that participation in physical activity offers good opportunities to extend years of active independent life.

 Nevertheless our knowledge is sparse regarding the evidence of effective programs for health promotion in groups of elderly, especially after discharge from hospital.

 Our knowledge is also sparse as to which intervention program is the most effective, group-based training or home- based training.
