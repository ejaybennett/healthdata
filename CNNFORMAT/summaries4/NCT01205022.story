(fifthQuint)Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody Therapy, Combination Chemotherapy, and Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the maximum tolerated dose of a combination of FOLFIRI chemotherapy, and intravenous yttrium-90 (90Y) M5A anti-CEA antibody.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:I.

 To study the progression free survival and response rate of this combined treatment in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer.

II.

 To evaluate the biodistribution, clearance and metabolism of 90Y and 111In (indium-111) M5A administered intravenously.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 DOTA anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A.

 Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks.

 Patients also receive yttrium Y 90 DOTA anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A IV over 25 minutes once in weeks 3 and 9.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody Therapy, Combination Chemotherapy, and Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can find tumor cells and either kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

 Giving radioactive substances together with antibodies may be effective treatment for some advanced cancers.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium (FOLFIRI), work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways.

 Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

 Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.

 Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

 Giving radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies together with combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab may be an effective treatment for colorectal cancer.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects, best way to give, and best dose of yttrium Y 90 DOTA anti-CEA (Carcinoembryonic antigen) monoclonal antibody M5A when given together with combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
