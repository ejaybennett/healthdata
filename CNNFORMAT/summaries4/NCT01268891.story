(secondQuint)Study of Azilect (Rasagiline) in Levodopa-treated Parkinson's Disease Patients With Motor Fluctuations in Korea.

 Levodopa has been the mainstay therapy for PD for decades, and it is considered to be one of the most effective medications for relief of the symptoms of PD.

 However, within few months to few years the majority of levodopa-treated patients notice a decline in the duration of benefit of each dose and develop motor-complications.

 A major problem is the appearance of fluctuations in mobility, cycles of ON and OFF periods.

 The administration of Azilect(R), a monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor, can slow the elimination of the endogenous dopamine supplies or the dopamine produced from the exogenous levodopa therapy and may therefore improve ON-OFF fluctuations.

 Azilect(R) is approved for treatment of PD in Europe and the US.

 The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of Azilect(R) compared to placebo in Korean PD patients with motor fluctuations on levodopa therapy.

To evaluate the efficacy of a fixed dose of Azilect(R) (1 mg/day) vs placebo as assessed by the change from baseline in mean total daily OFF time during 18 weeks of treatment in levodopa-treated Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients with motor fluctuations in Korea.
