(secondQuint)E7050 in Combination With Sorafenib Versus Sorafenib Alone as First Line Therapy in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 This open-label, multicenter, randomized study will consist of a Phase Ib: a safety run-in period with 3 ascending doses of E7050 in combination with sorafenib; and a Phase II portion: a randomized 2-arm period.

 Approximately 95 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma will be enrolled in the study (10-15 patients in the Phase Ib portion and 80 patients in the Phase II portion).

 Patients will only participate in either the Phase Ib or the Phase II portion of the study.

 In both Phase Ib and phase II, Patients will receive study treatment (E7050 plus sorafenib or sorafenib alone) until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD)for approximately six 28-day cycles (24 weeks).

 After 6 cycles.

 ath the discretion of the Investigator and in consultation with the Medical Monitor, patients who are experiencing clinical benefit may continue E7050, with or without sorafenib (Arm 1), or may continue sorafenib alone (Arm 2), depending on the original randomization treatment arm, for as long as clinical benefit is sustained and the treatment is well tolerated.

 Patients will be followed until death following completion of therapy.

 E7050 in Combination With Sorafenib Versus Sorafenib Alone as First Line Therapy in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who receive either E7050 administered with Sorafenib or Sorafenib alone experience greater benefit (cancer responds to treatment) when E7050 is administered with Sorafenib.
