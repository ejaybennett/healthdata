(firstQuint)The Immunogenicity of Intradermal Influenza Vaccination in Hemodialysis Patients.

 Hemodialysis patients are at high risk of influenza infection due to suppress immune status.

It is recommended to immunize them against influenza annually.

in intradermal vaccination antigens directly present to the large numbers of antigen-presenting cells in the skin and it may cause greater immunogenicity than in the intramuscular method.

 Reduced-dose intradermal influenza vaccine is immunogenic in healthy adult, patients with solid cancer and three groups of immunocompromized patients including Rheumatologic patients treated with anti-TNF, HIV-infected and stem cell transplanted patients.

 In this study we compare the efficacy of influenza vaccines in half dose intradermal and standard intramuscular methods among hemodialysis patients.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether half-dose intradermal influenza vaccine is as immunogenic as standard dose intramuscular vaccine in hemodialysis patients.
