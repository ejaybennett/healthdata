(firstQuint)Fasciocutaneous Flaps for Leg Defects.

 The fasciocutaneous flaps are tissue flaps which include skin, subcutaneous tissue, and the underlying fascia.

 Including the deep fascia with its prefascial and subfascial plexus enhances the circulation of these flaps.

 The investigators determined long-term outcomes of fasciocutaneous flap reconstruction in patients with lower limb defects.
