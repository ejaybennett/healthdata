(firstQuint)Abbreviated R-CHOP in Completely Excised Stage I or II DLBCL.

 Unlike the limited stage diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with primary chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy, patients with stage I or II DLBCL would be treated with surgical resection followed by chemotherapy in this trial.

 While chemotherapy is the main treatment modality and radiotherapy becomes adjuvant treatment in the former treatment scheme, surgical resection will remove all the gross lesions and chemotherapy aims to remove all microscopic disease whichever exists in the latter treatment scheme.

 Currently, six cycles of chemotherapy is usually performed after surgery even without any residual lesion compared with three cycles of chemotherapy in the former treatment scheme which plays primary role in the treatment scheme.

 The investigators will investigate whether abbreviated 3 cycles of Rituximab Plus Cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Vincristine, and Prednisolone (R-CHOP) immunochemotherapy following complete resection is an effective and safe treatment.
