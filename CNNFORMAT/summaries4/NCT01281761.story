(fifthQuint)Simvastatin + Cetuximab/Irinotecan in K-ras Mutant Colorectal Cancer (CRC).

 Simvastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor leading to inhibition of post-translational modification of small G proteins.

 Mevalonate-derived prenyl groups, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), facilitate essential intracellular functions of various proteins such as Ras and Rho.

 Owing to its effect on post-transcriptional modifications of Ras and Rho, the anti-tumor effect of statins has been suggested in various cancer cell lines.

 However, more recent studies utilizing cancer gene signatures have systematically screened an array of drugs for potential anti-tumor effect and have discovered statins as potential novel targeted agent against cancer.

 Given the cardiovascular therapeutic dose is 1 mg/kg/day which translates into serum level of 0.

1 uM in patients, the investigators have previously tested and reported that low dose lovastatin ranging from nanomolar to 0.

3- 1 uM statin induced cell senescence or cytostatic effect of prostate cancer cells in vitro.

 In addition, the investigators previously reported on well tolerability and promising anti-tumor effect of combination of simvastatin 40 mg daily and standard FOLFIRI (irinotecan, infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin) in metastatic colorectal cancer.

Based on the results from preclinical study, the investigators suggest that the addition of simvastatin at a dose of cardiovascular use (40 ~ 80 mg qd daily) may overcome cetuximab resistance in KRAS mutant colorectal cancer via B-Raf protein degradation and inducing Bim and Bad.

 Given the result of a phase II FOLFIRI plus cardiovascular dose of simvastatin (80mg qd daily) and this study, phase II study of conventional cetuximab treatment with 40 mg simvastatin is planned in metastatic colorectal cancer patients with KRAS mutation.
