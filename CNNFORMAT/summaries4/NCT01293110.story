(fifthQuint)Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Database.

 Lower urinary tract dysfunction is characterized by detrusor overactivity, detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, voiding dysfunction, stress incontinence, or a combination of these and frequently has a negative impact on the patients' health related quality of life.

 In addition, the treatment of lower urinary tract dysfunction is a challenge because conventional therapies may fail.

 Adequate treatment and long-term follow-up of lower urinary tract dysfunction is important to achieve/maintain continence and preserve renal function.

 Thus, we aim to prospectively collect clinical, video-urodynamic and radiological data of patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction treated at the University of Zurich in a database.
