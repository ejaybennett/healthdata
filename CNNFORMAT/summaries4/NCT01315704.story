(thirdQuint)Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders.

 Although gait disorders are frequently associated with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD), few studies have focused on cognitive motor effects of anti-dementia drugs and vitamin D.

 The objectives of this study are to - Compare characteristics of gait and balance measured among patients with ADRD separated into 3 groups according to stages of disease (i.

e.

, pre-dementia, mild and moderate dementia stages) - To determine the effects of anti-dementia drugs and vitamin D on cognitive motor abnormalities - To determine whether motor abnormalities could be associated with cognitive impairments, specifically executive dysfunctions - To establish a database at Angers University Memory Center.
