(fifthQuint)Evaluation of Efficacy of the EPIC Self-Expanding Nitinol Vascular Stent.

 The SUMMIT Registry addresses the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

 PAD represents a major challenge to physicians in treating the Superficial Femoral (SFA) and Popliteal arteries.

 These vessels are exposed to enormous mechanical stress what represents a harsh environment for any endovascular device.

 During flexing of the knee, the SFA/Popliteal arteries can bend, rotate, elongate and compress dramatically.

 An ideal stent designed for use in the SFA/Popliteal arteries would offer great ranges of movement while adequately supporting the arteries.

 Subject of study is the EPIC cent Femoropopliteal Self-Expanding Stent System which provides a great range of motions for a highly flexible femoral artery while adequately supporting the vessel.

 Primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the device in treating lesions of the SFA/Popliteal artery.

 The project is a multi-centre open label study.

 Primary efficacy parameter will be assessed by measuring the in-stent binary stenosis using duplex ultrasound at 6 and 12 months after the stent placement.

 Binary restenosis is defined as a peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) 2.

5:1.

 Anticipated study duration is 18 months: 6 months recruiting and 12 months follow-up.

 Evaluation of Efficacy of the EPIC Self-Expanding Nitinol Vascular Stent@highlight

The intent of this clinical registry is to demonstrate the efficacy of the EPIC cent stent in patients with superficial femoral/ popliteal artery disease.

 100 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal artery lesion will be enrolled in the study and shall undergo 4 visits during the trial -a pre-procedure visit, procedure visit at which time the stent will be placed, and follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months.

 Study hypothesis: The EPIC cent Self-Expanding Nitinol Vascular Stent with Delivery System will be efficacious in patients with Superficial Femoro/Popliteal Artery disease.
