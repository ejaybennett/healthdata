(fifthQuint)Study of Toddlers With Language Delay.

 Objective This investigation will focus on two areas: 1) early communication impairments as predictors of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and later developmental delays, and 2) the relationship between communication and evidence of CNS function (sleep, EEG) and structure (MRI DTI and volumetrics) in young children at risk for ASD.

 The objective is to delineate early communicative impairments that predict ASD vs.

 other developmental delays and to examine how these impairments correlate with brain abnormalities in both structure and function.

 Study Population We will recruit 64 children [n=32 at 12 months of age (plus or minus 2 months); n=32 at 18 months of age (plus or minus 2 months)] who are at-risk for ASD due to communication/language delays (at-risk group).

 The at-risk children will be matched at initial on chronological age, SES, and sex, to typically developing children (n=75) with no history of developmental delays.

 These 139 participants will hereafter be referred to as the toddler sample.

 At the 36 month final visit, diagnostic status (e.

g.

 ASD, non-ASD specific delays, catch up) will be determined for children in the at-risk group.

 In addition, 10 healthy adults, aged 18-40 will serve as control participants for the purpose of piloting the functional paradigms for the MRI portion of the protocol.

 Design We propose to conduct a prospective, longitudinal study of toddlers at-risk for ASD compared to typically developing toddlers.

 Children will complete behavioral testing and an overnight Sleep/EEG as well as MRI at either a 12 or 18 month initial.

 Follow-up visits that include behavioral assessment will occur at 24 and 36 months for all children (and at 18 months of age for the 12-month cohort).

 The Sleep/EEG and MRI will be repeated at the 36 month final follow-up.

 Outcome Measures Autism symptoms, language status, and cognitive development at 36 months will serve as the primary outcome measures.

 Study of Toddlers With Language Delay@highlight

The purpose of this study is to learn more about risk factors for autism by studying the behavior and brain functioning of toddlers with early communication delays and typically developing toddlers.

 Children 12 or 18 months of age with language delays (i.

e.

, no words at 18 months, limited vocalizations at 12 months) and typically developing toddlers may be eligible to participate.

 This study will be conducted at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.

 There will be an initial screening evaluation that will include behavioral assessment.

 Eligible participants will then complete a baseline visit that includes an overnight sleep study that includes Electroencephalogram (EEG) test to measure brain electrical activity, and an MRI scan.

 Follow-up visits that include behavioral assessment will occur every 6-12 months, depending on age at study entry.

 The final study visit will occur at 36 months of age and will include behavioral assessment, sleep/EEG study, and MRI.

 There is no cost for participation.

 Compensation will be provided.
