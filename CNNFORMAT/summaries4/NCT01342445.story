(fifthQuint)Effects of LDX on Functioning of College Students With ADHD.

 Objective: Evaluate stimulant medication on symptoms and functioning for college students with ADHD using double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design.

 Method: Participants included 24 college students with ADHD and 26 college students without psychopathology.

 Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) examined for ADHD participants over five weekly phases (no-drug baseline, placebo, 30, 50, & 70-mg LDX per day).

 Self-report rating scales of functioning and direct assessment of ADHD symptoms, verbal learning/memory, and adverse side-effects were collected (baseline only for control students).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, a prodrug stimulant, on the behavioral, academic, and psychosocial functioning of college students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

 Twenty-five college students with ADHD from two universities (University of Rhode Island and Lehigh University) completed a within-subject, placebo-controlled research trial.

 Dependent measures tapping behavioral, psychosocial, and academic functioning were completed on a weekly basis across five conditions (baseline, placebo, and 30-mg, 50-mg, and 70-mg lisdexamfetamine).
