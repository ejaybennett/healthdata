(secondQuint)High Dose Folic Acid Supplementation Throughout Pregnancy for Preeclampsia Prevention.

 Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy which affects at least 5% of all pregnancies worldwide and has serious health consequences to these women and their babies.

 Preeclampsia is hypertension (high blood pressure) in pregnancy with proteinuria.

 Proteinuria is when protein is found in the urine, and it is a sign that the kidneys are not functioning properly.

 The only effective treatment for preeclampsia is delivery of the baby.

 Because delivery may be required before the anticipated date of delivery; preeclampsia is also one of the leading causes of preterm delivery and accounts for 25% of very low birth weight infants.

 Recent research has also shown that women who have had preeclampsia during pregnancy are more likely to be at risk for future cardiovascular events later in life.

 Recently some studies have shown that supplementation with multivitamins containing folic acid is associated with a reduced risk of developing preeclampsia.

 These findings also suggested that for the prevention of preeclampsia, a high dose of folic acid (much higher than the amount of folate received from food intake or what is usually taken during pregnancy) may be needed.

 Even though the results of these studies showed that folic acid may play role in the prevention of preeclampsia, an additional study is needed to determine conclusively that high dose supplementation of folic acid throughout pregnancy has a preventative effect in pregnant women who are at higher risk than the average pregnant women of developing preeclampsia.

The hypothesis of the study is: high dose (4.

0 mg per day) supplementation for pregnant women at high risk of developing preeclampsia starting in early pregnancy and continued throughout the entire pregnancy will lower the incidence of preeclampsia.
