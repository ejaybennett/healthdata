(fifthQuint)Sunitinib or Cediranib for Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma.

 Background: - Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare, highly vascular tumor accounting for less than 1% of soft tissue sarcomas.

 There is no effective systemic treatment for patients with metastatic ASPS.

 Little is known with regards to relevant molecular markers as potential therapeutic targets.

 - Cediranib (AZD2171) and sunitinib (SU011248), oral small molecule inhibitors of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, are showing preliminary evidence of activity in patients with ASPS.

 Objectives: - Part I: Determine the objective response rate (ORR) of single-agent cediranib and single-agent sunitinib malate in patients with advanced ASPS.

 - Part II: Determine the ORR of cediranib in patients who progress on the sunitinib arm, and determine the ORR of sunitinib in patients who progress on the cediranib arm.

 - Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) at 24 weeks for single-agent cediranib and single-agent sunitinib malate in patients with advanced ASPS.

 Eligibility: Status Update: Patients enrolled after Amendment G (version dated 08/16/2013), will be evaluated and compared to the first 13 patients by the study statistician and the Principal Investigator.

 Patients with newly diagnosed ASPS with clinical evidence of disease progression will also be assessed separately.

 - Patients aged greater than or equal to 16 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic ASPS.

 - Patients must show evidence of objective disease progression per RECIST 1 on scans within the 3-month period immediately preceding enrollment.

 Both scans used to determine disease progression should have been obtained within this 6-month period.

 - Patients with newly diagnosed, unresectable, measurable, metastatic ASPS who show clinical evidence of disease progression will be eligible.

 - Patients must not have received treatment with any VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (e.

g.

, cediranib, sunitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib); however, prior treatment with bevacizumab is allowed.

 Design: - Part I: Patients will be randomized to receive cediranib (30 mg) or sunitinib malate (37.

5 mg) orally, once a day in 28-day cycles.

 - Part II: At the time of disease progression, patients will cross over to the other treatment arm after a 2-week wash-out period.

 - Appropriate anatomic imaging studies will be performed at baseline and every 2 cycles for restaging.

 - The study will be conducted using an optimal two-stage design to rule out an unacceptably low 15% clinical response rate (PR+CR) in favor of a modestly high response rate of 40%.

 The study will initially enroll 10 evaluable patients in each arm.

 If 0 or 1 of the 10 patients has a clinical response, then no further patients will be accrued.

 If 2 or more the first 10 patients have a response, then accrual continues to a total of 22 patients in each arm.
