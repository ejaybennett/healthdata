(fifthQuint)Comparison of Dosimetry After rhTSH or Withdrawal of Thyroid Hormone in Metastatic or Locally Advanced Thyroid Cancer.

 Patients will undergo a rhTSH stimulation, staying on thyroid hormone treatment.

 Following 2 administration of rhTSH an injection of I-124 will be performed.

 Positron emission tomography with computed tomography scans (PET/CT), blood tests, and measurements of whole body radioactivity will occurred during the 4 to 96 hours following I-124 administration in order to perform dosimetry (i.

e.

) to estimate the radiation dose delivered to the metastases.

 After 4 weeks under thyroid hormones patients will undergo thyroid hormone withdrawal and a new administration of I-124 will be performed.

 The same dosimetry study will be realized with PET/CT, blood tests, and measurements of whole body radioactivity.

 A therapeutic activity of I-131will then be administered followed by whole body scan realized 24 to 72 hours after the administration of I-131.

 Dosimetry studies will be compared in order to determine whether rhTSH stimulation can replace thyroid hormone withdrawal for the treatment of distant metastases.

 Comparison of Dosimetry After rhTSH or Withdrawal of Thyroid Hormone in Metastatic or Locally Advanced Thyroid Cancer@highlight

Metastases of thyroid cancer with iodine uptake are treated with repeated activity of I-131 administered after thyroid hormone withdrawal.

 The goal of thyroid hormone withdrawal is to treat patients with elevated thyrotropin stimulated hormone (TSH), a hormone secreted by the pituitary, a gland just located under the brain.

 Another way to obtain elevated TSH levels is to perform intramuscular injection of recombinant human TSH, a hormone produced pharmaceutically.

 The goal of this study is to know whether the radioiodine uptake by the metastases is similar after rhTSH administration or after thyroid hormone withdrawal.
