(secondQuint)The Tilburg Vasospasm Study.

 Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a frequent complication after an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

 Its pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear but a role for cerebral vasospasm and the presence of blood in the arachnoid space is likely.

 A wash out of blood and blood breakdown products in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could reduce the incidence of vasospasm and DCI.

 We aim to assess whether external lumbar drainage (ELD) of CSF is safe and reduces secondary ischemia and its sequelae.

In a prospective randomized controlled trial, the investigators aim to assess whether external lumbar drainage (ELD) of CSF is safe and reduces delayed cerebral ischemia and its sequelae in patients with an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
