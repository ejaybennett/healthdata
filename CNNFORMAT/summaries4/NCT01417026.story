(secondQuint)Intranasal Oxytocin and Learning in Autism.

 Recognizing faces is critical to social functioning, and can be improved for individuals with ASD by using intervention software in the form of appropriately designed computer games.

 The effects of this type of social intervention may be amplified with the concurrent use of oxytocin.

 Furthermore, these learning effects may impact social skills in general and translate to the level of the individual's everyday social behavior.

 Thus, the objective of this study is to determine the safety and therapeutic potential of intranasal oxytocin in children and adolescents with ASD when paired with a computer game intervention that is designed to enhance face perception skills.
