(secondQuint)Family Networks Project Study One: An Efficacy Study of Stepping Stones Triple P for Children Under Age Two.

 This study is an initial efficacy trial of SSTP for parents of children below age 2.

 The target population consists of 50 families of young children ages 11-23 months with developmental disabilities who are eligible to receive IDEA Part C (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Part C) services in one region of South Carolina.

 Families will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions (1) IDEA Part C services as usual or (2) IDEA Part C services plus SSTP.

 Project goals are to strengthen parent competence, enhance parent confidence, and strengthen child social, emotional and behavioral functioning.

 Ultimately, this should result in a reduced likelihood of child maltreatment.
