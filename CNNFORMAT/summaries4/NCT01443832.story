(fifthQuint)Iron Absorption From Iron-fortified Fonio Porridge: a Stable Isotope Study.

 Objective: To compare the bioavailability of iron in fonio porridge fortified with isotopically enriched [57Fe] or [58Fe]-ferrous sulfate with and without reducing phytic acid by native phytase in wheat flour.

 Study population: Sixteen apparently healthy young women aged 18-30 years recruited at the University based on their willingness to participate and according to inclusion criteria.

 Study design: Fonio porridges fortified with isotopically labelled [57Fe] or [58Fe] ferrous sulfate, with (test meal) and without wheat flour (control meal) are administered to fasting subjects on two consecutive days using a randomised crossover design.

 Half the subjects received the test meal on the first day and the control on the second day and vice versa.

 No food or drink was allowed within the 3 hours after consumption.

 All meals were administered under close supervision.

 Venous blood sample were collected (day 1 and day 16) for iron status and iron absorption measurement.

 Iron absorption measurement is calculated based on iron isotope-dilution in erythrocyte 14 days after intake of the labelled meals.

 Study parameters: Fourteen days before the test, height and weight were measured for nutritional status and subjects were screened for pregnancy and malaria.

 They were also treated with antihelminth (albendazole tablet).

 The day before meals test (day 0), whole blood sample was collected for hemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin (SF), serum Transferrin Receptor (sTfR) and C-reactive protein (CRP).

 Anemia and iron deficiency was defined as Hb mu g/L respectively.

 Pregnancy test and malaria tests were repeated on that day.

 On day 1 and day 2, the fonio porridges were randomly given to the subjects on a cross-over designed.

 Fourteen days after the meal test (day 16) whole blood sample was collected for iron absorption measurement.

 Iron Absorption From Iron-fortified Fonio Porridge: a Stable Isotope Study@highlight

The study sought to investigate the effect of lowering phytic acid in fonio porridge with phytase activity naturally occurring in wheat flour on iron absorption using labelled stable isotopes of iron.

 The study population is represented by 16 apparently healthy young Beninese women aged 18-30 years recruited based on their willingness to participate and according to inclusion criteria.

 Test meals consisted of fonio porridges fortified with isotopically labelled [57Fe] or [58Fe] ferrous sulfate with and without wheat flour.

 Meals were administered to fasting subjects on two consecutive days using a randomised crossover design: half the subjects received the test meal on the first day and the control on the second day and vice versa.

 Venous blood sample were collected (day 1 and day 14) for iron status and iron absorption measurement.

 Iron absorption measurement is based on erythrocyte incorporation of iron stable isotope labels 14 days after intake of the labelled test meals and calculated based on isotope-dilution.
