(firstQuint)Differences in Nerve Fiber Layer Between Patients With Normal- and High-Pressure-Glaucoma.

 It is till now not definitely clear whether normal- and high-tension glaucoma are different forms of the same disease and whether they have similar pathogenetic mechanisms.

 Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is supposed to objectively evaluate retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness.

 The investigators propose a study to compare the RNFL in patients with normal- and high-tension-glaucoma.

 In order to exclude other possible differences,which could influence the results, only patients with similar structural optic nerve head damage in both groups will be compared.

The purpose of the study is to prove if there is any difference in the nerve fiber layer between patients with normal- and high-tension-glaucoma with similar structural optic nerve head parameters.
