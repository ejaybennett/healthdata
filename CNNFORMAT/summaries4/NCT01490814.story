(secondQuint)FIRE AND ICE: Comparative Study of Two Ablation Procedures in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.

 The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of isolating the PVs with either the cryoballoon or a RF ablation technique with a ThermoCool catheter, a system which can be regarded as standard for ablation.

 In total 762 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation has been randomized for either radiofrequency (RF) or cryoballoon.

 With both techniques, PV isolation will be performed.

 Primary end point of the trial is the time to first recurrence of atrial arrhythmias or prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs after a blanking period of three months.

 Treatment success will be evaluated by using weekly electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring (transtelephonic transmission/Tele-ECG) and using Holter electrocardiograms.
