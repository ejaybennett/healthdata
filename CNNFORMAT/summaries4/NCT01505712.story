(thirdQuint)Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Patients With Hodgkin Lymphoma Enrolled on ECOG-2496 Clinical Trial.

 OBJECTIVES: - To explore the predictive power of a gene expression-based multi-gene predictor in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) with the potential to change clinical practice by basing treatment decisions on biological markers.

 OUTLINE: Archived tissue samples are analyzed for gene expression profile using NanoString technology.

 Results are then compared with patients' treatment outcomes, including failure-free survival and overall survival.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 306 patients from ECOG-2496 (training cohort) and 87 patients treated with ABVD in other trials (validation cohort) will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 It may also help doctors find better ways to treat cancer.

 PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with Hodgkin lymphoma enrolled on ECOG-2496 clinical trial.
