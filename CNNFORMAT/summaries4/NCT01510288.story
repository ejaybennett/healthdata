(fifthQuint)Phase 1 Trial of Ipilimumab and GVAX in Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.

 A promising immunotherapeutic approach in prostate cancer is whole-cell vaccination.

 Irradiated allogeneic tumor cells expressing GM-CSF generate a long-lasting and specific anti-tumor immunity in preclinical models.

 Results from several phase I and II trials showed Prostate GVAX (GVAX) to be well tolerated and suggested improved survival.

 Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is a crucial immune checkpoint molecule that down-regulates T-cell activation and proliferation.

 Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that blocks CTLA-4, promotes antitumor immunity, and has been demonstrated in two phase III trials to improve overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients.

 Pre-clinical studies of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody in combination with GM-CSF secreting tumor cell vaccines demonstrated a potent synergy.

 In this phase I study the investigators examine in CRPC patients whether ipilimumab can be safely combined with GVAX.

 In addition, the investigators will treat an additional 16 patients at a dose level of 3 cent 0 mg/kg to determine the safety profile and antitumor effects of GVAX and ipilimumab in patients with CRPC.

 Phase 1 Trial of Ipilimumab and GVAX in Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer@highlight

Ipilimumab, an antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, and GVAX have demonstrated anti-tumor activity in prostate cancer.

 Pre-clinical studies with this combination have demonstrated potent synergy.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate, using a phase-I 3+3 dose escalation design followed by an expansion cohort, the safety and efficacy of combined treatment with GVAX and ipilimumab in castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC) patients.
