(secondQuint)Individualizing Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention - The IDEAL-PCI Registry.

 Depending on the clinical presentation patients are treated according to standard operating procedures in our department.

 The earliest, 12 hours after an initial clopidogrel-loading dose (600mg)"on-treatment" platelet reactivity will be determined by Multiple Electrode Aggregometry (MEA, Multiplate(R) Analyzer), a point of care assay.

 In case of high residual platelet reactivity (i.

e.

 50U), patients are switched according to a therapeutic algorithm to either prasugrel (Efient(R)), or in case of contraindication (i.

e.

 stroke) to ticagrelor (Brilique(R)), or in case of contraindication (intracranial hemorrhage) reloaded with clopidogrel.

 Individualizing Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention - The IDEAL-PCI Registry@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of a routine individualized antiplatelet therapy after coronary stent implantation by evaluating "on-treatment" platelet reactivity with Multiple Electrode Aggregometry (MEA, Multiplate(R) Analyzer).
