(thirdQuint)A Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind Phase II Study Evaluating if Glucophage Can Avoid Liver Injury Due to Chemotherapy Associated Steatosis.

 This multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study will enroll 132 first-line palliative treated subjects with metastatic KRAS wild type CRC.

 Wild-type KRAS is required for study entry.

 Further target-related parameters, based on current scientific knowledge may be assessed.

 Subjects are randomized to Arm A or Arm B Arm A: FOLFIRI in combination with cetuximab and metformin Arm B: FOLFIRI in combination with cetuximab and placebo A liver biopsy of hepatic metastasis and normal liver tissue is planned before the first cycle and at the end of treatment; with regard to the primary study objective, these subjects are evaluable.

 Both efficacy and safety data will be collected.

 The investigators will assess response to treatment every 8 weeks based on imaging.

 Following permanent treatment cessation, subjects will be followed-up for survival.

 One interim analysis for futility (54 evaluable patients) and in addition two safety analysis for evaluation of reported adverse events between the two treatment groups will be performed at two different timepoints (20 evaluable patients/54 evaluable patients).

 A Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind Phase II Study Evaluating if Glucophage Can Avoid Liver Injury Due to Chemotherapy Associated Steatosis@highlight

This multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study will enroll 132 first-line palliative treated subjects with metastatic KRAS wild type CRC.

 Subjects with histologically confirmed, KRAS wild-type CRC without previous chemo-therapy for metastatic disease will be screened for this study.

 Approximately 10 sites in Austria will participate in the study.

 Subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 into two groups.
