(secondQuint)Metformin in Children With Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors.

 Metformin is an oral anti-diabetes medication that activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).

 Recent data from in vitro and in vivo experiments, as well as epidemiologic retrospective analyses, suggest that metformin has anti-cancer activity.

 Vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide (VIT) is a combination of chemotherapeutic agents that have different mechanisms of action as well as disparate side effect profiles.

 Two recent phase 1 trials have demonstrated that this regimen is safe and well-tolerated in children with relapsed and refractory solid tumors.
