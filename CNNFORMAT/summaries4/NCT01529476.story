(thirdQuint)Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Administration With Nemonoxacin and Levofloxacin in Patients With CAP.

 Community-acquired Pneumonia (CAP) remains a leading cause of death in both developing and developed countries.

 In the choice of antibacterial agents used to treat CAP, fluoroquinolones have received considerable attention because of their wide spectrum of bactericidal activity.

 TG-873870 (Nemonoxacin), a non-fluorinated quinolone (NFQ), is a selective bacterial topoisomerase inhibitor.

 This study will test the safety and efficacy of TG-873870 (Nemonoxacin) compared with Levofloxacin in adult patients with Community-Aquired Pneumonia (CAP).

 Besides,the population pharmacokinetics (PPK) of nemonoxacin in adult patients with CAP after continuous oral administration and determine the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD).
