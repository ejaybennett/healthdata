(fifthQuint)Randomized Controlled Trial of eScreen for Problematic Drug Use.

 Background: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of an Internet-based screening and brief intervention (SBI) site for problematic alcohol and drug use among illicit drug users.

 Method: Individuals searching for information about alcohol or drugs online who scored over 0 on the Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) and were 15 years or older were recruited for this trial and randomized into one group receiving Internet-based screening and brief intervention via eScreen.

se(n = 101) or one assessment-only control group (n = 101).

 Both groups were screened at baseline and followed up at 3 and 6 months.

 The primary outcome measure was the DUDIT-C score and secondary outcome measures were DUDIT, AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-C) and AUDIT scores.

Additional outcomes included the proportion of drug abstainers and those who made a clinically significant change in their alcohol and drug use.

 Four statistical models of analysis were used to conservatively assess results.

 Results: A significant decrease in DUDIT-C scores at the 3-month follow-up occurred in both groups.

 Three out of four statistical models showed a larger decrease in the DUDIT score in the intervention group than in the control group (p = 0.

006; p = 0.

046; p = 0.

001).

 Two models showed a continued decrease in AUDIT-Cand AUDIT scores also at the 6-month follow-up in the intervention group but not in the control group.

No additional differences occurred.

 Conclusions: The results are inconclusive but provide some evidence that SBI sites such as eScreen.

se could be effective for short-term reductions of problematic substance use.

 Randomized Controlled Trial of eScreen for Problematic Drug Use@highlight

Objectives: This study compared the efficacy of eScreen in a two-armed randomized controlled design, measuring outcomes in terms of changes in problematic drug use up to one year after study recruitment.

 The eScreen brief Internet intervention for problematic alcohol and drug use offers self-screening, in-depth self-reporting, personalized feedback and treatment recommendations as well as an electronic diary.

 Progress over time is shown in diagrams detailing consumption levels.

 Method: Participants with only problematic drug use according to the Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT),(DUDIT >0 for both men and women) or both problematic alcohol use according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), (AUDIT >7 for men and AUDIT >5 for women) and drug use were randomized to T1 (n=101) or the control group (n=101).

 Outcomes on alcohol and/or drug use as well as health-related symptoms were assessed after 3, 6 and 12 months.

 Hypotheses that were tested in this study are 1) that both groups would reduce their drug consumption and drug-related problems at follow-ups compared to the baseline level and 2) that participants in the eScreen group would reduce their drug consumption and drug-related problems to a higher extent than participants in the control group (no intervention) at follow-ups.
