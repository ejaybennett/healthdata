(firstQuint)Irradiation of Large Lung Tumors or Two or More Lung Metastases Simultaneously.

 A phase I/II multicenter trial will be conducted in patients with medically inoperable with peripheral non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) > 5 cm without lymph node involvement (group A) or medically with 2 or more lung metastases (group B).

 Radiation pneumonitis is expected to be dose-limiting in these patients and there is evidence that the incidence is predicted by the mean lung dose (MLD).

 The MLD escalation will be performed separately in both patient groups, using a time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM).

 All patients will receive 3-5 fractions SBRT to the lung tumor(s), with a minimum mean PTV dose 42 Gy.

 Fraction size may be downscaled based on the MLD constraint.
