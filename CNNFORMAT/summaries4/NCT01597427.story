(firstQuint)Reduction of Pulmonary Artery Pressure in Patients Subjected to Cardiac Surgery.

 Prospective, clinical-interventionist, randomized, and double-blind study.

 Patients with group 2 pulmonary hypertension will be included and subjected to cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation.

 Mean pulmonary artery pressure and the doses of dobutamine and sodium nitroprusside will be assessed four times: before (T0) administration of 2 1/2g/kg of intravenous clonidine or a placebo, 30 minutes after the onset of treatment (T1), immediately after extracorporeal circulation (T2), and 10 minutes after the injection of protamine (T3).
