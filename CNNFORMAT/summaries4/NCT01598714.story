(fifthQuint)Comparison of Patient Satisfaction Between 3 Types Dressing Shoes.

 Methodology: This will be a randomised trial with three arms: 1.

 Darco, 2.

 Podalux, 3.

 Standard dressing shoe.

 Design: A randomised controlled trial will ensure that shoes are distributed without surgeon bias, and will be performed prior to surgery by the principle investigator.

 Baseline differences will be assessed for by administration of a pre-operative MOXFQ score prior to randomisation.

 Primary outcome measure will be difference in score between groups post-operatively, however we will also analyse the absolute change in score between groups, although this we do not feel can be the primary outcome measure as the major reason for the change in MOXFQ from pre to post operation will be the surgery itself.

 Blinding and randomisation: Randomisation will be achieved by a computer generated randomisation table.

 As two main types of surgery will be used in the study as outlined below (namely 1st metatarsal osteotomy and 1st MTP joint fusion), we will have two separate randomisation groups to ensure that numbers of each operation are evenly distributed between the three types of shoe.

 This will improve heterogeneity of the groups.

 We have decided to use two types of surgery as the research question is relevant to both and we can perform a secondary analysis to look between these groups more closely as detailed below.

 For practical purposes this will not be a blinded trial as the surgeon and patient will both be aware of the shoe provided.

 Analysis: We have sought an opinion from a statistician.

 The data for the MOXFQ (primary outcome measure) will be subdivided into the 3 domains, walking/standing, pain and social demain, and the raw scores will be treated as laid out in the original paper by Dawson et al.

 (2011) [2].

 The scores from each of the 3 domains is then converted to a metric 0-100 scale for analysis.

 The Surgical Show Questionnaire scores (secondary outcome measure) will be totalled to give a score out of 50.

 The data will be analysed for normality, and comparison will be made using the ANOVA or Kruskall-Wallis testing for unpaired continuous data as advised by the statistician, with a significance level set at P36.

00 (based on the price of photocopying 5p per sheet).

 This includes 90 consent forms (1 page), 90 (4 pages), 180 MOXFQ's (1 page), 90 Surgical shoe questionnaires (1page).

 We anticipate the role of the research nurse to be negligible as all the questionnaires and paperwork will be administed in the out-patients clinics or prior to surgery by clinicians.

 Comparison of Patient Satisfaction Between 3 Types Dressing Shoes@highlight

This study compares patient satisfaction in terms of pain relief, mobility and ease of use between 3 commonly used types of post-surgical footwear.

 This study randomises patients who participate into one of 3 groups of footwear, namely Darco, Podalux or standard dressing shoe.

 Number of patients enrolled is determined by power calculation.

 Patients complete a single, simple previously validated questionnaire the MOXFQ (Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire) at their 6 week follow-up appointment and statistical differences between the group are calculated using a significance level of p<0.

05.

 This study will help us determine the best foot-wear to offer the investigators post-surgical patients.

 This study will form original research.
