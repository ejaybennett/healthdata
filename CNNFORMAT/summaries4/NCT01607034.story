(firstQuint)Study in Healthy Volunteers of the Bioavailability of Dexpramipexole Tablets and Food Effects.

 The effect of food on dexpramipexole bioavailability following administration of the proposed commercial formulation (capsule-shaped tablet) at the anticipated therapeutic dose (150 mg twice daily) has not been studied.

 Therefore, this study has been designed to evaluate the effect of a standard high-fat, high-calorie meal on dexpramipexole bioavailability following administration of a single 150 mg dose in healthy volunteers, consistent with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommendations.

 Additionally, patients with ALS can have difficulty swallowing tablets, necessitating alternative methods of administration for the drug.

 Therefore, this study has also been designed to evaluate the bioavailability of dexpramipexole mixed with water or crushed in soft food (applesauce).
