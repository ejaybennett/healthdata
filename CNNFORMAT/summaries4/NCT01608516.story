(fifthQuint)Multimodal Imaging Assessment of the Inflammatory Atheromatous Plaque.

 Patients with indication for endarterectomy will be presented the present protocol.

 If inclusion criteria are fulfilled, patients will have a 18F-FDG PET/CT + carotid US performed 6 to 2 days before endarterectomy and 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET/CT + MRI performed the day before endarterectomy.

 Histopathological sample will be analyzed to measure plaque inflammation.

 All imaging results and histopathology results will be pooled and compared.

 Multimodal Imaging Assessment of the Inflammatory Atheromatous Plaque@highlight

The present study aims at assessing the ability of 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET/CT for the detection of inflammatory atheromatous plaques in the carotid arteries, compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT, MRI and US and to determine the contribution of each imaging technique.

 Current gold standard for inflammation is histopathology.

 Hypothesis : 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD might give a better initial evaluation of patients with atheromatous plaques in the carotid artery eligible for endarterectomy.
