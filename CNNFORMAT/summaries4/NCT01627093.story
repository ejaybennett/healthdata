 If you agree to take part in this study, information will be collected from your medical records that is related to your personal medical history, diagnosis, and the treatment you received or are scheduled to receive for head and neck cancer.

 The information from your medical record will be collected at least 1 time, however, the study doctor may collect additional information from your medical records at any time in the future for the purposes of this study.

 You will complete 5 questionnaires before your treatment begins, at each visit during your treatment, and again at all follow-up visits related to your treatment.

 It should take about 30 minutes to complete the questionnaires each time.

 The questionnaires may be performed in person by mail, by phone or by secure electronic methods.

 The research coordinator will notify you via telephone, mail or via electronic notification approximately 2-3 weeks after the questionnaire is sent to remind you and also give you the option of performing the survey by other means.

 All information that is collected for this study will be stored in a password-protected computer and database at MD Anderson for use in future research related to cancer.

 Your medical record information will be given a code number.
