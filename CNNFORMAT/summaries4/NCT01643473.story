(secondQuint)Tailored Approaches to Improve Medication Adherence.

 Using a randomized controlled trial design, this study will compare the efficacy of a tailored adherence intervention (TAI) to a single patient education (PE) session, on medication adherence among 40 high-risk Latino patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) who are non-adherent to their prescribed antihypertensive medications.

 Patients randomized to the PE group will receive a single patient education session on HTN and medication management by a trained research assistant (RA) at the baseline visit.

 Patients randomized to the TAI group will complete a tailoring survey at the baseline visit to identify the most salient adherence barriers to the individual, which will be used to create an individualized adherence profile.

 Following completion of the tailoring survey, patients will collaborate with the RA to identify the most suitable mix of intervention strategies for improving medication adherence (i.

e.

, reminder aids, motivational interviewing, case management) that are matched to the barriers outlined on patients' individualized adherence profiles.
