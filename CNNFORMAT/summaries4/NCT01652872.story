(fifthQuint)Strategies Using Darbepoetin Alfa to Avoid Transfusions in Chronic Kidney Disease.

 The study is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study designed to describe the benefits and potential risks of a new treatment strategy using a fixed dose of darbepoetin alfa in subjects with chronic kidney disease and not on dialysis.

 Anemic subjects without recent use of an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) will be randomly allocated 1:1 to treatment with a fixed dose of darbepoetin alfa or to treatment with darbepoetin alfa using a hemoglobin (Hb)-based titration strategy, which has been the conventional dosing strategy.

 In the Hb-based titration group, darbepoetin alfa doses will be titrated to maintain hemoglobin (Hb) 10.

0 g/dL.

 This study aims to estimate the incidence of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (administered as deemed clinically necessary) in each group and the difference in incidence of RBC transfusions between the 2 groups.

 In addition, multiple aspects, such as cumulative darbepoetin alfa dose, total number of units of transfusions, Hb concentration, Hb-related parameters (eg, Hb variability, excursions, rate of change), and adverse (eg, cardiovascular) events, will also be considered in order to determine a preferred dosing regimen.

 Treatment group, darbepoetin alfa doses, and protocol specified Hb concentrations will be blinded to the investigator, subjects and study team.

 Subjects will be followed for approximately 2 years from the date of randomization.

 Strategies Using Darbepoetin Alfa to Avoid Transfusions in Chronic Kidney Disease@highlight

A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study.

 Anemic subjects with chronic kidney disease and not on dialysis will be randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 dosing strategies to evaluate the proportion of subjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion.

 In the Hb-based titration group, darbepoetin alfa doses will be titrated to maintain hemoglobin (Hb) 10.

0 g/dL.

 In the fixed dose group, subjects will receive a fixed dose of darbepoetin alfa.

 Treatment group, darbepoetin alfa doses, and protocol specified Hb concentrations will be blinded.

 Subjects will be followed for approximately 2 years from the date of randomization.
