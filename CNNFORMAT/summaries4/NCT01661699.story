(thirdQuint)Oxidative Stress in Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Correlation of Biomarkers and Nasal CPAP Compliance.

 The goal of this study is to further define biomarkers that would be useful in following patients with obstructive sleep apnea and examining their response to compliance to therapy with CPAP.

 To date no correlation between biomarkers of oxidative stress and compliance to CPAP has been measured.

 CPAP is the most effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea and has been show to reduce blood pressure and decrease oxidative stress.

The purpose of this study is to check blood and urine levels to further define markers/tests in the blood and urine that would be useful in following patients with obstructive sleep apnea and then to see if by wearing CPAP every night, these markers can be reduced.

 This research is being done because currently there are no effective blood or urine markers to determine how well CPAP is working.
