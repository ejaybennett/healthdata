(fifthQuint)Simplified Severe Sepsis Protocol-2 (SSSP-2) in Zambia.

 In recent years, evidence-based protocols of bundled therapies have improved survival of severe sepsis in developed countries.

 In sub-Saharan Africa, simple therapies such as IV fluids and early antibiotics are frequently under-utilized.

 Studies of fluid interventions in the region, however, have demonstrated conflicting results.

 Outcomes in septic patients may be further affected by delays in the diagnosis of tuberculosis-associated severe sepsis.

 The aims of this study are (1) To assess the impact on survival of a simple evidence-based protocol for severe sepsis with hypotensionor septic shock, (2) To evaluate the cost of implementation for a simplified severe sepsis protocol, (3) To develop a clinical diagnostic score for identifying tuberculosis in HIV positive patients with severe sepsis, and (4) To assess the performance of the Xpert TB/RIF rapid PCR system and urine lipoarabinomannan assay for diagnosing tuberculosis in HIV positive patients with severe sepsis.

 Simplified Severe Sepsis Protocol-2 (SSSP-2) in Zambia@highlight

This study is a randomized control trial assessing the impact of a simple evidence-based protocol for the treatment severe sepsis with hypotension in Zambia.

 This is a follow-up study to the Simplified Severe Sepsis Protocol (SSSP) study.

 The intervention protocol consists of a scheduled fluid regimen, early blood culture and antibiotics, and dopamine and blood transfusion when necessary.

 It is hypothesized that the protocol will significantly decrease in-hospital mortality in patients with severe sepsis and hypotension.
