(fifthQuint)Study on the Effect of Electroacupuncture at Both Zusanli and at Both Yanglingquan Acupoints on Cardiovascular Activity.

 A total of 24 adult healthy volunteer were studied, they received the three sessions of sham electroacupuncture, electroacupuncture at Zusanli and electroacupuncture at Yanglingquan, respectively.

 Each session was divided into three periods of before electroacupuncture, electroacupuncture, and post electroacupuncture.

 Each period was 20 min in duration.

 The ahead 15 min of the period was the skin blood flow and skin temperature recordings at Hoku's and Zhongzhu's region of right hand; the final 5 min of the period was pulse rate variability recordings of left hand.

 The data was storage and analysis in a personal computer.

 Study on the Effect of Electroacupuncture at Both Zusanli and at Both Yanglingquan Acupoints on Cardiovascular Activity@highlight

The purpose of this present study was to investigate the effect of electroacupuncture at both Zusanli and at both Yanglingquan acupoints on autonomic nerve modulating cardiovascular activity, and skin blood flow and skin temperature.

 The investigators use pulse rate variability to investigate autonomic nerve modulates cardiovascular function, and using distant skin blood flow and skin temperature recordings to investigate the relationship between the same names meridian of hand and foot.
