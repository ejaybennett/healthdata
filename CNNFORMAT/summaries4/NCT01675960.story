(thirdQuint)Effectiveness of Gabapentin on Chronic Irritability in Neurologically Impaired Children.

 This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design of the effects of gabapentin on chronic irritability in neurologically impaired children.

 The study will involve a 22 day medication titration, followed by a 7 day stable dosing period and a 6 day medication taper period.

 After an additional 3 day washout period, the subject will cross-over to the remaining arm of the study.

 Subjects will be evaluated for symptoms of chronic pain.

 Since the subjects are generally non-communicative, the subjects will be evaluated by two questionnaires and the Non-Communicating Children's Pain Checklist-Revised, to be completed by their parent or primary caregiver.

 The primary aim is to determine if gabapentin provides symptom relief for chronic irritability in neurologically impaired children.
