(fifthQuint)Meal Timing on Glucose and Hyperandrogenism in PCOS Women.

 Hyperinsulinemia plays a central role in the pathogenesis in obese as well as in lean PCOS women.

 These women are insulin resistant and have compensatory hyperinsulinemia that stimulates ovarian cytochrome P450c17 alpha activity that in turn stimulates ovarian androgen concentrations.

 In obese PCOS women, weight loss improves insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, resulting in improvement of clinical symptoms.

 Since lean PCOS women do not have the option of weight loss, it is important to know if composition and meal timing distribution may influence glucose metabolism and hyperandrogenism and cytochrome P450c17 alpha activity.

 We hypothesized that a timing pattern of increased nutrient intake of protein and carbohydrates in the morning, with decreased caloric intake at night would improve insulin sensitivity and hyperandrogenism in lean women with PCOS.

The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of two isocaloric maintenance diets with different meal timing distribution on insulin resistance hyperandrogenism and cytochrome P450c17 alpha activity in lean PCOS women.

 The investigators hypothesis is that in lean PCOS women a Breakfast Diet (BD) which consist in high calorie breakfast and reduced dinner, vs Dinner Diet (DD) which consist in high calorie dinner with reduced breakfast; the BD will improve glucose and insulin response to OGTT and would decrease the hyperandrogenism and cytochrome P450c17 alpha activity.
