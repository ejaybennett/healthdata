(thirdQuint)The Relationship Between Positive End Expiratory Pressure and Cardiac Index in Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Managed on a Fluid Protocol.

 This is a secondary cross-sectional analysis of the FACTT multi-center randomized controlled trial enrolling adult patients within 48 hours of ARDS onset from twenty medical centers across the US, some of which included more than one hospital.

 We studied the patients who were randomized to the pulmonary artery catheter arm of the FACTT study.

 The investigators included patients that had PEEP and cardiac index measurements performed within a short period of each other during the first 3 days of the FACTT study enrollment.

 Since FACTT had a 2x2 factorial design, half of the patients were in a 'liberal fluids' study arm, and the other half were in a 'conservative fluids' study arm.

 The Relationship Between Positive End Expiratory Pressure and Cardiac Index in Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Managed on a Fluid Protocol@highlight

The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) setting and cardiac function, as measured by cardiac index, in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were managed on the NHLBI ARDS Network Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial (FACTT) fluid protocols.
