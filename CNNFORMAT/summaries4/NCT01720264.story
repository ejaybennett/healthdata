(firstQuint)Multicenter Phase II of CD26 Using Sitagliptin for Engraftment After UBC Transplant.

 Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is more commonly used for transplantation in children but is being used in adults more often.

 However, because adults are larger than children, the relatively smaller stem cell dose in UCB is major limitation for transplantation in adults and engraftment can be delayed.

 This study is trying to find out if the drug sitagliptin can be used to increase and speed up engraftment in adults receiving UCB transplantation.

The main purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in enhancing engraftment following umbilical cord blood transplantation (recovery of blood counts after transplant).
