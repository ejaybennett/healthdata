(secondQuint)Etomidate Emulsion for Sedation in Patients Scheduled for Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) Endoscopy.

 To widely implement painless gastroscopy is required by diagnose and treatment with gastroscopy due to the large number and significant suffering of the patients.

 Also, development and exploration of anesthesiology will be bound to prompt the development and exploration of painless gastroscopy.

 However, the anesthesia risk of painless gastroscopy are usually higher than that of general anesthesia performed in operating room due to the condition, monitoring and equipments as well as the staffing for its implementation.

 Thus, the finding of a safe and convenient approach for general anesthesia will have a profound impact on a full promotion and implementation of comfortable care.

 Etomidate, with the main advantage of little effect on circulatory and respiratory systems, and the features of rapid onset and metabolism, may be helpful to guarantee the safety of painless diagnosis and treatment, thus appropriate for the procedure with short duration of anesthesia.

 However, there is controversy regarding whether analgesic should be used in combination, as well as how to given the combined regimen.

The study is designed to explore and compare the efficacy and safety of etomidate and propofol with or without analgesic for painless gastroscopy, and to provide more reliant support for implementation and promotion of comfort care.
