(firstQuint)Immunogenicity and Safety of PrepandrixTM in Korean Subjects Aged 18 to 60 Years Old.

 Initially, 124 subjects were planned to be enrolled according to a 1:1 randomisation ratio.

 However, by mistake, the randomisation application was set up consistent with the vaccine supply ratio (2:1) rather than the treatment group randomization ratio (1:1).

 Subsequently, the protocol was amended to adjust the sample size and randomisation ratio for the study.

 The study will enrol 126 subjects randomised 2:1.

 84 subjects will receive Prepandrix cent and 42 subjects will receive Fluarix cent .
