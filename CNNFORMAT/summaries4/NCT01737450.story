(secondQuint)Activity and Safety Study of BKM120 in Monotherapy in Patient With Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer Recurrent or Progressive.

 BKM120 is a PI3K inhibitor.

 The PI3K/Protein kinase B (AKT) signalling pathway deregulation is frequently observed in Head and neck cancer.

 In addition to its role in tumor genesis, the PI3K/AKT pathway seems to be involved in resistance to cetuximab.

 In this context, the study proposal is to evaluate the clinical interest of a monotherapy with a PI3K inhibitor (BKM120, Novartis) in patients with metastatic head and neck cancers refractory or relapsing under platin and cetuximab based- chemotherapy.

 Since resistance to cetuximab can result from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutation, PIK3CA amplification or mutation upstream in the PI3K pathway, BKM120 activity will be evaluated in two parallel independent cohorts of patients: patients presenting a PI3KCA mutation and patients without a PI3KCA mutation.

 Activity and Safety Study of BKM120 in Monotherapy in Patient With Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer Recurrent or Progressive@highlight

The aim of this study is to determine the activity, to assess the safety and tolerance of BKM120 in adult patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer progressive under platin and cetuximab-based chemotherapy.
