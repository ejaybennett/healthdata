(firstQuint)Prospective Evaluation of Lymph Node Metastasis at the Time of Surgical Staging for High Risk Endometrial Cancer.

 If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will have a PET/CT scan before your surgery and sentinel lymph node mapping procedure during the surgery.

 For the sentinel lymph node mapping procedure, a blue dye, a radioactive colloid, and/or an indocyanine green (IC-Green) dye will be injected into your cervix during your surgery.

 The study staff will then use a device that detects radioactivity and that looks for lymph nodes stained with the dye(s).

 When the study staff locates the sentinel lymph nodes, they will remove them.

 The sentinel lymph nodes will then be sent to a lab where a pathologist will check them to see if they contain cancer cells.

 Other lymph nodes may be removed as part of your standard of care surgery if your surgeon thinks it is in your best interest.

 Length of Study: Your participation in this study will be over after your surgery.

 This is an investigational study.

 The 2 procedures being compared in this study are standard of care.

 Up to 150 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 Up to 10 will be enrolled at the Harris Health System.

 Prospective Evaluation of Lymph Node Metastasis at the Time of Surgical Staging for High Risk Endometrial Cancer@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to compare positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans and sentinel lymph node mapping in finding lymph nodes that have endometrial cancer.
