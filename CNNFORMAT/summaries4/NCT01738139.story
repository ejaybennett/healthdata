(fifthQuint)Ipilimumab and Imatinib Mesylate in Advanced Cancer.

 Study Groups: Dose Escalation Group: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of your study drug combination based on when you joined this study.

 Up to 4 dose levels of the study drug combination will be tested.

 Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level.

 The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level.

 Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.

 This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination is found.

 Dose Expansion Group: After the highest tolerable dose level of the study drug combination is found, up to 20 additional participants will be enrolled in the dose expansion group.

 Patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), melanoma, or tumors with original tumor biopsies testing positive for KIT mutations (a cancer biomarker) will be eligible to enroll and will receive the highest dose of the study drug combination that was tolerated in the dose escalation group.

 Study Drug Administration: If you are in the Dose Escalation Group, the first study cycle is 35 days.

 Each cycle after that is 21 days.

 If you are in the Dose Expansion Group, all study cycles are 21 days.

 If you are in the Dose Escalation Group, you will start taking imatinib by mouth 2 times every day for 14 days before you receive ipilimumab.

 On Day 15 of each cycle, you will receive a single dose of ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes.

 You will continue to take imatinib by mouth 2 times every day.

 If you are in the Dose Expansion Group, you will receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle.

 You will also take imatinib by mouth 2 times every day.

 Study Visits: One (1) time each week during Cycle 1: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

 - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be collected for routine tests.

 - Urine will be collected for routine tests.

 On Day 14 of Cycle 1, if you have c-KIT positive mutant melanoma you will have a biopsy to check for changes in the tumor cells and for immune system testing.

 Every 3-4 weeks during Cycles 2 and beyond: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

 - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

 - You will have an EKG.

 On Day 21 of Cycle 2, if you have c-KIT positive mutant melanoma you will have a biopsy to check for changes in the tumor cells and for immune system testing.

 On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and then every other cycle: - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing (for up to a year).

 - You will have ECG.

 Starting after Cycle 2: - You will have a CT or MRI scan after every 2 cycles to check the status of the disease.

 - If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy test once a month.

 Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Ipilimumab and Imatinib Mesylate in Advanced Cancer@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the combination of ipilimumab and imatinib that can be given to patients with advanced cancer.

 The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

 Ipilimumab is designed to increase the immune system's ability to fight cancer.

 Imatinib is designed to bind to certain proteins on the tumor cells, which may prevent the cells from growing.

 This is an investigational study.

 Ipilimumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

 Imatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

 The combination of ipilimumab and imatinib is currently being used for research purposes only.

 Up to 96 participants will take part in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
