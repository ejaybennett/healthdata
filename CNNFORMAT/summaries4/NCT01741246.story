(thirdQuint)Neuroimaging Studies of Chronic Primary Headaches Using Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

 Specific aims of the study include: 1.

 To determine the pattern of brain metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) found in chronic migraine, episodic migraine and control patients.

 2.

 To determine changes of resting state brain networks using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between patients with chronic or episodic headache and healthy volunteers.

 Neuroimaging Studies of Chronic Primary Headaches Using Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging@highlight

Investigators hypothesize that chronic primary headaches are accompanied by a discrete pattern of brain metabolism and activity involving brain structures related to the development of acute exacerbations as well as pain modulation.

 Such structures include the brainstem, hypothalamus, and orbitofrontal cortex and can be defined using functional brain imaging.
