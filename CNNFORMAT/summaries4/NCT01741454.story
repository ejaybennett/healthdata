(fifthQuint)Treatment of Symptoms After Stent Placement for Urinary Tract Obstruction.

 The investigators aim to show that the addition of Tolterodine ER to Tamsulosin will provide added benefits in ameliorating stent related symptoms in patients who have had unilateral placement of a ureteral stent for urolithiasis.

 This objective will be assessed by determining the mean difference in the urinary symptom index domain of the Urinary Stent Symptom Questionnaire, which is a validated tool used to assess stent symptoms1.

 The investigators felt that a 15% further decrease in the index score in the experimental group, compared to the control group would represent a clinically significant improvement in urinary symptoms, based on the prior studies evaluating lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with stents.

 The investigators hypothesize that combination therapy with Tamsulosin and Tolterodine ER will yield greater symptom relief than tamsulosin alone.
