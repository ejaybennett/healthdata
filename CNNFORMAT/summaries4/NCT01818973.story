(secondQuint)Preoporative Bevacizumab, Radiation Therapy, and XELOX Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Nonmetastatic Rectal Cancer.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways.

 Giving bevacizumab together with radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy before surgery may achieve promising improvements in pCR rates, we designed this Phase II study in patients with T3/4 or N1/2 loco-regionally advanced rectum cancer, to examine the efficacy and safety of the addition of bevacizumab to a regimen of capecitabine and oxaliplatin in combination with pre-operative radiation.

 Preoporative Bevacizumab, Radiation Therapy, and XELOX Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Nonmetastatic Rectal Cancer@highlight

We presumed that the addition of a monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab into radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy could results in improved pathologic tumor regression grade (TRG) in locally advanced nonmetastatic rectal cancer.
