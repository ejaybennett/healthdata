(fifthQuint)A Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of TLC388 in Advanced/Metastatic RCC Patients.

 A Phase II, open-label, single-arm, multi-center study to evaluate TLC388 monotherapy in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic RCC.

 The study consisted of a Screening/Baseline Period, a Treatment Period and a post-treatment Follow-Up Period for PFS and OS.

 Patients were to be recruited at two stages.

 Stage I recruited 15 evaluable patients, who had completed at least 2 cycles of treatment with one tumor assessment.

 If 5 patients did not develop PD at the end of cycle 6 per RECIST, no patients were to be recruited for Stage II and the study was to be closed.

 If > 5 patients did not develop PD at the end of cycle 6, a total of 40 evaluable patients (additional 25 evaluable patients for Stage II) were to be recruited thereafter.

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT: TLC388 (Lipotecan*) *Lipotecan is a drug product of TLC388 HCl.

 PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT: Phase II No.

 OF PATIENTS: Approximately 40 (Stage I: 15 evaluable patients, Stage II: 25 evaluable patients) STUDY OBJECTIVES: Primary cent To evaluate non-progression disease (non-PD) rate at the end of cycle 6 Secondary - To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) - To evaluate overall survival (OS) - To evaluate the duration of non-PD - To evaluate objective response rate (ORR; where ORR= CR+PR) and duration - To evaluate the safety profile of TLC388 - To evaluate change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at the end of cycle 6 STUDY DESIGN: This is a Phase II, open-label, single-arm, multi-centre study to evaluate TLC388 monotherapy in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
