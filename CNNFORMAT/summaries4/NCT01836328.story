(fifthQuint)Conversion From Parenteral to Oral Methadone.

.

 OBJECTIVE: To compare the different ratios of conversion from MTD VP to MTD PO.

 To verify the presence of lower toxicity in the ratio 1:1.

2 against 1:2 while still maintaining a good control of pain in patients with advanced cancer that are hospitalized in different palliative care units.

 METHODOLOGY: Prospective randomized single blind study in patients with cancer pain treated with parenteral MTD and that would move into MTD oral provided there is good control of pain.

 The patients will be randomly split into two groups: (Group A = ratio 1:1.

2 and Group B=ratio 1:2).

 Patients will be evaluated during the two days before the switch is applied, the day of the change and during the 3 days post-ROP.

 The patients who display significant toxicity and/or bad analgesic control within the first 72 hours post-ROP will be considered negative cases.

 The size of the sample required will include 44 patients distributed in balanced groups in order to obtain a size effect of 45% and a statistical power of 80%.

 The significance level will be 0.

05 for two tails.

 STATISTIC ANALYSIS: By means of Chi-squared to compare the proportion of Opioid Rotation (OR) failure in both groups of study.

 Conversion From Parenteral to Oral Methadone.

@highlight

The majority of current studies regarding the use of methadone (MTD) in the treatment of cancer pain are focused in its administration via the oral route (PO).

 The ratio considered from VO to parenteral route (BP) is 2:1.

 Academic literature assumes the ratio from BP to VO to be 1:2.

 In our unit, we use MTD in the context of ROP and not as the last opioid.

 If face with a situation where there is a good control of pain with MTD BP, usually we move to VO.

 We have observed that the traditional ratio tend to produce certain toxicity problems.

 Because of this, we have proposed a new ratio of conversion from PAR MTD to oral MTD, i.

e.

 1:1.
