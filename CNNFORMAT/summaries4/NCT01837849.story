(firstQuint)A Comparison of Recombinant Human Brain Natriuretic Peptide and Dobutamine.

 Patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) whose left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF) was 3000 pg/mL) or an extra-high BNP group (BNP > 3000 pg/mL) , depending on their admission plasma BNP levels.

 Each group was then subdivided into rhBNP or dobutamine subgroups according to intravenous administration with either rhBNP or dobutamine for 24-72h.

 The effects of rhBNP and dobutamine on patients in the high and extra-high BNP groups were compared.
