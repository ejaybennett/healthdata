(fifthQuint)Role of N-Acetylcysteine in Treatment of Bacterial Vaginosis.

 Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most frequent diagnosis made in women with lower genital tract symptoms.

 It has recently been observed that 90% of subjects with BV show the growth of bacteria in the form of biofilms,and that Gardnerella vaginalis was the predominant species.

 The propensity of G.

 vaginalis to form biofilm is clinically relevant because this form of growth allows it to tolerate higher concentrations of certain antibiotics, thus increasing the possibility of recurrent BV even after apparently curative therapy.

 So new treatment strategies must be used to insure complete cure and prevent recurrence.

 NAC is an amino acid with strong antioxidant, mucolytic and antibacterial properties, and is produced within the human body.

Its effect in biofilms has been tested in several bacteria.

 This study aims to test the efficacy of NAC in treatment of BV either alone or in combination with the traditionally used metronidazole.

 Also the effect of using NAC in prevention of recurrence of BV will be monitored.

 Role of N-Acetylcysteine in Treatment of Bacterial Vaginosis@highlight

N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC) is an amino acid with strong antioxidant, mucolytic and antibacterial properties, and is produced within the human body.

Its effect in biofilms has been tested in several bacteria.

 Biofilms have recently been observed in 90% of subjects with bacterial vaginosis (BV) with Gardnerella vaginalis being the predominant species.

 Although a wide range of antimicrobial agents are currently available, treatment options for controlling BV are still limited.

 Furthermore, the number of relapses are increasing and require alternative treatments.

 This study is aiming to evaluate the role of NAC in treatment of BV and prevention of recurrence.
