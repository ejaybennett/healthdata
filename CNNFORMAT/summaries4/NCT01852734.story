(fifthQuint)Uterine Fibroid Embolization- Long Term Follow up and Technical Perspectives.

 Group 1: 26 patient will be treated with Bead-block microspheres - 700-900 mu m microspheres or combinations of one vial 2 ml of 500-700 mu m microspheres, follow by 700-900 mu m microspheres until blood flow stop ( " cut the tree" appearance).

 Group 2: 26 patient will be treated with Embosphere; 500-900 mu m until "near-stasis" flow stop in the uterine artery.

 Clinical and Technical success will be examined, and radiological follow-up 3 and 12 months after embolization using MR contrast-enhanced examination in a Bead Block group and only 3 months control in Embosphere group to assess total fibroid burden infraction degree and eventually residual contracts fibroid enhancement.

 Quantitative MRI dominant fibroid characteristic for and 3 months after an intervention to examine eventually potential of as a possible predictor of the volumetric response of the uterine fibroid.

 Retrospective study compromised all patient treated between January 2001 until January 2011 with follow up to January 2014, and re-intervention as well as complications rate analysis.

 Uterine Fibroid Embolization- Long Term Follow up and Technical Perspectives@highlight

The purpose of this prospective non-randomised study is to examine whether two different microspheres (Bead-Block and Embosphere) are equally effective in the treatment of the uterine fibroid controlled with contrast-enhanced MR examination.

 Quantitative MR imaging, including dominant fibroid T1, T2 and contrast enhancement characteristics before intervention and 3 months after interventions will be analysed as a potential predictor of volumetric response after embolization.

 Another purpose is to determine long-term follow-up in all patient treated in a period from 2001-2011 in OUH analysed retrospectively.
