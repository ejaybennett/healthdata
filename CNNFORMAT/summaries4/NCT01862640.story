(firstQuint)Safety and Tolerability Study of Two Fixed-doses of Brexpiprazole in the Treatment of Subjects With Agitation Associated With Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.

 Behavioral symptoms, such as agitation, are core features in subjects with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and develop in the majority of dementia subjects.

 The presence of agitation in subjects with Alzheimer's disease places a significant burden not only on subjects and their caregivers but also on the healthcare system.

 This is a trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole in the treatment of subjects with agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.

 The trial consists of a continuous 12-week double-blind treatment period with a 30-day follow-up.

 The trial population will include male and female subjects between 55 and 90 years of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, who are residing either in an institutionalized setting or in a non-institutionalized setting where the subject is not living alone.
