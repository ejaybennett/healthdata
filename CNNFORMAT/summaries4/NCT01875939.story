(thirdQuint)Phase I, Open Label,Crossover Food-Effect and Absolute Bioavailability Study of WCK2349 and WCK771 in Healthy Adult Human Volunteers.

 All the subjects will be checked-in into the clinical study facility on Day -1, the day prior to dosing.

 The subjects will be randomly assigned to receive WCK 2349 1000 mg as an oral dose in fed or fasting state (1:1) in the food effect study as per the randomization schedule.

 The subjects completing the food effect study (i.

e.

, Period 1 and Period 2) will be administered WCK 771 800 mg as an intravenous infusion in fasting state in Period 3 of the study.

 There will be a washout period of three days between each period.

 The subjects will continue to remain in the clinical facility for the entire duration of the study (completion of three periods in the study), including wash out period.

 Prior to check out procedure, detailed clinical examination will be done to confirm that subject has no safety issues.

 Phase I, Open Label,Crossover Food-Effect and Absolute Bioavailability Study of WCK2349 and WCK771 in Healthy Adult Human Volunteers@highlight

This study is aimed to ascertain the effect of food on pharmacokinetics of WCK 2349 and determine the absolute bioavailability of WCK 2349 1000 mg (oral, QD dose) with respect to WCK 771 800 mg (intravenous, QD dose).

 This study would ascertain/confirm the therapeutically equivalent oral and IV doses of WCK 2349 and WCK 771 respectively, and provide guidance in case of switch over therapy (WCK 771, IV to WCK 2349, oral) in future clinical trials in patients.
