(fifthQuint)Gaining Optimal Osteoporosis Assessments in Long-Term Care (GOAL).

 Individuals who live in LTC are at high risk for osteoporosis and fractures, particularly hip fractures, which lead to pain and transfer to acute care.

 The investigators' previous work in LTC has shown that awareness and use of clinical practice guidelines in LTC are low.

 To successfully transfer knowledge, it is imperative to understand the needs of the LTC teams and to tailor KT interventions appropriately.

 Interventions which focus on strategies to overcome barriers and on new ways to deliver and promote the uptake of best practices that are specific to both the learning needs of LTC health care providers and the operational/organizational culture in LTC are greatly needed.

 Interdisciplinary teams who participated in the Vitamin D and Osteoporosis Study (ViDOS) indicated several process barriers that may hinder the proper identification and treatment of fractures in LTC.

 There is a need to educate Ontario LTC practitioners on the osteoporosis guidelines.

 The investigators' aim is to facilitate the uptake of Osteoporosis Canada 2010 Clinical Practice Guidelines, across Ontario LTC homes using the ViDOS multi-faceted KT model.

 Furthermore, the investigators will have a greater emphasis on the implementation of guidelines which includes risk assessment and appropriate medication use.

The aim of this study is to disseminate the 2010 Osteoporosis Canada clinical practice guidelines, using a multi-faceted Knowledge Translation (KT) model, as KT aims to close the gap between knowledge generated from research and practice.

 The investigators' primary objective is to evaluate if this intervention can increase the percent of long-term care (LTC) residents receiving appropriate treatment for osteoporosis (i.

e.

 treatment is considered appropriate for an individual over age 50 who has had a diagnosis of osteoporosis or a fragility fracture of the hip or vertebrae and those who have had more than one fragility fracture and is therefore considered high-risk).

 A secondary objective is to examine whether the intervention increases the percent of all LTC residents receiving Vitamin D equivalent to 800 IU/day.
