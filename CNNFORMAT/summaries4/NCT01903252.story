(secondQuint)TP05 for the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Active UC.

 This is a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, multi-centre, non-inferiority trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3.

2 g of TP05/day compared to 3.

2 g/day of Asacol cent with an open label extension to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of TP05 administered over a 26 week period.

 A total of 800 subjects with mildly to moderately active UC will be evaluated.

 Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 3.

2 g/day of TP05 (administered once daily) or 3.

2 g/day of Asacol cent .

 The primary efficacy outcome will be assessed at Week 8.

 All subjects who respond to TP05/Asacol cent (response or remission) will continue receiving blinded study treatment for up to 12 weeks.

 After that, subjects can enroll in an Open Label Extension (OLE) for 26 weeks duration to receive TP05.

 Subjects failing to respond to study drug at the Week 8 visit can enroll in the OLE at week 8 and receive 4.

8 g/day of TP05.
