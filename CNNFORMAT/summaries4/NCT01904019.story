(firstQuint)Comparison of ARPE Prosthesis With the Literature.

 The primary objective is to compare functional outcome at 3 years after trapezio-metarcarpal arthroplasty with trapeziectomy and trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition.

 Literature values obtained by a recently published meta analysis1 will be used.

 Secondary objectives are: - to compare functional outcome at 1 and at 5 years after trapezio-metarcarpal arthroplasty with trapeziectomy and trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition - to determine pre- and postop HR QOL - Incidence of RLL at each follow up time point.

 Literature values from the same meta analysis1 will be used.
