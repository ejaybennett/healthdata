(fifthQuint)Impact of SpHb Monitoring on Transfusion.

 Eligible patients scheduled for neurosurgeries were enrolled into either a standard care group (Control Group) or an intervention group (SpHb Group).

 The Control Group received typical anesthesia care including estimated blood loss (EBL) assessment and intraoperative hemoglobin measurements from the central laboratory (Hb).

 Blood samples were taken when EBL was 15% of total blood volume.

 RBC transfusion was initiated if Hb was 10 g/dL and continued until the EBL was replaced and Hb >10g/dL was confirmed.

 The SpHb Group followed the same transfusion practice as the Control Group except the anesthesiologist was guided by the addition of SpHb monitoring with blood samples still taken pre- and post-transfusion.

 Additionally, the absolute and trend accuracy of SpHb compared to Hb was evaluated.

 Potential cost savings from reduced RBC utilization will be calculated if occured.

 Impact of SpHb Monitoring on Transfusion@highlight

Continuous and noninvasive hemoglobin (SpHb) monitoring provides clinicians with real-time trending of changes or lack of changes in hemoglobin, which has the potential to alter red blood cell (RBC) transfusion decision making.

 The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of SpHb monitoring on RBC transfusions in high blood loss surgery.

 The investigators hypothesize that SpHb will improve blood transfusion practice in the for of change the number of blood unit per patient and improve the outcome regards the time to take decision of transfusion trigger.
