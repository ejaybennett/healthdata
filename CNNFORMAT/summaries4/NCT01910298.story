(thirdQuint)Efficacy of Single Stage Breast Reconstruction.

 The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of immediate single-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction with Strattice cent TM, otherwise referred to as direct to implant (DTI) as compared to immediate two-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction where the initially placed expander will be exchanged for a breast implant only, without any type of reinforcement.

 The objective will be achieved by prospectively assessing the number of planned and unplanned post-mastectomy surgical interventions A within 12 months of the mastectomy.

 Two-stage breast reconstruction will include the initial placement of a tissue expander in a total or partial submuscular position.

 In the case of partial muscle coverage, this will be without the support of any mesh or autologous flap to reinforce the lower pole.

 The expander will be inflated over approximately the next one to six months, and then replaced with an implant.

This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, parallel design comparing a primary efficacy endpoint between subjects undergoing immediate post-mastectomy breast reconstruction with a breast implant and Strattice cent Reconstructive Tissue Matrix (TM) and subjects undergoing immediate, two-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction, where the initially placed expander will be exchanged for a breast implant only, without any type of reinforcement.
