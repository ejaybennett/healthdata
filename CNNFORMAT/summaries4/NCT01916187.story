(firstQuint)Imetelstat Given Intravenously Alone and With Standard 13-Cis-Retinoic Acid in Children With Neuroblastoma.

 This research is being done because imetelstat has been shown to slow the growth of tumours in animals and may also be doing so in adults, but we are not sure if it can also slow tumour growth in children and offer better results than standard treatment.

 Laboratory studies suggest imetelstat may increase the activity of 13-cis-retinoic acid, which is used to treat neuroblastoma, although this is not yet proven in patients.

The purpose of this study is to determine the best dose of imetelstat when given alone for patients with neuroblastoma and also when given in combination with 13-cis-retinoic acid.
