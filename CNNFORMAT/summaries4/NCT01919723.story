(secondQuint)Ticagrelor and Eptifibatide Bolus-Only Versus Ticagrelor and Eptifibatide Bolus Plus Abbreviated Infusion.

 In this study, 70 patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome who are undergoing non-emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) will be randomized to ticagrelor loading dose and eptifibatide bolus-only versus ticagrelor loading dose and eptifibatide bolus plus 2 hour infusion administrated after cardiac catheterization, but before PCI.

 Platelet function testing will be performed at baseline and follow-up.
