(fifthQuint)A Blinded Comparison Trial of Two Topical Creams to Reduce Thigh Girth and to Smooth Thigh Skin in Women.

 Participants will apply one cream (A) to one thigh and the second cream (B) to the other thigh under the supervision of a female clinic staff.

 The thigh to which each cream will be applied will be selected randomly, but half of the subjects will have cream A on the right thigh and cream B on the opposite thigh while the other half of the subjects will have the sides reversed.

 To evaluate the primary endpoint, both thighs will be measured at baseline and at the end of each treatment week, and the secondary endpoint will be assessed with standardized pictures of each thigh at baseline and on the last day of the fourth week which will end the study.

 A Blinded Comparison Trial of Two Topical Creams to Reduce Thigh Girth and to Smooth Thigh Skin in Women@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of two lipolytic creams differing in their bases and demonstrate that their herbal ingredients can reduce the size of the thigh and smooth the appearance of the thigh skin.

 It is hypothesized that creams with two different cream bases containing herbal products that stimulate the lipolytic process through stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor, with one cream base applied to each thigh daily 5 days a week for 4 weeks will reduce thigh girth and smooth the thigh skin compared to baseline.
