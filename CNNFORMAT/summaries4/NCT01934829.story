(thirdQuint)Urea Cream Treatment Sorafenib-Associated HSFR in HCC.

 Mild hyperkeratosis is an early sign of HFSR and may sometimes be the only manifestation of sorafenib-associated HFSR.

 Urea is useful for the treatment of hyperkeratotic conditions and has been recommended for the treatment of multitargeted kinase inhibitor-related HFSR .

 To our knowledge, no randomized, controlled trials to date have evaluated treatments to prevent/palliate sorafenib-associated HFSR.

 We therefore tested the prophylactic effects of a urea-based cream on the incidence of HFSR associated with sorafenib treatment of patients with advanced HCC.

 Urea Cream Treatment Sorafenib-Associated HSFR in HCC@highlight

Although sorafenib is effective and safe in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it increases dermatologic toxicities, including hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), which may have a negative impact on patient quality of life (QoL).

 Urea-based creams may have a prophylactic effect on sorafenib-induced HFSR in HCC patients.
