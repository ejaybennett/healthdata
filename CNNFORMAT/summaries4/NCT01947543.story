(secondQuint)Calmodulin Gene Mutations in Patients With Ventricular Arrhythmia of Unknown Origin - A Screening Study.

 Patients with ventricular tachycardia of unknown origin and treated with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) will be asked to participate in the study.

 For patients with results showing mutations in the calmodulin genes, family members (parents, siblings and children) will also be asked to participate in the study.

 For under age patients and relatives who agree to participate, informed consent will also be taken from their custodian.
