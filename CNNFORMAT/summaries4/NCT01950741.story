(firstQuint)Effect of Intravitreal VEGF-Trap Eye on Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy.

 Efficacy of VEGF Trap-Eye (aflibercept, Eylea) for exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was demonstrated in the phase III VIEW study.

 Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is considered as a subtype of exudative AMD, however it is reportedly different from choroidal new vessels based on the histologic studies.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate effects of VEGF Trap-Eye in treatment of PCV, which was diagnosed using indocyanine green (ICG) angiography.

 VEGF Trap-Eye will be injected intravitreally bimonthly after 3 monthly loading dose for 12 months in treatment-naive PCV patients.

 The efficacy will be evaluated on preserving visual acuity and improving angiographic features at 12 months.
