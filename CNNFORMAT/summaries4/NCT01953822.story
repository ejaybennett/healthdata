(fifthQuint)Study Assessing Risk of Autoimmune Diseases in Females (9 - 25 Years) Exposed to Cervarix in United Kingdom.

 GSK's vaccine Cervarix(R) protects against Human Papilloma Virus Types-16 and 18-related pre-cancerous lesions.

 GSK is committed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to conduct a safety study to evaluate the incidence of new neurological and eye-related autoimmune diseases and other pre-specified autoimmune diseases in subjects receiving Cervarix(R) in the US.

 Because of the very low Cervarix(R) uptake in the US, the observational GSK study to address this commitment is due to be stopped, as it will take too long to recruit the target subjects.

 The unexposed male cohorts will be enrolled in order to assess a possible change over time in the incidence rate of new onset of autoimmune disease(s) (NOAD) in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink General Practitioner OnLine database (CPRD GOLD) independent of Cervarix(R) introduction.

 The cohorts will be frequency matched for the age (age class of one year) and practice region identifier at reference date (age at first dose of Cervarix).

 Additionally, the reference date (time = 0) for the vaccinated (exposed) cohort will be the date of the first dose of Cervarix(R) recorded in CPRD GOLD.

 The reference date for the unexposed (unvaccinated) cohorts will be a date randomly selected among the reference dates of the exposed subjects and minus 3 years for the historical cohorts.

 The other observational study model is a self-control case-series (SCCS) analysis for confirmed NOAD in the exposed female cohort, using a risk period of one year after the first Cervarix(R) dose, a control period of one year and a six month buffer period between risk and control periods.

 Human Papillomavirus Bivalent (Types 16 and 18) vaccine (recombinant) exposed cohort was investigated between 1-SEP-2008 and 31-AUG-2010.

 The unexposed concurrent male cohort was investigated between 1-SEP-2008 and 31-AUG-2010.

 Unexposed historical female and male cohorts were investigated between 1-SEP-2005 and 31-AUG-2007.

 Study Assessing Risk of Autoimmune Diseases in Females (9 - 25 Years) Exposed to Cervarix in United Kingdom@highlight

This is an observational cohort study to assess the risk of autoimmune disease(s) within 12 months of receiving the first dose of Cervarix(R) in the exposed cohort and over a comparable period in the unexposed cohorts.

 This is an alternative study by GSK using the CPRD database in the UK to fulfil the US FDA safety commitment.

 The UK has had sufficient Cervarix(R) vaccination coverage during the period mid-September 2008 to 2011 to allow suitable data to be collected.
