 Patients will receive one dose of 0.

5ml of Prevnar-13 intra-muscularly.

 Antibody response to pneumococcal serotypes will be studied ar 2months and 12 months after administration of vaccine.

 The study will try to determine Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization in patients 50 years or older with end stage renal disease on dialysis and also investigate if there are any change in Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization after Prevnar-13 vaccination.
