(secondQuint)Gengraf Conversion Study in Stable Renal Allograft Transplant Recipients.

 The introduction of cyclosporine (CsA) into clinical practice resulted in improvements in acute renal allograft rejection rate and graft survival in renal transplant patients.

 Gengraf a microemulsion formulation of CsA though granted an AB-rated equivalent to Neoral, because of concerns over the use of generic drugs in transplantation, we undertook this study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Gengraf.

 We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open labeled study to establish the equivalence between Gengraf and Neoral in stable renal transplant recipients for a treatment period of 6 months.

 6 months post transplant patients with stable graft function and receiving a stable dose of neoral were recruited into the study.

 Eligible patients were randomly assigned to remain on Neoral or convert to an equal milligram-for-milligram dose of Gengraf.

 The primary end-point was serum creatinine at 26 weeks.

The purpose of this study is to establish the therapeutic equivalence of Gengraf(R) with the standard treatment Neoral(R) for a treatment period of 6 months in stable renal allograft transplant recipients with respect to drug levels, dosage, and acute graft rejection and other adverse events.
