(fifthQuint)The Effects of Rye Crisp Bread on Appetite and Metabolic Function.

 The short-term effects (up to 4 hours after intake) of rye crisp breads on subjective appetite and metabolism will be evaluated using a randomized cross-over study design.

 Each participant will consume three different breakfasts consisting of two different rye crisp breads and one wheat crisp bread on three different occasions separated by a 1 week wash-out period.

 Participants will rate subjective appetite (satiety, hunger and desire to eat) by using a visual analogue scale (VAS) every 30 min during a 4-hour period, starting 30 min before breakfast.

 Blood samples will be collected before breakfast and at regular intervals throughout the day for analysis of glucose, insulin and hormone levels.

 Gastric emptying rate will also be evaluated using paracetamol as an indicator.

 Glucose and hormonal responses will be related to subjective appetite and to differences in composition of the breakfasts.

 The Effects of Rye Crisp Bread on Appetite and Metabolic Function@highlight

The aim of this study is to contribute to a better understanding of how dietary fibre in rye affects appetite and metabolic processes.

 We will evaluate how the intake of rye crisp breads affects appetite, insulin secretion and glucose levels in the blood in healthy humans.

 We will also investigate microstructural properties of the crisp breads with microscopy, as well as to characterize the food products with respect to the content of dietary fibre and certain bioactive compounds.

 The aim is also to try to elucidate how observed effects on appetite are related to changes in insulin and glucose levels, appetite related hormonal signals and microstructural properties to verify findings from previous studies.
