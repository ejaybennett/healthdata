(fifthQuint)Atrial Fibrillation Detected by Continuous ECG Monitoring.

 Background: Stroke is a major health problem, which affects approximately 16,000 people annually in Denmark, causing severe and burdensome consequences for its victims, who suffer a significant loss in quality of life (QOL), and their families.

 Stroke is often caused by atrial fibrillation (AF), which is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia.

 Effective management of AF with anticoagulation therapy is available and may have considerable benefits for patients as well as society.

 Difficult to detect, however, asymptomatic AF is usually only diagnosed by chance.

 Recently developed technology (implantable loop recorder; ILR) allows continuous long-term electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring and may constitute a substantial improvement in AF diagnosis.

 Primary objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine, whether patients with increased risk of stroke have a high occurrence of AF without symptoms when studied by continuous ECG monitoring using an ILR and whether the risk of stroke and peripheral emboli can be reduced by initiating anticoagulation therapy according to pre-specified local study guidelines; Secondary objectives: a) Whether analysis of ECG intervals obtained from a single ECG lead (from the ILR ) and from conventional ECG can predict future development of AF; and b) Whether the use of an expensive monitor technology - such as an ILR - for the diagnosis of AF will be cost effective in a health economics analysis due to a reduction in the number of strokes.

 Study design: Randomised, un-blinded, controlled parallel two group trial.

 Endpoints: Primary endpoint: Time to stroke or systemic embolism.

 Secondary: - Composite endpoint of time to stroke or systemic embolic episode or death - Death due to any reason - Death due to cardiovascular reasons - Acute hospitalization due to heart failure, myocardial infarction, unstable angina - Major bleeding complications (according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria) - Cerebral haemorrhage - Transitory ischemic attack - Time to one or more of; atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular or supraventricular tachycardias (16 beats at 158 beats per minute), asystole (3 s), bradycardia (4 beats at 30 beats per minute), pacemaker implantation, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, transcatheter aortic valve replacement, transcatheter mitral valve repair, cardiac valve thoracic surgery - Changes in the use of healthcare resources and costs, i.

 Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria: Subjects will be 70 years of age or older and will have at least one of the following diseases: hypertension, diabetes, heart failure or previous stroke (and biologically a candidate for OAC).

 ILR group: Patients randomised to the ILR group will receive the monitoring device and if AF is detected anticoagulation therapy will be given according to study guidelines.

 Control group: Patients will be treated according to standard care.

 Study Duration: The study comprises a screening period of up to 12-36 months followed by at treatment phase of a minimum of 36 months.

 The total study duration will therefore be approximately 6 years.

 Screening and Randomisation: Treatment: After randomisation patients allocated to the ILR group should receive the implantation as fast as possible, and preferably within 4 weeks.

 Statistical Considerations: Regarding AF prevalence in the study population, we expect that 30% of the participants will have documented AF episodes qualifying for OAC during ILR monitoring for at least three years.

 This is comparable with ASSERT, where 35% had at least one episode lasting 6 minutes during a median follow-up of 2.

5 years.

 The study population is expected to have a stroke rate of 0.

7%/year in non-AF patients, and 2%/year in AF patients not treated with OAC.

 While we expect the number of AF-related strokes to be reduced by OAC (odds ratio 0.

29), we presuppose that strokes unrelated to AF will not be influenced by this.

 We also include in our calculations the assumption that 3% of all participants in the control group will become diagnosed with AF and start OAC.

 The annual rate of the primary end point in the control group is thus expected to be 1%.

 Finally, we expect that 5% in the ILR group will not be monitored due to refusal of ILR implantation or ILR explantation due to discomfort.

 These patients will participate at the same risk as patients in the control group and will be included in the analysis of the primary endpoint according to the intention-to-treat principle.

 We thus expect the overall hazard ratio to be 0.

65.

 To analyse this reduction in the primary endpoint with a 2-sided -level of 0.

05 and a power of 80%, we will need 279 primary events.

 Follow-up duration will be adjusted to accommodate the number of primary events.

 Primary Endpoint Analysis: The principal analysis for the primary endpoint (time to one of the events in the combined endpoint) will employ the intent-to-threat principle and use a survival analysis.

 For each randomised group, Kaplan-Meier curves will be estimated, graphically displayed and compared using a logrank test.

 A co-variate adjusted analysis of the combined primary endpoint using a Cox proportional regression model will be performed as a supportive analysis.

 The hazard ratios and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be estimated.

 Subjects completing the study and not reaching the composite endpoint will be censored.

 Secondary Endpoint Analysis: All time-to-event secondary endpoints will be analysed similarly to the primary endpoint.

 Event Committee: An event adjudication committee will classify endpoint events throughout the study.

 Funding: Research grants have been obtained from the Danish National Foundation for Strategic Research (DKK 15.

6 mio), the Research Foundation for the Capital Region of Denmark (DKK 2.

0 mio) and the Danish Heart Foundation (DKK 150.

000).

 Medtronic (manufacturer of the ILRs will donate an unrestricted research grant to the study covering costs related to 900 ILRs (which has a value of DKK 5.

4 mio (reduced price) or DKK 22.

5 mio (ordinary list price)) and a grant to cover salary for research nurses at the hospitals (DKK 1.

9 mio).

 Additional research grants will be applied for from private and public research foundations as well as from industry.

 Atrial Fibrillation Detected by Continuous ECG Monitoring@highlight

The LOOP study aims to clarify whether stroke and peripheral emboli can be prevented by monitoring the heart rhythm with a small device (called a loop recorder).

 The recorder which is placed under the skin on the front of the chest wall allows monitoring of the heart rhythm 24-hours a day 7 days a week.

 The study has 6,000 participants with risk factors for stroke (age >70 years, and at least one of the diseases: diabetes, hypertension, heart failure or previous stroke) but without a history of atrial fibrillation, of which 1,500 will have a loop recorder implanted and 4,500 will be included in a control group.

 Participants are randomised to receive a loop recorder or not (control).

 If a participant has atrial fibrillation of more than 6 min duration the study participant will start oral anticoagulation therapy according to local guidelines.
