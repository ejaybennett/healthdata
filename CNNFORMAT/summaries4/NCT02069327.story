(thirdQuint)The Role of Fat Emboli in the Trauma Inflammatory Response.

 Bone marrow is routinely removed during a tibial or femoral fracture procedure; researchers will take samples for this study from bone marrow that has already been removed as part of this procedure.

 No additional marrow samples will be taken as part of this research study.

 Also, researchers will collect blood (about 4 teaspoons) for testing inflammatory response and coagulation.

 Researchers may need to insert an additional line to collect your blood.

 The Role of Fat Emboli in the Trauma Inflammatory Response@highlight

This is an observational study designed to investigate the role of fat emboli in patients who are undergoing a tibial or femoral fracture procedure in the operating room.

 The purpose of this study is to obtain samples of bone marrow and blood during tibial or femoral fracture procedures to understand the inflammatory response.
