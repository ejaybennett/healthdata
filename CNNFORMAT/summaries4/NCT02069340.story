(fifthQuint)Genetics in Predicting Risk of Bisphosphonate-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw in Patients With Cancer Receiving Zoledronic Acid.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To develop a pharmacometric model to predict jawbone zoledronic acid (Zol) concentrations in oncologic patients by conducting a prospective cohort study of Zol pharmacometrics in BRONJ patients, measuring drug in plasma, urine, and jawbone tissue obtained during surgical treatment for BRONJ.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To clinically assess and validate our predictive pharmacometric model, and develop a risk model for BRONJ in oncologic patients receiving intravenous Zol.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on day 1.

 ARM II: Patients receive zoledronic acid IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.

 Genetics in Predicting Risk of Bisphosphonate-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw in Patients With Cancer Receiving Zoledronic Acid@highlight

This randomized clinical trial studies genetics in predicting risk of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with cancer receiving zoledronic acid.

 Zoledronic acid is an anti-resorptive drug used as part of cancer treatment.

 A serious side effect of these drugs is death of the jawbone, commonly called bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ).

 Genetic research may help doctors understand risk factors for BRONJ or who is more likely to get BRONJ and why.
