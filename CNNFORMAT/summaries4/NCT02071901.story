(thirdQuint)Eltrombopag Olamine in Improving Platelet Recovery in Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Undergoing Chemotherapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

To determine whether eltrombopag leads to early platelet recovery in older AML patients ( 60years) who attain morphologic remission on day 14 (range, day 14-17) bone marrow assessment following remission induction chemotherapy (IC).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the effect of eltrombopag on megakaryopoiesis - median time to reach platelet count 50,000 /1/2L and 100,000 /1/2L, number of days of platelet transfusion, rates of platelet transfusion-independence and the median time to reach platelet transfusion independence.

 II.

 To determine the effect of eltrombopag on the rates of clinically significant bleeding events (CSBE).

 III.

 To determine the effect of eltrombopag on erythropoiesis the median time to red blood cell transfusion independence.

 IV.

 To determine the effect of eltrombopag on granulopoiesis- the time taken to reach an absolute neutrophil count of 500 /1/2L.

 V.

 To determine the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag in AML patients undergoing remission IC - incidence and severity of eltrombopag-related adverse events.

 VI.

 To determine rates of complete remission (CR), rates of partial complete remission (CRp), time to attain CR, and time to initiation of postremission consolidation therapy.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive eltrombopag olamine orally (PO) once daily (QD) until platelet counts reach 50,000/uL or for 8 weeks, whichever comes earlier.

 Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.

 Eltrombopag Olamine in Improving Platelet Recovery in Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Undergoing Chemotherapy@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well eltrombopag olamine works in improving the recovery of platelet counts in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing induction (the first treatment given for a disease) chemotherapy.

 Platelet counts recover more slowly in older patients, leading to risk of complications and the delay of post-remission therapy.

 Eltrombopag olamine may cause the body to make platelets after chemotherapy.
