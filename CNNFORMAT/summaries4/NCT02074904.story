(fifthQuint)Topiramate's Effects on Heavy Drinking.

 This project is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of topiramate's effects on brain and behavior responses in heavy drinkers.

 Eligible volunteers who meet study criteria will be randomized to receive either topiramate or placebo with weekly visits and medication management sessions.

 Participants will complete two magnetic resonance imaging sessions.

 The first scan session will occur prior to starting study drug, and the second scan will occur following six weeks of study drug.

 This project will yield novel findings on brain and behavioral responses to alcohol cues, the effects of topiramate on alcohol cue reactivity, and the mechanisms underlying topiramate's ability to blunt alcohol cue reactivity and heavy drinking.

 Topiramate's Effects on Heavy Drinking@highlight

The proposed project will utilize perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the effects of topiramate on brain and behavioral responses in heavy drinkers to appetitive alcohol reminders (cues that motivate continued alcohol use and relapse).

 This project will yield novel findings on brain and behavioral responses to alcohol cues, the effects of topiramate on alcohol cue reactivity, and the mechanisms underlying topiramate's ability to blunt alcohol cue reactivity and heavy drinking.
