(firstQuint)A Placebo Controlled Study Comparing AZD1775+ Docetaxel Versus Placebo+Docetaxel to Treat Lung Cancer.

 This multicentre trial consists of an open-labelled single cohort lead-in (Part A) followed by a phase II double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled comparison of AZD1775 (or placebo) and an antimitotic agent.

 Review by a central laboratory of fresh tumour or archival tumour samples will be required prior to study entry to assess TP53 mutation status.

 However, subjects will be allowed to enter the single cohort (Part A) regardless of TP53 mutation status (wild-type or mutant).

 In addition, patients in the single cohort Part A treatment group will be asked to consent to limited sample collections for assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters.
