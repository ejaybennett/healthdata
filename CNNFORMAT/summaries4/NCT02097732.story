(thirdQuint)Ipilimumab Induction in Patients With Melanoma Brain Metastases Receiving Stereotactic Radiosurgery.

 This is a randomized Phase II selection study investigating the use of ipilimumab induction prior to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), versus no induction, for melanoma brain metastases.

 Participants will be randomized to Arm A "Induction" (two doses of ipilimumab prior to SRS, two doses of ipilimumab after SRS) versus Arm B "No induction" (SRS first, followed by 4 doses of ipilimumab).

 Participants will undergo multiple dynamic contrast-enhanced MRIs of the brain and submit blood samples for immune testing.

 Ipilimumab Induction in Patients With Melanoma Brain Metastases Receiving Stereotactic Radiosurgery@highlight

This is a study to test the efficacy of using standard immune therapy for melanoma prior to stereotactic radiosurgery (ipilimumab induction), as compared to stereotactic radiosurgery followed by immune therapy.

 The study's hypothesis is that ipilimumab induction is as good as or better than controlling brain metastases as compared to stereotactic radiosurgery followed by immune therapy.
