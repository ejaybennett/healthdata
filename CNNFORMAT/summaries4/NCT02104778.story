(secondQuint)Effect of Dexamethasone and Epinephrine on the Duration of Sciatic Nerve Blocks With Ropivacaine.

 In a double-blinded trial utilizing single-injection sciatic nerve block, patients are randomly assigned to one of three groups: control: 0.

5% ropivacaine adding normal saline; epinephrine: 0.

5% ropivacaine adding epinephrine; dexamethasone: 0.

5% ropivacaine adding dexamethasone.

 We assess time to first analgesic request after post-anaesthesia care unit discharge.

 Effect of Dexamethasone and Epinephrine on the Duration of Sciatic Nerve Blocks With Ropivacaine@highlight

The aim of the present study is to test that adding dexamethasone or epinephrine significantly prolongs the duration of sciatic nerve blocks with ropivacaine and that the magnitude of the effect differs among dexamethasone and epinehrine.
