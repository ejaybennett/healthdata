(fifthQuint)Low-Dose Total Lymphoid Irradiation in Treating Patients With Refractory Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease After Donor Stem Cell Transplant.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the safety of total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) in cohorts of a selected population of refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) patients, given to cohorts with a total cumulative doses of TLI of 100, 150, 200, 250 or 300 centigray (cGy).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the efficacy (failure free survival [FFS] at 6 months) of this therapy in the study population.

 II.

 Approximate the efficacy at different dose levels using the GvHD summary scores.

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the effect of this therapy on relevant subpopulations of immune cells in an attempt to elucidate a mechanism of action.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients undergo LD-TLI daily for 1-2 days.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on day 45, at 3 and 6 months, at 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

 Low-Dose Total Lymphoid Irradiation in Treating Patients With Refractory Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease After Donor Stem Cell Transplant@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of low-dose total lymphoid irradiation (LD-TLI) in treating patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease that has not responded to treatment with steroids.

 LD-TLI is a procedure in which all of the body's major lymph nodes are treated with small doses of radiation in order to reset the dysfunctional immune system.

 LD-TLI may work as a treatment for graft-versus-host disease caused by a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.
