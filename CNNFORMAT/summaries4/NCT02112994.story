(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of Sebelipase Alfa in Patients With Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency.

 The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of intravenous infusions of sebelipase alfa in a more broad population of LALD patients than previously studied.

 Such patients may have been excluded from enrollment in other studies of LALD because of age, disease progression, previous treatment by hematopoietic stem cell or liver transplantation, less common disease manifestations, or disease characteristics that would preclude participation in a placebo-controlled study.

 This open-label study will include infants >8 months, children and adults.

 Eligible patients will receive sebelipase alfa at a dose of 1 mg/kg every other week.
