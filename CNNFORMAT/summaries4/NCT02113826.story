(thirdQuint)Pazopanib for Metastatic Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma.

 Pazopanib, a multi-targeted anti-angiogenesis inhibitor significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) after failure to anthracycline-based regimen (pazopanib vs placebo, 4.

6 months, HR=0.

 Regarding sunitinib (continuous daily dose of 37.

5mg), after a median duration of 10 months, median OS and PFS were 19 months and 17 months, respectively in a small retrospective study (ASPS, N=9).

 With regard to cediranib, 6-month PFS was over 60%.

 In addition, randomized phase II trial of sunitinib vs cediranib with cross-over at disease progression was recently initiated (NCT01391962).

 However, the efficacy of pazopanib is unknown in metastatic ASPS.

 Pazopanib for Metastatic Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma@highlight

Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), a rare subset of STS (<1%) harbors t(X;17)(p11;q25) translocation and produces resultant ASPL-TFE3 fusion protein.

 Due to its nature of high expression of angiogenic factors, sunitinib and cediranib produced overall response rates of 55% and 43%, respectively.

 However, the efficacy of pazopanib is unknown in metastatic ASPS.
