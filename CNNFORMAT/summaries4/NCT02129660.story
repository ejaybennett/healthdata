(secondQuint)Comparator Study of the Effect of DRM04B and DRM 04 in Subjects With Axillary Hyperhidrosis.

 This is a randomized, double-blind, vehicle controlled, parallel group, comparator study designed to assess the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of two doses of DRM04B compared to two doses of DRM04 compared to vehicle, 5 treatment arms.

 Efficacy will be assessed through gravimetric assessment of sweat production using Patient Reported Outcome and the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (HDSS).

 Safety will be assessed through adverse events, local skin responses, serum chemistry and hematology laboratory testing, ECGs, physical examination and vital signs.

 PK blood samples will be taken study subjects.
