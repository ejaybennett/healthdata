(thirdQuint)Plasmablast Trafficking and Antibody Response in Influenza Vaccination (SLVP021 2011-2014).

 The aim of this study is to compare the response to different formulations of licensed influenza vaccines.

 The type of seasonal influenza vaccination(s) received independently by volunteers in the year(s) since their last study visit will not impact eligibility.

 Volunteers will be assigned into one of three vaccine groups (intramuscular trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV); live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV- given year 1 only) or intradermal TIV, based on the type of study vaccine they received in 2010, 2011, 2012, or 2013.

 All participants will receive a single dose of their assigned seasonal influenza vaccine.

 Volunteers will complete 3 study visits at Day 0, Day 6-8 and Day 24-32.
