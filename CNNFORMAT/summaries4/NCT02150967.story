(firstQuint)A Phase II, Single Arm Study of BGJ398 in Patients With Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma.

 Adult patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 gene fusion/ translocation or other FGFR genetic alteration who have evidence of radiologic progression following a cisplatin-and gemcitabine-containing regimen for advanced disease or a gemcitabine-containing regimen for those who are considered intolerant to cisplatin will be enrolled.

 Approximately 55 adult patients over age 18, both male and female will be enrolled.

 Of these 55 patients, 40 patients will have cholangiocarcinoma with identified FGFR2 gene fusions and up to 15 patients may have other FGFR genetic alterations.

 All patients will receive oral BGJ398, once daily, on a three weeks on (21 days), one week off (7 days) schedule.

 One treatment cycle will consists of 28 days.
