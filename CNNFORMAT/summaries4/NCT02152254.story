(fifthQuint)IMPACT 2: Randomized Study Evaluating Molecular Profiling and Targeted Agents in Metastatic Cancer.

 If you agree to take part in this study, a sample of tumor tissue will be collected as part of a biopsy.

 The type of biopsy you receive will depend on the disease site.

 The study doctor will describe the procedure and its risks to you before the biopsy.

 If you have tumor tissue available from a procedure performed within the last year and you have received no anti-cancer therapy since that time, samples from this procedure may be able to be used for molecular profiling.

 In this case, you would not need to have a biopsy.

 The study doctor will discuss with you whether your leftover sample can be used.

 The tumor tissue will be sent to Foundation Medicine for molecular profiling.

 Then, the results will be used to determine if there is a genetic abnormality for which a targeted therapy is available.

 The planned time to get this information is 3 weeks, or possibly longer if needed.

 As with other cancer studies, this may take more time to determine.

 If you have previously untreated cancer your doctor may treat you with standard therapy, excluding targeted therapy.

 In this case, results of your molecular profiling will be used for further treatment if your disease gets worse.

 A) If there is no abnormality, your doctor will treat you according to what he/she thinks is in your best interest.

 The results of molecular profiling will be given to you at the time the results become available.

 B) If there is an abnormality and there is an FDA-approved drug for the tumor type, you will be offered that treatment.

 The results of molecular profiling will be given to you at the time the results become available.

 C) If there is an abnormality and there is no FDA-approved drug for the abnormality and the tumor type, you will then be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups.

 You will have an equal chance of being assigned to either group: - If you are in Group 1, you will receive a targeted therapy against the abnormality.

 - If you are in Group 2, you will receive a standard-of-care therapy.

 Neither you nor your study doctor will be able to choose to which group you are assigned.

 The results of molecular profiling will be given to you before you are randomly assigned to a treatment group.

 If at any point the disease appears to get worse, you will be able to cross over to the other study group and be assigned to that therapy.

 Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to look for genetic changes in your blood.

 All Patients: The therapy you will receive may consist of either a commercially available drug/therapy or a clinical study in which you will be asked to be enrolled.

 In either case, the disease will be followed as part of the standard of care (imaging scans, blood draws, biopsies, and so on).

 These procedures will not be performed as part of this study.

 However, their results and other entries in your medical record will be checked as part of this study to learn if the disease is getting worse, getting better, or staying the same.

 Length of Study: Your medical records and your health will continue to be reviewed from the time that you sign this consent until any time that the disease appears to get worse (unless you cross over to another study group).

 IMPACT 2: Randomized Study Evaluating Molecular Profiling and Targeted Agents in Metastatic Cancer@highlight

You are being asked to take part in this study because you have metastatic cancer (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body).

 Cancer can be caused by abnormalities in genetic material (such as gene mutations).

 These genetic differences can be found by studying the tumor (molecular profiling).

 Information from molecular profiling can be used to choose treatment that may target the tumor.

 This is known as personalized medicine.

 Early studies have shown that molecular profiling has led to patients being treated with more specialized therapy than they would normally receive.

 At this time is it unknown whether molecular profiling and selection of treatment has different results than standard-of-care treatment.

 The goal of this research study is to compare the effects of treatment based on molecular profiling to those of the standard-of-care.

 This is an investigational study.

 Up to 1,362 participants will take part in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson and its regional care centers.
