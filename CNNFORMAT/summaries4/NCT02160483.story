(firstQuint)Functional Brain Imaging and Psychological Testing in Women With Chronic Pelvic Pain.

 Multimodal magnetic resonance neuroimaging will be utilised.

 Arterial spin labelling is tightly coupled with cerebral metabolism and can be used as a marker of neural activity.

 Resting state magnetic resonance imaging which measures synchronous activity across the brain, allows detection of functional connectivity of intrinsic brain network.

 Diffusion tensor imaging detects the anisotropic water diffusion in axonal fibres can provide information on connectivity and fibre tracts.

 Magnetic resonance spectroscopy would enable the levels of neurotransmitter to be elucidated.
