(fifthQuint)Secretin Infusion to Prevent Pancreatic Leaks Following Pancreatic Resection.

 We hypothesize that intra-operative, intravenous secretin administration will decrease the rate of pancreatic leaks in patients undergoing pancreatic resection.

 Our primary objective is to determine if intravenous secretin administration will decrease the amount of pancreatic leaks as measured by drain fluid amylase 5 days following resection.

 Our secondary objectives are to determine if intra-operative intravenous secretin administration changes the management of the pancreatic resection margin intra-operatively or impacts length of stay (LOS) Use a level of detail similar to what would be used when submitting an article for publication in a peer reviewed journal.

 Explain the study procedures, data collection, and analysis process.

 Please define terms and explain concepts which might be confusing to reviewers who are not expert in the area of the study.

 If a formal protocol for the study exists, page references to the protocol are acceptable.

 This study design is a prospective, double-blind, randomized-controlled trial.

 We will enroll patients in our institution undergoing pancreatic resection to receive either 1) one dose weight-based Secretin to be given once the closure of the pancreatic resection margin is complete 2) saline placebo.

 Consent and basic demographics will be garnered by the physician in an office visit once the surgery has been scheduled and consent for the surgery is being obtained.

 The consent will be validated by the treating surgeon in the pre-procedure area on the day of the surgery.

 The patient will undergo the scheduled surgery.

 Once the pancreatic anastomosis has been deemed acceptable by the attending physician, but prior to abdominal closure, the patient will be randomized to receive either Secretin (0.

2 mcg/kg) or saline placebo.

 The attending surgeon will be blinded to this assignment.

 10 minutes after receiving the Secretin or placebo, the attending surgeon will examine the anastomosis or repaired cut edge of the pancreas to determine if leakage of pancreatic fluid is noted, leak location(s), type (side branch/main duct) and whether any further intervention was performed in an effort to close the leak.

 Specifics of operative intervention will be documented.

 The patient will then undergo standard surgical closure of the abdomen.

 As is standard of care at DHMC, surgical drains will be placed adjacent to the anastomosis and drain amylase output will be checked on POD #1, POD#3 and POD#5.

 Pancreatic leak is defined according to the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) definition as drainage of >50 cc/day of amylase-rich fluid (greater than a 3-fold elevation above the upper limit of normal in serum) through the surgically placed drains on POD #5.

 Randomization assignments will be revealed once the patient has been discharged from the hospital following their initial surgical intervention.

 A follow-up visit with the patient two weeks following discharge, will evaluate for any evidence of ongoing pancreatic duct leak.

 The primary outcome of interest will be the presence of pancreatic leaks based on the amount of drain amylase on POD#5.

 Secondary outcomes will include: 1) technical interventions intra-operatively directed to leak closure or manipulation of the anastomosis following Secretin or placebo stimulation 2) length of stay as a surrogate to complication severity after pancreatic surgery.

 Patient demographics, risk factors, operative technique, randomization assignment and outcome data will be recorded on standard case report forms - See Case Report Forms in Appendix.

 Data will be stored in an encrypted hard-drive by a single agent (Gardner) who is the only researcher who has access to the randomization data.

 Secretin Infusion to Prevent Pancreatic Leaks Following Pancreatic Resection@highlight

Pancreatic leaks complicate pancreatic resection in approximately 20% of cases.

 The pancreatic anastomosis or repair has been referred to as the Achilles heel of pancreatic surgery.

 Unfortunately, despite recognition of this problem and multiple operative techniques proposed to prevent this complication, leaks continue to represent a major cause of morbidity for patients undergoing pancreatic surgery.

 Treatment of leaks often requires nutritional support with total parenteral nutrition to diminish the leak in addition to invasive interventions to contain the leak with drains, stents or in severe cases, reoperation.

 Experiential data suggest that intra-operative infusions of secretin, a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates bicarbonate release from the pancreas, following resection but just prior to abdomen closure, may identify a leak if present.

 If secretin can demonstrate evidence of leaking intra-operatively, the pancreatic duct leak may be able to be fixed prior to abdominal closure.

 The investigators aim to determine if giving an intra-operative infusion of secretin will allow for identification and treatment of leaks after pancreatic reconstruction and prior to abdominal closure, leading to a reduction in the rate of pancreatic anastomotic leaks requiring intervention.

 The investigators will perform a double-blind, randomized pilot study of 176 patients undergoing pancreatic resection (pancreaticoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy) at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.

 88 of those patients will receive an intra-operative secretin infusion prior to abdominal closure and 88 will receive a saline placebo.

 Our primary outcome of interest will be the rate of pancreas duct leaks in each group as measured by the amount of amylase present in the surgical drains 5 days following surgery.
