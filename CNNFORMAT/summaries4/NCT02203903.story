(thirdQuint)Multi-institutional Prospective Research of Expanded Multi-antigen Specifically Oriented Lymphocytes for the Treatment of VEry High Risk Hematopoietic Malignancies.

 This Phase I dose-escalation trial is designed to evaluate the safety of administering rapidly-generated multi-antigen-specific T lymphocytes, to HSCT recipients or future HSCT recipients for the treatment or relapsed or refractory hematopoietic malignancies.

 This study will first enroll 2 adult patients to each arm (A and B) prior to enrolling pediatric patients, all of whom will have either relapsed or persistent hematological malignancies pre- or post- allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation.

 TAA-CTL may be generated from host lymphocytes (pre-HSCT) or donor lymphocytes (post-HSCT) obtained from either patient PBMC or donor PBMC.

 Four different dosing schedules will be evaluated.

 Two to four patients will be evaluated on each dosing schedule (See below).

 This protocol is designed as a phase I dose-escalation study.

 For Arm A Patients (post HSCT): T cells will be infused any time after neutrophil engraftment post-HSCT or day 30, whichever comes first.

 For Arm B Patients (pre HSCT): T cells will be infused any time >1 week after previous therapy for relapsed disease.

 For Arm C Patients (post HSCT): T cells will be infused any time after neutrophil engraftment post-HSCT or day 30, whichever comes first.

 In each group, a patient will be enrolled to one of the following dosing schedule.

 Dose Level One: 5 x 106 cells/m2 Dose Level Two: 1 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Three: 2 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Four: 4 x 107 cells/m2 Each patient will receive at least one infusions according to the enrolled dose level, where the expected volume of infusion is 1 to 10 cc.

 Patients will receive cells either because: of prior refractory disease and/or high risk for relapse and/or detectable disease at the time of infusion.

 Group A and Group B patients will use the dose escalation strategy described above.

 We strongly recommend that patients should not receive other systemic antineoplastic agents for at least 6 weeks after infusion of TAA-specific T-cells (for purposes of evaluation), although such treatment may be added if deemed critical for patient care by the attending physician.

 Arm C patients will (post HSCT): T cells will be infused any time after neutrophil engraftment post-HSCT or day 30, whichever comes first, on the top dose level determined in the safety phase of Arm A.

 TAA-CTL cells may be infused any time after neutrophil engraftment post-HSCT or day 30, whichever comes first if patient is post-allo HSCT, and at greater than 1 week after prior cytoreductive therapy if patients is pre-allo HSCT.

 We strongly recommend that patients should not receive other systemic antineoplastic agents for at least 6 weeks after infusion of TAA-specific T-cells (for purposes of evaluation), although such treatment may be added if deemed critical for patient care by the attending physician and not under IND.

 Exclusions to this include: agents that have shown success in disease reduction and safety after HSCT (to include FLT3 inhibitors and BCR-ABL inhibitors).

 For autologous recipients, this could include PD-1 inhibitors or other immune activators if these have been previously tolerated without autoimmunity; however, allogeneic patients are not eligible to receive these agents in conjunction with TAA-L cells.

 If patients with active disease do not have >grade 3 toxicity that is possibly, probably, or definitely attributed to cells and fail to rapidly progress with disease requiring urgent therapy, patients may receive subsequent doses.

 Subsequent doses will be available for those patients who have stable disease or a mixed, partial, or complete response by the International Working Group (IWG) criteria at the evaluation after dose 1.

 They are eligible to receive up to 6 additional doses of TAA-CTLs at monthly intervals-each of which will consist of the same cell number as their tolerated dose level.

 Notably, these doses will be identical to the treated dose for this patient (i.

e.

 no subsequent dose escalation).

 Patients will not be able to receive additional doses until the initial 28 day evaluation for toxicity and efficacy following the second infusion.

This Phase I dose-escalation trial is designed to evaluate the safety of administering rapidly-generated multi-antigen-specific T lymphocytes, to HSCT recipients (Arm A) or future HSCT recipients (Arm B) for the treatment or relapsed or refractory hematopoietic malignancies, to determine if event-free survival (EFS) at six months after HSCT is improved with TAA-L administration at six months after HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia and MDS (Arm C).
