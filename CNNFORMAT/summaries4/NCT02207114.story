(thirdQuint)Using Biomarkers to Optimize Antibiotic Strategies in Sepsis.

 The goal of this project is reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics in the ICU.

 The purpose of Phase I of the study is to identify the biomarker, or combination of biomarkers, that provides optimal test characteristics in identifying adults and children/neonates with presumed sepsis who have a very low likelihood of bacterial infection.

 Results of Phase I will result in development of a biomarker-based algorithm to inform need for antibiotic use in ICU patients.

 In Phase II, the impact of this biomarker-based algorithm on reducing antibiotic use in the ICU will be determined.

 Costs or savings associated with the algorithm will also be assessed.

 Using Biomarkers to Optimize Antibiotic Strategies in Sepsis@highlight

The proposed work will provide critical insights into the potential impact of a biomarker-based algorithm on reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in different adult and pediatric/neonatal ICU's.

 This proposal will also assess the costs (or savings) of a biomarker-based intervention.

 Overall, the results of this work will be critical in informing future strategies to eliminate unnecessary antibiotic use and curb the continued rise in antimicrobial resistance.
