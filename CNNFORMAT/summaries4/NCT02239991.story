(firstQuint)Management of Perioperative Coagulopathy With Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in Liver Transplant.

 Patients with liver disease frequently acquire a complex disorder of hemostasis secondary to their disease.

 The fundamental key to the management of coagulopathy of cirrhotic patient is the knowledge that hepatic dysfunction results in impairment of both pro-hemostatic factors as anti-hemostatic factors in a disproportionate manner which can lead to a clinical picture of both bleeding and thrombosis.

 Routine tests of coagulation as prothrombin time (PT, INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) although prolonged in cirrhotic patients cannot predict bleeding.

 Global viscoelastic test of whole blood (TEG / ROTEM) produce a dynamic composite image of the entire coagulation process and have the potential to provide clinically relevant information in patients with liver disease allowing rational use of blood products during liver transplantation.

A point-of-care bleeding management protocol based on global viscoelastic test (thromboelastometry) can change the amount of blood products used during orthotopic liver transplant.
