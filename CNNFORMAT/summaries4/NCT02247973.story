(secondQuint)Mesenchymal Stem Cells Co-transplantation in Alternative Donor Transplantation of Severe Aplastic Anemia.

.

 Aplastic anemia (AA) is an autoimmune hematologic stem cell disease mediated by activated T-lymphocytes that leads to bone marrow dysfunction.

 In the presence of an empty marrow, pancytopenia, and transfusion dependence, the severity of the disease is based on neutrophil (PMN) count: nonsevere AA (nSAA; PMN > 0.

5 * 109/L), severe AA (SAA;PMN 0.

2- 0.

5 * 109/L), and very severe AA (vSAA; PMN12.

4%.

 Retrospectively analyzed results for 154 patients with acquired SAA who received BMT from unrelated donors identified through the Japan Marrow Donor Program showed the probability of OS at 5 years was 56% (95% confidence interval, 34%-78%).

 Compared with malignant disease, mismatched related donor or unrelated donor HSCT for SAA involves distinct challenges mainly associated with high graft failure and high GVHD.

 So, if we can find a way to promote implantation meanwhile prevent or reduce GVHD , the efficacy of HLA-mismatched related donors transplantation can improve.

 Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multi-potent non-hematopoietic progenitors mainly found in BM, cord blood, and adipose tissue.

 MSCs are attractive because of the ease with which they can be isolated and expanded ex vivo, their ability to undergo multilineage differentiation, and their lack of immunogenicity.

 These cells were shown to provide support for the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in BM micro-environments.

 In additon, preliminary studies have shown clinical effectiveness of allogeneic MSC in the treatment of refractory graft-versus-host disease and an improvement in or resolution of severe aGVHD when co-transplantation with MSCs.

 Due to these properties, MSCs have become an interesting candidate for use in cellular therapy and are considered "theoretically perfect cells" for potential clinical use against AA mismatched related donors transplantation.

@highlight

The study is a phase II trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of co-transplantation with bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells from related donors in alternative donor transplantation of severe aplastic anemia.
