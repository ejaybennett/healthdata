(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Cocktail Periarticular Injection in Simultaneous Total Knee Arthroplasty.

 It is hypothesized that intraoperative periarticular injection with cocktail analgesics can reduce postoperative parenteral narcotics use and improve patient satisfaction following total knee arthroplasty.

 A prospective, randomized trial is conducted to testify the hypothesis above by recruiting patients who go through simultaneous bilateral TKA and observing their postoperative analgesic consumption, visual analog scores and functional recovery.

 Potential side-effects of the multimodal drugs is also under observation.
