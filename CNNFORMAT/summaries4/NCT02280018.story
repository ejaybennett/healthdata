(secondQuint)A Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics Study of a Single Intravenous Dose of JNJ-49122944 in Healthy Male Participants.

 This is a double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), and single-center study.

 The study will consist of Screening Period (2 to 21 days prior to participants' dose administration), Double-blind Treatment Period (single dose of JNJ-49122944 or placebo on Day 1), and Safety Follow-up Period (4 to 7 days after discharge).

 The total duration of participation for each participant, including screening, will be up to approximately 4 weeks.

 Blood samples will be collected for assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters.

 Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (the study of the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) of JNJ-49122944 in healthy male participants after a single intravenous ([IV] within a vein) dose administration.
