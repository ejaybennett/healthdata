(firstQuint)[18F]ISO-1 PET/CT in Breast Cancer.

 This study will evaluate the feasibility of using [18F]ISO-1 PET/CT to image sigma-2 receptor binding in primary breast tumors and continue to evaluate the safety of the tracer in this patient population.

 [18F]ISO-1 uptake measures will be correlated with qualitative immunohistochemical staining for cell proliferation (Ki67).

 This is an observational study in that [18F]ISO-1 PET/CT will not be used to direct treatment decisions.
