(secondQuint)Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Fine Motor Skills in Parkinson's Disease: a Pilot Study.

 The pilot study will involve a double-blind, sham controlled cross-over design where participants will receive anodal and sham tDCS stimulation in a randomized order.

 Differences in brain activity and fine motor skill performance between groups and after tDCS stimulation will be compared.
