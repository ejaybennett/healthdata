(firstQuint)Prospective Study on Modified Delta-shaped Gastroduodenostomy in Totally Laparoscopic Surgery for Distal Gastric Cancer.

 A prospective randomized comparison of the modified delta-shaped gastroduodenostomy in totally laparoscopic surgery and Billroth-I anastomosis in laparoscopy-assisted surgery for distal gastric cancer will be performed, to evaluate the clinical value and provide theoretical basis and clinical experience for the extensive application of the modified technique.

 The evaluation parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative life quality, immune function and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.
