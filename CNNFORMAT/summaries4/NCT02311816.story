(firstQuint)Increase in Procalcitonin Kinetics May be a Good Indicator of Starting Empirical Antibiotic Treatment in Critically Ill Patients.

 Starting antibiotic therapy early in critically ill patients with suspected infection is of utmost importance with significant effect on survival.

 Procalcitonin is a reliable sepsis marker but results about its usefulness in initiating antimicrobials are conflicting.

 Our aim is to investigate the predictive value of 24 hours procalcitonin kinetics before starting empirical antibiotic therapy in intensive care patients as an indicator of the presence of bacterial infection.

The value of procalcitonin change from the day before to the day when infection was suspected in predicting bacterial infection in intensive care patients.
