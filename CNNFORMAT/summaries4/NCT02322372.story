(secondQuint)Femoral Blockade and Low-dose Spinal Anesthesia in Outpatient Knee Arthroscopy.

 Fifty patients undergoing arthroscopic meniscus repair were included to the current study.

 The patients were allocated to two groups as the spinal anesthesia with conventional dose of heavy bupivacaine or spinal anesthesia with low dose heavy bupivacaine combined with femoral blockade.

 Blood pressures and heart rates were recorded at the beginning, at the 0th minute following femoral block, at the 0th minute and in two-minute intervals following spinal anesthesia for 20 minutes and in five-minute intervals till the end of surgery.

 The sensorial block and motor block in both extremities were recorded in two-minute intervals following spinal anesthesia and in five-minute intervals till the end of surgery The time of sensorial blockade to reach T12, maximum level of sensorial blockade level and the time to reach maximum level of sensorial blockade and the time for regression of sensorial blockade to L2, the time for regression of motor blockade were recorded.

The investigators of the current study aimed to evaluate the effect of spinal anesthesia with low dose bupivacaine combined with femoral blockade on duration of anesthesia and time of first analgesic requirement during postoperative period
