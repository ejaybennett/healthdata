(thirdQuint)ADXS31-142 Alone and in Combination With Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Patients With Prostate Cancer - KEYNOTE-046.

 Part A of the study will be an open-label, Phase 1, multicenter, non-randomized, dose-determining trial of ADX31-142 monotherapy in subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

 The dose determining phase is intended to select a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for Part B.

 Part B of the study will be an open-label, Phase 1-2, multicenter, non-randomized dose-determining trial of ADXS31-142 in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in subjects with mCRPC.

 Part B will consist of a dose-determination phase followed by an expansion cohort phase.

 The dose-determining phase is intended to select a RP2D for the combination.

 Dose escalation/de-escalation for this study will be explored by applying the mTPI design.
