(secondQuint)Adherence Intervention to Promote Optimal Use of Insulin Pumps in Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes.

 To achieve optimal use of the insulin pump, patients must engage in frequent Blood Glucose Monitoring (BGM) and insulin bolusing, and have an understanding of their relationship.

 BGM must occur and then it must be followed by a decision about what to do (or not do) regarding insulin bolusing.

 If insulin bolusing occurs in the absence of BGM, hypoglycemia and less than ideal glycemic control can occur.

 Of the few insulin pump adherence studies, only very basic adherence behaviors such as BGM and insulin bolusing frequency or number of hypoglycemic events have been reported.

 The overall objective of this study is to address the critical need of improving insulin pump adherence in adolescents with T1D by providing personalized intervention using evidence-based techniques during routine diabetes clinic visits at point of care.
