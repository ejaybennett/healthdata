(firstQuint)A Safety and Efficacy Study of BBI-4000 in Subjects With Axillary Hyperhidrosis.

 This is a Multicenter, Randomized, Double Blind, Vehicle-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of 3 concentrations of Topically Applied BBI-4000 in Subjects with Axillary Hyperhidrosis.

 Participating subjects will apply BBI-4000 once a day for 4 weeks in their axillae.

 The 4 week treatment period will be followed by a 2 week follow-up period.

 Safety will be assessed through collection of vital signs, adverse events, local skin responses, hematology and serum chemistry laboratory testing and ECGs.

 Efficacy will be assessed using the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (patient reported outcome) and through gravimetrically measured sweat production.

 PK blood samples will be taken from study subjects from selected centers.
