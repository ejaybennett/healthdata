(firstQuint)Detection of Chlamydia DNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction in Primary Tubal and Ovarian Cancers Tissues : a Pilot Study.

 The investigators shall review the early cancer detection unite pathology records for the past 10 years , for cases diagnosed with primary Fallopian tube cancers , cases of high and low grade serous ovarian cancer and cases underwent hysterectomy and salpingectomy for non oncological reasons.

 Paraffin blocks for suitable selected patients will be examined histologically to confirm the primary diagnosis .

 Chlamydia DNA in these paraffin blocks of the Fallopian tubes and ovarian tissues will be examined using PCR techniques .

 The possible correlation between the presence of Chlamydia DNA and the ovarian serous tumours and primary tubal cancer will be analyzed statistically .

 Detection of Chlamydia DNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction in Primary Tubal and Ovarian Cancers Tissues : a Pilot Study@highlight

PCR for chlamydia DNA is done in paraffin blocks of cases of primary tubal cancer and is compared to cases of high grade serous ovarian cancer and normal tubes .
