(secondQuint)Inter-Observer Reliability and Accuracy of Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion in Patients With Suspected PE in the ED.

 This will be a prospective observational cohort study aimed at determining the utility and reproducibility of TAPSE, in patients who present to the emergency department with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).

 The gold standard diagnostic test for PE is computed tomography of the pulmonary arteries (CTPA).

 Any patient for whom a CTPA is ordered because of suspected PE is eligible for study inclusion.

The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the measurement of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) by emergency physician performed echocardiogram on patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) who are scheduled to get a computed tomography of the pulmonary arteries (CTPA)
