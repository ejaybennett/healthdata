(thirdQuint)Pembrolizumab After ASCT for Hodgkin Lymphoma, DLBCL and T-NHL.

 Pembrolizumab is an antibody drug that blocks a molecule called PD-1.

 PD-1 is a receptor molecule on the surface of immune cells that can be used to turn off the immune response.

 Some cancers use this as a way to turn off the immune response against them.

 Blocking PD-1 with pembrolizumabmay restore an effective immune attack against the lymphoma cells.

 On this study, patients who undergo ASCT for R/R cHL, DLBCL or PTCL in 1st remission will receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles, beginning within a few weeks of ASCT.

This phase II study is designed to determine the clinical efficacy of PD-1 blockade, using the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab (MK-3475), administered as consolidation therapy after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) or peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in 1st remission.
