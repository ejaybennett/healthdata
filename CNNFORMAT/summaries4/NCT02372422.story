(firstQuint)Transvaginal Ultrasound Cervical Length Measurements in Twin Gestations.

 This is a randomized controlled trial to determine whether there is a difference in the rate of preterm birth among women with twin pregnancies whose clinicians are aware of transvaginal ultrasound cervical length measurements compared to those managed without this information.

 The study group had transvaginal cervical length ultrasound monthly from 16-28 weeks and were managed with a standard algorithm for activity restriction and cerclage depending on the cervical length.

 The control group had digital cervical exams and routine transvaginal cervical length ultrasound was not utilized.

 The primary outcome was the mean length of gestation.

 Secondary outcomes included percentage of deliveries < 35 weeks, maternal and neonatal outcomes.

The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of routine transvaginal cervical length ultrasound can be used to prevent preterm deliveries in twin gestations.
