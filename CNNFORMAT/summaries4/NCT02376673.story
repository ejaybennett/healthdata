(fifthQuint)Comparing Children's Book to Brochures for Safe Sleep Education in a Home Visiting Program.

 Safe sleep and health literacy are priorities at national, state, and local levels.

 While greatly improved since the launch of the Back to Sleep campaign in the 1990s, the rate of sleep-related infant deaths, notably Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), has been stagnant for over a decade.

 While printed materials are widely distributed for SIDS education, to date none have been proven effective, and overall satisfaction has been low.

 Reasons include passive delivery, unappealing content, and excessively high reading level, especially for low-socioeconomic status populations.

 Evidence suggests that an ideal strategy involves printed materials combining simplicity, emotional appeal, cultural sensitivity, and low reading level, conveyed by health care practitioners and reviewed multiple times.

 Children's books are a potentially ideal medium for this, combining pictures and text to invoke emotion and inspire a shared parent-child experience that is valued and repeated.

 This is a randomized controlled trial involving a population of at-risk, low-socioeconomic status, first-time mothers enrolled in an early intervention home visitation program, Every Child Succeeds (ECS).

 ECS home visitors from 9 agencies will be randomly assigned to utilize either a specially-designed children's book (intervention) or standard brochures (control) for safe sleep education.

 Our target enrollment is 230 mothers.

 Trained ECS home visitors will obtain consent, distribute the book or brochures, and perform baseline assessment of health literacy (via the REALM-R screen), safe sleep knowledge, and home literacy orientation during a third trimester, prenatal home visit.

 Outcomes data will be collected by the same visitor during subsequent home visits at 1 week old, when infant sleep routines are being established, and 2 months old, at onset of peak SIDS risk.

 At each visit, the book or brochures will be reviewed.

 Outcomes will be compared between intervention and control groups in the following categories: 1) maternal safe sleep knowledge, 2) maternal adherence to safe sleep guidelines (observed), 3) maternal and provider satisfaction with materials utilized to convey safe sleep guidelines, and 4) the degree to which utilizing a children's book for health education impacts home literacy orientation (i.

e.

 attitudes towards reading).

 Comparing Children's Book to Brochures for Safe Sleep Education in a Home Visiting Program@highlight

This randomized controlled trial compares a specially-designed children's book to standard brochures for safe sleep education and reduction of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) risk in a high-risk population of young, first-time mothers enrolled in a home visitation program.

 Roughly half of the mothers will receive safe sleep education via the book, the other half via brochures, during prescribed home visits.

 Our study will assess differences in safe sleep knowledge, adherence to recommendations, satisfaction with materials used, and attitudes towards reading with their baby.

 Our hypothesis is that these will be higher in the group receiving the book, due to simpler language, appealing illustrations, emotional connection, and repeated exposures via shared reading.
