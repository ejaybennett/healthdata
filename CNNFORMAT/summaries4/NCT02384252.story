(secondQuint)Characterization of Obesity-related Cardiomyopathy Through Exploration of Human Atrial Trabeculae Contraction.

 Obesity is associated with the development of heart failure, regardless of coronary artery disease or other comorbidities.

 Right atrial samples obtained from patients undergoing cardiac surgery and presenting no sign of clinical cardiomyopathy will be grouped according to patient's body mass index.

 Atrial trabeculae will be explored to dissect out the respective contribution of (i) sarcoplasmic reticulum dysfunction (isometric twitch force contraction analysis), (ii) abnormal sarcomere sensitivity to calcium assessed in permeabilized fibers and (iii) mitochondrial dysfunction to intrinsec contractile dysfunction of myocardium in obese patients.

 Characterization of Obesity-related Cardiomyopathy Through Exploration of Human Atrial Trabeculae Contraction@highlight

The investigators aim to explore obese cardiomyopathy by studying contractile twitch force, sarcomere sensitivity to calcium and mitochondrial function in atrial myocardial samples of patients grouped according to their body mass index, i.

 normal weight, overweight and obese.
