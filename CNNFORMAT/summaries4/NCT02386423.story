(secondQuint)RESTIFFIC Foot Wrap Reduces Moderate to Severe Restless Leg Syndrome.

 Restless legs syndrome (RLS), or Willis-Ekbom Disease, is a neurologic disorder causing unpleasant sensations and an urge to move the legs when the person is at rest.

 The sensations are relieved by movement.

 Loss of sleep associated with RLS can cause extreme fatigue, affecting concentration, which may produce anxiety and depression, resulting in a poor quality of life.

 Prevalence in the general population is 5% to 10%.

 In approximately 3%, symptoms are so severe that treatment is sought.

 Potent drugs, such as opioids, central nervous system depressants, anticonvulsants, and dopamine agonists have been used to ease symptoms, each with several side effects.

 Anecdotal evidence suggested that pressure on specific foot muscles decreases symptoms of moderate to severe primary restless legs syndrome.

 In the RESTIFFIC cent study, patients served as their own negative controls, wearing the RESTIFFIC cent devices intermittently, while completing surveys related to RLS throughout the study.

 Physicians also completed surveys related to quality of life.

 Meta-analysis was used to compare RESTIFFIC cent to historic reports of ropinirole and placebo pill.

 Demographics, disease severity,inclusion/exclusion criteria, assessment tools were similar among studies.
