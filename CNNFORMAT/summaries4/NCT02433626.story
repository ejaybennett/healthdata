(fifthQuint)Study of COTI-2 for the Treatment of Gynecologic Malignancies and Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

 This is a three-part, multi-center, open-label, Phase 1, first-in-patient study of COTI-2 in patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, endometrial, or cervical cancer (collectively gynecological malignancies), and in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

 COTI-2 will be self-administered as a single agent, orally, once daily for 5 days followed by 2 treatment-free days each week.

 Part 1 of the study will be dose finding in patients with gynecological malignancies using a 3 + 3 design to establish the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) over 6 planned cohorts.

 Part 2 of the study will be dose finding in patients with HNSCC using a 3 + 3 design to establish the MTD over 6 planned cohorts.

 Part 3 of the study will enrol a further 10 Ovarian and 10 HNSCC participants to further establish tolerability and efficacy at the MTD.

 Study of COTI-2 for the Treatment of Gynecologic Malignancies and Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma@highlight

Activity of COTI-2 has been demonstrated in various cancer tumor models.

 With its p53- and AKT-based mechanisms of action, COTI-2 is anticipated to be highly relevant in treatment of patients with gynecologic malignancies or head and neck suamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

 This study is designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of COTI-2 in patients with advanced and recurrent gynecologic malignancies and HNSCC to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for future studies.

 Patients are currently being recruited for Part 2 of the study.
