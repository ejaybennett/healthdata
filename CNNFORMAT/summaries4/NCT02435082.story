(secondQuint)Vascular Assessment of Regulation Index Arrays Registry.

 The key aims of the VARIA Registry are to determine the real-life testing patterns and clinical outcomes of newly diagnosed patients with brain injury.

 In accordance with the primary objective, the study will collect and analyze physiological data associated with brain injury identified in normal clinical practice with specific reference to: - Patient demographics, symptoms, NCI Index, and other test results, - Baseline ranges by demographic group, - Post-injury patients presenting without a baseline test to be assessed in the context of the norms for similar patients, - Recovery curves by demographic, - Health Economics.

 This registry will be a prospective observational study to collect data to describe the real-life testing patterns and clinical outcomes of newly diagnosed patients with brain injury.
