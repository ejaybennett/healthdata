(fifthQuint)Biologic Mesh in Preventing Hernia in Patients With Bladder Cancer Undergoing Radical Cystectomy With Ileal Conduit Diversion.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To estimate the rate of developing parastomal hernia detected either clinically or radiologically in patients with radical cystectomy and ileal conduit, with or without mesh.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To estimate the rate of developing symptomatic parastomal hernia requiring surgical intervention in patients with radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with or without mesh.

 II.

 To estimate the time from cystectomy with an ileal conduit to diagnosis of clinical parastomal hernia development in patients with radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with or without mesh.

 III.

 To estimate the time from cystectomy with an ileal conduit to diagnosis of radiological parastomal hernia development in patients with radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with or without mesh.

 IV.

 To estimate the rate of stomal prolapse and time to its development in patients with radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with or without mesh.

 V.

 To evaluate mesh-related complications in mesh group.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 ARM I: Patients undergo placement of biologic mesh during radical cystectomy and placement of the ileal conduit.

 ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care radical cystectomy and placement of the ileal conduit.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up every 2-4 months for 2 years.

 Biologic Mesh in Preventing Hernia in Patients With Bladder Cancer Undergoing Radical Cystectomy With Ileal Conduit Diversion@highlight

This randomized phase III trial studies how well biologic mesh works in preventing parastomal hernia in patients with bladder cancer who are undergoing radical cystectomy, or removal of the bladder, and ileal conduit diversion.

 An ileal conduit is a tube created from your small intestine that will be used as a tube for urine to flow out of your body.

 Parastomal hernia is a type of hernia that can occur in the stomach area where the ileal conduit is placed.

 Biologic mesh may help prevent parastomal hernia following surgery and ileal conduit diversion.
