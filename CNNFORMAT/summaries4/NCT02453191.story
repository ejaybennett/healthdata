(secondQuint)TVEC and Preop Radiation for Sarcoma.

 This is a single-arm open-label phase Ib and phase II clinical study assessing the safety and relative efficacy of concurrent talimogene laherparepvec in combination with radiotherapy in patients with soft tissue sarcomas.

 Patients will be treated with neoadjuvant radiation and weekly intratumoral injections of talimogene laherparepvec.

 Weekly injections of talimogene laherparepvec will be continued until surgery.

 Surgery will be performed 4-6 weeks from the end of radiation therapy to allow for resolution of acute toxicities per current standard of care.
