(firstQuint)Prospective Study to Determine Impact of Early Palliative Care Consult on Quality of Life (QOL), Cancer Related Symptoms In Advanced Lung Cancer Patients: Thoracic Pilot Project.

 Advanced lung cancer (ALC) will be assessed for participant outcomes in a sample which is prior initiation of palliative consultation and in a sample after the initiation of early palliative consultation.

 Study goals are: I.

 To determine the differences in participant outcomes including quality of life (QOL); symptom distress [Edmonton symptom assessment scale (ESAS)] and caregiver outcomes [Zarit Burden Interview {ZBI}, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale(HADS) and FAMCARE] at week 12 in advanced lung cancer (ALC) patients receiving early palliative care consultation versus those who don't.

 II.

 Identify the cellular, molecular, and immune basis for the development of symptoms in patients with ALC.
