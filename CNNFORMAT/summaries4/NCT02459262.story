 Part A: Subjects will receive 2 doses of the vaccine, GBS-NN, and will be followed for 12 weeks after the first dose of the vaccine.

 The following safety endpoints will be evaluated to support this objective: local and systemic reactogenicity; adverse events; laboratory tests; urinalysis; vital signs; 12-Lead ECG parameters; physical examination.

 In addition hereto, immunological parameters will be evaluated.

 Part B: Subjects will receive one or 2 doses of GBS-NN, and will be followed for 12 months after the first dose of the vaccine.
