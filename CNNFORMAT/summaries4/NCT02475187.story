(firstQuint)Observational Study of Thrombogenic Properties in 220 Patients With Proximal Femur Fracture.

 Patients with proximal femur fracture have high incidences of thrombotic events.

 By the two "bed-side" methods TEG (Thrombelastography) and MEA (Multiple Electrode Aggregometry), the thrombogenic properties of 220 patients with proximal femur fracture will be measured at time of hospital admission and 4 times over a period of 6 months postoperatively, and the patients will be followed in a total length of 2 years to register thrombotic events.
