(thirdQuint)Sham Controlled Study of Renal Denervation for Untreated Stage I and II Hypertension.

 The primary objective of this feasibility study is to assess the safety of renal denervation using externally focused therapeutic ultrasound with non-invasive targeting for patients with stage I and II hypertension who are not on any antihypertensive medications.

 The key secondary objective is to assess the effect of the therapy on changes from baseline in ambulatory systolic BP.
