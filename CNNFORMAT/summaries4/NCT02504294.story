(firstQuint)A Phase 3b Study of Erythropoietin Drugs Using a Specified Dosing Algorithm in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease on Hemodialysis.

 Primary Objective: To evaluate switching from Epogen to Epoetin Hospira for maintenance of hemoglobin levels in anemic chronic kidney disease (CKD) subjects on hemodialysis using a specified algorithm for the dosing of erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA).

 Secondary Objective: To evaluate switching from Epogen to Epoetin Hospira on the dosing of ESA in anemic CKD subjects on hemodialysis using a specified algorithm for the dosing of ESA.

 Exploratory Objectives: To generate hypotheses regarding maintenance of hemoglobin levels, dosing of ESA, intravenous (IV) iron dosing requirements, transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels and ferritin levels associated with the switch from Epogen to Epoetin Hospira in anemic CKD subjects on hemodialysis using specified algorithms for the dosing of ESA and for the dosing of IV iron, that are standard of care.
