(secondQuint)STOPBANG As A Screening Tool for Obstructive Sleep Apnoea in Pregnancy.

 Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a condition in which the muscles and soft tissues of the throat collapse during sleep, resulting in them stopping breathing for a short period.

 It affects around 4% of all pregnant women and is more common in obese people.

 Pregnant women with untreated OSA are more likely to have pregnancy complications and are more likely to need a caesarean section.

 Babies born to mothers with untreated OSA are more likely to need neonatal treatment.

 If OSA is diagnosed and treated then these risks are reduced.

 In non-pregnant patients presenting for surgery, an screening tool called STOPBANG has been proven to be effective in identifying patients with OSA.

 S: Do you Snore loudly? T: Do you often feel tired during daytime? O: Has anyone observed you stop breathing during your sleep? P: Do you have high blood pressure? B: Is your BMI >35 kg/m2? A: Are you >50 years old? N: Is your neck circumference >40cm? G: Is your gender male? The investigators aim to assess whether STOPBANG can be used to identify OSA in obese pregnant women.

 The aim is to recruit 100 pregnant women with a body mass index (BMI) 40 consented at Sunderland Royal Hospital's obstetric clinic in the second trimester of their pregnancy.

 They will have a STOPBANG score and Epworth score (questionnaire asking how likely they are to fall asleep during everyday tasks) calculated and then have overnight oximetry.

 This is a non-invasive test that measures their heart rate and oxygen level while they sleep.

 Upon returning the oximeter to hospital the patient's involvement in the study will be over.

 The oximetry results will be analysed to see if any participants have OSA.

 A statistician will analyse the results to determine if there is a relationship between STOPBANG score and likelihood of the pregnant women having OSA.

This study evaluates the use of the STOPBANG questionnaire to predict whether an obese pregnant woman has obstructive sleep apnoea.

 All participants will have a STOPBANG score calculated and then be tested with overnight oximetry to see if they have obstructive sleep apnoea.
