(secondQuint)VP-16, Ifosfamide, Dexamethasone, L-asparaginase Chemotherapy in Patients With Extranodal Natural Killer T Cell Lymphoma (VIDL+ASCT).

 Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is a rare and aggressive lymphoma subtype, but standard front-line therapy has not been established.

 The clinical outcome of patients (pts) with ENKTL after the treatment of conventional chemotherapy, especially pts with advanced stage, was generally poor.

 Therefore, high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as a consolidation could be one of promising strategies to improve the outcome of ENKTL.

 However, there have been few studies reporting the survival outcome or prognostic significances of front-line ASCT in pts with ENKTL.

 Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the outcome of patients with advanced-stage ENKTL who had undergone front-line ASCT.
