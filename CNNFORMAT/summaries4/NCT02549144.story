(secondQuint)Effects of a Large Increase in Dietary Fats and Cholesterol on HDL Composition and Function in Healthy Subjects.

 HDL particles can change their composition and function in response to a variety of pathological conditions and environmental stimuli.

 It has been previously shown that a western diet is able to drastically modify biochemical composition, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of HDL in animals.

 In humans little is known on the role of diet on HDL function and composition.

 Effects of a Large Increase in Dietary Fats and Cholesterol on HDL Composition and Function in Healthy Subjects@highlight

In this study the investigators aimed at measuring the effect of a two-week high-fat/high-cholesterol (HFHC) normocaloric diet on HDL particles biochemical composition and HDL function compared to a two-week low-fat/low-cholesterol (LFLC) normocaloric diet.
