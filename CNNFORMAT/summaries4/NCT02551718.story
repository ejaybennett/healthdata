(fifthQuint)High Throughput Drug Sensitivity Assay and Genomics- Guided Treatment of Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To test patient cells in a high throughput assay against individual drugs and drug combinations within 21 days to enable optimal choice of drug combinations for therapy.

 II.

 To test gene expression that reveals activation of druggable pathways or mutations in genes that confer susceptibility to specific agents may also be considered in choice of treatment.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the response to the chosen therapy.

 OUTLINE: Leukemia cells obtained from blood or bone marrow are analyzed for sensitivity to both individual drugs and drug combinations via high throughput chemotherapy sensitivity assay and next generation sequencing assays.

 Doctors will then recommend chemotherapy regimens based on the results.

 After completion of the chemotherapy regimen, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks for response, and then every 3 months for 2 years for duration of response and survival.

 High Throughput Drug Sensitivity Assay and Genomics- Guided Treatment of Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies the feasibility of choosing treatment based on a high throughput ex vivo drug sensitivity assay in combination with mutation analysis for patients with acute leukemia that has returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment.

 A high throughput screening assay tests many different drugs individually or in combination that kill leukemia cells in tiny chambers at the same time.

 High throughput drug sensitivity assay and mutation analysis may help guide the choice most effective for an individual's acute leukemia.
