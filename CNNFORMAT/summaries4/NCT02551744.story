(firstQuint)Proton Pump Inhibitor Versus Histamine-2 Receptor Antagonist for the Prevention of Recurrent Peptic Ulcers.

 The aims of the randomized double-blind comparison study are to compare the efficacy of Proton Pump Inhibitor and H2 receptor antagonist for the prevention of recurrent peptic ulcers in thienopyridine users.

 We plan to enroll 334 thienopyridine (clopidogrel or ticlopidine) users without baseline gastroduodenal ulcer at initial endoscopy.

 The patients will be randomly assigned to receive either (1) pantoprazole (40 mg qd) or (2) famotidine (40 mg qd) for 6 months.

The ulcer recurrence rate between the treatment groups will be compared.
