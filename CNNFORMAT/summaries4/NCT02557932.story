(firstQuint)Comparison of 7-day PPI-based Standard Triple Therapy and 10-day Bismuth Quadruple Therapy for H.

 Pylori Eradication.

 Current Helicobacter pylori management guidelines recommend proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-Clarithromycin containing triple therapy as 1st line treatment.

 However, in Korea, eradication rates of PPI-Clarithromycin containing triple therapy have been decreased to less than 80% due to increased clarithromycin resistance.

 In areas of high clarithromycin resistance (resistance rate more than 15%), guidelines recommend bismuth quadruple therapy as a 1st line treatment for H.

 pylori eradication.

 Clarithromycin resistance rates reported from 15.

7% to 42.

1% in Korea, thus, bismuth quadruple therapy may be better 1st line treatment than PPI-Clarithromycin containing triple therapy.

 However, only one limited study was performed to compare effects of the both treatment regimens in Korea.

 Thus, studies evaluating the effect of 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy as the first line treatment for H.

 pylori infection.

 Pylori Eradication@highlight

In this randomized controlled trial, we investigate the effect of 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy in comparison with that of 7-day PPI-based standard triple as 1st line treatment for H.

 pylori.
