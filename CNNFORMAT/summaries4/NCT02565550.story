(firstQuint)Is Microbiota Community Associated With Clinical Response to a Low FODMAP Diet in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

 We seek to determine whether a low FODMAPs diet decreases symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)patients and to identify potential microbial factors related to diet efficacy.

 Pain symptoms, stooling characteristics, breath hydrogen, stool microbiome will be collected and/or documented in IBS patients at baseline and during one week of an low FODMAPs intervention.
