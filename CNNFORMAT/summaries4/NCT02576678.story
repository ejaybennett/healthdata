(fifthQuint)A Study of Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Apremilast (CC-10004) in Pediatric Subjects With Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis.

 Each subject will undergo a screening period of up to 5 weeks, a treatment period of 2 weeks with PK sample collection, and an extension treatment period of 48 weeks, to allow subjects access to apremilast treatment if medically appropriate (following the completion of the 2 week PK portion).

 Regardless of when they stop treatment, subjects should complete two post treatment follow-up visits at approximately 4 and 8 weeks after the last dose.

 All subjects should complete the final follow-up visit at Week 102 or at a timepoint 52 weeks after the last dose of apremilast was taken in subjects who have withdrawn at any time prior to Week 50.

 At least 32 subjects will be enrolled into this study to provide an adequate PK profile and safety assessment in subjects of different ages and body weight ranges.

 Subjects will be divided into 2 age groups (adolescents [ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive] and children [ages 6 to 11 years, inclusive]), with at least 16 subjects in each group.

 Apremilast treatment will start in older and heavier subjects.

 Group 1 (ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive; weight 35 kg) - The data collected from the first 8 subjects will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (DMC) to determine if it is appropriate to proceed with dosing the balance of Group 1 subjects and to proceed with dosing in the Group 2 subjects.

 and an evaluation of these data by the DMC has been completed.

 Group 2 (ages 6 to 11 years, inclusive; weight 15 kg) - The dose regimens (dose strength and/or dose frequency) for these first 8 subjects will be based upon the PK and safety assessments from the first 8 subjects in Group 1.

 - For the remaining subjects in Group 2, the dose (dose strength and/or dose frequency) will be based upon the subject weight as determined by the PK and safety assessments.

 The dose strength and/or dose frequency will be adjusted for any safety concerns or for unexpected changes in exposure.

 In the event of a dose regimen adjustment after the second PK and safety assessment, the first 8 subjects in Group 2 will return to the site for the appropriate dosing adjustment.

 A Study of Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Apremilast (CC-10004) in Pediatric Subjects With Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis@highlight

This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis aged 6 to 17 years, inclusive, intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of apremilast with 2 weeks of oral apremilast treatment followed by a 48-week extension of apremilast treatment.

 Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is defined as Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 12, Body Surface Area (BSA) 10%, and static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of 3.

 The total study duration for each subject will last for up to a total of 107 weeks which includes screening, treatment (including the PK portion of the study and the extension treatment period), two short-term follow-up periods and a long-term follow-up period.
