(firstQuint)Managing Neovascular (Known as "Wet") Age-related Macular Degeneration Over 2 Years Using Different Treatment Schedules of 2 mg Intravitreal Aflibercept Injected in the Eye.

 The T&E dosing regimen for nAMD has emerged as a preferred regimen for many treating physicians aiming at maximizing outcomes by proactively treating the subject at each visit and by extending the treatment interval (if extension criteria are met), thus limiting visits, monitoring, and injections.

 To this day, there is limited evidence available addressing the question of what are useful intervals for treating and monitoring, how do they differ among subjects, and how are retreatment criteria applied to achieve long-term desirable outcomes in real-life practice.

 This study is designed to evaluate the optimal use, efficacy, and safety of the T&E regimen with intravitreal aflibercept in subjects with nAMD.
