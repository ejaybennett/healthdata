 The objective was to assess the acceptability and safety of neonatal male circumcision performed by clinical officers (equivalent to US physician assistants) and nurse midwives, using the Mogen clamp.

 This was a randomized, blinded trial of circumcision using the Mogen clamp under topical anesthesia in healthy male infants aged 1-28 days, with normal birth weight and gestational age, performed by trained clinical officers or nurse midwives, randomized 1:1 in Rakai District, Uganda.

 Mothers of male infants born in 4 health centers were invited to participate and signed an informed consent for screening and enrollment.

 Infants were screened on enrollment prior to randomization (1;1) to clinical officer and nurse midwife circumcision providers.

 Follow up was via a phone call at 24 hours, 7 days and 4 weeks post-circumcision.

 Enhanced Provision of Male Circumcision (MC) for HIV Prevention, Rakai, Uganda@highlight

Background: Medical male circumcision (MMC) for HIV prevention is a priority in 14 East and Southern African countries, and the long-term sustainability of MMC programs could best be achieved by early infant male circumcision (EIMC.

) However, the acceptability and safety of EIMC provided by non-physicians is unknown.

 Methods: We conducted a trial of EIMC using the Mogen clamp provided by newly trained clinical officers (CO) and nurse midwives (NMWs) in 4 health centers in rural Rakai, Uganda.

 501 healthy neonates aged 1-28 days with normal birth weight and gestational age were randomized to CO (n=256) and NMWs (n=245), and were followed up at 24 hours, 7 and 28 days.

 Combined analgesia was provided by paracetamol suppository, Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) cream and a 24% sucrose solution.
