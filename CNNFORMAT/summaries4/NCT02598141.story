(thirdQuint)Grinding Versus Standard Methods for the Treatment of Per-operative Bacteriological Samples Associated With Osteo-articular Sepsis.

 The secondary objectives of this study are to: A.

 Compare the two techniques in terms of bacterial species identified.

 B.

 Compare the diagnostic capabilities (sensitivity and specificity) of the two sample processing techniques depending on the type of analyzed samples (soft tissue, bone tissue) (subgroup analysis).

 C.

 Compare the diagnostic capabilities (sensitivity and specificity) of the two sample processing techniques depending on the type of joint (subgroup analysis).

 D.

 Compare the diagnostic capabilities (sensitivity and specificity) of the two sample processing techniques depending on the type of implanted materials (prosthesis versus other equipment) (subgroup analysis).

 E.

 Develop a culture collection of bacteria isolated from infection osteo-articular protheses.

 Grinding Versus Standard Methods for the Treatment of Per-operative Bacteriological Samples Associated With Osteo-articular Sepsis@highlight

The main objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic capability (sensitivity and specificity) of standard bacteriological analysis made from one or other of the two sampling processing techniques and perioperative management of samples : the Ultra Turrax method that uses grinding versus the standard method.
