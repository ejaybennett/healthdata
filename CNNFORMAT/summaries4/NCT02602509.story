(thirdQuint)Evaluating Celecoxib Activity in Mycobacterium Tuberculosis: A Whole Blood Bactericidal Activity Study in Healthy Volunteers.

 The whole blood bactericidal activity (WBA) assay is an ex vivo model for measuring the combined effects of administered drugs, host factors and strain factors on mycobacterial sterilisation.

 If performed in parallel with PK measurements, the method can be used to evaluate the effect of drugs throughout the dosing cycle.

 Celecoxib is a COX-2 inhibitor with immuno-modulatory properties important in the host defence against tuberculosis (TB).

 The aim of this trial is to investigate the effect on WBA of manipulation of the host response to TB using celecoxib, in combination with established TB drugs.

 Evaluating Celecoxib Activity in Mycobacterium Tuberculosis: A Whole Blood Bactericidal Activity Study in Healthy Volunteers@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis of celecoxib in combination with established drugs used to treat tuberculosis (TB).

 Pharmacokinetics (PK) and whole blood bactericidal activity (WBA) will be measured in healthy volunteers following administration of the study drugs alone and in combination.
