 This study is a multi-center, uncontrolled, open-label, non-interventional post-marketing safety surveillance study to describe the use of Obizur in patients with acquired hemophilia A (AHA), and secondarily, where data are available, to describe the hemostatic effectiveness and immunogenicity of Obizur.

 Patients should be enrolled at the earliest possible time point after initiating Obizur.

 In an attempt to collect safety and utilization data on patients treated with Obizur since Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in October 2014, Baxalta will make an effort to identify all persons treated with Obizur and to collect data for as many patients as possible.
