(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Spinal Mobility Reeducation in Patients Treated for a Lumbar Spinal Stenosis After Epidural Infiltration.

 The standard treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis is the lumbar canal recalibration surgery which presents co-morbidity factors and risks of post-operative complications.

 The non-invasive methods are a good alternative compared with the surgery : the patients medically treated present few damages and the results of the postponed surgery are equivalent to the immediate surgery.

 That is why a non-surgical treatment is proposed in first intention to the patients with mild or moderate symptoms : this treatment associates an epidural infiltration and a kyphosis reeducation.

 Yet the kyphosis reeducation did not show a real profit in the time compared with the natural evolution of the pathology.

 The benefits of the infiltration are lost three months after this one in 80 % of the cases.

 A return to physical activity and a restored spinal mobility would improve the duration of the infiltration effect.

 The objective is then to compare the efficiency of a spinal mobility reeducation program versus a kyphosis reeducation program in patients with acquired and central lumbar spinal stenosis.

 It is a prospective, monocentric, randomized, superiority and parallel-group study : - group C (control group) : kyphosis reeducation + patient education + auto-reeducation at home, - group M (test group) : spinal mobility reeducation + patient education + auto-reeducation at home.

 Evaluation of Spinal Mobility Reeducation in Patients Treated for a Lumbar Spinal Stenosis After Epidural Infiltration@highlight

In actual practice the patients with mild or moderate lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms receive an epidural infiltration and participate in kyphosis reeducation in first intention.

 Yet the kyphosis reeducation did not show a real profit in the time compared with the natural evolution of the pathology.

 The study assume that the spinal mobility reeducation will reduce the incidence of pain recurrences compared with the classic kyphosis reeducation.
