(firstQuint)Smoking-cessation: A Spanish-Language Clinical Trial.

 Study Aim 1: To transcreate the existing English-language 10 "Stop Smoking for Good" booklets and accompanying 9 supportive "My Story" pamphlets into a series of culturally relevant and acceptable materials for Spanish-speaking smokers who prefer to receive health information in Spanish.

 The adaptation of the intervention materials will be based upon the findings from a systematic formative evaluation employing a heterogeneous group of Hispanic/Latino smokers representing diverse subcultural groups.

 Study Aim 2: To test the efficacy of the self-help intervention developed in Study I among Spanish-speaking smokers in a randomized controlled trial.

 Participants (500) will be randomized to receive the Spanish-language version of the Stop Smoking for Good (SS-SP) intervention or usual care (UC) comprising an existing booklet from NCI.

 Investigators hypothesize SS-SP will produce higher abstinence rates than UC through 24 months.

 Secondary Aim: Test moderator variables to improve targeting the intervention.

 Moderator analyses will be exploratory, without strong a priori hypotheses.
