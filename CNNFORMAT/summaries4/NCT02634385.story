(fifthQuint)Zero Ischemia Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy.

 The potential utility of a zero ischemia, laparoscopic, partial nephrectomy portends significant implications for both the surgeon and patient.

 Firstly, the technical difficulty of a partial nephrectomy will be reduced to a more achievable level owing mainly to the removal of a time limit on surgical resection.

 With the blood flow halted to downstream tissue containing the renal neoplasm from preoperative embolization, resection can be made to the tumor without clamping of the main renal arteries.

 This minimizes the ischemic time to non-neoplastic renal tissue, allowing for a renal protective effect.

 Without the need for clamping, the overall surgical operative time is drastically reduced.

 With excision made at the ischemic tissue, intra-operative bleeding and ease can be achieved.

 More surgeons can ultimately attempt at LPN by removing the single most limiting surgical factor, warm ischemic time.

 Zero Ischemia Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy@highlight

Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) is often reserved for patients with a small peripheral tumour, in the hands of an experienced surgeon since it demands a high degree of endoscopic skill.

 Renal vessel clamp for vascular control is a required step during standard LPN.

 However, this creates a time limiting step for the surgeon and induces renal injury via warm ischemia and reperfusion injury.

 This novel approach can substantially reduce renal injury during LPN via superselective embolization of level II renal arteries pre-operatively.

 This technique facilitates the performance of a clamp-less, zero-ischemia LPN, significantly simplifying the procedure by remove time thresholds within which to perform tumor excision.

 The preliminary results are promising; however, there is a need for further corroboration of their results, in addition to a randomized controlled trial comparing this modified, zero ischemia technique with standard LPN.
