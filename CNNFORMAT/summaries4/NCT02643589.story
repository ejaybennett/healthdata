(thirdQuint)Dose Study of Antithymocyteglobulin in Haploidentical Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation.

 Graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD) remains a major cause of morbility and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with grafts from an HLA-mismatched family donor.

 Antithymocyteglobulin (ATG) has been widely used to prevent acute GVHD (aGVHD) in haploidentical HSCT.

 Notwithstanding, immunosuppressive effect of ATG, which may also increase the risk of opportunistic infections, necessitates the use of the lowest possible dose.

 Till now, the optimal dose of ATG is not known.

 Here, the investigators compared the outcome of patients receiving haploidentical HSCT treated with two different doses of ATG.

 Dose Study of Antithymocyteglobulin in Haploidentical Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the incidences of GVHD in haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients receiving different dose of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) for acute graft-versus-host disease(aGVHD) prophylaxis.

 The investigators' first objective was to investigate the optimal dose of ATG for aGVHD.
