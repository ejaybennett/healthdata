(firstQuint)Quantitative Rise in Intraocular Pressure in Steep Trendelenburg Position.

 Patient undergoing robotic surgeries requires steep trendelenburg position (upto 60 degrees) along with pneumoperitoneum.

 These both can cause a significant rise in intraocular pressure.

 Significant rise of pressure for prolonged period can cause post operative visual disturbances, which can be of medicolegal importance.

 Thus studying the quantitative rise and thus trend of intraocular pressure is first step in managing ophthalmic changes during robotic surgeries.
