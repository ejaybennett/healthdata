(firstQuint)Study of the Effects of Intravenous Exenatide on Cardiac Repolarization.

 This single-center Phase I study will consist of 2 parts, a Pilot Part and a Core Part.

 The Pilot Part of the study will be an open-label, non-randomized, single-treatment design in 10 healthy male and female subjects to determine if an infusion regimen of a 6-h continuous IV infusion of exenatide will lead to a mean plasma steady state concentration of 500 pg/mL.

 The Core part of the study will be a double-blind (except for the use of open label active control moxifloxacin), randomized, placebo-controlled,3 period, 6-sequence, cross-over design in 72 healthy male and female subjects to evaluate whether exenatide at therapeutic and supra-therapeutic concentrations has a pharmacological effect on cardiac repolarization (threshold value >10 msec).
