(fifthQuint)Community-led Responses for Elimination: Controlled Trial of Reactive Case Detection Versus Reactive Drug Administration.

 The study is a cluster randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the impact of RFDA intervention against current standard of care for the impact on seropositivity in children under five years, passive surveillance for confirmed malaria case incidence, and elimination of transmission from hotspots.

 It will be conducted among a background population of ~130,000 people in ~30,000 households in 16 health center catchment areas across several districts in Southern Province.

 The government of Zambia is pursuing malaria elimination as a national goal on an accelerated timeline and this trial will help evaluate two treatment-based strategies for supporting malaria elimination.

 The secondary objectives of the study include: 1).

 Compare the effectiveness of RFDA using DHAP with RFTAT using AL in reducing rapid diagnostic test (RDT) confirmed malaria incidence through passive case detection at health facilities; 2).

 Compare the effectiveness of RFDA using DHAP with RFTAT using AL in reducing the prevalence of malaria and preventing re-infection in individuals receiving reactive responses; 3).

 Compare the cost-effectiveness of RFDA using DHAP with RFTAT using AL in reducing the burden of malaria in the community; 4).

 Measure the proportion of P.

 falciparum infections likely attributable to importation and local transmission using parasite genotyping as well as defining genotype spatial distribution; 5).

 Assess the utility of using serology to measure short term changes in malaria transmission and evaluate malaria elimination programs; and 6).

 Assess the feasibility of using remotely sensed malaria risk maps to identify areas with higher potential for local malaria transmission.

 Community-led Responses for Elimination: Controlled Trial of Reactive Case Detection Versus Reactive Drug Administration@highlight

This study is designed to compare the effectiveness of reactive focal drug administration (RFDA) using dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine (DHAP) versus reactive focal test and treat (RFTAT) using artemether+lumefantrine (AL) as a routine process for identifying and eliminating malaria transmission as measured through achieving zero seropositivity in children under five in Southern Province, Zambia.

 These two strategies are potential candidates for expanded malaria operational surveillance and elimination for low malaria transmission areas.
