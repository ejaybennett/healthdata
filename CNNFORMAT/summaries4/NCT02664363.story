(fifthQuint)EGFRvIII CAR T Cells for Newly-Diagnosed WHO Grade IV Malignant Glioma.

 Following consent, subjects will be enrolled onto dose-escalation cohorts.

 Patients will undergo leukapheresis to harvest Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) for the generation of EGFRvIII CAR T cells prior to beginning RT and concurrent TMZ.

 T cells will be isolated from the patient's PBMCs and transduced to express the CRA.

 Briefly, PBMC will be stimulated with Muromonab-cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) (OKT3), an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and transduced on RetroNectin(R) coated plates.

 Transduced cells will be expanded in interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 14 days.

 Patients will then complete standard of care RT and concurrent TMZ.

 Patients who remain eligible after standard of care radiation and TMZ will receive up to 3 cycles of TMZ at 50-100 mg/m^2/day for 21 days of 28 day cycles, which is the standard dose-intensified (DI) TMZ regimen.

 If the CAR-specific T cells do not meet release criteria, the patient will be withdrawn before CAR treatment and replaced.

 At least 48 hours after the last dose of DI TMZ, the total dose of EGFRvIII CAR T cells will be delivered intravenously.

 If sufficient CAR-specific T cells cannot be generated to meet the targeted assigned dose within the dose-escalation portion of the study, the patient will be treated at a lower pre-defined dose level using available CAR-specific T cells and replaced in the assigned higher dose.

 The administered dose will be the highest defined dose level for which there are sufficient CAR-specific T cells available.

 Within the expanded cohort, if sufficient CAR-specific T cells can't be generated to meet the MTD dose, all available T cells will be administered.

 Following the infusion of EGFRvIII CARs, blood samples for immune monitoring will be drawn 1, 5, and 10 days after the infusion, then 1, 3, and 6 months, then yearly until progression (or death or lost to contact).

 The return visits for immune monitoring at 3 months, 6 months, and yearly will coincide with standard of care clinic visits.

 Blood will also be taken for Replication Competent Retrovirus (RCR) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at 3, 6 and 12 months during standard of care clinic visits.

 Lastly, blood for evaluation of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) will be drawn prior to cell infusion, 1 and 4 hours after infusion, and on days 1, 2, 5, 10, and at one month.

 Measurements for CRS include IL-2, IL-6, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF), interferon (IFN) gamma, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and C-reactive protein (CRP).

 Patients will return to clinic one month following the EGFRvIII CAR T cell infusion to be evaluated for cycles of standard of care 5-day TMZ at 150-200 mg/m^2/day for the first 5-day cycle, followed by 200 mg/m^2/day for 5-days every 28 days per the treating oncologist.

 This will result in a >30 day delay between the last cycle of DI TMZ and the first cycle of 5-day TMZ.

 Tumor progression will be documented histologically, unless there are clinical contraindications, to exclude inflammatory responses presenting as radiographic or clinical changes, which could indicate a potentially toxic or therapeutic responses and not tumor progression.

 If tissue is obtained through Tissue Bank Consent Institutional Review Board (IRB) # 2635, it will be used to confirm tumor progression histologically, and to assess immunologic cell infiltration and EGFRvIII antigen escape at the tumor site.

 Patients will be eligible for additional adjuvant therapy at the time of tumor progression.

 A classical "3+3" study design will be used to estimate the MTD for CAR-specific T cells treatment among patients with newly-diagnosed GBM.

 Four dose levels will be considered: #1: 4.

5 x 10^6/kg, #2: 1.

5 x 10^7/kg, #3: 4.

5 x 10^7/kg, and #4: 1.

5 x 10^8/kg.

 Starting with the lowest dose level, cohorts of 3-6 subjects will be accrued at each dose level.

 If a patient is lost to follow-up during the first 4 weeks after CAR treatment without experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), then the patient will not be evaluable for the determination of DLT and will be replaced.

 The MTD is the highest dose level at which 1 of 6 patients experiences DLT during the 4 week observation period after CAR treatment.

 An expanded cohort of 12 patients will be enrolled at the MTD of EGFRvIII CAR T cells in order to obtain a more precise estimate of the probability of unacceptable toxicity.

 This cohort will also have the cells radiolabeled with 111In to track their distribution.

 Briefly, CARs will be counted and re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).

 4-6x10^8 cells will be labeled with a total of 500 microCi of 111In.

 The cells will be washed and mixed with cold CARs to achieve the desired cell dose.

 The labeled CARs will be infused into the patient through an intravenous catheter within the Ambulatory Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Unit.

 Distribution of 111In-labeled EGFRvIII CARs will be evaluated at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion using scintigraphy.

 EGFRvIII CAR T Cells for Newly-Diagnosed WHO Grade IV Malignant Glioma@highlight

Newly diagnosed WHO grade IV malignant glioma subjects who are eligible will be enrolled following surgery to remove the brain tumor.

 They will then undergo a leukapheresis to harvest cells for the generation of the study drug, Epidermal Growth Factor variant III Chimeric Antigen Receptor (EGFRvIII CAR) T cells prior to beginning standard of care (SOC) radiation therapy (RT) with temozolomide (TMZ).

 Once SOC RT with TMZ is completed, subjects will return for the post-RT brain imaging assessment, and if stable will start post-RT TMZ cycles.

 Patients will receive up to 3 cycles of dose intensified TMZ prior to receiving the EGFRvIII CAR T cells, which will be infused in dose escalation cohorts.

 Following a one month delay between cycles, the subject will resume post-RT cycles of TMZ and be monitored with blood work and brain imaging as per SOC.

 Once the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) is reached in the dose escalation cohorts, an expanded cohort of 12 subjects will be enrolled to obtain a more precise estimate of the probability of unacceptable toxicity and to track the EGFRvIII CAR T cells using 111 Indium (111In) labeling.

 Computed Tomography (CT) will be done on days 1, 2, and 3 post-infusion to determine intracerebral (IC) localization.
