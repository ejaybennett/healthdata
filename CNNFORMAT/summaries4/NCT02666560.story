(secondQuint)Does Increasing Auditory Cueing Affect Gait Parameters in Children With Cerebral Palsy During a Functional Task?.

 Introduction: Cerebral Palsy is a non progressive disorder occurring in early brain development, resulting in inefficient ambulatory pattern.

 The use of sensory cues to facilitate loco-motor activity has been suggested as providing the necessary trigger to synchronise movement with greater beneficial outcomes observed at higher frequency intensities within the adult population.

 Thus auditory cueing could have the potential to alter gait parameters during a functional task.

 Aim: To explore if increasing auditory cueing frequency (AC20) affects gait during a functional task compared to auditory cueing at self-paced cadence (ACSC).

 Method: Nineteen children with CP levels 1 and 2 on the Gross Motor Function Classification Scale participated using paired analysis.

 Outcomes were compared to the mean values for temporal spatial gait data within the conditions using a cross over design.

 TS data was obtained by using the GAITRite(R) walkway system whilst walking holding a cup.

 Does Increasing Auditory Cueing Affect Gait Parameters in Children With Cerebral Palsy During a Functional Task?@highlight

To determine the clinical efficacy of auditory cueing using a cross over design to investigate whether increasing auditory cueing frequency by 20% above self paced cadence affects gait parameters in children with Cerebral Palsy when performing a functional task.
