(fifthQuint)Family Matters Intervention: A Three-Arm Superiority RCT.

 The proposed study is an 18-month, individual randomized controlled superiority trial (RCT).

 The main aim of the study is to decrease childhood obesity in children ages 5-7 years old by increasing family meal quality (i.

e.

, dietary intake, emotional atmosphere) and quantity (i.

e.

, frequency of family meals) via innovative technology (i.

e.

, ecological momentary intervention (EMI), video feedback).

 The RCT is a three-arm superiority trial including the following three arms: (1) Education (Edu)+EMI; (2) Edu+EMI+Video feedback; and (3) Attention Control.

 Delivery of the intervention will last 12 months for each family, which includes a 12-week maintenance phase.

 All three arms will receive primary care visits with 5-2-1-0 obesity prevention messages.

 The two experimental arms will additionally receive twelve in-home training visits focused on family meal quality and quantity and then will receive either EMI family meal tips via smartphones, or EMI family meal tips with video feedback.

 The attention control group will receive messages on general child health delivered in a similar manner and frequency as the experimental arms.

 After families have completed nine months of the study, a maintenance phase will ensue for three months.

 Having a maintenance phase is evidence-based and will provide incrementally less support to families to allow for self-efficacy to increase and sustainability of new behaviors to occur.

 For study arms 1 and 2, EMI meal tips will be reduced to only the days in which parents report their highest stress levels.

 For participants in study arm 2, video feedback will be reduced to once per month.

 The attention control arm maintenance phase will include reductions in text messages and video-recorded tips at a similar frequency as arms 1 and 2.

 The study will last 18 months, with four assessment time points including, baseline, 9 months, 12 months (i.

e.

, post-intervention), and 18 months (i.

e.

, 6-month post-intervention).

 The eligible child and multiple family members (i.

e.

, parent/primary caregiver, siblings) from low-income and diverse households (i.

e.

, African American, Hispanic, Native American, White)--who are at greatest risk for obesity--will be recruited for the study.

 Additionally, partnerships with existing community-based healthcare systems will be utilized to reach participants in community settings where they have existing relationships and resources.

 This study utilizes innovative and research-informed intervention components (i.

e.

, in-home visiting, EMI, video-feedback) to increase the likelihood of intervention effectiveness and sustainability.

 The "Family Matters Intervention" study will be carried out across two Phases, an R61 Phase and an R33 Phase.

 Main aims for each Phase are described below: Specific Aims for the R61 Phase: Aim 1: Organize and prepare the study team, project materials, study protocols and procedures.

 Success of Aim 1 will be measured by meeting established R61 Planning Phase transition milestones.

 Aim 2: Test recruitment, evaluation, and intervention protocols in the first 24 (2 per race/ethnicity and study arm) eligible participants.

 Aim 2 success will be achieved by meeting transition milestones related to screening, enrollment, assessment, intervention delivery, and retention.

 Specific Aims for the R33 Phase: Aim 1: Conduct a three-arm RCT comparing Education (Edu)+EMI, Education+EMI+video feedback, and attention control arms in children ages 5-7 years old and their families to test the hypotheses that: Hypothesis 1: Family meal quality and quantity will increase in households with children in the Edu+EMI+ video feedback arm compared to children in the Edu+EMI or attention control arms.

 Hypothesis 2: Diet quality will increase and BMI z-score/BMI percentile will decrease in children in the Edu+EMI+video feedback arm compared to children in the Edu+EMI and attention control arms; family meal quality and quantity will mediate this association.

 Aim 2: Examine intervention effects on parent and sibling weight and weight-related behaviors.

 Hypothesis 1: Restriction and pressure-to-eat feeding practices will decrease and coping skills will increase in parents in the Edu+EMI+video feedback arm compared to the Edu+EMI and attention control arms.

 Hypothesis 2: BMI z-score/BMI percentile will decrease in siblings in the EMI+video feedback arm compared to Edu+EMI and attention control arms.
