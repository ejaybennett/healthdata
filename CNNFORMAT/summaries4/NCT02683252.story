(firstQuint)Musculoskeletal Non-tumoral Pathology Quantitative Perfusion.

 Patients referred for the MR imaging evaluation of non-tumoral musculoskeletal pathology (osteonecrosis, pseudarthrosis and compartment syndrome) will have their MR protocols complemented by a contrast enhanced perfusion study.

 In this patients standard clinical evaluation is already performed with contrast medium injection (Gadolinium) and no additional injection is required.

 After post processing multiple quantitative perfusions parameters will be extracted (e.

g.

 plasmatic volume, transfer constant, backflow constant, extra-cellular extra vascular space volume).

 The variation of these parameters in patients with and without the previously described conditions will be compared.
