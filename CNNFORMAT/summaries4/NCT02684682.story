(secondQuint)Frequency of Self-performed Mechanical Control of Plaque.

 Thirty nine subjects with at most 5% of the sites for GI= 2 (gingival health) will be randomized into three groups with different frequencies in self-mechanical control of plaque: Group 12 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours.

 The exams of plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level and gingival crevicular fluid will be performed at baseline, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days.

 Frequency of Self-performed Mechanical Control of Plaque@highlight

The purpose of this blind randomized clinical trial is to evaluate different frequencies in self-mechanical control of plaque in individuals with historic of periodontitis and in periodic and preventive maintenance in order to assess which frequencies are compatible with maintaining gingival health.
