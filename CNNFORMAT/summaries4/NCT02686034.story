(secondQuint)RCT of Non-Invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) With gammaCore, for the Acute Treatment of Migraine Attacks.

 Period 1: 4-week observational run-in period; no stimulation treatment.

 Subjects use standard of care (SoC) medication to treat their migraine attacks, according to their individual prescriptions.

 Period 2: 4-week randomized/controlled period.

 After the run-in period, subjects are randomized (1:1) to receive either an nVNS device or a sham device to treat up to 5 migraine attacks.

 Period 3: 4-week open-label (active treatment) period.

 After the randomized period, subjects continue to the open-label period where all subjects receive an active gammaCore device to treat up to 5 migraine attacks.
