(secondQuint)Dose-finding, Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of VABOMERE (Meropenem-Vaborbactam) in Pediatric Subjects With Serious Bacterial Infections.

 In the current era of increased resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenem antimicrobial agents are frequently the antibiotics of "last defense" for the most resistant pathogens in serious infections, including those found in complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI).

 The recent dissemination of serine carbapenemases (e.

g.

 KPC) in Enterobacteriaceae in many hospitals worldwide now poses a considerable threat to the carbapenems and other members of the beta-lactam class of antimicrobial agents.

 Rempex developed meropenem-vaborbactam administered as a fixed combination by IV infusion, to treat serious Gram-negative infections, such as cUTIs, including those infections caused by bacteria resistant to currently available carbapenems.

 This study is an open label, dose-finding, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability study of a single dose infusion of meropenem-vaborbactam in pediatric subjects from birth to less than 18 years of age with serious bacterial infections.
