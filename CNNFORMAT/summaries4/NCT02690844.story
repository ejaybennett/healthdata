(thirdQuint)Effectiveness of Mucolox and Clonazepam in Treatment of Burning Mouth Syndrome.

 Question: What affect does the use of a mucoadhesive drug delivery system (Mucolox(R)) compounded with clonazepam have in the treatment of burning mouth syndrome? There are no clinical trials reported in the literature that evaluate the use of a mucoadhesive vehicle to deliver clonazepam into the oral cavity and treat burning mouth syndrome.

 The use of a mucoadhesive may help to increase surface contact and elicit a greater reduction in symptoms.

 Study Design: Randomized, single-blind study to be performed with 3 groups (seen below in treatment arms).

 Randomization will be performed by computer generated randomization to randomly allocate patients.

 The patients are not aware of the random group allocation.

 The study will involve assessment at three phases, once at initial examination (baseline), once at two weeks into treatment, and a final assessment at four weeks.

 Treatment Arms: 1.

 Clonazepam (Klonopin(R)) treatment arm - 1 mg clonazepam (Klonopin(R) tablet) TID, dissolved in mouth for 3 minutes then expectorated 2.

 Mucolox(R) only - 5mL Mucolox(R) TID, swished around mouth for 3 minutes then expectorated.

 3.

 Mucolox(R) and clonazepam - 1mg Clonazepam/5mL Mucolox(R) TID, swished around mouth for 3 minutes then expectorated.

 Participants - Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Study is open to men and woman.

 Only will accept patients over the age of 18.

 Prior to inclusions, patients will have to have candida infection ruled out.

 Laboratory examination will be performed and serum levels of iron, ferritin, folate, vitamin B12 and glucose will be measured.

 Any abnormalities in these levels will lead to exclusion.

 If the patient is using an antidepressant or anxiolytic, they must have been on it for at least 6 months with no change in dosage.

 Resting salivary flow rates will be measured to rule out patients with hyposalivation ( cent Used to assess degree of interference that burning mouth symptoms have with day-to-day activities and quality of life Medication Dosing 3 different treatment arms will be utilized.

 1.

 Clonazepam (Klonopin(R)) treatment arm - 1 mg clonazepam (Klonopin(R) tablet) TID, dissolved in mouth for 3 minutes then expectorated 2.

 Mucolox(R) only - 5mL Mucolox(R) TID, swished around mouth for 3 minutes then expectorated.

 3.

 Mucolox(R) and clonazepam - 1mg Clonazepam/5mL Mucolox(R) TID, swished around mouth for 3 minutes then expectorated.

 All treatment arms will utilize medication TID (morning, midday and night).

 Maximum dose of 3 mg clonazepam will be used topically per day.

 Patients are told to expectorate their medication after swishing it around their mouth for 3 minutes to minimize the amount of systemic absorption of clonazepam.

 Patients will be followed for any potential side-effects.
