(thirdQuint)Rate of Atrial Fibrillation Through 12 Months in Patients With Recent Ischemic Stroke of Presumed Known Origin.

 Stroke AF is a prospective, multi-site, randomized, controlled, non-blinded, post-market study.

 The Stroke AF study will compare the incidence rate of atrial fibrillation through 12 months between the continuous monitoring arm and the control arm in subjects with a recent ischemic stroke of presumed known origin.

 Subjects randomized to the continuous monitoring arm will have a Reveal LINQ Insertable Cardiac Monitor inserted within 10 days of the qualifying stroke and undergo continuous remote monitoring.

 Subjects randomized to the control arm will be followed per site specific standard of care.

 Rate of Atrial Fibrillation Through 12 Months in Patients With Recent Ischemic Stroke of Presumed Known Origin@highlight

The purpose of the Stroke AF study is to compare the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) through 12 months between continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring with the Reveal LINQ cent Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) (continuous monitoring arm) and standard of care (SoC) medical treatment (control arm) in subjects with a recent ischemic stroke of presumed known origin.
