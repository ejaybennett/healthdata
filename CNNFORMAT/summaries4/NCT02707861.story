(fifthQuint)Ibalizumab Plus Optimized Background Regimen in Treatment-Experienced Patients With Multi-Drug Resistant HIV-1.

 Participants will enroll into one of two study cohorts.

 Cohort 1 will provide continued administration of IV ibalizumab for patients completing a prior ibalizumab clinical trial (TaiMed-sponsored or Investigator-Sponsored).

 Patients will continue to receive IV infusions of ibalizumab at the dosage assigned in the previous study - either 800 mg once every two weeks, or 2000 mg once every four weeks.

 Cohort 2 will provide IV ibalizumab, 800 mg once every two weeks, for qualifying patients with multi-drug resistant HIV-1 and limited treatment options who have never previously received ibalizumab.

 Participants may continue in this study for 48 weeks, or until ibalizumab becomes commercially available, whichever occurs first.

 Ibalizumab Plus Optimized Background Regimen in Treatment-Experienced Patients With Multi-Drug Resistant HIV-1@highlight

Ibalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by blocking HIV entry into the immune system cells (CD4+ or T-cells) the virus typically infects.

 Ibalizumab is intended for use in combination with other anti-HIV drugs in people with multi-drug resistant HIV and limited treatment options.

 This study will collect further information on the safety and tolerability of intravenously administered (IV) ibalizumab combined with an optimized background regimen for treating multi-drug resistant HIV-1 infection, and will provide continuing access to ibalizumab for patients completing a prior ibalizumab clinical trial.
