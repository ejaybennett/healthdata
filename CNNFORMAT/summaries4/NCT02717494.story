(thirdQuint)Safety and Immunogenicity of Anti-Pneumococcal Vaccines in HIV-Infected Pregnant Women.

 This is a multi-center, Phase II, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) who are in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and of their infants.

 The study is designed to investigate the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, transplacental antibody transfer and interference with infant responses to childhood vaccination of maternal vaccination with PCV-10 or PPV-23 by comparison with placebo.

 Mothers will be randomized to one of three arms and will receive PCV-10, PPV-23, or placebo in a blinded fashion.

 They will be followed for safety, immunogenicity and vaccine-specific anti-capsular pneumococcus (PNC) antibody persistence until 24 weeks post-delivery.

 Women who received placebo will be randomized to a second study step and will receive PCV-10 or PPV-23 at 24 weeks post-delivery.

 Antibody responses to the vaccine administered 6 months postpartum will be measured.

 Women who received placebo but cannot be randomized to a second study step due to ongoing new pregnancy will be enrolled in a third study step and receive open label PCV-10 at the last study visit; no data will be collected on these women and they will not be followed after vaccine administration.

 All infants will receive PCV-10 vaccinations per local standard of care.

The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, transplacental antibody transfer and interference with infant responses to childhood vaccination of maternal vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate 10-valent vaccine (PCV-10) or pneumococcal polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine (PPV-23) by comparison with placebo.
