(thirdQuint)Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacodynamics of Investigational Treatments in Combination With Standard of Care Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Participants With Advanced Melanoma.

 The drugs being tested in this study are called TAK-580, TAK-202 (plozalizumab), and vedolizumab.

 These investigational drugs were given along with standard of care checkpoint inhibitors ([nivolumab in Arms 1 and 2] or nivolumab + ipilimumab in Arm 3).

 This study will look at the safety profile of the combination treatments in each arm when administered to participants with advanced melanoma.

 The study will enroll approximately 156 participants.

 Participants will be assigned to one of the 3 treatment groups: - TAK-580 + nivolumab - TAK-202 (plozalizumab) + nivolumab - vedolizumab + nivolumab + ipilimumab This study consists of 3 parts.

 A dose-escalation safety lead-in phase, confirmatory safety phase and a cohort expansion phase.

 This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States.

 The overall time to participate in this study is 50 weeks.

 Participants may make multiple visits to the clinic and 30, 60, and 90 days after last dose of study drug for follow-up assessments.

 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacodynamics of Investigational Treatments in Combination With Standard of Care Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Participants With Advanced Melanoma@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the initial safety profile and initial antitumor activity of the combination treatments (immune checkpoint inhibitors [nivolumab, ipilimumab] with investigational drugs [TAK-580, TAK-202 (plozalizumab), vedolizumab]) in the 3 arms when administered to participants with advanced melanoma.
