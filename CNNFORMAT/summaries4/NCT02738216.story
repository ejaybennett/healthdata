This NICHD-funded RCT will enroll up to 178 depressed pregnant women, randomly assigning them to one of 2 intervention conditions: (1) a gentle prenatal yoga program (PYP), or (2) a series of educational workshops focused on perinatal health, the Mom and Baby Wellness Workshop (MBWW), each condition lasting 9 weeks.

 The investigators will clinically monitor all participants in the study for safety and clinical deterioration, and measure a variety of symptom outcomes over the course of the intervention period during pregnancy, as well as at a postpartum follow-up.
