(fifthQuint)Early Versus Late Voiding Trials After Prolapse Repair.

 Overnight indwelling catheterization is a prevalent practice after surgical repair of pelvic organ prolapse.

 A voiding trial is performed postoperative day one to determine if urinary retention or abnormal bladder function exists.

 A significant number of patients ranging from 26-47% will require continued catheterization post-op for urinary retention in order to avoid injuries associated with over distention of the bladder and ureteral reflux.

 This study aims to explore a strategy to reduce the length of catheterization post-operatively by testing the bladder at a closer interval to surgery.

 An earlier voiding trial may improve patient perioperative satisfaction and decrease catheter associated urinary tract infections.

 Additional benefits that may also be seen are earlier first ambulation and quicker achievement of post-op discharge milestones (pain control, ambulation with symptoms, oral intake tolerance and completion of a voiding trial).

 To date, few studies have attempted a day of surgery voiding trial in patients being admitted for repair of pelvic organ prolapse that requires an overnight admission.

 Early Versus Late Voiding Trials After Prolapse Repair@highlight

The primary aim of this study is to determine if normal bladder function (the ability to empty the bladder during spontaneous urination) after surgical repair of pelvic organ prolapse returns faster in patients who have a retrograde voiding trial the day of surgery versus patients who have a retrograde voiding trial on postoperative day one.

 Half of participants will have a voiding trial 4 hours after surgery, while the other half will have the voiding trial postoperative day one.
