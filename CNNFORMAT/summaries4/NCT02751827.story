(thirdQuint)Predicting Severe Toxicity of Targeted Therapies in Elderly Patients With Cancer.

 This is a prospective cohort with collection of biological samples, including 300 patients > 75 year-old treated in multicenter with antiangiogenic TKI regularly approved for metastatic cancers.

 Data on clinical and biological characteristics of the patient, disease and treatment as well as pharmacogenomics will be centrally collected at the beginning of the treatment.

 Drug exposure-safety analyses will be performed through assessment of drug through levels (Cmin).

 Primary endpoint is severe toxicity defined as treatment-related death, hospitalization or disruption of treatment for more than three weeks.

 Predicting Severe Toxicity of Targeted Therapies in Elderly Patients With Cancer@highlight

In order to assess the important issue of the safety of antiangiogenic TKI in geriatric population we set up this project which aims to identify, among clinical, biological, pharmacokinetic data, predictive factors for severe toxicity of antiangiogenic TKI (sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, regorafenib, axitinib) in patients over 75 year-old.
