(secondQuint)Effectiveness of ROTEM-based Coagulation Surveillance on Reducing Blood Product Utilization During Complex Spine Surgery.

 The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of intra-operative ROTEM-based coagulation monitoring on reducing total blood product use during complex spine surgery.

 The primary outcome will include estimated blood losses and blood product utilization during and after surgery (48 hours).

 Secondary outcomes also include hospital length of stay, and cost analysis of the 2 methodologies.
