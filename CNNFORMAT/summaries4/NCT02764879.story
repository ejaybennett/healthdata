(thirdQuint)Effect of Omega 3 on Periodontitis in Postmenopausal Women.

 Fifty postmenopausal women with chronic periodontitis were divided randomly into two groups: Group 1 (n=25) were provided periodontal treatment in the form of scaling and root planing (SRP) plus placebo soft gelatin capsules while group 2 (n=25): patients were received SRP along with systemic administration of Omega 3 fatty acids.

 Clinical parameters and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the gingival crevicular fluid were recorded at baseline, 3 and 6 months after therapy.

 The research has been conducted between July 2014 and June 2015.

 By the end of the study period, the Omega 3 treated group was able to achieve a greater mean probing pocket depth reduction, mean gain in clinical attachment level, as well as greater increase in SOD activity (P<0.

01) compared to SRP alone.

The study was aimed to investigating changes in periodontal parameters and superoxide dismutase activity after root surface debridement with and without Omega 3 fatty acids (-3 FAs) supplementation in postmenopausal women.

 Adjunctive Omega 3 fatty acids supplements reduce periodontal inflammation and improve the status of systemic enzymatic antioxidants in postmenopausal women.
