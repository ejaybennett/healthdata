(fifthQuint)Intensive Cognitive and Physical Rehabilitation Program.

 1.

 ICT intervention.

 A personalized SMS based patient communication feedback system (Microsoft).

 Utilizing the jointly decided upon follow-up parameters individuals will receive periodic SMS reminders.

 In cases of consistent non-adherence the system will alert the diabetes nurse educator who will contact the individual (in addition to the routine monthly call) in order to understand the difficulty and devise an alternate plan.

 The personalized SMS system is based on insights from a recent successful clinical trial conducted in people with diabetes.

 The system is based on a machine learning module and learns using the attributes of the participants (age, gender etc.

) their activities as well as past experience to predict which SMS message would most incentivize each person to enhance conduction of the decided upon treatment plan (for example a certain type of physical activity).

 In this way the system achieves improvements which are superior to those achieved by generic feedback systems.

 Mobile health technology (mHealth).

 MHealth is the use of mobile phone technology to deliver health care.

 This innovation have been developed that address an array of issues such as monitoring chronic condition, medication adherence, improving patient provider communication, and disease and emergency tracking.

 Most widely adopted and least expensive technological feature of mHealth is the text messaging (SMS).

 SMS is suitable for behavior change interventions because it allows for in-the-moment, personally tailored health communication and reinforcement.

 Several studies have found that text messaging is a worthwhile investment for helping people with diabetes to improve their disease management.

 Intensive cognitive-physical rehabilitation intervention.

 The intervention will include two phases: 1.

 Intensive phase: 12 weekly group meeting 4 hours each.

 Each meeting will be composed of: - 2 hours guided by a neuropsychologist each dedicated to a different cognitive domain for example memory, concentration, planning, information processing, problem solving (with special emphasis on diabetes issues).

 Each session will be composed of: 1) introduction- homework from previous session will be checked and the cognitive domain that will be discussed on that day will be introduced; 2) cognitive training using a computerized system (hour); 3) group discussion on compensatory strategies and training to be conducted at home - 2 hours guided by a certified physical trainer.

 These will include strength, balance and aerobic elements conducted in a group but individualized according to the capabilities and targets of the individual as assessed during the evaluation day.

 These sessions will also include formulation of a plan for exercise to be conducted by the individual on a daily basis.

 Additionally, 30 minutes of each session will be dedicated to psycho-education on various disease management aspects guided by a diabetes nurse educator or a dietitian (alternating).

 2.

 Consolidation phase: 9 months of monthly group meetings.

 The consolidation group sessions will include monthly 2 hour group discussions on challenges of implementation and coping strategies Medical surveillance will take place every 2 months with monitoring of glucose, blood pressure lipid control as well as follow-up on other recommendations given during the feed-back sessions this will be conducted by the Diabetes nurse educator who will be work together with a diabetes specialist an Endocrinologist (study physician) on maximal risk factor reduction.

 Intensive Cognitive and Physical Rehabilitation Program@highlight

This will be a feasibility study.

 Individuals that have undergone an evaluation day at the center for successful aging with diabetes with a Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) of >=7.

5 and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)<26 will be approached and invited to participate.

 The participants will be divided into 2 groups: 1) information communication technology (ICT) group - an intervention based on weekly SMS that will remind the individual to implement his personal treatment plan and will raise the awareness to the importance of self-care in diabetes; 2) intensive cognitive-physical rehabilitation group that will include a 2 phase multi-disciplinary intervention.

 The 2 phases: a) Intensive phase: weekly 4 hour group meeting which will include computerized cognitive training, aerobic, balance and strength exercise and group discussion that will be dedicated to cognitive rehabilitation strategies development and implementation with emphasis on disease management and physical activity as well as psycho-education on various disease management aspects (medical and nutritional) b) a consolidation phase: monthly 2 hour group discussions on challenges of implementation and coping strategies.

 Outcomes will include change in A1C (primary), change in strength, aerobic capacity as well as quality of life and cognitive function (secondary).

 Additionally, team members and participants will fill out a structured questionnaire regarding their evaluation of the program aiming at refinement of the intervention.
