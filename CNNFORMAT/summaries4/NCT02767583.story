 Development of the study: If patients the eligibility criteria, it will be proposed at the first consultation in central obesity, participate in a clinical study to assess the prevalence of subclinical damage peripheral nerves by simple and painless rapid measurement of skin conductance on the palm of the feet with the Sudoscan(R) device during the consultation and a Thermotest(R), as well as monitoring during the various follow-up consultation after any bariatric surgery or not.

 This monitoring will be done by the same neurophysiological tests.

 - During the preoperative assessment that will be conducted in the planned hospital in Diabetology Service, written information will be given to patient and no objection will be drawn, then the following tests will be done: - The measurement of skin conductance by Sudoscan(R) and the extent of the painful sensitivity to temperature Thermotest(R) will be made for all patients included in the study.

 - If the records Sudoscan(R) skin conductance less than 601/2S, we propose a Electroneuromyography the patient as usual on GHPSJ.

 - Measurement of weight, height, waist circumference and hip circumference patient - The DN4 scale and Uens clinical neuropathy score.

 - A measurement of blood pressure will be - A biological sample will be taken on an empty stomach.

 - For patients with plantar skin conductance will be lowered 1/2Siemens and / or whose pain threshold will warm significantly elevated (Thermotest(R)), if necessary electromyogram will be realized in the second time (appointment given to the output consultation with the endocrinologist.

 - During the postoperative follow-up usually expected for this type of surgery, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months will be made the same clinical examinations than those made during the preoperative assessment and the type of surgery performed.

 Laboratory tests will be carried out in the usual care for surgical patients.

 Methodology Design: prospective, single-center Study duration: 24 months (estimate: 3-5 patients included / week of 15 patients collected in central obesity / week) including 12 months of inclusion.

 Data processing : For each subject will be awarded an identifier (original name and surname - year of birth) and the data will be entered on a computer file which will be sent to the statistician in charge of analyzing the GHPSJ site.

 There will be no exchange of personal data.

 Statistical analysis : The patient will be considered to have a small fiber neuropathy, symptomatic or not, when the skin conductance of chloride ions will be below the threshold for 601/2Siemens soles.

 The prevalence shall be calculated from that definition.

 Stratified by age will be made during the statistical analysis.

 A test will be performed to analyze the statistical relationship between: Skin conductance AND - BMI, - size, - Girth - Waist circumference ratio / hip circumference - Sex, - DN4 score, - The score Uens, - The biological parameters studied: fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, CRP, serum uric acid.

 Assessment of the Prevalence of Small Fiber Peripheral Neuropathy Among Non-diabetic Obese Patients@highlight

Background / rational: Obesity is associated with significant comorbidities including type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance), heart disease, stroke, hypertension, sleep apnea syndrome, dyslipidemia, cancer, hepatobiliary diseases, orthopedic complications and psychosocial impact 1 .

 Peripheral neuropathy is a known complication in the type I and II diabetes and glucose intolerance and metabolic syndrome in 2.

 Outside of diabetes (type I and II) that are associated with cardiovascular risk high vascular, presence of metabolic syndrome constitutes in itself a well demonstrated vascular risk factor.

 Its definition requires the presence of three elements from the following 5: abdominal obesity (high waist circumference), high blood pressure, high fasting blood sugar, high triglycerides and / low HDL-cholesterol 3.

 This peripheral neuropathy predominantly affects sensory fibers of small poorly myelinated diameter (A fibers and C) and autonomous sensory fibers and is called small fiber neuropathy 4.

 The cardinal sign of NAION is the presence of neuropathic pain but abnormalities in physical examination are often absent and conventional electromyography is faulted to make the diagnosis.

 These small fibers are also constituent of the autonomic nervous system and causes damage autonomic dysfunction that can manifest the cardiovascular system (hypotension, cardiac conduction disorders), digestive, sweat, sphincter.

 neuropathy of the diagnosis of small fibers is suggested clinically by the presence of neuropathic pain often contrasting with a normal clinical examination.

 The confirmation is based on electrophysiology with various techniques and quantification of intra-epidermal nerve fibers.

 Main objective / secondary: Primary objective : To determine the prevalence of a small fiber peripheral neuropathy in nondiabetic obese patients, by measuring skin conductance ion Chlorine (Sudoscan(R)) evaluating small fibers C autonomic Secondary objectives: - Evaluation of the prevalence of occurrence of peripheral neuropathy by Sudoscan(R) during follow-up after treatment of obese patients with bariatric surgery (months) M1, 3, 6, 9, 12.
