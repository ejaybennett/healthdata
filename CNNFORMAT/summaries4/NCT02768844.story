(secondQuint)Physiology and Therapeutic Management of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome.

 Novel approaches to diagnosing and treating Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) are needed for reducing prolonged pharmacological management, minimizing hospitalization and improving developmental outcomes in drug exposed newborns.

 This study seeks to examine the physiology and symptoms of drug withdrawal (e.

g.

, irritability marked by movement activity; cardio-respiratory instabilities) in infants exposed to drugs in utero and test whether sensory stimuli (tactile, auditory) reduce dysregulated systems in the withdrawing infant.

 Candidates at-risk for NAS due to fetal drug exposure will be identified to investigators by the infant's Attending physician.

 Investigators will use a modified-consecutive sampling technique, restricted by equipment and personnel availability, for enrolling infants.

 Participants will be studied throughout their hospitalization.

 Effects of stimulation will be examined at different stages of withdrawal.

 Efficacy of stimulation will be examined as a potential complementary treatment of NAS.

The overall purpose of this project is to to quantify the physiology of neonatal drug withdrawal and develop non-pharmacological techniques to help improve the therapeutic management of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS).
