(thirdQuint)A Short Term Evaluation of a Structured Weight Loss Plan in Overweight and Obese Adults.

 It is well know that consumption of a calorically-restricted diet helps people lose weight.

 Such a diet with low carbohydrate lowers the serum uric acid concentration which is a factor associated with obesity and also represents a particular metabolic risk in women compared to men.

 The present weight loss study will determine whether women benefit more than men to short-term weight loss occurring during restriction of simple sugars.

 Specifically, this study is designed to cause weight loss acutely through consumption of a diet that is restricted in calorie and simple sugars.

 Both men and women will be studied and their results compared to determine whether women benefit more with respect to arterial stiffness.

 Upon finishing the four-week diet intervention, body weight and blood lipids will be assessed two and four weeks later to compare the longer term effect on blood pressure.

 A Short Term Evaluation of a Structured Weight Loss Plan in Overweight and Obese Adults@highlight

The present study is designed to examine the effect of changes in body weight and related parameters associated with a commercially-available, low-carbohydrate diet plan.

 A parameter proposed to be studied here is the impact of fructose restriction and weight loss on serum uric acid concentrations and arterial stiffness.
