(secondQuint)Prothrombin Complex Concentrate Versus Fresh Frozen Plasma to Correct Coagulation Disorders in Adult Neurosurgical Patients.

 The coagulation disorders increase the risk of bleeding and are a risk factor of intracranial hemorrhagic complications in neurosurgical patients.

 They are diagnosed more often in emergency on a PT value less than 60% and so they should be corrected as soon as possible.

 Two therapeutic strategies are proposed by French or international recommendations: transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or administration of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC).

 This prospective, randomized, multicenter study with blinded assessment of the primary endpoint, is performed to determine whether PCC confers any benefits over FFP in the neurological patients with coagulation disorders.
