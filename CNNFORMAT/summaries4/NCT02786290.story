(firstQuint)The Zenflow Spring System Feasibility and Safety Study.

 The purpose of the Zenflow Study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a novel prostatic urethral implant for the treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) that arise due to bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), secondary to the presence of Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH).

 Effectiveness will also be measured.

 It is intended that the features of the Zenflow Spring will provide an effective office-based treatment and management therapy for BPH with little or no side effects.
