(fifthQuint)Study to Assess the Activity of Molecularly Matched Targeted Therapies in Select Tumor Types Based on Genomic Alterations.

 This four-arm pilot phase II study will evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of selected commercially available molecularly matched targeted therapies in patients who have failed first line treatment for one of the following tumor types: 1.

 non-small cell lung cancer, 2.

 urothelial carcinoma, 3.

 non-colon gastrointestinal cancers, and 4.

 upper aerodigestive tract cancers (lip, tongue, salivary glands, gum, mouth, oral cavity, tonsils, oropharynx, nasopharynx, nasal cavity, sinus, and larynx tumors).

 Approximately 160 patients (40 per tumour type) are planned for enrollment.

 Consideration for enrollment will be based on results from profiling with next-generation sequencing technology that was performed outside of the protocol.

 Eligible patients will receive one of the FDA-approved targeted agents at the recommended dose.

 The treating physician will decide which targeted agent to prescribe based on the genomic alterations per tumor type and the targets listed in the package insert for each agent.

 Study to Assess the Activity of Molecularly Matched Targeted Therapies in Select Tumor Types Based on Genomic Alterations@highlight

With the increased availability of next-generation sequencing, oncologists are starting to incorporate genomic profiling into routine care of cancer patients.

 If a genomic alteration is identified during profiling, it could help guide the choice of therapy and improve treatment outcomes.

 This study will examine the anti-tumor activity of selected commercially available molecularly matched targeted therapies in patients who have failed first-line treatment for one of the following tumor types: non-small cell lung cancers; urothelial cancer; non-colon gastrointestinal cancers, and upper aerodigestive tract cancer.
