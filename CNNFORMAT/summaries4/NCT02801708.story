(thirdQuint)Enhanced Detection of Underlying, Covert ATrial Fibrillation Using 7-day Holter Electrocardiogram in Patients With Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source.

 Covert atrial fibrillation (AF) is a relevant potential cause of a recently proposed clinical construct, "Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (ESUS)".

 However, routine post-stroke work up including 24-hour Holter monitoring may fail to detect paroxysmal AF.

 A recent systematic review has shown an increased AF detection rate with longer monitoring durations.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel ambulatory 7-day Holter ECG (EV-201, Parama-Tech inc.

) for detecting AF in patients with recent ESUS after completion of a standard clinical examination.

The aim of this study is to determine the diagnostic yield of continuous 7-day Holter ECG for detecting covert paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with recent embolic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) of undetermined cause after completion of a standard clinical work up including an initial 24-hour Holter monitoring.
