(thirdQuint)Serum and Peritoneal CEA and CA 19-9 for Gastric Adenocarcinoma.

 Clinical usage of tumor markers on preoperative staging and prediction of peritoneal dissemination of gastric adenocarcinoma is a controversial issue.

 It has been thought that there is a positive correlation between serum and peritoneal levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 and pathologic features of gastric tumors and peritoneal dissemination.

 In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of serum and peritoneal CEA and CA 19-9 to predict TNM stages and peritoneal washing cytology in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma after curative gastrectomy, and to determine predictive value of these measurements to the development of recurrence and death.

 Serum and Peritoneal CEA and CA 19-9 for Gastric Adenocarcinoma@highlight

For preoperative staging and prediction of peritoneal dissemination of gastric adenocarcinoma, usage of serum and peritoneal levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 may be helpful.

 Additionally, the prognosis of the patients with gastric adenocarcinoma treated with gastrectrectomy may be associated with serum and peritoneal levels of tumor markers.
