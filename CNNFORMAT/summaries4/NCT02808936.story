(firstQuint)The Effect of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning on Major Organ Function in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease Undergoing Orthopedic Surgery.

 When adult patients with ischemic heart disease undergo non-cardiac surgery, perioperative ischemic complication may occur.

 These morbidity results in poor clinical outcomes.

 The incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemic event has been reported to be up to 19.

7%.

 Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a concept that a brief ischemic reperfusion of upper or lower extremity can transfer protection to the other vital organs from sustained ischemic reperfusion injury.

 Although RIPC is extensively studied in high risk cardiovascular surgery, it has not been tested in a non-cardiac surgery patients with a history of ischemic heart disease.

 Major organ injury including heart, lung and kidney will be evaluated in this randomized controlled trial.

The investigators attempt to investigate the organ protective effect of remote ischemic conditioning in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery with history of ischemic heart disease.
