 Proteomics of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma@highlight

Thyroid carcinoma is the common endocrine system malignant neoplasm.

 At present it has become the malignant neoplasm of fastest growing incidence rate.

 More than 85% thyroid carcinoma is papillary thyroid carcinoma.

 Cervical lymph node metastasis is common in papillary thyroid carcinoma patients.

 This study aim to reveal protein expression differences between papillary thyroid carcinoma with cervical lymph node metastasis and without cervical lymph node metastasis.
