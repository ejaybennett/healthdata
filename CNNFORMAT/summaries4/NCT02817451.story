(fifthQuint)DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T Combined Vaccine as a Primary Series and a 2nd Year of Life Booster in HIV-Exposed Infected and Uninfected Infants.

 Male and female infants born from HIV-infected mothers will be tested for HIV infection from birth to 6 weeks of age.

 HIV infected and HIV uninfected participants will be enrolled into two groups at Day 0.

 Some infants will be detected outside of this screening and will already have proof of HIV infection, and will be enrolled in the study at Day 0.

 All participants will receive primary vaccinations with Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T combined vaccine at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age and a booster dose at approximately 15 to 18 months of age will receive a booster dose of the Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T combined vaccine.

 DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T Combined Vaccine as a Primary Series and a 2nd Year of Life Booster in HIV-Exposed Infected and Uninfected Infants@highlight

Study is to assess and confirm the adequate immunogenicity and safety profile of the Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-Hep B-IPV-PRP-T fully liquid combined hexavalent vaccine administered in HIV-exposed uninfected infants (HIV-exposed uninfected) and in HIV-exposed infected infants (HIV-exposed infected).

 Primary Objectives: - To evaluate the immunogenicity of the study vaccine 1 month after the 3-dose primary series in HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants.

 - To describe the persistence of all antibodies before receipt of the booster vaccination in HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants.

 - To evaluate the immunogenicity of the study vaccine 1 month after the booster dose in HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants.

 Secondary Objectives - To describe the safety profile after each and all doses of the study vaccine administered as a 3-dose infant primary series in HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants.

 - To describe the safety profile of the study vaccine administered as a booster in HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants.
