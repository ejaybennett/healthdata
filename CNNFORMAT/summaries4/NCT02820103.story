(fifthQuint)Reducing Acute Coronary Syndrome Patient Delay.

 Patient delay means many people do not achieve optimal benefit of time-dependent treatments for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS).

 Reducing delay would reduce mortality and morbidity but to date, interventions to change behaviour have had mixed results.

 Systematic inclusion of behaviour-change techniques (BCTs) or a visual mode of delivery might improve the efficacy of interventions.

 Aim To evaluate the efficacy of a BCT-based intervention and to compare two possible modes of delivery (text+visual and text-only).

 Design A 3-arm web-based, parallel randomised, controlled trial of a theory-based intervention.

 Methods and analysis The intervention comprises 12 BCTs systematically identified following systematic review and a consensus exercise undertaken with behaviour change experts.

 We aim to recruit n=177 participants who have experienced ACS in the previous 6 months from a local National Health Service (NHS) Teaching Hospital.

 Participants will be identified by Cardiac Rehabilitation staff and invited by letter to take part in the study.

 Those who wish to take part will be asked to access the experiment at a secure web-address and consent re-checked.

 Consenting participants will be randomly allocated in equal numbers to one of three study groups: i) usual care ii) usual care plus text-only BCT-based intervention or iii) usual care plus text+visual BCT-based intervention.

 The outcome variable will be the change in intention to phone an ambulance immediately with symptoms of ACS 15 minutes duration assessed using two randomised series of 8 scenarios representing varied symptoms before and after delivery of the interventions or control condition (usual care).

 Reducing Acute Coronary Syndrome Patient Delay@highlight

1.

 To test the effectiveness of the theory-based interventions (text+visual and text-only BCT-based interventions) against usual care in changing patients' intentions to phone ambulance immediately with symptoms of ACS 15 minutes duration.

 2.

 To determine the most effective mode of delivery by comparing the text+visual BCT-based intervention with text-only BCT-based intervention.

 3.

 To investigate any unintended consequences of the intervention on intentions to phone an ambulance for non-life-threatening symptoms.
