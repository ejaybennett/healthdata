(fifthQuint)Learn, Engage, Act, Process (LEAP) for MOVE.

 The Veterans Affairs (VA) National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP) first disseminated MOVE! weight management program guidance in 2006.

 Program guidance was updated in 2014, which is expected to increase engagement and improve outcomes.

 However, variation in local programs is high.

 The overall goal of this project is to test the Learn.

 Engage.

 Act.

 Process (LEAP) intervention to work with teams virtually, to build skills in implementing program improvements.

 Forty-eight sites will be randomized to the LEAP intervention using a stepped-wedge trial design.

 LEAP is a virtually delivered program that relies on the IHI Model for Improvement, an online learning platform for clinician teams to share ideas and progress, an audit and feedback process, and a barrier buster tool.

 The LEAP intervention will be compared to active support provided by NCP to all local VA MOVE! teams.

 The investigators will compare whether teams participating in LEAP have MOVE! programs that engage more Veterans compared to facilities not participating in LEAP.

 The investigators will also collect information to understand which components of LEAP worked best and how to scale up and implement LEAP more broadly.

 The project aims are: Aim 1: To develop three core products to enhance NCP support to VAMCs and to pilot LEAP in three VAMCs.

 H1: Dissemination of products to enhance NCP support will improve MOVE! outcomes.

 Aim 2: To determine effectiveness of LEAP plus enhanced NCP support (LEAP+NCP) versus enhanced NCP support alone.

 H2: VAMCs with LEAP+NCP will have better MOVE! group outcomes than VAMCs with enhanced NCP support alone.

 Aim 3: To conduct formative and cost evaluations to refine design of LEAP and inform future scaling-up of LEAP.

The overall goal of this project is to test whether the Learn.

 Engage.

 Act.

 Process (LEAP) intervention helps teams within the Veterans Health Administration's local MOVE! group weight management programs be more in line with guidance.

 Forty-eight sites will be randomized to the LEAP intervention, which is a virtually delivered program that relies on the IHI Model for Improvement, an online learning platform for clinician teams to share ideas and progress, an audit and feedback process, and a barrier buster tool.

 The LEAP intervention will be compared to active support that is provided to all VA MOVE! programs by the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP).

 The investigators will compare whether participation in LEAP results in engaging more Veterans in the MOVE! weight management program compared to facilities not participating in LEAP.

 The investigators will also collect information to understand what components of LEAP worked best and how to scale up so more teams can participate in LEAP.
