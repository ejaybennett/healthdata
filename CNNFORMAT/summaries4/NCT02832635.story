(thirdQuint)A Clinical Trial on Whole-brain Radiotherapy With Temozolomide Concurrent Chemotherapy or Avoidance of Hippocampus for Patients of Brain Metastases.

 This is a phase II randomized clinical trial.

 It is reported that avoidance of hippocampus during whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) had benefits in preservation of memory for patients, and the use of concurrent TMZ in radiotherapy for patients with brain metastases benefited for treating outcome.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects on neurocognitive function of whole-brain radiotherapy with/without TMZ concurrent chemotherapy or avoidance of hippocampus for patients of brain metastases, as well as the feasibility and risk of avoidance of hippocampus during whole-brain radiotherapy.
