(fifthQuint)Nivolumab and Yttrium Y 90 Glass Microspheres in Treating Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To identify MTD of nivolumab for combination treatment of nivolumab and Y-90 in this population.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the proportion of patients with objective response rate (ORR) (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria) to the combination treatment of nivolumab with Y-90.

 II.

 To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 24 weeks in the described population.

 III.

 To evaluate the toxicities (according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version (v)4.

03) and tolerability of nivolumab and Y-90 in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma IV.

 To determine the disease control rate (DCR) to the combination of nivolumab and Y-90 at 24 months from the start of nivolumab treatment.

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein on tumor cells and the expression levels of other markers of inflammatory/immune signature that may include but not be limited to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 4 (OX40), cluster of differentiation (CD) 73, CD39, T cell immunoglobulin and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM3), glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor receptor (GITRL), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), and granzyme by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or flow cytometry will be evaluated.

 II.

 Whole exome sequencing and computational analyses will be performed to assess mutanome and immunome (subpopulations of immune cells).

 III.

 Change in clonal burden landscape of various mutanome and immunome will be analyzed to investigate its correlation with treatment response or development of resistance to treatment.

 OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of nivolumab followed by a phase Ib study.

 Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres intraarterially (IA).

 Approximately 4 weeks after yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres treatment, nivolumab will be administered intravenously (IV) over approximately 60 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 30 days after the last dose of nivolumab and again at 100 days after discontinuing study drug.

 Nivolumab and Yttrium Y 90 Glass Microspheres in Treating Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to identify maximum tolerated dose (MTD), that is, the highest dose of the study drug nivolumab that does not cause unacceptable side effects, for combination treatment of nivolumab and yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (Y-90).

 Also, to evaluate the efficacy (the effect of drug on your tumor) and the tolerability (the effect of the drug on your body) of nivolumab, when given with standard of care Y-90 (Therasphere).

 Nivolumab is currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for other cancers, but has not yet been investigated in advanced or refractory hepatocellular carcinoma.

 Nivolumab is an antibody (a human protein that sticks to a part of the tumor and/or immune cells) designed to allow the body's immune system to work against tumor cells.

 Y-90 is currently FDA approved for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas, but has not yet been investigated in combination with nivolumab for this disease.
