(thirdQuint)The Impact of Focused Transthoracic Echocardiography in Urgent Abdominal Surgery for Septic Patients.

 Often sepsis remains undiagnosed at the very beginning because of the concentration to the surgical pathology in perioperative period.

 This results in unacceptably high mortality.

 The investigators hypothesize that extended hemodynamic monitoring by focused echocardiography will allow early detection of hemodynamic instability, which cannot be clinically diagnosed yet.

 The goals of the investigators study are: - To conduct two-group randomized controlled clinical trial to compare patient management based on standard monitoring and extended hemodynamic monitoring by focused echocardiography in patients undergoing urgent abdominal surgery.

 - To demonstrate that patient management based on extended hemodynamic monitoring by focused echocardiography results in reduced incidence of hemodynamic instability during perioperative period.

 - To compare an amount of administrated of intravenous fluids in both groups.

 The investigators hypothesize that focused echocardiography monitoring will result in more administrated intravenous fluids during perioperative period.

The aim of the study is to identify the diagnostic value of the focused assessed echocardiography protocol (FATE - Holm et al 2012) for patients undergoing urgent abdominal surgery and having signs of sepsis.

 The extended cardiac monitoring may affect patient's management during perioperative period.

 The investigators expect that the incidence of hemodynamic instability will be reduced and the outcomes of the patients will be improved.
