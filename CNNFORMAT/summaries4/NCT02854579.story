(secondQuint)Neural Progenitor Cell and Paracrine Factors to Treat Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy.

 Neonates diagnosed moderate/severe Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy after birth will receive routine therapy and be randomized to four arms for allogenic neural progenitor cells transplantation,paracrine factors of human mesenchymal stem cells intrathecal injection,combination of cell and factor or only routine therapy.

 Patients will be followed for neurodevelopmental outcome at 12 and 18 months in Pediatrics of Navy General Hospital.

 Magnetic Resonance Imaging, electroencephalogram, Bailey scores, Peabody development measure scale and Gross motor function measure assessment will be obtained in the following research.

Results will be analyzed and described in study reports.
