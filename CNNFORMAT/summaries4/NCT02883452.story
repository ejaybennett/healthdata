(firstQuint)A Phase I Study to Evaluate PK, Efficacy and Safety of CT-P13 SC in Patients With Active CD and UC.

 A new subcutaneous infliximab formulation is being developed by Celltrion, Inc.

 as an alternative to the intravenous regimen where subcutaneous infliximab injection typically takes less than 2 minutes.

 The availability of a subcutaneous formulation of infliximab would increase the treatment options available to patients, particularly those wishing to self-administer their therapy.

 This Phase 1 randomized, open-label, multicenter, parallel-group study is designed to evaluate efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety between CT-P13 SC and CT-P13 IV in patients with active CD or active UC.
