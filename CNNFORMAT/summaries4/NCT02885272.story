(secondQuint)Dual Time Point FDG PET-MR Imaging Optimization for the Evaluation of Glioblastoma.

 Imaging Procedures: If you agree to take part in this study, you will come to the Diagnostic Imaging clinic for your FDG PET/CT scans.

 If you have not had your standard of care MRI scan done already, it will be done on the day of the FDG PET/CT scans.

 The contrast drug will be injected into a vein in your arm through a standard IV over about a minute.

 One (1) hour after you receive the contrast drug, you will be moved to the FDG PET-CT scanner where you will have a brain and whole body scan, which will take about 30 minutes.

 This is a research scan.

 If you have not had your standard-of-care MRI scan of your brain already, it will be done at this time.

 This MRI will take about 45 minutes.

 You will come back to the clinic for 2 more FDG PET-CT scans at 4 - 5 hours and at 7 - 8 hours after receiving the contrast drug.

 The scanning time will be about 20 - 30 minutes each time.

 These are the research scans.

 You must fast (have nothing to eat or drink except water) for at least 6 hours before each scan.

 When you are allowed to eat, you should eat a low carbohydrate, high protein meal (for example, baked chicken with a side of asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms, or any green vegetable/salad).

 You should also drink about 6-8 glasses of water (each glass should be about 8 ounces).

 The study staff will give you a handout with specific diet instructions you must follow before the PET scan.

 Information will also be collected from your medical record.

 Length of Study Participation: Your active participation in this study will be over after your last PET-CT scan is complete.

 This is an investigational study.

 The FDG PET-CT and MRIs are delivered using FDA approved and commercially available methods.

 Comparing the results from different imaging time points after giving the contrast drug is investigational.

 Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.

 Dual Time Point FDG PET-MR Imaging Optimization for the Evaluation of Glioblastoma@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the results during different scanning time points after a contrast drug is given for a FDG PET/CT.

 The contrast drug helps the researchers "see" the images more clearly.
