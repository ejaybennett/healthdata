(fifthQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Bortezomib as add-on Treatment in Relapsing Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder.

 It has been shown in some scientific studies that the the antibody marker specific for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), known as AQP4-IgG, causes inflammation in brain tissues by activating NF-B pathway.

 Bortezomib has already been shown to be effective in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

 The overall objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of bortezomib as add-on therapy to oral steroids,azathioprine or others for treatment of relapsing NMOSD, which have not reduced average relapsing rate (ARR) effectively.

 The primary (most important) objectives of this study are to determine: Whether bortezomib reduces relapse frequency in patients with relapsing NMO.

 The number of attacks during the one year treatment period will be compared to the number of attacks that occurred prior to initiation of bortezomib treatment.

 The secondary objectives are to determine: The safety profile of bortezomib in patients with NMO.

 Whether bortezomib maintains or improves walking, visual function and quality of life as measured by a variety of established disability scales.

 We will also assess the severity of an individual attack and the degree of recovery.

 Depending on our preliminary investigations we may evaluate patient cerebrospinal fluid in the laboratory to see how effective eculizumab is at getting into the cerebrospinal fluid from the blood stream, and to see if the drug reverses the biological effects of the NMO-IgG antibody.

 Efficacy and Safety of Bortezomib as add-on Treatment in Relapsing Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder@highlight

Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD) is characterized by the pathogenic anti-AQP4 antibody, which can be produced by specific plasma cells.

 The patients who are not responsive to rituximab treatment may be due to the presence of short-lived and long-lived plasma cells.

 Previous studies confirmed that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade(R), approved for therapy of multiple myeloma) eliminated both plasmablasts and plasma cells by activation of the terminal unfolded protein response.

 Treatment with bortezomib may help deplete plasma cells producing auto-antibodies.

 Therefore, the rationale for using bortezomib in NMOSD is in that bortezomib may help eliminate autoreactive plasma cells and reduce anti-AQP4 antibodies titers.

 It is noted that bortezomib may protect astrocytes from NFB-dependent inflammatory damage in early events in NMOSD pathogenesis.

 The purpose of this study is to determine if the drug bortezomib contributes to reduce the average relapsing rates (ARRs) and alleviate neurological disability in NMOSD patients.
