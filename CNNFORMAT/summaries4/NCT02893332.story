(secondQuint)Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in Newly Diagnosed Advanced Staged Lung Adenocarcinoma (Sindas).

 This protocol is a randomized phase III trial of TKI versus consolidative Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) plus TKI for patients with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 Prior to accrual on the trial, patients with Stage IV NSCLC will be treated with positive EGFR mutation.

 Patients who with fewer than or equal to 5 sites of oligometastatic disease will be randomized toTKI or consolidative SBRT to all sites of disease (followed by TKI at the medical oncologist's discretion).

 Choices of TKI will be determined by the medical oncologist based on clinical appropriateness.

To tested if the adding of consolidative SBRT to TKI in EGFR mutated patients with less than or equal to 5 metastatic sites (primary + 5) will improve progression free survival (PFS) compared to TKI alone.
