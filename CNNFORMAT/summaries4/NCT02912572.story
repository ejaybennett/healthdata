(firstQuint)Study of Avelumab in Patients With MSS, MSI-H and POLE-mutated Recurrent or Persistent Endometrial Cancer.

 This research study is a Phase II clinical trial.

 Phase II clinical trials test the effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer.

 "Investigational" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of cancer.

 It also means that the FDA (the U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved the drug for use in patients, including people with Metastatic Endometrial Cancer.

 Avelumab is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing by enabling the activation of the immune system.

 Avelumab blocks an immune inhibiting signal that can impair the ability of the immune system to attack cancers.

 In this research study, the investigators are looking to see whether Avelumab is effective in treating recurrent and Metastatic Endometrial Cancer.

 Additionally, the investigators are looking to see if participants whose tumors contain a particular genetic make-up will have better response to Avelumab.
