(firstQuint)In Vivo EGFR-ECD Molecular Imaging Using [68Ga]- Labelling Anti-EGFR Affibody Molecule.

 The goals of investigators are to evaluate the use of [68Ga]-labelling Anti-EGFR Affibody Molecule as a novel PET/CT radiotracer to monitor EGFR-ECD expression status and classify EGFR-ECD benefit NSCLC patients.

 The investigators want to evaluated the use of [68Ga]-labelling Anti-EGFR Affibody Molecule in lung cancer imaging in adult NSCLC patients with different EGFR-ECD expression status of primary and metastatic cancers.
