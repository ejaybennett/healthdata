(fifthQuint)Low VW Activity in Adolescent HMB.

 One hundred and twenty five subjects will be enrolled.

 Adolescent females with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and low Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) will be recruited.

 Data collection will occur from participant's medical records in regards to their low VWF activity and HMB medical history.

 Participants will be asked to complete symptom questionnaires in regards to their HMB.

 A blood sample will be collected to analyze how many participants have the disease causing sequence variation in the VWF gene and other genes affecting bleeding, clotting and blood vessel biology and correlated with their bleeding history.

 The blood sample will be deidentified and stored indefinitely for future research.

 Low VW Activity in Adolescent HMB@highlight

This is a research study for patients diagnosed with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and low Von Willebrand Factor (VWF).

 Menstruation, also known as a period, is the regular discharge of blood and tissues from the uterus.

 HMB is having a heavier amount of discharge during menstrual period.

 Low Von Willebrand Factor means that the participant has lower level of a blood protein that is important for clotting of blood and so, the participant is at a higher risk for bleeding.

 The purpose of this project is to study the genetic differences of adolescent females with HMB and low VWF activity and compare the genetic differences with their bleeding manifestations, response to medications and outcome.
