(secondQuint)Cervical Cancer Radiotherapy by Use of VMAT, Individualized Polyradiosensitization and Interstitial Brachytherapy.

 Now cisplatin based concurrent chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer is a standard treatment modality.

 But we consider that the treatment results could be improved by several ways: 1.

 use of VMAT (volumetric arc therapy) based external beam radiotherapy could decrease toxicity by reducing of unnecessarily irradiated tissue volumes; 2.

 in addition to cisplatin gemcitabine could enhance tumor cell damaging effect of radiation; 3.

 interstitial brachytherapy could provide higher radiation dose boost to high risk tumor volume while sparing surrounding organs at risk.

 Cervical Cancer Radiotherapy by Use of VMAT, Individualized Polyradiosensitization and Interstitial Brachytherapy@highlight

The purpose of this study is to define an effectiveness of concurrent chemoradiotherapy of cervical cancer patients treated by VMAT (volumetric arc therapy) based external beam radiotherapy, polyradiosensitization by cisplatin and gemcitabine and interstitial brachytherapy.
