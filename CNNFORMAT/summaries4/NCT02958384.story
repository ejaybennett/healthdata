(firstQuint)A Clinical Research of LeY-Targeted CAR-T in Myeloid Malignancies.

 Lewis -Y(LeY) is a difucosylated carbohydrate antigen and although its function is not known, it is expressed on a wide range of malignancies including myeloid malignancies.

 LeY-targeted CAR-T in myeloid malignancies had been explored and showed good efficiency in the treatment of myeloid malignancies.

 This trial is designed and conducted to test the safety and effectiveness of LeY-targeted CAR-T.
