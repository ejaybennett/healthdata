(firstQuint)A Clinical Research of CD33-Targeted CAR-T in Myeloid Malignancies.

 Great progress has been made in the treatment of relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies with CD19-targeted CAR-T cells.

 However, for myeloid malignancies, which has higher morbidity, trials of CAR-T is few.

 CD33 is expressed on most myeloid leukemia cells so it is a ideal target for CAR-T.

 This trial is designed and conducted to test the safety and effectiveness of CD33-targeted CAR-T.
