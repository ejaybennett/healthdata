(fifthQuint)INTegrated Assessment of intERmediate Coronary Stenoses by Fractional Flow rEserve (FFR) and Near-infraREd Spectroscopy (NIRS).

 Background Objective of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the treatment of angiographically significant coronary stenoses in patients affected by stable or unstable coronary syndromes 1.

 When we face an intermediate stenosis (percentage diameter stenosis between 40% and 70%), revascularization is guided by the presence of inducible myocardial ischemia, detected by non - invasive stress tests or by assessment of fractional flow reserve (FFR).

 FFR is an index of the physiological significance of a coronary stenosis and is defined as the ratio of maximal blood flow in a stenotic artery to normal maximal flow.

 An FFR value of 0.

80 or less identifies ischemia-causing coronary stenoses with an accuracy of more than 90%.

 FFR is a very accurate tool to identify functionally significant stenoses and to predict cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and solid evidences demonstrate that PCI of lesions with FFR > 0.

80 can be safely deferred (incidence of MACE 0.

80) but can cause acute coronary events 6, 7.

 Since the prevalence of features of plaque instability (plaque volume > 70%, minimum luminal area 400 identifies a high lipid content in a given segment.

 In an autopsy study conducted on human aortic specimens, the technique reached 90% sensibility and 93 % specificity in the detection of lipid rich plaques9, opening new horizons in terms of risk stratification and therapy10-15.

 To provide a quantitative target suitable for algorithm construction and validation, a lipid core plaque of interest was defined as a fibroatheroma with a lipid core > 60 in circumferential extent, >200 mu m thick, with a fibrous cap having a mean thickness mu m16.

 Aim of the study - To compare lipid content expressed by LCBImax value between functionally significant (FFR 0.

80) stenoses in patients undergoing coronary angiography because of stable CAD and non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes.

 - To evaluate the correlation between functional significance (expressed by FFR value) and lipid content (expressed by LCBImax value) of coronary lesions in patients undergoing coronary angiography because of stable CAD and non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes.

 Design of the study This is an observational, prospective, multicentric study: at present time, two centers (Misericordia Hospital, Grosseto and San Giovanni Hospital, Rome) are going to take part in the study.

 Subjects undergoing coronary angiography for stable CAD and non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina will be enrolled.

 Patients included must have evidence of at least one angiographically borderline stenosis ( 40, 400 in lesions with FFR > 0.

80 vs lesions with FFR SD) in lesions with FFR > 0.

80 vs lesions with FFR 400) from 36% in FFR positive lesions to 18% in FFR negative lesions, as inferred by previous findings showing a 36% vs 18% prevalence of thin cap fibroatheroma in lesions with a >70% vs <70% diameter stenosis17.

 Using chi-square test for 2 x 2 tables and a 1-sided alpha value of 0.

05, a sample of 150 lesions will provide the study 80% power to meet the primary end point.

 INTegrated Assessment of intERmediate Coronary Stenoses by Fractional Flow rEserve (FFR) and Near-infraREd Spectroscopy (NIRS)@highlight

Revascularization of borderline coronary stenoses (40-70%) is usually driven by fractional flow reserve (FFR) which expresses the physiological significance of a lesion and tells the operator whether PCI may reduce the rate of adverse events as compared to medical therapy.

 Coronary stenoses with FFR value 0.

80 show an excellent prognosis which cannot be improved by coronary stenting.

 Such a predictive value of FFR is theoretically based only on the degree of myocardial ischemia downstream from a given coronary stenosis: however, also plaque composition may play a crucial role in triggering future events especially in patients affected by acute coronary syndrome.

 Differences in plaque composition between FFR-positive and FFR negative lesions have never been assessed.

 Intracoronary Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) identifies lipid rich plaques that can potentially cause acute events.

 The aim of this study is to compare the lipid content expressed by LCBI (Lipid Core Burden Index) between functionally significant (FFR 0.

80) stenoses in patients undergoing coronary angiography because of stable CAD and non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes.

 This is an observational, prospective, multicentric study where we plan to collect 150 coronary lesions.
