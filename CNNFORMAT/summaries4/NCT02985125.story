(firstQuint)LEE011 Plus Everolimus in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Refractory to Chemotherapy.

 This is a single arm, open label Phase I/II study to evaluate the progression free survival at 8 weeks (PFS8week) of the combination of LEE-011 plus everolimus, in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer refractory to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.

 Previous studies of third-line therapy in mPAC are limited but reveal stable disease in 25-31% of patients with no partial or complete responses (31% of patients in the GVAX/CRS-207 combination vaccine study had stable disease but only 52% of these patients were treated in the third-line setting).

 It is hoped that the combination of LEE-011 plus everolimus can increase the PFS8weeks to at least 50%, though early stopping rules are in place for lack of efficacy.
