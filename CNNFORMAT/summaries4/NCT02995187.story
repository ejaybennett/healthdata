(secondQuint)Study of Apatinib as Third-line and Later Therapy in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC).

 Although fist-line therapy with Cisplatin and etoposide(EP)or Carboplatin and etoposide(CE)and second-line therapy with topotecan has been given, patients with extensive small cell lung cancer(ED-SCLC) still relapse and 2-year survival is less than 10%.

 There is no standard treatment recommendation for this group of patients who failed to second-line therapy and had good performance status.

 Apatinib has been approved as a second-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer.

 Several phase III clinical studies of non small cell lung cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer and other tumors also showed apatinib has less toxic side effects and better patient tolerance.

 However, the clinical application of apatinib in small cell lung cancer is still lack of evidence-based medicine.

 And this clinical trial is designed to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in recurrent SCLC patients in our center.
