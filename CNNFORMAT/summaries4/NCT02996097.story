(secondQuint)Fractional Laser Assisted Steroid Therapy vs Intralesional Steroids in the Treatment of Keloids.

 Intralesional corticosteroids remain the gold standard treatment for keloids.

 However, more effective therapies are desperately desired.

 Ablative fractional laser (AFL) treatment facilitates delivery of intralesional steroid more deeply and uniformly into the skin by creating vertical channels.

 Recent studies have showed that fractional laser assisted steroid therapy can be effective in the treatment of keloids.

 However the studies are lacking in comparing this treatment modality to the gold standard of intralesional steroids.

The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of fractional carbon dioxide (CO2) laser therapy immediately followed by intralesional steroid therapy against intralesional steroid therapy alone for the treatment of keloids.
