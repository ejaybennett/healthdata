(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy of ATIR101 as Adjunctive Treatment to Blood Stem Cell Transplantation From a Haploidentical Family Donor Compared to Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide in Patients With Blood Cancer.

 Study CR-AIR-009 is a Phase III randomized controlled multicenter open-label study comparing two parallel groups.

 After signing informed consent, a total of 195 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either a T-cell depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; CD34 selection) from a related, haploidentical donor, followed by ATIR101 infusion, or a T-cell replete HSCT, followed by a high dose of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy).

 Randomization will use minimization to balance treatment groups with respect to underlying disease (AML, ALL, or MDS), Disease Risk Index (DRI; intermediate risk, high risk, or very high risk) and center.

 A stochastic treatment allocation procedure will be used so that the treatment assignment is random for all patients entered in the study.

 Patients randomized in the ATIR101 group will receive a single ATIR101 dose of 2*10E6 viable T-cells/kg between 28 and 32 days after the HSCT.

 Patients randomized in the PTCy group will receive cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day at 3 and 4/5 days after the HSCT.

 All patients will be followed up for 24 months post HSCT.

 Safety and Efficacy of ATIR101 as Adjunctive Treatment to Blood Stem Cell Transplantation From a Haploidentical Family Donor Compared to Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide in Patients With Blood Cancer@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to compare safety and efficacy of a haploidentical T-cell depleted HSCT and adjunctive treatment with ATIR101 versus a haploidentical T cell replete HSCT with post-transplant administration of high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in patients with a hematologic malignancy.

 An additional objective of the study is to compare the effect of the two treatments on quality of life.
