(thirdQuint)CT DOSE Collaboratory.

 The investigators are using a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial, collecting radiation dose information on CT from across all collaborating health care facilities, and leading several different interventions to optimize dose across facilities.

 In addition to collecting the CT radiation dose data, and using these results to provide feedback to the collaborating health care facilities, they will be conducting surveys of several individuals at each site, including key informants, such as lead radiologists, technologists, and medical physicist, and radiology administrators.

 They will compare and identify facilitators and barriers (assessed through surveys of participating facilities) associated with successful and failed implementation of dose optimization.

 CT DOSE Collaboratory@highlight

This is a pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial to explore variation in doses used for diagnostic CT by pooling radiation dose data across diverse healthcare delivery systems.

 To compare different strategies for lowering and optimizing dose and identify the barriers and facilitators to implementing successful dose optimization strategies and standardizing practice.
