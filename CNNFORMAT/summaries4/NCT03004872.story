(secondQuint)Relationship Between Postpartum Mood Disorders and Delivery Experience.

 It is theorized that poor pain control during labor and cesarean delivery, non-elective inductions, unplanned surgeries such as urgent/emergent cesarean delivery or operating room management of postpartum hemorrhage, and opioid abuse/addiction are risk factors for developing postpartum depression (PPD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after delivery.

 This study will, through questionnaires, interviews, and examination of the medical record, seek to identify whether and how strongly such correlations exist during the first year postpartum in patients who have no preexisting history of these conditions.
