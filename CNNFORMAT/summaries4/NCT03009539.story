(thirdQuint)eHealth Evidence-based Intervention (EBI) for Latino Youth in Primary Care.

 To test the effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care in preventing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STIs in a universal sample of Hispanic youth, a randomized trial design will be used with two levels of intervention (eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care and Treatment as Usual) as the between subjects factor with five repeated measures assessments at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline as the within subject factor.

 Participants will be recruited from four primary care clinics: two located within the University of Miami Health System, Jackson Memorial Medical Center (South Florida's only county health hospital), and a general community clinic in Miami (not affiliated with either the University of Miami Health System or Jackson Memorial Medical Center).

 The first site is an academic pediatric clinic within the University of Miami's Health District.

 This practice serves mostly insured individuals.

 The second pediatric site is a University of Miami mobile clinic that provides medical care at no charge to uninsured youth.

 The third pediatric clinic is a public health clinic located within Jackson Memorial Hospital, South Florida's only public health hospital.

 This clinic serves mostly underinsured or uninsured youth.

 The fourth site is a private pediatric care clinic.

 In total, these pediatric clinics jointly serve over 3,400 Hispanic between the ages of 12 -16 per year.

 A total of 456 Hispanic adolescents (between 12 to 16 years old) and their primary caregivers (expected age range 35-55) will be recruited.

 All adolescent participants will be of Hispanic ancestry, with both males and females represented.

 Women are likely to be over-represented among primary caregivers.

 AIM 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas delivered in a primary care setting (referred hereafter as eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care) in preventing/reducing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs; specifically gonorrhea and chlamydia).

 H1a: eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care will be effective, relative to Treatment as Usual, in reducing the frequency of (past 90-day) drug use in Hispanic adolescents over time H1b: eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care will be effective, relative to Treatment as Usual, in reducing the frequency of (past 90-day) unprotected sex in Hispanic adolescents over time H1c: eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care will be effective, relative to Treatment as Usual, in reducing STI incidence (specifically, the incidence of gonorrhea and chlamydia).

 AIM 2: Determine whether intervention effects are mediated by: 1) family functioning for drug use and unprotected sexual behavior and 2) family functioning and unprotected sexual behavior for STI incidence.

 H2a: Intervention effects on frequency of drug use will be partially mediated by improvements in family functioning over time H2b: Intervention effects on unprotected sex will be partially mediated by improvements in family functioning over time H2c: Intervention effects on STI incidence will be partially mediated by improvements in family functioning and decreases in unprotected sexual behavior over time.

 AIM 3: Estimate the cost effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care over a three year follow up.

 H3: eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care will be more cost effective than Treatment as Usual in reducing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STI incidence.

 As an exploratory aim, investigators will collect data on clinic level leadership and climate from the primary care clinic physicians and staff attitudes towards eHealth Familias Unidas from Primary Care facilitators.

 Specifically, investigators will explore whether clinic level leadership and climate will predict staff attitudes towards eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care which will predict changes in the proposed outcomes.

 eHealth Evidence-based Intervention (EBI) for Latino Youth in Primary Care@highlight

The purpose of this study is to test the relative effectiveness of a Hispanic-specific eHealth intervention, "e-Health Familias Unidas," in preventing and reducing drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and STIs among Hispanic youth in primary care.

 Families will be recruited through four pediatric primary care settings.

 Pediatric staff and research team members, including nurse assistants and mental health professionals, will implement eHealth Familias Unidas.
