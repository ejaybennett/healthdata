(secondQuint)PriMatrix for the Management of Diabetic Foot Ulcers.

 A diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a major health complication that affects up to 15% of individuals with diabetes mellitus over their lifetime.

 The treatment of DFUs is extremely challenging as these ulcers may not respond to standard of care (SC) treatment and frequently become infected.

 Advanced wound therapies like PriMatrix have become an important strategy in the treatment of hard-to-heal chronic DFUs by trapping and binding the patients' own cells to rebuild the dermis layer of the skin to aid in healing.

 The study will evaluate the efficacy of PriMatrix Dermal Repair Scaffold in the closure of DFUs in subjects with diabetes mellitus in comparison to Standard of Care treatment.
