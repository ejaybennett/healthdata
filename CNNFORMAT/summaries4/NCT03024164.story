(fifthQuint)Stroke Registration of Young Adults in China.

 Approximately 10%-14% of all ischemic strokes occur in young adults ages 18 to 45 years old.

 Stroke etiology in this population differs by geographic region and has greater heterogeneity than in older individuals.

 Ascertain the definite etiologic classification in this young patients might be the key point to prevent the stroke recurrence and reduce the stroke burden.

 Advances in stroke diagnostic tests, particularly neuroimaging, refinement in classification schema.

 In this multi-center registry study conducted in China, we determine to explore the difference of prognosis and stroke recurrence of young patients with different ischemic stroke subtypes.

 Stroke Registration of Young Adults in China@highlight

This is a multi-center, prospective,continuous registry study.

 The investigators will include 3000 young adult (18-45 years old) patients with confirmed first-ever acute ischemic stroke in China.

 The main purpose of this study is to build the study cohort of young ischemic stroke patients in China, and to compare the prognosis and stroke recurrence of young patients with different ischemic stroke subtypes.

 Secondary objectives are trying to find biomarkers of stroke recurrence.
