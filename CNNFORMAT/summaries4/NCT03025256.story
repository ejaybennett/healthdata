(fifthQuint)Study of Concurrent Intravenous and Intrathecal Nivolumab for Patients With Leptomeningeal Disease (LMD).

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you join this study.

 Up to 18 participants will be enrolled in Phase 1 of the study, and up to 12 participants will be enrolled in Phase 2.

 If you are enrolled in Phase 1, the dose level of IT nivolumab you receive will depend on when you join this study.

 The first group of 6 participants will receive the lowest dose level of IT nivolumab.

 Each new group will receive a higher dose of IT nivolumab than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.

 This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of IT nivolumab is found.

 If you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will receive IT nivolumab at the highest dose that was tolerated in Phase 1.

 All participants in both phases will receive the same dose level of IV nivolumab.

 Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 14 days.

 You will receive IT nivolumab as an injection directly into your CSF through your Ommaya reservoir on Day 1 of each cycle.

 The injection should take about 5 minutes.

 You will need to remain in the hospital for 24 hours so that you can be checked for side effects.

 Starting with Cycle 2, you will receive IV nivolumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 2 of every cycle.

 Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Your participation in this study will be over after the follow-up.

 Study Visits: On Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing, to test how well your blood clots, and to check your liver function.

 - Blood (about 4 1/2 tablespoons each time) will be drawn for immune system testing before your IT nivolumab dose and then 4 hours after your dose.

 - CSF will be collected for immune system testing before your IT nivolumab dose and then 2 more times over the next 24 hours after your dose.

 On Day 2 and 8 of Cycles 1-3 blood (about 4 1/2 tablespoons) and CSF will be collected for immune system testing.

 On Day 3 of Cycle 2, blood (about 4 1/2 tablespoons) and CSF will be collected for immune system testing.

 On Day 1 of Cycle 3: - You will have a physical, neurological, and neurocognitive exam.

 - Blood (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing and to check your liver function.

 - You will have an MRI to check the status of the disease.

 - Blood (about 4 1/2 tablespoons) and CSF will be collected for immune system testing.

 On Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 4 and beyond: Blood (about 4 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for immune system testing.

 On Day 1 of Cycle 5 and then every 4 cycles after that (Cycles 9, 13, 17, and so on): - You will have a physical, neurological, and neurocognitive exam.

 - Blood (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing, to see how well your blood clots, and to check your liver function.

 - You will have an MRI and either a CT or PET-CT scan to check the status of the disease.

 - If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 tablespoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.

 Treatment Beyond Progression: Sometimes the disease appears to get worse when the study drug is actually working.

 If the disease appears to be getting worse or the tumors appear to be getting larger, you may still be able to receive the study drug if you and your doctor decide it is in your best interest.

 However, there are risks of continuing to receive the study drug because the disease may actually be getting worse.

 You are still at risk for side effects due to the study drug.

 This could also delay starting other treatments.

 The disease may get worse to the point that you are no longer able to receive other treatments.

 If you choose to receive the study drug after the disease gets worse, you will continue to have study visits as described above.

The study doctor will discuss this option with you.

 End-of-Study Visit: Within 4 weeks after your last dose of study drug, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - CSF will be collected for immune system testing.

 Long-Term Follow-Up: Every 12 weeks after your last dose of study drug, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - CSF will be collected for immune system testing.

 - You will have an MRI and either a CT scan or PET-CT scan to check the status of the disease.

 Every 12 weeks, you will also be contacted by a member of the study staff to ask how you are doing and about any new anti-cancer therapy you may be receiving.

 This contact will take place at a regular clinic visit, or you may be contacted by phone, email, or mail.

 If you are contacted by phone, the call should last about 15 minutes.

 Study of Concurrent Intravenous and Intrathecal Nivolumab for Patients With Leptomeningeal Disease (LMD)@highlight

This clinical research study consists of 2 phases: dose escalation (Phase 1) and dose expansion (Phase 2).

 The goal of Phase 1 of this research study is to find the highest tolerable dose level of nivolumab that can be given both by intravenous (IV) infusion and intrathecal (IT) injection to patients with leptomeningeal disease (LMD).

 IV infusions are given by vein, while IT injections are given directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

 The goal of Phase 2 of this research study is to learn if the highest tolerable dose level combination found during Phase 1 can help to control the disease.

 The safety of the drug combination will also be studied in both phases.

 This is an investigational study.

 Nivolumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of several types of cancer.

 Its use in LMD is considered investigational.

 The method of injecting nivolumab into the CSF is investigational.

 The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

 Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
