(thirdQuint)The Effect of -hydroxy--methylbutyrate Supplementation on Physical Capacity and Body Composition in Trained Athletes.

 The effect of HMB supplementation is of great interest in sport.

 In view of the inconclusive character of the results of the studies conducted to date and of a relatively low number of studies investigating the effectiveness of HMB supplementation over a longer period on a large population of trained athletes, the aim of this study was to verify the effect of 12-week with HMB and a placebo supplementation on body composition, anaerobic and aerobic capacity, as well as concentrations of the selected biochemical blood markers in trained athletes, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.

The purpose of this study was to verify the effect of 12-week with -hydroxy--methylbutyrate (HMB) and a placebo (PLA) supplementation on body composition, anaerobic and aerobic capacity, as well as concentrations of the selected biochemical blood markers in trained athletes, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.
