(secondQuint)Dapagliflozin in Type 2 Diabetes or Pre-diabetes, and PRESERVED Ejection Fraction Heart Failure.

 A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of once-daily dapagliflozin 10 mg on heart failure disease-specific biomarkers (NTproBNP and BNP), symptoms, health status, and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes and chronic heart failure with preserved systolic function.

 An imaging substudy will also be conducted to explore the effects of dapagliflozin vs.

 placebo on various echocardiographic parameters.
