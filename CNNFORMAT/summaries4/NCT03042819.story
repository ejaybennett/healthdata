(fifthQuint)Study of Selinexor and Doxorubicin in Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcomas.

 This is a phase 1b study of investigational drug selinexor in combination with doxorubicin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.

 Patients will be screened for eligibility within 28 days of the start of the study drugs.

 In addition to standard tests and procedures, research tumor tissue (archival or fresh biopsy) will be collected for collection for pharmacodynamics.

 Participants will also be asked if they agree to optional biopsies at 6 cycles if their cancer is responding and at disease progression.

 Eligible participants will then receive the study drugs in 21 day cycles.

 Selinexor will be given by mouth and doxorubicin will be given by vein, once a week, for 6 cycles.

 Participants will be restaged every 2 cycles.

 If participants respond to treatment after 6 cycles, they may be able to continue the selinexor alone as a maintenance treatment until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 While receiving the study drug, many of the screening tests will be repeated.

 Additional tests and procedures include blood sample collection for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

 When participants stop the study drug permanently for any reason, an end of treatment visit, 28-day follow-up, and long term follow up every 90 days will occur.

 Study of Selinexor and Doxorubicin in Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcomas@highlight

This is a phase 1b study of investigational drug selinexor in combination with doxorubicin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.

 The purpose of this study is to determine how safe and tolerable the combination is, as well as the best dose of the study drugs in this patient population.

 Selinexor (also called KPT-330), works by trapping "tumor suppressor proteins" within the cell and thus causing the cancer cells to die or stop growing.
