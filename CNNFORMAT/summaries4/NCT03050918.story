(fifthQuint)Discharge Follow-up Phone Call Program.

 RATIONALE In the current medical literature, it is unclear how follow-up calls influence these outcomes in a general medical population.

 Some studies have attempted to address this question, but are limited in that they target very specific patient populations, are of insufficient quality, or evaluated follow-up calls as part of a larger care bundle.

 We will conduct a high quality, real-time clinical care study to determine the efficacy of a follow-up phone call program.

 STUDY DESIGN This is a single center, pragmatic, randomized, controlled clinical trial to investigate whether a structured post-hospital discharge follow-up phone call can improve patients' transition from in-hospital to outpatient care and improve satisfaction with their care.

 We will also identify the discharge implementation assistance given to those in the intervention (Phone Call) group.

 Outcome Measures Primary Outcome for this study is readmission event rate within 30 days.

 Secondary Outcomes include patient satisfaction which will be measured as mean Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) patient satisfaction scores, all cause VUMC emergency department (ED) visits, the need for assistance with discharge plan implementation, and 30 day mortality.

 Discharge Follow-up Phone Call Program@highlight

The goal of this project is to quantify the impact of post-hospital discharge follow-up phone calls on hospital readmission, ED visits, patient satisfaction, and mortality in a general medicine inpatient population.

 We will obtain exploratory information on patient sub-groups at high risk for hospital readmission and on those experiencing high benefit from the follow-up phone call intervention.

 In addition, we will obtain data on discharge plan implementation assistance needed to support a successful transition from inpatient to outpatient care among those reached by the intervention phone call.
