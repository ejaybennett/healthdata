(firstQuint)Comparison of Devices Evaluating Fractional Flow Reserve in Coronary Arteries.

 The decision to perform a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is usually based on angiographic results alone.

 Angiography can be used for the visual evaluation of the inner diameter of a vessel.

 Visual evaluation is limited by inter-individual variability.

 Fractional flow reserve provides a functional evaluation, by measuring the pressure decline caused by a vessel narrowing.

 The original studies validating the use of FFR were conducted with only one device (St-Jude Medical(R)).

 Recently, new FFR devices have been commercialized but have not yet been compared.

The aim of the study is to compare different devices available to measure fractional flow reserve (FFR) in coronary arteries.
