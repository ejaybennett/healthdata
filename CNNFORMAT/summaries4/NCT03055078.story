(firstQuint)Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Therapy in Aplastic Anemia.

 Aplastic anemia (AA) is a disorder thought to be caused by an immune-mediated bone marrow failure.

 Not all people with AA are eligible for today's standard treatments.

 One new treatment approach uses umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells-specialized cells capable of developing into other types of cells-to provide the basis for clinical application.

 The aim of the present study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of vein infusion of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells in patients with AA .
