(secondQuint)Validation of Rehab Assessments in Myositis Patients.

 This study evaluates the validity and reliability of two health related instruments that assess disease relevant functions and disabilities in patients with IM: the manual muscle testing 8 (MMT8) and the myositis activity profile (MAP).

 This study is needed to determine the psychometric properties of these two assessments.

 Provided that both the MMT8 and the MAP show good psychometric properties, these assessments could be used in the rehabilitation process and intervention programs of patients with IM to determine progress in muscle strength and activity in daily life.

 Methodology: Reliability (Test re-test study and validity (cross sectional study) of a short form of MMT 8 and a questionnaire to assess difficulties in activities of daily life (MAP) in myositis patients.
