(secondQuint)Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Treatment in Prostate Cancer With an Immunogenic Signature.

 This is a single arm phase II trial designed to assess the efficacy of nivolumab + ipilimumab in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer that have progressed following at least 1 line of therapy and have an specified immunogenic signature.

 The immunogenic signature is defined by the presence of at least one of the following: - Mismatch repair deficiency by IHC - Defective DNA repair detected by a targeted sequencing panel - High inflammatory infiltrate defined on multiplexed IHC criteria.

 Treatment consists of : - Nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every three weeks for a maximum of 4 doses - 6 week gap after last combination dose - 480 mg flat dose of nivolumab every 4 weeks for up to one year, or until progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.

 Patients must have ongoing androgen deprivation to maintain serum testosterone < 1.

The primary objective is to test the following hypothesis: Patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer that have progressed following at least one line of therapy and have an immunogenic signature will respond to combined PD-1 and CTLA4 inhibition.
