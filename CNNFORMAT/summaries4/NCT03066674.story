(thirdQuint)Effect of the Hands- on McKenzie Program on Low Back Pain.

 Thirty eight patients with sub-acute and chronic LBP will be randomly assigned to the McKenzie group (MG) or the control group (CG).

 The MG will perform exercises with the hands-on procedure (three sessions per week) for two weeks, while the CG will perform only exercises for two weeks.

 Both groups will do a home exercise program.

 The outcome assessments will measure pain by the Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NPRS), the level of disability through the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), spine mobility by range of motion (ROM) for the lumbar spine, and the centralization of symptoms and the postural alternation by postural analysis grid (PAG).

 By using SPSS version 20, a paired t-test will be use to study the effect of the McKenzie program before and after treatment.

 An independent t-test will be used to study the significance between the two groups.

 Effect of the Hands- on McKenzie Program on Low Back Pain@highlight

Low back pain (LBP) is one of most prevalent types of musculoskeletal pain and is strongly related to disability.

 The McKenzie method is one of most popular treatment options for LBP.

 The objectives of this study are to determine the effect of the hands-on McKenzie program on pain, disability, spine mobility, and posture deviations in subjects with derangement low back pain.
