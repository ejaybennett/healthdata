(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Relugolix in Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer.

 This study is an international phase 3 randomized, open-label, parallel group efficacy and safety study to evaluate oral daily relugolix 120 mg in patients with androgen-sensitive advanced prostate cancer who require at least 1 year (48 weeks) of continuous androgen deprivation therapy.

 Relugolix 120 mg orally once daily or leuprolide acetate depot suspension, 22.

5 mg (or 11.

25 mg in some Asian countries), every 3-months (3-M) by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection will be administered to patients with prostate cancer who require androgen deprivation therapy.

 Approximately 915 patients will be enrolled in this study.

 The study includes a Screening Period, a Treatment Period of 48 weeks, and a Follow-up Period.

 Additionally, unscheduled follow-up visit(s) may be arranged for patients with study-related safety concerns as needed.

 Eligible patients include those with evidence of biochemical relapse (rising PSA) following local primary intervention with curative intent, newly diagnosed metastatic disease (excluding metastases to the brain), and/or advanced localized disease.

 Following successful completion of the Screening period study participants will be randomized 2:1 to oral relugolix 120 mg once daily or leuprolide acetate 22.

5 mg (or 11.

25 mg in some Asian countries) 3-M depot subcutaneous or intramuscular injection and will attend visits monthly (ie, every 4 weeks) where serum testosterone and PSA will be assessed.

 Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and 12-lead electrocardiograms.

The purpose of this study is to determine the benefit and safety of relugolix 120 mg orally once daily for 48 weeks on maintaining serum testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<=50 ng/dL [1.

7 nmol/L] in patients with androgen-sensitive advanced prostate cancer.
