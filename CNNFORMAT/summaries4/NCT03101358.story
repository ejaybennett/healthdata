(thirdQuint)Study of Topical SOR007 Ointment for Cutaneous Metastases.

 This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-rising study evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of three concentrations of SOR007 (Uncoated Nanoparticle Paclitaxel) Ointment (0.

15%, 1.

0%, and 2.

0%) applied to non-melanoma cutaneous metastases.

 A treatment area of 50 cm2 will be selected by the Investigator.

 Using a gloved hand, subjects will apply one Finger Tip Unit (FTU) of SOR007 to the 50 cm2 treatment area twice daily at approximately the same time each day for 28 days.

 At each visit (Days 1, 8, 15, 29, and 43), at least two global and two close-up color photographs of the treatment area will be taken (with a ruler for scale).

 The photographs will be analyzed with ImageJ.

 Eligible lesions will be determined at baseline by the RECIST definition of measurable tumors ( 10mm in its longest diameter).

 The study will include a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.

 In the dose escalation phase, formal safety reviews will be conducted after the last subject in each cohort of three subjects completes 15 days of treatment.

 The next dose level will enroll upon a finding of safety and tolerability.

 The top dose or the maximum tolerated dose (if DLT occurs) will be taken into the dose expansion phase and additional subjects will be enrolled to reach a maximum of 12 subjects at that dose.

 Study of Topical SOR007 Ointment for Cutaneous Metastases@highlight

This study evaluates a topical nanoparticle paclitaxel ointment (SOR007) for the treatment of cutaneous metastases from non-melanoma cancer in adults.

 Three concentrations of SOR007 will be evaluated in dose-rising cohorts of three.

 An expanded cohort will treat additional subjects at the maximum tolerated dose.
