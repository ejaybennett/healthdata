(thirdQuint)The Use of Quantitative Pregnancy Test in Amniotic Fluid as a Diagnostic Tool for Rupture of Fetal Membranes.

 Beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin assay will be measured in the vaginal washing in two groups.

 The first group are pregnant women in the second or third trimester.

 These women have definite rupture of membranes diagnosed by visual leaking of the amniotic fluid from the cervix during speculum examination.

 The second group are pregnant women with intact membranes.

 Assessment of both the qualitative and quantitative beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin will be done.
