(thirdQuint)Randomized Trial of Sacrospinous Ligament Fixation Versus McCall Culdoplasty in Women Undergoing Vaginal Hysterectomy and Repairs for Prolapse.

 The aim of the study is to determine objective anatomical recurrent prolapse after SLF vs McCall.

 The study is designed as a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).

 Primary study endpoint will be at 12 months, secondary study endpoint at 24 months.

 The following parameters will be evaluated after one year: anatomical outcome, Quality of Life (QoL), sexual health, reoperations, and complications.

 Randomized Trial of Sacrospinous Ligament Fixation Versus McCall Culdoplasty in Women Undergoing Vaginal Hysterectomy and Repairs for Prolapse@highlight

To date no study has determined prospectively which technique is superior to prevent recurrent Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) after vaginal hysterectomy- a major unmet clinical need.

 The aim of the study is to determine objective anatomical recurrent prolapse after Sacrospinous Ligament Fixation (SLF) vs McCall.
