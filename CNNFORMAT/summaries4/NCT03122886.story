(secondQuint)Fat Emulsion in Preventing Hypersensitivity Reactions in Patients With Cancer Receiving Carboplatin or Oxaliplatin.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine if the infusion of a lipid emulsion before each dose of chemotherapy appears to prevent carboplatin and oxaliplatin hypersensitivity reactions in high-risk patients.

 II.

 To explore if lipid infusions modulate a well-established panel of mediators of hypersensitivity reactions and if these mediators appear to predict reactions.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

 GROUP I: Patients receive fat emulsion intravenously (IV) immediately before each dose of either carboplatin or oxaliplatin.

 Treatment continues for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 GROUP II: Patients receive placebo IV immediately before each dose of either carboplatin or oxaliplatin.

 Treatment continues for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Fat Emulsion in Preventing Hypersensitivity Reactions in Patients With Cancer Receiving Carboplatin or Oxaliplatin@highlight

This randomized pilot trial studies how well fat emulsion works in preventing hypersensitivity reactions in patients with cancer receiving carboplatin or oxaliplatin.

 Giving lipids before chemotherapy may prevent some drug reactions from carboplatin or oxaliplatin.
