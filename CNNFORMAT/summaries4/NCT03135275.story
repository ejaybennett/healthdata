(fifthQuint)MULTivessel Immediate Versus STAged RevaScularization in Acute Myocardial Infarction -The MULTISTARS AMI Trial.

 An investigator-initiated, randomized, multicenter, non-blinded study of consecutive patients presenting with STEMI and MVD in stable hemodynamic conditions, undergoing after successful PCI of the culprit lesion either (1:1 randomization) immediate revascularization during the index procedure of all additional target lesions or staged PCI of additional target lesions (within 19-45 days) using the Boston Scientific Synergy cent stent.

 The goal of this trial is to compare two treatment strategies that are currently performed in clinical practice: complete immediate revascularization versus staged revascularization in patients with STEMI with MVD, using in both groups the Synergy cent stent.

 Patients randomized to complete immediate revascularization will have treated during the index procedure, after the revascularization of the culprit lesion responsable for the STEMI, the other significant coronary stenosis.

 Patients randomized to staged revascularization will have treated during the index admission only the culprit lesion and they will be hospitalized again after 19-45 days to complete the revascularization on the other significant coronary lesions.

 For both groups lesion are defined significant when causing a 70% diameter stenosis by visual estimation in at least two projections, with current on line state of the art angiographic equipment of the participating centers.

The primary objective of the trial is to compare, in patients presenting with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and multi-vessel disease (MVD), the safety and efficacy of immediate complete primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of all target vessels versus culprit vessel only revascularization, followed by staged PCI (within minimal 19 and maximal 45 days) of all target vessels, in a non-inferiority trial, using a third generation biodegradable-polymer everolimus-eluting stent (Synergy cent ).
