(fifthQuint)PSA TOOL for Prostate Cancer Screening Discussions.

 Objectives: 1.

 To pilot test a decision making tool, the PSA TOOL, for prostate cancer screening for usefulness and ease of use in primary care practices.

 2.

 To revise the PSA TOOL based upon provider and patient feedback.

 3.

 To assess patient knowledge about the option to be screened for prostate cancer and factors to consider in the prostate cancer screening decision before and after use of the tool.

 Study Design: This protocol is for field testing of a brief tool to improve prostate cancer screening discussions that occur at previously scheduled primary care outpatient visits.

 PSA TOOL for Prostate Cancer Screening Discussions@highlight

The study team created a tool to help identify patients who may benefit from shared decision making in the primary care setting.

 This tool is a guide to aid in decision making for prostate cancer screening.

 The team proposes the topics to be discussed in the screening conversation include the risk for developing prostate cancer based upon age, race/ethnicity, family history of prostate cancer, history of previous digital rectal exam, and history of previous prostate specific antigen (PSA) as well as self-reported health status and preferences for treatment.

 The team now proposes 1) testing this tool first for ease of use in primary care clinics 2) revising this tool based upon feedback from patients and providers, then 3) testing this tool for effectiveness in improving patient knowledge that they have an option to be screened for prostate cancer and of specific factors to be considered in the screening decision.
