(thirdQuint)A Trial Using ctDNA Blood Tests to Detect Cancer Cells After Standard Treatment to Trigger Additional Treatment in Early Stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients.

 Patients will undergo blinded serial ctDNA screening every 3 months from the point of registration and completion of primary treatment for their triple negative breast cancer.

 If a ctDNA positive result occurs on or before their 12 month ctDNA screening assessment they will be randomised by the Institute of Cancer Research Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit (ICR-CTSU) in a 2:1 ratio to the pembrolizumab treatment arm or observation arm.

 The patient and their treating team will only be informed of the randomisation if they are allocated treatment.

 Patients without a positive ctDNA result within 12 months of starting ctDNA screening, will not be randomised but will continue to have blinded ctDNA screening every 3 months up to 2 years from starting ctDNA screening.

 All patients will be followed up every 6 months until recurrence, specific withdrawal of consent for follow up, or until sponsor advises no further follow up is required.

c-TRAK TN is a multi-centre phase II study, consisting of a circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) screening component and a therapeutic component.

 c-TRAK TN aims to assess whether ctDNA screening can be used to detect residual disease following patients standard primary treatment for triple negative breast cancer, and will assess the safety and activity of the investigational medicinal product pembrolizumab.
