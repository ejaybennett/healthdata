(thirdQuint)Prospective Clinical Study of PCV and PCV-VG in Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery.

 With the development of economy and changing of life style, obesity is becoming a common phenomenon.

 More and more obese patients are undergoing bariatric surgery every year.

 Obesity results in a series of physiological changes particularly the respiratory system.

 The decrease of lung compliance and the limited total lung capacity, vital capacity, functional residual capacity are all contributed to intraoperative hypoxemia and postoperative lung complications.

 Presently study mainly discuss lung protective ventilation strategies from four aspects: tidal volume,ventilation modes,positive end-expiratory pressures and lung recruitment maneuvers.

 This prospective study mainly compares two ventilation modes in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery:pressure-controlled ventilation(PCV) and pressure-controlled ventilation volume-guaranteed(PCV-VG).

 The total of 140 patients would be divided into two groups randomly.

 And the investigator will intendedly use PEEP of 5cmH2O in each group to open the collapsed alveoli in some degree.

 The investigator record the respiratory and hemodynamic parameters in six time points intraoperatively and compare the postoperative chest computerized tomography (CT) with the preoperative chest CT to identify postoperative lung complications.

 Prospective Clinical Study of PCV and PCV-VG in Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery@highlight

This study compares the two mechanical ventilation strategies in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery: pressure-controlled ventilation(PCV) and pressure-controlled ventilation volume-guaranteed(PCV-VG).

 This is a randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 140 patients whose body mass index(BMI) is over 30kg/m.
