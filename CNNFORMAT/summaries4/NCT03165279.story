(fifthQuint)ZEnith AlPHa for AneurYsm Repair.

 The ZEPHYR registry has two major objectives: 1.

 to prospectively collect 'real world' safety, durability and clinical performance data on the Zenith AlphaTM Abdominal Endovascular Graft in subjects with infrarenal abdominal aortic or aorto-iliac aneurysms.

 2.

 To increase the clinical evidence about the safety and effectiveness of the Zenith AlphaTM Abdominal Endovascular Graft by creating a database that can be pooled and/or compared with databases available on this and other stent graft systems.

 The ZEPHYR registry is a multi-center, post-market, non-randomized, single-arm prospective study.

 The study has no controls, as it is descriptive in nature.

 It will recruit approximately 450 subjects from high-volume sites across Germany and the BeNeLux.

 Study is open to consecutively enrolled subjects (20-50 per site) whou in the opinion of the investigator are candidates for endovascular AAA repair.

 The sites are recommended to schedule the subject's post-operative follow-up visits based on the current standard care in endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) therapy, which is generally at 1 month, 1 year and annually thereafter.
