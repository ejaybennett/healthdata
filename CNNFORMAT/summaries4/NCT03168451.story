(fifthQuint)American Indians STOp Smoking by Mobile Phone.

 This is a randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial examining the effectiveness of a text messaging-based smoking cessation program among American Indian (AI) smokers who call state quit lines, in states with high AI populations.

 Participants will be randomized to either receive culturally-tailored text-messages to support smoking cessation or quit line's treatment as usual.

 Participants will be recruited by Optum, the company who runs many state quit lines in the US.

 If - after answering some demographic questions for Optum from the following states: Alaska, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and New Mexico - a person is found to be a AI/AN and 18+ years old, that person will be asked if they would like to receive information about the study.

 If they answer yes the WSU research team will receive their contact information from Optum via a secure email, and WSU researchers will send a text explaining the study in more detail and a link to the e-consent form.

 Participants will also fill out 4 baseline questionnaires.

 After filling out baseline questionnaires, participants will be randomized to either the intervention group or the control group.

 Participants will be stratified into the intervention and control groups based on their age, gender, and Fagerstrom nicotine dependence score.

 Random permuted blocks will be used by on-campus research staff to manually assign participants to the two research groups.

 All participants will begin receiving text messages one week before their chosen quit date.

 American Indians STOp Smoking by Mobile Phone@highlight

In an attempt to reduce smoking-related health disparities, investigators will implement a text messaging-based smoking cessation intervention in collaboration with state quit lines.

 The approach is based on the successful STOMP (STOp smoking by Mobile Phone) program, a text messaging-based smoking cessation intervention among young Maori adults in New Zealand.

 Investigators will adapt the STOMP intervention, which will result in a new intervention known as AI STOMP (American Indians STOp smoking by Mobile Phone).

The primary aim of the study is to determine the effectiveness of the AI-STOMP intervention in smoking cessation among American Indians.
