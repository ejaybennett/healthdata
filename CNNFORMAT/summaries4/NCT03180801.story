(fifthQuint)Efficacy of FLU-v in an H1N1 Influenza Human Challenge Model.

 Influenza virus is a highly variable virus.

 Most of its variability comes from the proteins on its surface, NA and HA.

 Current vaccines use these highly immunogenic proteins to induce production of neutralising antibodies, however because these proteins change from strain to strain, the antibody response is only efficient against the strain present in the vaccine and if the circulating strain is different to that in the deployed vaccine, it will not be protective.

 FLU-v, a novel peptide vaccine, aims to provide a broad-spectrum response and for that it uses as antigens viral proteins that are conserved throughout the different strains.

 These proteins are not located on the surface of the influenza virus like NA and HA are, but internally.

 These antigens are not capable of producing neutralising antibodies but can induce cytotoxic T cell responses and non-neutralising antibodies.

 When cells are infected with influenza, these internal viral antigens are presented on the surface of infected cells.

 Vaccination with FLU-v generates a population of T cells and non-neutralising antibodies that can recognise these antigens on the surface of infected cells.

 On recognition, T cells are activated and secrete Th1 cytokines such as INF-gamma, TNF-alpha, and release granzyme and perforin.

 Non-neutralising antibodies will activate complement and/or induce cytotoxic responses led by Natural Killer cells (NK cells).

 These T cells and antibody actions will result in the destruction of infected cells.

 A series of pharmacology, safety and toxicology studies have been carried out in two animal species, the mouse and the rat.

 Pharmacology studies have demonstrated that FLU-v is able to generate both a cell mediated and humoral response in vaccinated animals and that the cell mediated response is enhanced when FLU-v is injected together with an adjuvant.

 A safety pharmacology study in rats demonstrated that FLU-v had no biologically relevant effects on cardiovascular or respiratory parameters when administered subcutaneously alone or in combination with the adjuvant.

 The current study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, will assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvanted FLU-v administered as 2 vaccinations or 1 vaccination vs placebo prior to intranasal challenge with the Influenza A 2009 H1N1 human virus.

 In this study, the main efficacy comparisons are for each of the FLU-v groups to placebo.

 The study will also compare the two FLU-v dosing arms but will only have power to detect a significant difference in Mild to Moderate Influenza Disease (MMID) rates between the FLU-v groups and placebo and not against each other.

 Efficacy of FLU-v in an H1N1 Influenza Human Challenge Model@highlight

FLU-v is a broad spectrum influenza vaccine that targets regions in the influenza virus that are conserved among many different influenza strains.

This study aims to assess efficacy of FLU-v vaccine in protecting healthy FLU-v vaccinated volunteers against an influenza challenge delivered intranasally under quarantine.

 Efficacy of FLU-v will be assessed by measuring the incidence and severity of the disease in the treatment groups compared to the placebo group.

 In addition, the immune responses of the volunteers to FLU-v will also be explored.
