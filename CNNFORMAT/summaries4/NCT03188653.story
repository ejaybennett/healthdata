(fifthQuint)Evaluating the Effects of Cleansers on the Skin.

 Up to 50 subjects (up to 25 with healthy skin or 25 with atopic dermatitis) meeting the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in this study.

 A physical exam will be performed to ensure the subjects have healthy skin versus atopic dermatitis.

 For atopic dermatitis subjects, AD severity will be graded by the EASI score.

 Site randomization will be performed to determine which cleansers will be used for each of the 8 test sites (one site will be randomized to act as a control and not receive any cleanser).

 Baseline skin barrier function (TEWL, pH and hydration) will be measured.

 Then 1ml of each cleansers will be applied to the corresponding test sites, 2ml of tap water will be added, and lathered in a circular motion for 15 seconds.

 The sites will then be rinsed off with tap water for 15 seconds.

 Arms will be padded dry.

 Barrier functions will be measured again immediately after padding dry, and at 30, 60 and 90 minutes after.

 Evaluating the Effects of Cleansers on the Skin@highlight

This will be a single visit study that will take approximately 2 hours.

 Up to 50 subjects (up to 25 healthy subjects, and up to 25 subjects with AD) from BUMC dermatology clinics will be enrolled in this study and randomized to receive the 7 cleansers on 7 test spots on their upper extremities.

 One spot will serve as a control and not receive any cleanser.

 Each spot will be cleansed with the corresponding cleanser for 15 seconds then rinsed off with tap water.

 Skin barrier will be measured at baseline, immediately after, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after rinse off.
