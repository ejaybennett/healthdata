(thirdQuint)Radiofrequency Identification Technology in Locating Non-palpable Breast Lesions in Patients Undergoing Surgery.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the feasibility of utilizing a new Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared radiofrequency tag for localization of non-palpable breast lesions and provide preliminary data for a larger study.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo mammogram or ultrasound for image-guided placement of the radiofrequency tag within 30 days of surgery and then undergo radiofrequency-guided localization during surgery.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up within 2 weeks.

This pilot clinical trial studies radiofrequency technology in locating non-palpable breast lesions in patients undergoing surgery.

 Placing a miniature radiofrequency tag or microchip in the breast lesion before surgery and using a handheld device to guide doctors during surgery may improve surgical outcomes in patients with non-palpable breast lesions.
