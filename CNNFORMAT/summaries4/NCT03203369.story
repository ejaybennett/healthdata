(thirdQuint)Study to Evaluate the Safety and Clinical Activity of UCART123 in Patients With BPDCN.

 This is a Phase I, first-in-human, open-label, dose-finding study of UCART123 administered intravenously to patients with BPDCN.

 he study will consist of two phases, a dose-escalation phase in relapsed or refractory BPDCN patients and a dose-expansion phase in relapsed/refractory and newly diagnosed BPDCN patients and relapsed/refractory BPDCN patients.

 The safest dose of UCART123 used at the dose level where activity is observed will be used in the dose-expansion phase.

 The study's primary assessment is the the safety and tolerability of UCART123 administered to patients with BPDCN, and to determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of UCART123.
