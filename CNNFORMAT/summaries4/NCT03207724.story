(fifthQuint)Study of Onivyde and 5-FU in Combination With Xilonix for Pancreatic Cancer With Cachexia.

 Main inclusion criterion are a diagnosis of advanced pancreatic cancer, did not respond to an earlier treatment, and the patient has had unexplained weight loss in the last 6 months (cachexia).

 This study will prospectively evaluate advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients.

 The intervention will be interleukin-1-alpha antagonist (Xilonix) in addition to standard chemotherapy.

 The first aim is to assess the safety and identify the maximum tolerated dose of Onivyde with 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid in combination with the study agent, Xilonix.

 The study will also create a repository of serum, tissue, and fecal specimens to investigate novel biomarkers related to cachexia with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and interleukin-1-alpha blockade.

 Lastly, the study will assess for a correlation between cachexia, activity, and PROs on domains of quality of life.

 Study of Onivyde and 5-FU in Combination With Xilonix for Pancreatic Cancer With Cachexia@highlight

This study is being conducted to examine the safety of the investigational drug, Xilonix( cent ), in addition to standard doses of Onivyde(R) (nanoliposomal irinotecan) and 5- fluorouracil (5FU)/folinic acid (leucovorin) for pancreatic cancer patients with cachexia.

 Cachexia is a syndrome that includes involuntary weight loss and physical deterioration that can contribute to poor outcomes of cancer treatment.

 In other studies, Xilonix has increased lean body mass in advanced cancer patients.

 This increase could lead to improved weight maintenance and quality of life.
