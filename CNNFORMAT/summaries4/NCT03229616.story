(secondQuint)BUCY+VP-16 vs BUCY Conditioning Regimen for DLBCL Undergoing Auto-HSCT.

 Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Auto-HSCT) is an effective therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

BuCY conditioning regimen is a conventional scheme for DLBCL patients undergoing auto-HSCT, but it has a high relapse rate.

 Etoposide (VP-16) is extensively used in chemotherapy regimen for refractory/relapsed lymphoma.

 Whether addition of VP-16 could reduce the relapse rate remains unclear.

In this study, the safety and efficacy of BUCY+VP-16 and BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in DLBCL undergoing auto-HSCT are evaluated.
