(fifthQuint)Randomized Study on Effects of Uniportal VATS Versus Triportal VATS.

 Randomized cohort clinical trial, prospectic, monocentric.

 Procedure of randomization: the day before the operation, with the "Random Allocation Rule" technique Arm 1: pulmonary lobectomy and lymphoadenectomy with uni-portal VATS approach Arm 2: pulmonary lobectomy and lymphoadenectomy with three-portal VATS approach Misurations Total analgesic consumption, normalized to morphine milligrams, recorded in the 7 days following the operation.

 The choice of cumulative analgesic consumption as parameter of primary outcome is because pain valuation with VAS is significantly affected by individual variability.

 Secondary outcomes: measure of postoperative pain with NRS at 2,6,12,24 hours and at 2,3,4,5,30 days from sugery.

 A pain score will be assigned to each patient after the total amount of NRS.

 Respiratory function will be valuated with spirometry after 7 and 30 days from surgery, and compared with pre-operative tests.

 All intraoperative parameters will be compared between the two groups: operative time (skin to skin), proportion of conversions to open surgery, number of resected lymphnodes, amount of bleeding.

 Postoperative complications will be analyzed: rate of prolonged air leaks, surgical site infections, cardiac rythhm disfunctions, pulmonary complications, post-thoracotomy syndrome, as well as lenght of stay at the hospital.

 Randomized Study on Effects of Uniportal VATS Versus Triportal VATS@highlight

For the treatment of stage I-II NSCLC, two mini-invasive techniques are mostly utilized: uni-portal and three-portal VATS.

 In the uniportal approach, the injury on a single intercostal space could determine a lower level of pain than the three-portal approach, allowing a better postoperative course.

 Few studies in Literature compare these techniques, and most of them are retrospective.

 The main purpose of this randomized study is to compare uni-portal VATS with three-portal VATS, in terms of postoperative pain.

 Secondary objectives of the study are valutations of: - respiratory and functional capacity between the two groups - operative time - number of resected lymphnodes - intra and postoperative complications, such as conversions to open surgery, amount of bleeding, prolonged air leaks, surgical site infections, pulmonary complications.
