(fifthQuint)Clinical Study Comparing PillCam Crohn's Capsule Endoscopy to Ileocolonoscopy (IC) Plus MRE for Detection of Active CD in the Small Bowel and Colon in Subjects With Known CD and Mucosal Disease.

 This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study, evaluating the efficacy of CE versus IC plus MRE for detecting active Crohn's Disease (CD) in the small bowel and colon in subjects with known CD and mucosal disease.

 A screening visit will be performed within 30 days prior to baseline procedures to assess pre-procedure eligibility.

 At this visit the following assessments will be performed: Informed Consent, Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria, Demographics, Montreal Classification, Medical History, Previous GI procedures, Surgical history, Laboratory tests and pregnancy tests.

 At baseline, subjects with known CD on routine evaluation (e.

g.

 history, physical exams, labs) and a recent history of mucosal disease (within the last 2 years and diagnosis based on radiologic, endoscopic, or histologic findings) will undergo Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE), Capsule Endoscopy (CE) and Ileocolonoscopy (IC), to assess presence or absence of CD across the small and large bowel.

 Also, at baseline the following assessments will take place: Laboratory tests, Pregnancy test, Concomitant medications, Patient satisfaction questionnaire, Quality of life questionnaire and Adverse Events.

 Subjects who do not have active CD, as assessed by all three modalities, will be discontinued from the study.

 Subjects with confirmed active CD will then be randomized into two groups a) CE and b) IC plus MRE or IC alone (comparator group).

 In the comparator group, subjects with small bowel disease (proximal and/or ileal) and/or colonic disease with clinical indication (per investigator discretion) will undergo IC plus MRE.

 For subjects with no small bowel, MRE at 6 and 12 months is at the discretion of the physician.

 At 6 and 12 month follow up appointments, subjects will return for follow up visits.

 At 3 and 9 month follow up appointments will be conducted over the phone.

 At 6 and 12 month follow up appointments, subjects will undergo a second round of procedure/s with either CE or IC with or without MRE.

 The following assessments will also take place at the 6 and 12 month follow up appointments: Laboratory tests, Pregnancy test, Concomitant medications, Patient satisfaction questionnaire, Adverse events.

 In addition at the 12 month follow up visit the Quality of Life Questionnaire will be completed as well.

 At 3 and 9 month follow up phone calls the information to be collected are as follows: Concomitant medications and Adverse Events.

 All CE and IC videos and MRE images will be evaluated by central readers.

 A 1:1 randomization will be employed to minimize bias relative to the comparison of the two study arms.

 In addition, CE and IC videos and MRE images will be randomly distributed among the central readers.

 The planned number of subjects is 352.

 Subjects will be enrolled at up to 40 sites in the United States, Israel, and Europe (Austria, Italy, Portugal, France, Germany).

 Study duration is expected to be up to approximately 3 years.

 Subjects will be followed for a period of 12 months in order to effectively evaluate changes to the disease state.

 The expected duration of each subject's participation is approximately 13 months.

 Clinical Study Comparing PillCam Crohn's Capsule Endoscopy to Ileocolonoscopy (IC) Plus MRE for Detection of Active CD in the Small Bowel and Colon in Subjects With Known CD and Mucosal Disease@highlight

This study will evaluate the efficacy of capsule endoscopy (CE) versus ileocolonoscopy (IC) plus MRE for detection of active Crohn's disease (CD) in the small bowel in subjects with known CD and mucosal disease.

 The primary objective of the study is to assess the accuracy of CE versus IC plus MRE for detecting active CD, by visualizing the small bowel and colon in subjects with known CD and mucosal disease.

 There will be assessment of mucosal disease activity at baseline and 6- and 12- month follow ups.

 Patient satisfaction questionnaires will be completed at baseline, 6- and 12- month follow ups along with a Quality of Life questionnaire at 12 month follow up.

 Concomitant medication and adverse events information will be collected baseline and 3-, 6-, 9- and 12 month follow ups.
