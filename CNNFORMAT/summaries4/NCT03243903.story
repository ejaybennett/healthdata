(thirdQuint)Comparison of Safety and Efficacy of QS-M Needle- Free Injector and Insulin Pen in Controlling T2DM Patient's Glucose.

 The research purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of QS-M needle-free injector as a drug carrier in the control of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by non-inferiority study,using needle-insulin pen as the comparison.

 This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open and parallel grouping study.

 QS-M needle-free injector produced by Beijing QS medical technology co.

, Ltd.

is used as the insulin carrier in the experimental group.

 While needle-insulin pen is used as the insulin carrier in the control group.

 In this study, we investigated whether the changes of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) at the 16th week in the experimental group respected to the baseline is non-inferiority compared with that in control group.

 A total of 420 cases were included in this study.

 The experimental group and the control group were assigned by 1:1 ratio.

 The duration of each participant was designed for the screening period: 0-2 weeks; treatment adjustment period: 4 weeks; treatment observation period: 12 weeks.

 Therefore, the expected duration of each participant is 18 weeks.

 All patients were unable to change the type of insulin and the number of injections during the study period.

 In this study, the treatment regimen was adjusted according to the results of the determination of prescription blood glucose.

 According to clinical experience, the adjustment of blood glucose fluctuations in the possibility of a larger, so the study of the adjustment phase follow-up frequency is greater than the treatment period.

 Explanation of Visits and Timing of Assessments: Baseline assessment was performed for all subjects during the screening period.

 On the first day of treatment, the first week after treatment ( 2 days), the second week ( 2 days), the 4th week ( 5 days), the 6th week ( 5 days), the 8th week ( 5 days),the 12th week ( 5 days), the 16th week ( 5 days) for visit.

The 3th week ( 2 days), the 5th week ( 5 days), the 7th week ( 5 days), the 10th week ( 5 days), the 14th week ( 5 days), for telephone interviews.
