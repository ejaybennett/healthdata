(thirdQuint)Fusion Protein rHSA/GCSFclinical Study on Breast Cancer Patients.

 This experiment adopts the method of multicenter, open, dose escalation study injection with recombinant human blood clean protein/granulocyte stimulating factor fusion protein after single and multiple doses of tolerance, security, and pharmacokinetic characteristics.

 Breast cancer patients with reduced white blood cells after chemotherapy were selected as subjects of this study.

 The three research doses that were to be incremented were 1.

8 mg, 2.

1mg and 2.

4mg respectively, each of which was studied by single and multiple doses.
