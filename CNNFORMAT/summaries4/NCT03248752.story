(fifthQuint)Monitoring Physical Activity (Fitbit).

 Background: Physical activity is associated with management and/or prevention of over 25 chronic health conditions; however the majority of adults in North America are not active enough to experience these benefits.

 Behavioral strategies have been shown to be effective for increasing physical activity, and wearable fitness monitors such as Fitbits include components of several behavioral strategies including goal setting and feedback.

 While this technology provides a platform for implementing self-regulation techniques important for behavior change, direct supervision is still the most effective strategy for behavior change.

 Supervised exercise programs and personal trainers may not be accessible or affordable for people; this study will examine whether proxy supervision by a family member or doctor are more effective in changing behavior compared to self-regulation alone.

 Target Population: Sedentary adults aged 45-64 years old who have received an exercise prescription (to increase physical activity) from their doctor, living in Victoria, British-Columbia, Canada.

 Sample Size: 80 participants, 20 per group.

 Intervention: Participants will be randomized to 4 groups: 1 - Physician monitored, 2 - Family monitored, 3 - Self monitored, and 4 - Control.

 Participants from all groups will perform aerobic testing at baseline and 3 months, complete an online questionnaire at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months, and wear an accelerometer for 1 week at baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months.

 Participants in Group 1,2,and 3 will receive a Fitbit activity tracker and wear it for 3 months.

 Weekly Fitbit reports are automatically sent to the individual participants in all groups.

 Group 1 participant Fitbit reports will also be sent to their Physician.

 Group 2 participant Fitbit reports will also be sent to their partner/spouse.

 Group 3 participants will have sole access to their weekly Fitbit results.

 Group 4 is the control group and will not receive a Fitbit.

 Monitoring Physical Activity (Fitbit)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of monitoring and sharing physical activity outcomes (using Fitbit technology) on physical activity participation in those who have received an exercise prescription from their physician.

 Primary research question: Does shared physical activity outcomes from wearable technology with a participant's physician improve overall physical activity over 3 months compared to shared outcomes with a family member, unshared outcomes (normal wearable technology condition), and a control group (no wearable technology condition) following an exercise prescription from one's physician? Physical activity will be measured as minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week.

 Hypothesis: Knowledge that physical activity outcomes will be shared with a participant's physician will serve as a proxy-supervision intervention and improve physical activity adherence in comparison to all other groups.

 Self- and partner shared outcomes conditions will be more effective than the control group.
