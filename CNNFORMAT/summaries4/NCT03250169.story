(firstQuint)Neurofilaments for NEDA Assessing in MS.

 Primary 1.

 To evaluate the achievement of NEDA using blood and CSF neurofilaments in Alemtuzumab treated patients.

 Secondary 2.

 To assess prognosis at the end of the study based on neurofilament status.

 3.

 To correlate neurofilament levels with clinical and MRI markers of disease activity.

 4.

 To evaluate the effect of Alemtuzumab on the profile of other CSF, blood, urine, faeces biomarkers of inflammation, neurodegeneration, neuronal sprouting and synaptogenesis, treatment activity and metabolic activity.

 Neurofilaments for NEDA Assessing in MS@highlight

Goal is to evaluate the achievement of biological NEDA as demonstrated by a drop in neurofilament levels in MS patients commencing Alemtuzumab therapy as part of their MS management.
