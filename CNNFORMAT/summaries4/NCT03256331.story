(thirdQuint)Evaluate the Safety of BEL-X-HG in Advanced Cancer Patients.

 This study will be carried out in 2 parts: Part 1: A sequential Dose Escalation Part of four doses following a 3 + 3 design where dose escalation will be made based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), for a single cycle (28-days) of BEL-X-HG treatment Part 2: A Dose Extension Part of up to 5 cycles (28-days each) at the same dose level (starting dose) of BEL-X-HG treatment Up to 48 eligible subjects with confirmed advanced refractory solid tumors will be enrolled sequentially, in 3-patient cohorts, from the lower to the higher dose cohort into the study.

 Escalating dose levels of BEL-X-HG in 4 study cohorts will be as follows: Cohort 1: Dose level 1 - 0.

5 g/day (0.

25 g, bid) Cohort 2: Dose level 2 - 1.

0 g/day (0.

5 g, bid) Cohort 3: Dose level 3 - 2.

0 g/day (1.

0 g, bid) Cohort 4: Dose level 4 - 4.

0 g/day (2.

0 g, bid) BEL-X-HG will be administered orally at the assigned dose level for one cycle during the Dose Escalation Part to each subject.

 Thereafter, if eligible and willing, subjects can continue to Extension Part at the same assigned dose level of BEL-X-HG treatment.

 Evaluate the Safety of BEL-X-HG in Advanced Cancer Patients@highlight

This is a Phase I, open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter dose escalation and extension study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate safety / tolerability and preliminary effects of BEL-X-HG in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors.

 Dose escalation during the study will be made based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).
