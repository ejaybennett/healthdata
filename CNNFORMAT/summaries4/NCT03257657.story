(fifthQuint)Helping Moms to be Healthy After Baby.

 Low-income and minority women are at increased risk for postpartum weight retention (i.

e.

 retaining weight after pregnancy) and consequent persistent obesity.

 Women who are obese pre-pregnancy are 3-5 times more likely to gain weight, rather than lose weight, in the postpartum period than non-obese women.

 Obesity science supports that weight loss interventions should be multi-component with regular points of contact.

 Building upon this, we have designed a multi-component intervention that considers the demands on women in the postpartum period and utilizes technology for both provider decision support and for virtual contact with participants.

 The intervention will address diet, physical activity, and social support through the use of in-person meetings with WIC staff, text messaging, phone coaching, self-monitoring, and Facebook.

 Women who are obese pre-pregnancy are 3-5 times more likely to gain weight, rather than lose weight, in the postpartum period than non-obese women.

 Aims for this pilot study are listed below: Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component novel weight loss intervention delivered in a WIC setting to a population of low-income, predominantly racial/ethnic minority, obese, postpartum women.

 Aim 2: To evaluate differences in weight change, diet, physical activity, self-efficacy, readiness to change, motivations to eat between intervention and control participants to determine preliminary intervention efficacy over a 12-week period.
