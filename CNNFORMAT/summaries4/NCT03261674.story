(firstQuint)Non-Pharmacological Treatments for Insomnia in Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury.

 Insomnia is a serious health problem in Veterans suffering from chronic Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and often associated with extensive prescription of sleeping medications.

 Although safer, even the latest "sleeping pills" can lead to daytime impairment and risk of abuse.

 Thus non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia have been pursued as alternatives to medications.

 This trial will compare the relative efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) and Desensitization Therapy for Insomnia (DTI).
