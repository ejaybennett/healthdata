(thirdQuint)Evaluation of the Antibiofilmogramme Test During Orthopaedic Device-Related Infection.

 The secondary objectives are: A.

 Investigate the role of antibiogram-antibiofilmogramme concordance (in terms of S.

 aureus strains and prescribed antibiotics) in orthopaedic device-related infection management.

 B.

 Investigate the capacity of S.

 aureus isolates to form biofilm in presence/absence of antibiotics.

 C.

 Create an S.

 aureus strain collection for future ancillary studies.

 Evaluation of the Antibiofilmogramme Test During Orthopaedic Device-Related Infection@highlight

This is an observational study that does not change routine care.

 The primary objective of this study is to investigate the correlation between the administration of an antibiotherapy able to prevent biofilm formation according to the results of the Antibiofilmogramme test, and the relapse of the infection for patient with orthopaedic device-related infection.
