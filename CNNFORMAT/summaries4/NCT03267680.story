(fifthQuint)IRX-2 Regimen in Treating Women With Cervical Squamous Intraepithelial Neoplasia 3 or Squamous Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia 3.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To compare the proportion of subjects who achieve a pathologic complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in regimen 1 versus regimen 2 at week 25, based on the resected surgical specimen.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the toxicity and feasibility of administration of IRX-2 in subjects with confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) 3.

 II.

 To evaluate multiple parameters to assess the activity of the IRX-2 regimen for the treatment of CIN 3 or VIN 3: the occurrence of clinical CRs or PRs at weeks 6, 13 and 25.

 III.

 To evaluate multiple parameters to assess the activity of the IRX-2 regimen for the treatment of CIN 3 or VIN 3: frequency of elimination of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical or vulvar tissue using a commercial HPV genotyping assay and viral load determination by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

 IV.

 To evaluate multiple parameters to assess the activity of the IRX-2 regimen for the treatment of CIN 3 or VIN 3: analysis of the immune infiltrates in the resected surgical specimens.

 V.

 To evaluate multiple parameters to assess the activity of the IRX-2 regimen for the treatment of CIN 3 or VIN 3: immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes.

 VI.

 To evaluate multiple parameters to assess the activity of the IRX-2 regimen for the treatment of CIN 3 or VIN 3: frequency of serum antibodies to HPV E6, E7 and L1 proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

 VII.

 To evaluate multiple parameters to assess the activity of the IRX-2 regimen for the treatment of CIN 3 or VIN 3: ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression profiling of immune-inflammatory markers from post-treatment resected surgical specimens.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on day 1 and IRX-2 via submucosal injections in the cervix or subcutaneously (SC) for vulvar lesions on days 4-7.

 Patients also receive indomethacin orally (PO) three times daily (TID), zinc-containing multivitamins (PO) once daily (QD) and omeprazole orally (PO) on days 1-21.

 Arm II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on day 1 and placebo via submucosal injections in the cervix or SC for vulvar lesions on days 4-7.

 Patients also receive indomethacin PO TID, zinc-containing multivitamins PO QD and omeprazole PO on days 1-21.

 In both arms, treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Beginning week 25, patients undergo surgical resection.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1-8 weeks after surgery.

 IRX-2 Regimen in Treating Women With Cervical Squamous Intraepithelial Neoplasia 3 or Squamous Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia 3@highlight

This randomized phase II trial studies how well an IRX-2 Regimen works in treating women with cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 3 or squamous vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia 3.

 The IRX-2 Regimen consists of a single dose of cyclophosphamide, followed by 21 days of indomethacin, zinc-containing multivitamins, and omeprazole.

 IRX-2, a human cell-derived biologic with multiple active cytokine components, may act as an immune booster to stimulate the immune system.

 Giving cyclophosphamide and IRX-2 may work better at treating cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia or squamous vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.
