(secondQuint)The Use of Cyanoacrylate on Palatal Wound.

 A total of 35 patients were included in the study.

 In the test group (19 patient), cyanoacrylate was placed over the palatal wounds; conversely, the 16 control group patients were allowed to heal in a conventional way without cyanoacrylate.

 Primary bleeding time, presence of secondary bleeding, postoperative pain and completion of epithelization were assessed following free gingival graft operation.

 As a result, compared to the control group it was determined that the cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive could reduce the postoperative morbidity and improve the wound healing.
