(thirdQuint)Pharmacists Intervention to Improve Hypertension Management in Primary Care.

 Patients with medically treated arterial hypertension, who attend a pharmacy in order to obtain their antihypertensive medication are invited to participate in the trial.

 The main inclusion criteria is uncontrolled hypertension, as determined by an automated office blood pressure measurement at a threshold of 135/85 mmHg.

 Main exclusion criteria include a first-ever prescription of an antihypertensive agent, resistant hypertension, systolic blood pressure 180 mmHg and dialysis.

 Randomization occurs on the level of pharmacies (cluster randomization).

 Patients in the interventional arm are immediately referred to their treating physician for up-titration of antihypertensive therapy.

 Re-examination of automated automated office blood-pressure occurs in the respective pharmacy, and patients are referred to their treating physician again if required.

 These measures are accompanied by a structured and educational blood pressure record card.

 Patients in the observational arm undergo periodic automated office blood pressure measurements and are referred to their treating physician at the end of the trial in case of persistently uncontrolled blood pressure.

Arterial hypertension is the single largest contributor to mortality world-wide, and only 30-50% of diagnosed and treated patients achieve their blood pressure goal.

 The APOTHECARE trial is designed to identify treated patients with uncontrolled hypertension in community pharmacies in order to improve blood pressure control through intensification of antihypertensive therapy.
