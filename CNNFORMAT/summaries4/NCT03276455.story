(secondQuint)Gene Therapy for Beta-Thalassemia Major Using Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Genetically Modified.

 Beta-thalassemia major is a life-threatening genetic disease of red cell malfunction.

 It is caused by mutations in the beta-globin gene which encodes the beta-globin protein, leading to the ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis and anemia.

 Transplantation of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCT) is the only available cure which is, however, has the significant risk of transplant related mortality, graft versus host disease and limited source.

 Therefore, transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells will be an attractive therapeutic treatment for beta-thalassemia major patients.

 10 patients will be treated with genetically modified autologous hematopoietic stem cells which transduced with lentiviral vector encoding for beta-globin gene.

 Patients will participate for this study for 3 years.

This is a single group, open label study in 10 subjects who are 8 years of age or older with beta-thalassemia major.

 The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transduced with lentiviral vector for the treatment of beta-thalassemia major.
