(firstQuint)Flexible Band vs Rigid Ring for Degenerative Mitral Valve Disease.

 Currently, mitral ring selection is based on a surgeon's preference rather than evidence.

 Semirigid rings combine flexibility and stability; however, their clinical benefit has not been completely clarified.

 The present study aimed to compare the outcomes of mitral valve repair with a flexible posterior annuloplasty band versus complete semirigid ring in patients with degenerative mitral valve disease.
