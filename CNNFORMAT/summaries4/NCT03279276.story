(secondQuint)Selecting the Right Hip Prosthesis for Young Patients.

 The overall purpose of this study is to show whether the Primoris(R) hip prosthesis results in a smaller loss of bone density than standard hip prosthesis, which in the longer term may result in an improved survival of prosthesis No.

 2 after revision / replacement of a Primoris(R) hip prosthesis.

 The primary outcome is periprosthetic bone quality in Primoris(R) hip prosthesis compared to standard hip prosthesis measured by DXA scanning.

 The secondary outcomes are to assess: 1.

 The hip function measured by gait analysis.

 2.

 Hip strength at pressure gauge.

 3.

 Prosthetic migration / migration measured by radio-stereometric analysis (RSA).

 4.

 Patient satisfaction measured by PROMs.

 Selecting the Right Hip Prosthesis for Young Patients@highlight

There have been no previously published clinical randomized studies comparing Primoris(R), short stem, hip prosthesis with standard uncemented hip arthroplasty in relation to bone density and function development.

 This is the subject for this study.
